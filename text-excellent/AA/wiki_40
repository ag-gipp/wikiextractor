Rinaldo (opera)

Rinaldo (<a href="H%C3%A4ndel-Werke-Verzeichnis">HWV</a> 7) is an opera by <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>, composed in 1711, and was the first <a href="Italian%20opera">Italian language opera</a> written specifically for the London stage. The <a href="libretto">libretto</a> was prepared by <a href="Giacomo%20Rossi">Giacomo Rossi</a> from a scenario provided by <a href="Aaron%20Hill%20%28writer%29">Aaron Hill</a>, and the work was first performed at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">the Queen's Theatre</a> in London's <a href="Haymarket%20%28London%29">Haymarket</a> on 24 February 1711. The story of love, war and redemption, set at the time of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a>, is loosely based on <a href="Torquato%20Tasso">Torquato Tasso</a>'s epic poem "<a href="Jerusalem%20Delivered">Gerusalemme liberata</a>" ("Jerusalem Delivered"), and its staging involved many original and vivid effects. It was a great success with the public, despite negative reactions from literary critics hostile to the contemporary trend towards Italian entertainment in English theatres.

Handel composed "Rinaldo" quickly, borrowing and adapting music from operas and other works that he had composed during a long stay in Italy in the years 1706–10, during which he established a considerable reputation. In the years following the premiere, he made numerous amendments to the score. "Rinaldo" is regarded by critics as one of Handel's greatest operas. Of its individual numbers, the soprano aria "<a href="Lascia%20ch%27io%20pianga">Lascia ch'io pianga</a>" has become a particular favourite, and is a popular concert piece.

Handel went on to dominate opera in England for several decades. "Rinaldo" was revived in London regularly up to 1717, and in a revised version in 1731; of all Handel's operas, "Rinaldo" was the most frequently performed during his lifetime. After 1731, however, the opera was not staged for more than 200 years. Renewed interest in <a href="baroque%20opera">baroque opera</a> during the 20th century led to the first modern professional production in Handel's birthplace, <a href="Halle%2C%20Saxony-Anhalt">Halle</a>, Germany, in 1954. The opera was mounted sporadically over the following thirty years; after a successful run at New York's <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> in 1984, performances and recordings of the work have become more frequent worldwide. "Rinaldo" was the first Handel Opera to have found its way to the Metropolitan. The opera's <a href="tercentenary">tercentenary</a> in 2011 brought a modernized production at the <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival</a>.

Handel began to compose operas in <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, where he spent the years 1703–06; his principal influences were <a href="Johann%20Mattheson">Johann Mattheson</a> and <a href="Reinhard%20Keiser">Reinhard Keiser</a>. At that time, German opera as a genre was still not clearly defined; in Hamburg the term "<a href="Singspiel">Singspiel</a>" ("song-play") rather than opera described music dramas that combined elements of French and Italian opera, often with passages of spoken German dialogue. The music was, in the words of historian <a href="Donald%20Jay%20Grout">Donald Jay Grout</a>, "tinged with the serious, heavy formality of Lutheran Germany". The first of Handel's early works in the German style was "<a href="Almira">Almira</a>", a considerable success when it was premiered on 8 January 1705. Over the next three years Handel composed three more operas in the German style, but all of these are now lost. However, fragments of the music from these works have been identified in later operas.

In autumn 1706 Handel went to Italy. He stayed for long periods in <a href="Florence">Florence</a>, <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, <a href="Naples">Naples</a> and <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, making frequent visits to the opera houses and concert halls. He obtained introductions to leading musicians, among them <a href="Arcangelo%20Corelli">Arcangelo Corelli</a>, <a href="Alessandro%20Scarlatti">Alessandro</a> and <a href="Domenico%20Scarlatti">Domenico Scarlatti</a>, and <a href="Agostino%20Steffani">Agostino Steffani</a>, and met numerous singers and performers. From these acquaintances Handel learned the essential characteristics of Italian music, in particular (according to Dean and <a href="J.%20Merrill%20Knapp">Knapp</a>) "fluency in the treatment of Italian verse, accurate declamation and flexible harmonic rhythm in recitative, ... drawing the necessary distinction between vocal and instrumental material and, above all, the release of [his] wonderful melodic gift". Handel's first Italian opera, "<a href="Rodrigo">Rodrigo</a>", showed an incomplete grasp of Italian style, with much of Keiser's Hamburg influence still evident; it was not a success when premiered in Florence, in late November or early December 1707. He followed this by a lengthy visit to Rome, where opera performances were then forbidden by papal decree, and honed his skills through the composition of <a href="cantata">cantata</a>s and <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>s. In Rome, Handel met Cardinal <a href="Vincenzo%20Grimani">Vincenzo Grimani</a>, a diplomat and spare-time librettist; the result of this meeting was a collaboration which produced Handel's second Italian opera, "<a href="Agrippina%20%28opera%29">Agrippina</a>". After this work's triumphant premiere at the <a href="Teatro%20San%20Giovanni%20Grisostomo">Teatro San Giovanni Grisostomo</a> in Venice, on 26 December 1709, Handel became, says biographer <a href="Paul%20Henry%20Lang">P. H. Lang</a>, "world famous and the idol of a spoiled and knowledgeable audience".

This sudden recognition led to eager competition for Handel's services. Among those most keen to employ him was <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">Prince Georg Ludwig</a>, the <a href="Electorate%20of%20Brunswick-L%C3%BCneburg">Elector of Hanover</a> and future King George I of Great Britain. In June 1710 Handel accepted the appointment of <a href="Kapellmeister">Kapellmeister</a> to Georg's Hanover court, under terms that gave him considerable scope to pursue his own interests. On the basis of this freedom, in late 1710 Handel left Hanover for London, possibly in response to an earlier invitation from members of the English nobility. By 1711, informed London audiences had become familiar with the nature of Italian opera through the numerous <a href="pastiche">pastiche</a>s and adaptations that had been staged. The former <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> Principal, <a href="Curtis%20Price">Curtis Price</a>, writes that the popularity of these pieces was the result of a deliberate strategy aimed at the suppression of English opera. Handel's music was relatively unknown in England, though his reputation from "Agrippina" was considerable elsewhere. A short "Italian Dialogue" he had written in honour of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>'s birthday was well received when performed at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Palace">St James's Palace</a> on 6 February 1711.

In London, by means which are not documented, Handel secured a commission to write an Italian opera for <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">the Queen's Theatre</a> in the <a href="Haymarket%20%28London%29">Haymarket</a> (it became the "King's Theatre" after King George I's accession in 1714). This theatre, designed and built by Sir <a href="John%20Vanbrugh">John Vanbrugh</a>, had become London's main opera house; its manager, Aaron Hill, intended to mount the first Italian opera written specifically for London and had engaged an all-Italian company for the 1710–11 opera season. Hill employed an Italian poet and language teacher, Giacomo Rossi, to write a libretto based on a scenario that Hill prepared himself. As his subject Hill chose "Gerusalemme liberata", an epic of the <a href="First%20Crusade">First Crusade</a> by the 16th-century Italian poet <a href="Torquato%20Tasso">Torquato Tasso</a>; the opera was called "Rinaldo", after its main protagonist. Hill was determined to exploit to the full the opportunities for lavish spectacle afforded by the theatre's machinery; his aim, according to Dean and Knapp, was "to combine the virtuosity of Italian singing with the extravagance of the 17th century masque".


The Crusader army under Goffredo is laying siege to Jerusalem, where the Saracen king Argante is confined with his troops. With Goffredo are his brother Eustazio, his daughter Almirena, and the knight Rinaldo. As Goffredo sings of the coming victory, Rinaldo declares his love for Almirena, and Goffredo confirms that she will be Rinaldo's bride when Jerusalem falls. Almirena urges Rinaldo to fight boldly and assure victory. As she departs, a herald announces the approach of Argante from the city. Eustazio surmises that the king fears defeat; this seems to be confirmed when Argante, after a grandiose entrance, requests a three-day truce to which Goffredo graciously assents. After Goffredo leaves, Argante ponders his love for Armida, the Queen of Damascus who is also a powerful sorceress, and considers the help her powers might bring him. As he muses, Armida arrives from the sky in a fiery chariot. She has divined that the Saracens' only chance of victory lies in vanquishing Rinaldo, and has the power, she claims, to achieve this.

The scene changes to a garden, with fountains and birds, where Rinaldo and Almirena are celebrating their love. They are interrupted as Armida appears, and wrests Almirena from Rinaldo's embrace. Rinaldo draws his sword to defend his lover, but a black cloud descends to envelop Armida and Almirena, and they are borne away. Rinaldo mourns the loss of his loved one. When Goffredo and Eustazio arrive they comfort Rinaldo, and propose they visit a Christian magician who may have the power to save Almirena. Rinaldo, left alone, prays for strength.

A sea shore. As Goffredo, Eustazio and Rinaldo near the magician's lair, a beautiful woman calls from her boat, promising Rinaldo that she can take him to Almirena. Two mermaids sing of love's delights, and urge Rinaldo to go in the boat. He hesitates, unsure what to do, and his companions attempt to restrain him. Angry at the abduction of his loved one, Rinaldo enters the boat, which immediately sails off. Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's impulsiveness and believe that he has deserted their cause.

In Armida's palace garden, Almirena mourns her captivity. Argante joins her and, overcome by her beauty, confesses that he now loves her. He promises that as proof of his feelings he will defy Armida's wrath and secure Almirena's freedom. Meanwhile, Rinaldo is brought before the triumphant Armida. As he demands that Almirena be set free, Armida finds herself drawn to his noble spirit, and declares her love. When he angrily rejects her she uses her powers to assume Almirena's form, but Rinaldo suspects trickery, and departs. Armida, resuming her own appearance, is furious at her rejection yet retains feelings of tender love. She decides on another attempt to ensnare Rinaldo, and transforms herself back into Almirena's shape, but then encounters Argante. Believing her to be Almirena, Argante repeats his earlier promises of love and freedom. Swiftly resuming her own form, Armida denounces his infidelity and vows vengeance. Argante defiantly confirms his love for Almirena and declares that he no longer needs Armida's help. She departs in a fury.

A mountainside, at the magician's cavern. Goffredo and Eustazio are told by the Magician that Almirena is being held captive in Armida's palace at the mountain-top. Ignoring the magician's warning that they will need special powers, the pair set off for the palace but are quickly driven back by Armida's monsters. The magician then gives them magic wands that transcend Armida's power, and they set off again. This time they overcome the monsters, but as they reach the gates of the palace it disappears, leaving them clinging to a rock in the midst of a stormy sea. They climb the rock and descend out of sight.

In the palace garden Armida prepares to kill Almirena. Rinaldo draws his sword, but Armida is protected from his wrath by spirits. Suddenly Goffredo and Eustazio arrive, but as they touch the garden with their wands it disappears, leaving them all on an empty plain with the city of Jerusalem visible in the distance. Armida, after a last attempt to kill Almirena, also disappears as Rinaldo strikes her with his sword. The remaining four celebrate their reunion, while Goffredo announces that the attack on Jerusalem will begin the next day.

In the city, Argante and Armida, in danger from a common enemy, become reconciled and prepare their troops for battle. Goffredo's army advances, and battle finally commences. After a struggle for supremacy, Jerusalem falls to Goffredo; Argante is overcome and captured by Rinaldo, while Armida is taken by Eustazio. Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which is the source of her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus of reconciliation.

The opera was frequently revised, most particularly in 1717 and in 1731; modern performances are usually a conflation of the versions available. Up to and including 1717, these changes had no significant effect on the plot. In the 1731 version, however, in Act 2 Armida imitates Almirena's voice rather than assuming her appearance, and Argante declares his love to Almirena's portrait rather than to her face. In Act 3 the marches and the battle scene are cut; Armida and Argante remain unrepentant and vanish in a chariot drawn by dragons before the conclusion.

In a letter dedicating the new opera to Queen Anne, Hill wrote of his choice of story: "I could not chuse a finer Subject than the celebrated story of Rinaldo and Armida". He had, however, exercised "a Poet's Privilege", to render Tasso's work suitable for the stage. This "privilege" moved the opera's story a long way from Tasso's original. Hill invented a new heroine, Almirena, to provide the main love interest with the hero Rinaldo, and the relationship between Rinaldo and Armida scarcely figures in the opera. Likewise, the affair between Argante and Armida is Hill's creation, as are the conversions to Christianity, the latter possibly a <a href="wikt%3Asop">sop</a> to English susceptibilities. Rossi was required to turn the elaborate scenario into verses, a relatively light task which, he said, was "the delivery of a few evenings". Nevertheless, Rossi complained that Handel hardly gave him time to write: "To my great wonder I saw an entire Opera set to music by that surprising genius, with the greatest degree of perfection, in two weeks". Price argues that Rossi's role was beyond that of a mere versifier, quoting Hill's words of praise for Rossi in the preface to the libretto, which suggest that Rossi was the senior partner in the birth of the libretto. Price also points to the likely influences on the structure of "Rinaldo" from two British <a href="semi-opera">semi-opera</a>s—<a href="George%20Granville%2C%201st%20Baron%20Lansdowne">George Granville</a>'s "The British Enchanters", and <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>'s "<a href="King%20Arthur%20%28opera%29">King Arthur</a>". The transformations of characters to others' shapes, Price contends, is likely derived from <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>'s play "<a href="Amphitryon%20%28Dryden%29">Amphitryon</a>".

Handel's speed of composition was assisted by his inclusion of arias and other numbers from his earlier Italian works, among them "Bel piacere" and "Basta che sol" from "Agrippina", "Sibillar gli angui" from the dramatic cantata "<a href="Aci%2C%20Galatea%20e%20Polifemo">Aci, Galatea e Polifemo</a>", and the mermaids' song "Il vostro maggio" from the cantata "Arresta il passo". Almirena's aria "Lascia ch'io pianga" had appeared in the oratorio "<a href="The%20Triumph%20of%20Time%20and%20Truth">Il trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno</a>". The suitability of some of these insertions has been questioned by later commentators; Dean and Knapp cite Argante's "Sibillar gli angui", with its references to the hissing snakes of <a href="Alecto">Alecto</a> and the howls of <a href="Scylla">Scylla</a>, as "ludicrously inappropriate" to accompany the king's grand Act 1 entrance. Many other numbers—Dean and Knapp estimate two-thirds of the arias—were adapted and partly recomposed from earlier sources.

In the years between the 1711 premiere and the 1717 revival, Handel made various adjustments to the score and the vocal parts, often to accommodate the requirements of new singers. Details of these changes are difficult to establish since the performing librettos and scores for these years no longer exist. For 1717, more significant revisions were made; the role of Eustazio was merged with that of Goffredo, and Argante's part was rewritten to accommodate an alto voice. Thus in this revival all the principal parts were sung in high voice ranges. Handel's revisions for the 1731 revival were even more radical, since they not only affected individual musical numbers but involved alterations in the plot. The production was advertised "With New Scenes and Cloathes", but many of the changes involved reducing or eliminating the pyrotechnics and special effects that had characterised the original production. The only significant new music in the 1731 production is a long accompanied recitative for Rinaldo, though other numbers are changed or cut. Goffredo becomes a tenor, Armida a contralto, the Herald and the Magician become basses. Dean and Knapp summarise the 1731 revisions as "a striking illustration of the seeming vandalism with which Handel could treat his works in revival".

The 19th-century music critic <a href="George%20Hogarth">George Hogarth</a> wrote of "Rinaldo" that "[t]he romantic interest of the subject, the charms of the music, and the splendour of the spectacle, made it an object of general attraction".
Its premiere at the Queen's Theatre on 24 February 1711, possibly under Handel's direction, was a triumphant success. A further 12 performances were immediately scheduled; at the end of the run, popular demand was such that two more were added. Notwithstanding this enthusiasm, the financial strains of such a grand production led to legal actions against Hill from unpaid craftsmen. Nine days after the premiere the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain's Office</a> revoked the impresario's licence. Under Hill's successors the opera was played at the theatre in most seasons until 1716–17, by which time it had totalled 47 performances, far more than any other opera at the Queen's.

The public's general enthusiasm for the opera was not shared by the writers <a href="Joseph%20Addison">Joseph Addison</a> and <a href="Richard%20Steele">Richard Steele</a>, who used the pages of their new journal, "<a href="The%20Spectator%20%281711%29">The Spectator</a>", to pour scorn and ridicule on the work. Addison may have been motivated by his own failure, a few years previously, to establish a school of English opera with "Rosamund", on which he had collaborated with the composer Thomas Clayton. It was absurd, he wrote, that theatre audiences should be exposed to entire evenings of entertainment in a foreign tongue: "We no longer understand the language of our own stage". Addison did, however, praise the singing of <a href="Nicolo%20Grimaldi">Nicolo Grimaldi</a>, the celebrated alto castrato known as "Nicolini", in the title role. Steele compared the production unfavourably to a <a href="Punch%20and%20Judy">Punch and Judy</a> show, particularly criticising certain bungled scene changes and the poor quality of effects such as thunder and lightning. Hogarth made light of such comments: "Notwithstanding the influence which the "Spectator" influenced over the taste and manners of the age, its attacks ... seem to have had little effect in turning people from the entertainment".

Some sources have suggested that the opera was performed in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> in March or April 1711, though according to Dean and Knapp there is no record of such an occasion. In November 1715 a version mainly in German was performed in Hamburg. This production, based on a translation by the playwright Barthold Feind, proved to be very popular and was revived in the city on numerous occasions during the 1720s. A pastiche of the opera, with additional numbers by <a href="Leonardo%20Leo">Leonardo Leo</a>, was presented by Leo at the Royal Court in <a href="Naples">Naples</a> in 1718, with Nicolini singing his original role.

After 1716–17, "Rinaldo" was not seen on the London stage until 1731, when it was revived in its revised form at the King's Theatre. During these years Handel's industry was such that he was producing a new opera for this theatre every nine months. The 1731 production of "Rinaldo" received six performances, bringing the London total for the work to 53 in Handel's lifetime, the most for any of his operas. After 1731 Handel had fewer stage successes, and performances of his operas became rarer. Changes in taste and style combined, as Grout concludes, to "thrust [the operas] into ill-deserved oblivion", as a result of which "Rinaldo" was not staged anywhere for two hundred years.

The first 20th-century production of "Rinaldo" which can be specifically verified was a performance in London, in February 1933, by pupils of the Hammersmith Day Continuation School, though Dean and Knapp mention a shortened version, in Czech, at the <a href="Prague%20Conservatory">Prague Conservatory</a> in 1923. The first modern professional performance was at the <a href="Halle%20Opera%20House">Halle Opera House</a> in June 1954, under <a href="Horst-Tanu%20Margraf">Horst-Tanu Margraf</a>, as part of the <a href="Handel%20Festival%2C%20Halle">Handel Festival</a>. On 17 May 1961 the Handel Opera Society, directed by <a href="Charles%20Farncombe">Charles Farncombe</a>, staged the work at London's <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells Theatre</a>, a production that was revived four years later. The first American performance was a concert version at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> on 27 March 1972, given by the <a href="Handel%20Society%20of%20New%20York">Handel Society of New York</a>, with Stephen Simon conducting and <a href="Beverly%20Wolff">Beverly Wolff</a> as Rinaldo. The first staging of the opera in America was at the <a href="Houston%20Grand%20Opera">Houston Grand Opera</a> under <a href="Lawrence%20Foster">Lawrence Foster</a>, in October 1975, with <a href="Marilyn%20Horne">Marilyn Horne</a> in the title role, a part with which she would become particularly associated.

In July 1982 Horne sang the part alongside <a href="John%20Alexander%20%28tenor%29">John Alexander</a>'s Goffredo and <a href="Samuel%20Ramey">Samuel Ramey</a>'s Argante, in a <a href="National%20Arts%20Centre">National Arts Centre</a> (NAC) production in Ottawa directed by <a href="Frank%20Corsaro">Frank Corsaro</a>. The performance, with <a href="Mario%20Bernardi">Mario Bernardi</a> conducting the <a href="National%20Arts%20Centre%20Orchestra">NAC Orchestra</a>, was applauded by "<a href="Montreal%20Gazette">Montreal Gazette</a>" critic <a href="Eric%20McLean">Eric McLean</a> for its fine music making and its displays of "architectural and sartorial splendour". Eighteen months later, on 19 January 1984 Bernardi and Corsaro, with Horne, Ramey and <a href="Benita%20Valente">Benita Valente</a> from the Ottawa cast, brought the production to New York for the work's debut at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>. The production was loaned to the Met for its centennial season by the National Arts Centre of Canada "in deep appreciation of the many years during which Canadians have enjoyed opera from the Met – on tour, on radio and in New York". <a href="Donal%20Henahan">Donal Henahan</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" praised all the singers in turn, with a special mention for Valente's "plaintive and affecting" rendering of the popular aria "Lascia ch'io pianga". But, says Henahan, "the loudest cheers of the night went at last to the choreographer, Eugene Collins, and an incredibly nimble corps of tumbling warriors". After ten performances at the Metropolitan Opera House the production was taken in May to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and toured in the US before returning to New York in June for several outdoors performances.

From the mid-1980s onwards, performances of "Rinaldo" became more frequent worldwide. In June 1989 it was staged at <a href="La%20Fenice">La Fenice</a> in Venice, under <a href="John%20Fisher%20%28opera%20director%29">John Fisher</a>, again with Marilyn Horne. This production was criticised by critic and music scholar <a href="Stanley%20Sadie">Stanley Sadie</a>, in his review of the live recording, for straying too far from the composer's original intentions, particularly in the rearrangement of material and the extent of cuts. Singers were, Sadie says, allowed too much freedom to ornament their vocal lines; some of the <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a>s were "preposterous".
The opera reached Australia in 1999, at the <a href="Sydney%20Opera%20House">Sydney Opera House</a> under Patrick Summers, and was performed there again in July–August 2005 under <a href="Trevor%20Pinnock">Trevor Pinnock</a>, with <a href="Michael%20Chance">Michael Chance</a> as Rinaldo. The new century saw a number of performances across Europe, including an appearance at the <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen%20International%20Handel%20Festival">Göttingen International Handel Festival</a> in 2004, with <a href="Nicholas%20McGegan">Nicholas McGegan</a> conducting <a href="Concerto%20K%C3%B6ln">Concerto Köln</a>. This production was well received by the public, but was criticised by <a href="Jochen%20Breiholz">Jochen Breiholz</a> of "<a href="Opera%20News">Opera News</a>" for poor staging, indifferent singing and a substandard performance from the orchestra.

<a href="Zurich%20Opera">Zurich Opera</a>'s 2008 production, directed by <a href="Jens-Daniel%20Herzog">Jens-Daniel Herzog</a> and conducted by <a href="William%20Christie%20%28musician%29">William Christie</a>, threw aside all convention by representing the action in a 21st-century airport lounge and conference centre, with Rinaldo dressed in a double-breasted navy blazer and needing a drink. "Characters go up and down on-stage escalators, and the set spins to show various areas of the lounge and terminal. There is a dissection of a small, white furry animal, a large snake, some allusions to Bond girls and character transformations. The Christians pull guns on the Muslims at a signing ceremony". It was, wrote <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> critic Ronald Blum, "outrageous – and entertaining". A concert version of "Rinaldo" was given at the 2009 <a href="Edinburgh%20Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a>, by the <a href="Bach%20Collegium%20Japan">Bach Collegium Japan</a> conducted by <a href="Masaaki%20Suzuki">Masaaki Suzuki</a>, with the Japanese soprano Maki Mori as Almirena.

During the opera's <a href="tercentenary">tercentenary</a> year in 2011, the <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival</a> mounted a new production directed by <a href="Robert%20Carsen">Robert Carsen</a>, designed by Gideon Davey, and conducted by <a href="Ottavio%20Dantone">Ottavio Dantone</a> with the <a href="Orchestra%20of%20the%20Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment</a> in the pit. The production is set in a school where Rinaldo is a student, initially the victim of bullying, who enters into the world of the Crusades. The Glyndebourne Festival Opera brought a semi-staged version of this production to the 2011 <a href="The%20Proms">Proms</a>.

The amount of recycled music in "Rinaldo" is such that Dean and Knapp call it an "anthology" of the best works from Handel's Italian period. Sadie raises the question of whether the opera's <a href="dramaturgy">dramaturgy</a> is affected by the small amount of music written for its particular situations. He also comments on the problems raised for scholars by the extensive revisions to the music that took place during Handel's lifetime, but suggests that the available admixture creates interesting opportunities in the preparation of modern performing versions. The initial popular success of "Rinaldo" was assisted by the employment of virtuoso singers, in particular Nicolini in the title role. This part has remained in its original pitch, though in his various revisions Handel transposed the music of other leading roles to different voice types. Thus Goffredo had originally been an alto part, but in the 1717 revisions became a tenor; the Magician was transposed from alto castrato to bass, and Armida from soprano to contralto.

The music, Lang says, flows "beguilingly" from the spacious overture; the quieter, emotional passages are illustrated evocatively, while in the more spectacular moments Handel's innovative use of brass is exciting and inspiring. The sudden blast of trumpets which announces the Act 3 March provides, say Dean and Knapp, "an effect of splendour and exhilaration that time has not dimmed". The <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a> solos which decorate "Vo' far guerra" in Act 2 were originally improvised on the keyboard by Handel during performances, and were extremely popular. They were remembered and written down by <a href="William%20Babell">William Babell</a>, and published later as separate pieces. Lang believes that in spite of the borrowings, and the hasty manner in which the work was put together, "Rinaldo" is one of Handel's great operas. According to Dean and Knapp, no Italian opera heard in London to that point had been supported by such "majestic" orchestral forces. Critic <a href="Anthony%20Hicks">Anthony Hicks</a> describes the music, overall, as both "varied and excellent". Dean and Knapp's verdict is more equivocal. The music for the war and pageantry scenes, they say, is "brilliantly successful", but in depicting the scenes concerned with magic, Handel misses the mark; they suggest it was not until over 15 years later, with "<a href="Admeto">Admeto</a>" and "<a href="Orlando%20%28opera%29">Orlando</a>", that he was able to represent the supernatural convincingly in music.

The opera begins in the <a href="Key%20%28music%29">key</a> of F, and switches to G at the inception of the grove scene in Act 1. Act 2 starts in E minor and ends in G. The final act begins and ends in B minor. According to Hicks the dominant character musically, except in Act 3 in which she barely sings, is Armida. Her entry <a href="cavatina">cavatina</a> "Furie terribili" gives, says Hicks, "an immediate impression of fiery passion", an energy and intensity demonstrated in her Act 2 "Ah crudel", and in her later vengeance aria which is the occasion of Handel's harpsichord cadenzas. Armida's Act 3 duet with Argante was the last duet with bass part that Handel wrote for 30 years. Of the other set pieces, Dean and Knapp highlight Rinaldo's "Cara sposa" as an example of Handel's growing confidence with aria forms. "Or la tromba" is praised for the brilliance of its orchestration: 4 trumpets, drums, strings & oboes—the only aria Handel ever wrote for this combination. The melody for Almirena's "Lascia ch'io pianga" began its life as an Asian dance in "Almira" before appearing as an aria in the oratorio "Il trionfo". From this simple tune and plain accompaniment Handel achieves an "intensely moving effect" in this, the best-known of all the arias.

The main musical numbers from the 1711 libretto are listed, together with changes and replacements from the two major revisions of 1717 and 1731. Minor changes, transpositions, and alterations to recitative sections are not shown. New numbers introduced in 1717 and 1731 are listed separately. Other arias not listed may have been sung in "Rinaldo" during the years 1711–17, but in the absence of contemporary evidence from scores or librettos the extent of such changes cannot be accurately ascertained.



No complete autograph score exists; fragments representing about three-quarters of the 1711 score are held by the Royal Music Library (a subdivision of the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a> in London) and the <a href="Fitzwilliam%20Museum">Fitzwilliam Museum</a> in Cambridge. The oldest complete score, dating from about 1716, is an error-strewn manuscript that may be a copy from one or more of the performing scores from that period. The manuscript bears numerous notes and corrections in Handel's hand, and was possibly the basis for the substantial revisions which he effected in 1731. It was also used by the copyist John Christopher Smith to produce two performing scores for the 1720s Hamburg performances. Further complete manuscript copies were produced by Smith and others in 1725–28 (the "Malmesbury" score), 1740 ("Lennard") and 1745 ("Granville"). These provide many variations of individual numbers.

During the initial run at the Queen's Theatre the publisher John Walsh printed "Songs in the Opera of Rinaldo", in mainly <a href="Sheet%20music%23Types">short score</a> form. Apart from the overture, instrumental numbers were omitted, as were the recitatives. In June 1711 Walsh published a fuller version, which included instrumental parts; he continued to publish versions of individual numbers, with a variety of orchestrations, until the 1730s. In 1717 William Babell issued an arrangement for harpsichord of the overture and seven of the arias. <a href="Friedrich%20Chrysander">Friedrich Chrysander</a> published editions of the whole opera in 1874 and in 1894, based on a study of the existing published and manuscript material. In 1993 David Kimbell, for the <a href="Hallische%20H%C3%A4ndel-Ausgabe">Hallische Händel-Ausgabe</a> (HHA), produced a full score of the 1711 version, together with rejected draft material and the additional numbers introduced in revivals up to 1717. HHA has also produced a complete score of the 1731 version.

The libretto was published in London by the Queen's Theatre in February 1711, to coincide with the premiere, with Hill's English translation. Revised versions followed in 1717 and 1731 to reflect the changes introduced in those years; Rossi is believed to have prepared the Italian additions and revisions, with the 1731 English credited to "Mr. Humphreys". Feind's German versions of the libretto were published in Hamburg in 1715, 1723 and 1727.

The first full recording of "Rinaldo" (an "excerpts" disc had preceded it by two years) was made in 1977 by CBS, with <a href="Carolyn%20Watkinson">Carolyn Watkinson</a> in the title role, <a href="Ileana%20Cotruba%C5%9F">Ileana Cotrubaş</a> as Almirena, and <a href="Jean-Claude%20Malgoire">Jean-Claude Malgoire</a> conducting <a href="La%20Grande%20%C3%89curie%20et%20la%20Chambre%20du%20Roy">La Grande Écurie et la Chambre du Roy</a>. The work, recorded in a Paris church, was based on the 1711 score; <a href="Alan%20Blyth">Alan Blyth</a> in "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" praised the standard of the singing, and despite reservations about the sound quality, called it one of the most enjoyable of available Handel opera recordings. There was no further recording of "Rinaldo" available until 1990, when John Fisher's heavily cut version from <a href="La%20Fenice">La Fenice</a> was issued. Another decade passed before the appearance of <a href="Christopher%20Hogwood">Christopher Hogwood</a>'s 1999 Decca recording, again based on the original score, with the countertenor <a href="David%20Daniels%20%28countertenor%29">David Daniels</a> as Rinaldo, <a href="Cecilia%20Bartoli">Cecilia Bartoli</a> as Almirena and <a href="Catherine%20Bott">Catherine Bott</a> in the small part of First Mermaid. "Gramophone's" reviewer called this issue "a treat for Handel lovers – a rare recording of one of the composer's richest operas, with a strong and starry cast". Since then several more versions have been made available: <a href="Harry%20Bicket">Harry Bicket</a>'s 2001 recording for Arthaus, which was later issued as a <a href="DVD">DVD</a>; <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Jacobs">René Jacobs</a> with the Freiburg Baroque Orchestra for <a href="Harmonia%20Mundi">Harmonia Mundi</a> in 2001; and a performance by the Aradia Ensemble under Kevin Mallon, recorded in 2004 and issued under the <a href="Naxos%20Records">Naxos</a> label in 2005.

The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan

The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan is the second studio album by American singer-songwriter <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, released on May 27, 1963 by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. Whereas his self-titled debut album "<a href="Bob%20Dylan%20%28album%29">Bob Dylan</a>" had contained only two original songs, "Freewheelin" represented the beginning of Dylan's writing contemporary words to traditional melodies. Eleven of the thirteen songs on the album are Dylan's original compositions. The album opens with "<a href="Blowin%27%20in%20the%20Wind">Blowin' in the Wind</a>", which became an anthem of the 1960s, and an international hit for folk trio <a href="Peter%2C%20Paul%20%26amp%3B%20Mary">Peter, Paul & Mary</a> soon after the release of "Freewheelin". The album featured several other songs which came to be regarded as among Dylan's best compositions and classics of the 1960s folk scene: "<a href="Girl%20from%20the%20North%20Country">Girl from the North Country</a>", "<a href="Masters%20of%20War">Masters of War</a>", "<a href="A%20Hard%20Rain%27s%20a-Gonna%20Fall">A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall</a>" and "<a href="Don%27t%20Think%20Twice%2C%20It%27s%20All%20Right">Don't Think Twice, It's All Right</a>".

Dylan's lyrics embraced news stories drawn from headlines about the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a> and he articulated anxieties about the fear of <a href="nuclear%20warfare">nuclear warfare</a>. Balancing this political material were love songs, sometimes bitter and accusatory, and material that features <a href="surreal%20humor">surreal humor</a>. "Freewheelin" showcased Dylan's songwriting talent for the first time, propelling him to national and international fame. The success of the album and Dylan's subsequent recognition led to his being named as "Spokesman of a Generation", a label Dylan repudiated.

"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" reached number 22 in the US (eventually going platinum), and became a number-one album in the UK in 1964. In 2003, the album was ranked number 97 on <a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a> Magazine's list of <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">the 500 greatest albums of all time</a>. In 2002, "Freewheelin"' was one of the first 50 recordings chosen by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> to be added to the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a>.

Neither critics nor the public took much notice of Dylan's self-titled debut album, "<a href="Bob%20Dylan%20%28album%29">Bob Dylan</a>", which sold only 5,000 copies in its first year, just enough to break even. In a pointed rebuke to <a href="John%20H.%20Hammond">John Hammond</a>, who had signed Dylan to <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, some within the company referred to the singer as "Hammond's Folly" and suggested dropping his contract. Hammond defended Dylan vigorously and was determined that Dylan's second album should be a success. The recording of "Freewheelin"' took place from April 1962 to April 1963, and the album was assembled from eight recording sessions in the Columbia Records Studio A, 799 Seventh Avenue, in New York City.

Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a> connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend <a href="Suze%20Rotolo">Suze Rotolo</a> in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20USA">American Communist Party</a>. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: "Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her."

Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the "Freewheelin" album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on "Freewheelin"' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as "chicks", and she resented being regarded as "a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention".

The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on <a href="WBAI">WBAI</a> in June 1962, <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a> described Dylan as "the most prolific songwriter on the scene" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, "I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called <a href="the%20Bitter%20End">the Bitter End</a>." Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation. In an interview with "<a href="Sing%20Out%21">Sing Out!</a>" magazine, Dylan said, "The songs are there. They exist all by themselves just waiting for someone to write them down. I just put them down on paper. If I didn't do it, somebody else would."

Dylan began work on his second album at Columbia's Studio A in New York on April 24, 1962. The album was provisionally entitled "Bob Dylan's Blues", and as late as July 1962, this would remain the working title. At this session, Dylan recorded four of his own compositions: "Sally Gal", "<a href="The%20Death%20of%20Emmett%20Till">The Death of Emmett Till</a>", "Rambling, Gambling Willie", and "<a href="Talkin%27%20John%20Birch%20Paranoid%20Blues">Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues</a>". He also recorded two traditional folk songs, "Going To New Orleans" and "Corrina, Corrina", and <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a>' "(I Heard That) Lonesome Whistle".

Returning to Studio A the following day, Dylan recorded his new song about <a href="fallout%20shelter">fallout shelter</a>s, "<a href="Let%20Me%20Die%20In%20My%20Footsteps">Let Me Die In My Footsteps</a>". Other original compositions followed: "Rocks and Gravel", "Talking Hava Negiliah Blues", "Talking Bear Mountain Picnic Massacre Blues", and two more takes of "Sally Gal". Dylan recorded cover versions of "Wichita", <a href="Big%20Joe%20Williams">Big Joe Williams</a>' "<a href="Baby%2C%20Please%20Don%27t%20Go">Baby, Please Don't Go</a>", and <a href="Robert%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Robert Johnson</a>'s "Milk Cow's Calf's Blues". Because Dylan's songwriting talent was developing so rapidly, nothing from the April sessions appeared on "Freewheelin"'.

The recording sessions at Studio A resumed on July 9, when Dylan recorded "<a href="Blowin%27%20in%20the%20Wind">Blowin' in the Wind</a>", a song that he had first performed live at <a href="Gerde%27s%20Folk%20City">Gerde's Folk City</a> on April 16. Dylan also recorded "Bob Dylan's Blues", "Down the Highway", and "Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance", all of which ended up on "Freewheelin"', plus one other original composition, "Baby, I'm in the Mood for You", which did not.

At this point, music manager <a href="Albert%20Grossman">Albert Grossman</a> began to take an interest in Dylan's business affairs. Grossman persuaded Dylan to transfer the publishing rights of his songs from Duchess Music, whom he had signed a contract with in January 1962, to Witmark Music, a division of Warner's music publishing operation. Dylan signed a contract with Witmark on July 13, 1962. Unknown to Dylan, Grossman had also negotiated a deal with Witmark. This gave Grossman fifty percent of Witmark's share of the publishing income generated by any songwriter Grossman had brought to the company. This "secret deal" resulted in a bitter legal battle between Dylan and Grossman in the 1980s.

Albert Grossman became Dylan's manager on August 20, 1962. Since Dylan was under twenty-one when he had signed his contract with CBS, Grossman argued that the contract was invalid and had to be re-negotiated. Instead, Hammond responded by inviting Dylan to his office and persuading him to sign a "reaffirment"—agreeing to abide by the original contract. This effectively neutralized Grossman's strategy, and led to some animosity between Grossman and Hammond. Grossman enjoyed a reputation in the folk scene of being commercially aggressive, generating more income and defending his clients' interests more fiercely than "the nicer, more amateurish managers in the Village". Dylan critic Andy Gill has suggested that Grossman encouraged Dylan to become more reclusive and aloof, even paranoid.

On September 22, Dylan appeared for the first time at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a>, part of an all-star hootenanny. On this occasion, he premiered his new composition "<a href="A%20Hard%20Rain%27s%20a-Gonna%20Fall">A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall</a>", a complex and powerful song built upon the question and answer refrain pattern of the traditional British ballad "<a href="Lord%20Randall">Lord Randall</a>". "Hard Rain" would gain added resonance one month later, when <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">President Kennedy</a> appeared on national television on October 22, and announced the discovery of Soviet missiles on the island of Cuba, initiating the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>. In the sleeve notes on the "Freewheelin"' album, <a href="Nat%20Hentoff">Nat Hentoff</a> quotes Dylan as saying that he wrote "Hard Rain" in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis: "Every line in it is actually the start of a whole new song. But when I wrote it, I thought I wouldn't have enough time alive to write all those songs so I put all I could into this one". In fact, Dylan had written the song more than a month before the crisis broke.

Dylan resumed work on "Freewheelin"' at Columbia's Studio A on October 26, when a major innovation took place—Dylan made his first studio recordings with a backing band. Accompanied by <a href="Dick%20Wellstood">Dick Wellstood</a> on piano, Howie Collins and <a href="Bruce%20Langhorne">Bruce Langhorne</a> on guitar, <a href="Leonard%20Gaskin">Leonard Gaskin</a> on bass, and <a href="Herb%20Lovelle">Herb Lovelle</a> on drums, Dylan recorded three songs. Several takes of Dylan's "<a href="Mixed-Up%20Confusion">Mixed-Up Confusion</a>" and <a href="Arthur%20Crudup">Arthur Crudup</a>'s "<a href="That%27s%20All%20Right">That's All Right Mama</a>" were deemed unusable, but a master take of "Corrina, Corrina" was selected for the final album. An 'alternate take' of "Corrina, Corrina" from the same session would also be selected for the b-side of "Mixed Up Confusion", Dylan's first electric single issued later in the year. At the next recording session on November 1, the band included <a href="Art%20Davis">Art Davis</a> on bass, while jazz guitarist <a href="George%20Barnes%20%28musician%29">George Barnes</a> replaced Howie Collins. "Mixed-Up Confusion" and "That's All Right Mama" were re-recorded, and again the results were deemed unsatisfactory. A take of the third song, "Rocks and Gravel", was selected for the album, but the track was subsequently dropped.

On November 14, Dylan resumed work with his backup band, this time with Gene Ramey on bass, devoting most of the session to recording "Mixed-Up Confusion". Although this track did not appear on "Freewheelin"', it was released as a single on December 14, 1962, and then swiftly withdrawn. Unlike the other material which Dylan recorded between 1961 and 1964, "Mixed-Up Confusion" attempted a <a href="rockabilly">rockabilly</a> sound. <a href="Cameron%20Crowe">Cameron Crowe</a> described it as "a fascinating look at a folk artist with his mind wandering towards <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="Sun%20Records">Sun Records</a>".

Also recorded on November 14 was the new composition "<a href="Don%27t%20Think%20Twice%2C%20It%27s%20All%20Right">Don't Think Twice, It's All Right</a>" (<a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a> writes that, although the sleeve notes of "Freewheelin" describe this song as being accompanied by a backing band, no band is audible on the released version). Langhorne then accompanied Dylan on three more original compositions: "<a href="Ballad%20of%20Hollis%20Brown">Ballad of Hollis Brown</a>", "Kingsport Town", and "Whatcha Gonna Do", but these performances were not included on "Freewheelin"'.

Dylan held another session at Studio A on December 6. Five songs, all original compositions, were recorded, three of which were eventually included on "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan": "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall", "Oxford Town", and "I Shall Be Free". Dylan also made another attempt at "Whatcha Gonna Do" and recorded a new song, "Hero Blues", but both songs were ultimately rejected and left unreleased.

Twelve days later, Dylan made his first trip abroad. British TV director <a href="Philip%20Saville">Philip Saville</a> had heard Dylan perform in Greenwich Village, and invited him to take part in a <a href="BBC">BBC</a> television drama: "<a href="Madhouse%20on%20Castle%20Street">Madhouse on Castle Street</a>". Dylan arrived in London on December 17. In the play, Dylan performed "Blowin' in the Wind" and two other songs. Dylan also immersed himself in the London folk scene, making contact with <a href="The%20Troubadour%20%28London%29">the Troubadour</a> folk club organizer Anthea Joseph and folk singers <a href="Martin%20Carthy">Martin Carthy</a> and Bob Davenport. "I ran into some people in England who really knew those [traditional English] songs," Dylan recalled in 1984. "Martin Carthy, another guy named [Bob] Davenport. Martin Carthy's incredible. I learned a lot of stuff from Martin."

Carthy taught Dylan two English songs that would prove important for the "Freewheelin" album. Carthy's arrangement of "<a href="Scarborough%20Fair%20%28ballad%29">Scarborough Fair</a>" would be used by Dylan as the basis of his own composition, "<a href="Girl%20from%20the%20North%20Country">Girl from the North Country</a>". A 19th-century ballad commemorating the death of <a href="Sir%20John%20Franklin">Sir John Franklin</a> in 1847, "<a href="Lady%20Franklin%27s%20Lament">Lady Franklin's Lament</a>", gave Dylan the melody for his composition "<a href="Bob%20Dylan%27s%20Dream">Bob Dylan's Dream</a>". Both songs displayed Dylan's fast-growing ability to take traditional melodies and use them as a basis for highly personal songwriting.

From England, Dylan traveled to Italy, and joined Albert Grossman, who was touring with his client <a href="Odetta">Odetta</a>. Dylan was also hoping to make contact with his girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, unaware that she had already left Italy and was on her way back to New York. Dylan worked on his new material, and when he returned to London, Martin Carthy received a surprise: "When he came back from Italy, he'd written 'Girl From the North Country'; he came down to the Troubadour and said, 'Hey, here's "Scarborough Fair"' and he started playing this thing."

Dylan flew back to New York on January 16, 1963. In January and February, he recorded some of his new compositions in sessions for the folk magazine "<a href="Broadside%20%28magazine%29">Broadside</a>", including a new anti-war song, "Masters of War", which he had composed in London. Dylan was happy to be reunited with Suze Rotolo, and he persuaded her to move back into the apartment they had shared on West 4th Street.

Dylan's keenness to record his new material for "Freewheelin"' paralleled a dramatic power struggle in the studio: Albert Grossman's determination to have <a href="John%20H.%20Hammond">John Hammond</a> replaced as Dylan's producer at CBS. According to Dylan biographer <a href="Howard%20Sounes">Howard Sounes</a>, "The two men could not have been more different. Hammond was a <a href="White%20Anglo-Saxon%20Protestant">WASP</a>, so relaxed during recording sessions that he sat with feet up, reading "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>". Grossman was a Jewish businessman with a shady past, hustling to become a millionaire."

Because of Grossman's hostility to Hammond, Columbia paired Dylan with a young, African-American jazz producer, <a href="Tom%20Wilson%20%28producer%29">Tom Wilson</a>. Wilson recalled: "I didn't even particularly like folk music. I'd been recording <a href="Sun%20Ra">Sun Ra</a> and <a href="Coltrane">Coltrane</a> ... I thought folk music was for the dumb guys. [Dylan] played like the dumb guys, but then these words came out. I was flabbergasted." At a recording session on April 24, produced by Wilson, Dylan recorded five new compositions: "Girl from the North Country", "Masters of War", "Talkin' World War III Blues", "Bob Dylan's Dream", and "Walls of Red Wing". "Walls of Red Wing" was ultimately rejected, but the other four were included in a revised album sequence.

The final drama of recording "Freewheelin"' occurred when Dylan was scheduled to appear on "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>" on May 12, 1963. Dylan had told Sullivan he would perform "Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues", but the "head of program practices" at <a href="CBS%20Television">CBS Television</a> informed Dylan that this song was potentially libelous to the <a href="John%20Birch%20Society">John Birch Society</a>, and asked him to perform another number. Rather than comply with TV censorship, Dylan refused to appear on the show. There is disagreement between Dylan's biographers about the consequences of this censorship row. <a href="Anthony%20Scaduto">Anthony Scaduto</a> writes that after "The Ed Sullivan Show" debacle, CBS lawyers were alarmed to discover that the controversial song was to be included on Dylan's new album, only a few weeks from its release date. They insisted that the song be dropped, and four songs ("John Birch", "Let Me Die In My Footsteps", "Rambling Gambling Willie", "Rocks and Gravel") on the album were replaced with Dylan's newer compositions recorded in April ("Girl from the North Country", "Masters of War", "Talkin' World War III Blues", "Bob Dylan's Dream"). Scaduto writes that Dylan felt "crushed" by being compelled to submit to censorship, but he was in no position to argue.

According to biographer <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a>, "There remains a common belief that [Dylan] was forced by Columbia to pull 'Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues' from the album "after" he walked out on "The Ed Sullivan Show"." However, the "revised" version of "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" was released on May 27, 1963; this would have given Columbia Records only two weeks to recut the album, reprint the record sleeves, and press and package enough copies of the new version to fill orders. Heylin suggests that CBS had probably forced Dylan to withdraw "John Birch" from the album some weeks earlier and that Dylan had responded by recording his new material on April 24. Whether the songs were substituted before or after "The Ed Sullivan Show", critics agree that the new material gave the album a more personal feel, distanced from the traditional folk-blues material which had dominated his first album, "Bob Dylan".

A few copies of the original pressing of the LP with the four deleted tracks have turned up over the years, despite Columbia's supposed destruction of all copies during the pre-release phase (all copies found were in the standard album sleeve with the revised track selection). Other permutations of the "Freewheelin"' album include versions with a different running order of the tracks on the album, and a Canadian version of the album that listed the tracks in the wrong order. The original pressing of "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" is considered the most valuable and rarest record in America, with one copy having sold for $35,000.

"Blowin' in the Wind" is among Dylan's most celebrated compositions. In his sleeve notes for "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201%E2%80%933%20%28Rare%20%26amp%3B%20Unreleased%29%201961%E2%80%931991">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991</a>", John Bauldie writes that it was <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a> who first identified the melody of "Blowin' in the Wind" as Dylan's adaptation of the old Negro spiritual "No More Auction Block". According to Alan Lomax's "The Folk Songs of North America", the song originated in Canada and was sung by former slaves who fled there after <a href="Slavery%20Abolition%20Act%201833">Britain abolished slavery in 1833</a>. In 1978, Dylan acknowledged the source when he told journalist Marc Rowland: "'Blowin' in the Wind' has always been a spiritual. I took it off a song called 'No More Auction Block'—that's a spiritual and 'Blowin' in the Wind' follows the same feeling." Dylan's performance of "No More Auction Block" was recorded at the Gaslight Cafe in October 1962, and appeared on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201%E2%80%933%20%28Rare%20%26amp%3B%20Unreleased%29%201961%E2%80%931991">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991</a>".

Critic Andy Gill wrote: Blowin' in the Wind' marked a huge jump in Dylan's songwriting: for the first time, Dylan discovered the effectiveness of moving from the particular to the general. Whereas 'The Ballad of Donald White' would become completely redundant as soon as the eponymous criminal was executed, a song as vague as 'Blowin' in the Wind' could be applied to just about any freedom issue. It remains the song with which Dylan's name is most inextricably linked, and safeguarded his reputation as a civil libertarian through any number of changes in style and attitude."

"Blowin' in the Wind" became world-famous when <a href="Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a> issued the song as a single three weeks after the release of "Freewheelin". They and Dylan both shared the same manager: Albert Grossman. The single sold a phenomenal three hundred thousand copies in the first week of release. On July 13, 1963, it reached number two on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" chart with sales exceeding one million copies. Dylan later recalled that he was astonished when <a href="Peter%20Yarrow">Peter Yarrow</a> told him he was going to make $5,000 from the publishing rights.

There has been much speculation in print about the identity of the girl in the song. Clinton Heylin states that the most frequently mooted candidates are Echo Helstrom, an early girlfriend of Dylan from his hometown of <a href="Hibbing%2C%20Minnesota">Hibbing</a>, and <a href="Suze%20Rotolo">Suze Rotolo</a>, for whom Dylan was pining as he finished the song in Italy. Howard Sounes suggests the girl Dylan probably had in mind was Bonnie Beecher, a girlfriend of Dylan's when he was at the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>. Musicologist Todd Harvey notes that Dylan not only took the tune of "<a href="Scarborough%20Fair%20%28ballad%29">Scarborough Fair</a>", which he learned from Martin Carthy in London but also adapted the theme of that song. "Scarborough Fair" derives from "<a href="The%20Elfin%20Knight">The Elfin Knight</a>" (<a href="List%20of%20the%20Child%20Ballads">Child Ballad Number 2</a>), which was first transcribed in 1670. In the song, a supernatural character poses a series of questions to an innocent, requesting her to perform impossible tasks. Harvey points out that Dylan "retains the idea of the listener being sent upon a task, a northern place setting, and an antique lyric quality". Dylan returned to this song on "<a href="Nashville%20Skyline">Nashville Skyline</a>" (1969), recording it as a duet with <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a>, and he returned to it again in the studio with an unreleased organ and sax version in 1978.

A scathing song directed against the war industry, "Masters of War" is based on <a href="Jean%20Ritchie">Jean Ritchie</a>'s arrangement of "<a href="Nottamun%20Town">Nottamun Town</a>", an English riddle song. It was written in late 1962 while Dylan was in London; eyewitnesses (including Martin Carthy and Anthea Joseph) recall Dylan performing the song in folk clubs at the time. Ritchie would later assert her claim on the song's arrangement; according to one Dylan biography, the suit was settled when Ritchie received $5,000 from Dylan's lawyers.

Dylan composed this song in the form of a <a href="Twelve-bar%20blues">12-bar blues</a>. In the sleeve notes of "Freewheelin", Dylan explained to <a href="Nat%20Hentoff">Nat Hentoff</a>: "What made the real blues singers so great is that they were able to state all the problems they had; but at the same time, they were standing outside of them and could look at them. And in that way, they had them beat." Into this song, Dylan injected one explicit mention of an absence that was troubling him: the sojourn of Suze Rotolo in <a href="Perugia">Perugia</a>: "My baby took my heart from me/ She packed it all up in a suitcase/ Lord, she took it away to Italy, Italy."

Dylan begins this track with a spoken intro where he describes the origins of folk songs in a satirical vein: "most of the songs that are written uptown in <a href="Tin%20Pan%20Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a>, that's where most of the folk songs come from nowadays". What follows has been characterized as an absurd, improvised blues which Dylan, in the sleeve notes, describes as "a really off-the-cuff-song. I start with an idea and then I feel what follows. Best way I can describe this one is that it's sort of like walking by a side street. You gaze in and walk on." Harvey points out that Dylan subsequently elaborated this style of self-deprecatory, <a href="absurdist%20humor">absurdist humor</a> into more complex songs, such as "I Shall Be Free No.10" (1964).

Dylan was only 21 years old when he wrote one of his most complex songs, "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall", often referred to as "Hard Rain". Dylan is said to have premiered "Hard Rain" at <a href="the%20Gaslight%20Cafe">the Gaslight Cafe</a>, where Village performer Peter Blankfield recalled: "He put out these pieces of loose-leaf paper ripped out of a spiral notebook. And he starts singing ['Hard Rain'] ... He finished singing it, and no one could say anything. The length of it, the episodic sense of it. Every line kept building and bursting". Dylan performed "Hard Rain" days later at <a href="Carnegie%20Hall">Carnegie Hall</a> on September 22, 1962, as part of a concert organized by <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a>. The song gained added resonance during the <a href="Cuban%20Missile%20Crisis">Cuban Missile Crisis</a>, just one month after Dylan's first performance of "Hard Rain", when U.S. President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> gave his warning to the Soviet Union over their deployment of <a href="nuclear%20missiles">nuclear missiles</a> in Cuba, . Critics have interpreted the lyric 'hard rain' as a reference to <a href="nuclear%20fallout">nuclear fallout</a>, but Dylan resisted the specificity of this interpretation. In a radio interview with <a href="Studs%20Terkel">Studs Terkel</a> in 1963, Dylan said, "No, it's not atomic rain, it's just a hard rain. It isn't the fallout rain. I mean some sort of end that's just gotta happen … In the last verse, when I say, 'the pellets of poison are flooding the waters', that means all the lies that people get told on their radios and in their newspapers."

Many people were astonished by the power and complexity of this work. For <a href="Robert%20Shelton%20%28critic%29">Robert Shelton</a>, who had given Dylan an important boost in his 1961 review in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", this song was "a landmark in topical, folk-based songwriting. Here blooms the promised fruit of the 1950s poetry-jazz fusion of <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Ginsberg</a>, <a href="Lawrence%20Ferlinghetti">Ferlinghetti</a>, and <a href="Kenneth%20Rexroth">Rexroth</a>." Folk singer <a href="Dave%20Van%20Ronk">Dave Van Ronk</a> later commented: "I was acutely aware that it represented the beginning of an artistic revolution." <a href="Pete%20Seeger">Pete Seeger</a> expressed the opinion that this song would last longer than any other written by Dylan.

Dylan wrote this song on hearing from Suze Rotolo that she was considering staying in Italy indefinitely, and he used a melody he adapted from <a href="Paul%20Clayton%20%28folksinger%29">Paul Clayton</a>'s song "Who's Gonna Buy You Ribbons (When I'm Gone)". In the "Freewheelin" sleeve notes, Dylan comments: "It isn't a love song. It's a statement that maybe you can say to make yourself feel better. It's as if you were talking to yourself."

Dylan's contemporaries hailed the song as a masterpiece: Bob Spitz quotes <a href="Paul%20Stookey">Paul Stookey</a> saying "I thought it was a masterful statement", while <a href="Dave%20Van%20Ronk">Dave Van Ronk</a> called it "self-pitying but brilliant". Dylan biographer <a href="Howard%20Sounes">Howard Sounes</a> commented: "The greatness of the song was in the cleverness of the language. The phrase "don't think twice, it's all right" could be snarled, sung with resignation, or delivered with an ambiguous mixture of bitterness and regret. Seldom have the contradictory emotions of a thwarted lover been so well expressed, and the song transcended the autobiographical origins of Dylan's pain."

"Bob Dylan's Dream" was based on the melody of the traditional "<a href="Lady%20Franklin%27s%20Lament">Lady Franklin's Lament</a>", in which the title character dreams of finding her husband, Arctic explorer <a href="Sir%20John%20Franklin">Sir John Franklin</a>, alive and well. (Sir John Franklin had vanished on an expedition searching for the <a href="North%20West%20Passage">North West Passage</a> in 1845; a stone <a href="cairn">cairn</a> on <a href="King%20William%20Island">King William Island</a> detailing his demise was found by a later expedition in 1859.) Todd Harvey points out that Dylan transforms the song into a personal journey, yet he retains both the theme and the mood of the original ballad. The world outside is depicted as stormy and harsh, and Dylan's most fervent wish, like Lady Franklin's, is to be reunited with departed companions and to relive the fond memories they represent.

"Oxford Town" is Dylan's sardonic account of events at the <a href="University%20of%20Mississippi">University of Mississippi</a> in September 1962. <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> veteran <a href="James%20Meredith">James Meredith</a> was the first black student to enroll at the <a href="University%20of%20Mississippi">University of Mississippi</a>, located a mile from <a href="Oxford%2C%20Mississippi">Oxford, Mississippi</a>. When Meredith first tried to attend classes at the school, some Mississippians pledged to keep the university segregated, including the state governor <a href="Ross%20Barnett">Ross Barnett</a>. Ultimately, the University of Mississippi had to be integrated with the help of U.S. federal troops. Dylan responded rapidly: his song was published in the November 1962 issue of "<a href="Broadside%20%28magazine%29">Broadside</a>".

The "talkin' blues" was a style of improvised songwriting that <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a> had developed to a high plane. (A Minneapolis domestic recording that Dylan made in September 1960 includes his performances of Guthrie's "Talking Columbia" and "Talking Merchant Marine".) "Talkin' World War III Blues" was a spontaneous composition Dylan created in the studio during the final session for "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan". He recorded five takes of the song and the fifth was selected for the album. The format of the "talkin' blues" permitted Dylan to address the serious subject of nuclear annihilation with humor, and "without resorting to his finger-pointing or apocalyptical-prophetic persona".

"Corrina, Corrina" was recorded by <a href="the%20Mississippi%20Sheiks">the Mississippi Sheiks</a>, and by their leader <a href="Bo%20Carter">Bo Carter</a> in 1928. The song was covered by artists as diverse as <a href="Bob%20Wills">Bob Wills</a>, <a href="Big%20Joe%20Turner">Big Joe Turner</a>, and <a href="Doc%20Watson">Doc Watson</a>. Dylan's version borrows phrases from a few <a href="Robert%20Johnson%20%28musician%29">Robert Johnson</a> songs: "Stones In My Passway", "32-20 Blues", and "Hellhound On My Trail". An alternate take of the song was used as a B-side for his "<a href="Mixed-Up%20Confusion">Mixed-Up Confusion</a>" single.

"Honey, Just Allow Me One More Chance" is based on "Honey, Won't You Allow Me One More Chance?", a song dating back to the 1890s that was popularized by Henry Thomas in his 1928 recording. "However, Thomas's original provided no more than a song title and a notion", writes Heylin, "which Dylan turned into a personal plea to an absent lover to allow him 'one more chance to get along with you.' It is a vocal tour de force and ... showed a Dylan prepared to make light of his own blues by using the form itself."

"I Shall Be Free" is a rewrite of <a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a>'s "We Shall Be Free", which was performed by <a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a>, <a href="Sonny%20Terry">Sonny Terry</a>, <a href="Cisco%20Houston">Cisco Houston</a>, and <a href="Woody%20Guthrie">Woody Guthrie</a>. According to Todd Harvey, Dylan's version draws its melody from the Guthrie recording but omits its signature chorus ("We'll soon be free/When the Lord will call us home"). Critics have been divided about the worth of this final song. Robert Shelton dismissed the song as "a decided anticlimax. Although the album has at least a half dozen blockbusters, two of the weakest songs are tucked in at the end, like shirttails." Todd Harvey has argued that by placing the song at the close of the "Freewheelin" LP, Dylan ends on a note of levity which is a relief after the weighty sentiments expressed in several songs on the album.

The known outtakes from the "Freewheelin"' album are as follows. All songs released in 1991 on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201%E2%80%933%20%28Rare%20%26amp%3B%20Unreleased%29%201961%E2%80%931991">The Bootleg Series 1–3</a>" are discussed in that album's liner notes, while songs that have never been released have been documented by biographer Clinton Heylin, except where noted. All songs written by Bob Dylan, except where noted.

Dylan promoted his upcoming album with radio appearances and concert performances. In May 1963, Dylan performed with <a href="Joan%20Baez">Joan Baez</a> at the Monterey Folk Festival, where she joined him on stage for a duet of a new Dylan song, "<a href="With%20God%20on%20Our%20Side%20%28song%29">With God on Our Side</a>". Baez was at the pinnacle of her fame, having appeared on the cover of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine the previous November. The performance not only gave Dylan and his songs a new prominence, it also marked the beginning of a romantic relationship between Baez and Dylan, the start of what Dylan biographer Sounes termed "one of the most celebrated love affairs of the decade".

"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" was released at the end of May. According to Scaduto, it was an immediate success, selling 10,000 copies a month and bringing Dylan an income of about $2,500 a month. An article by Nat Hentoff on folk music appeared in the June issue of "<a href="Playboy">Playboy</a>" magazine and devoted considerable space to Dylan's achievements, calling him "the most vital of the younger citybillies".

In July, Dylan appeared at the second <a href="Newport%20Folk%20Festival">Newport Folk Festival</a>. That weekend, <a href="Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>'s rendition of "Blowin' in the Wind" reached number two on "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>"s pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. <a href="Tom%20Paxton">Tom Paxton</a> recalled: "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially and it was like a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend <a href="Bob%20Fass">Bob Fass</a> recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird. People follow me into the men's room just so they can say that they saw me pee."

In September, the album entered "Billboard"s album charts; the highest position "Freewheelin" reached was number 22, but it eventually came to sell one million copies in the U.S. Dylan himself came to acknowledge "Freewheelin"' as the album that marked the start of his success. During his dispute with Albert Grossman, Dylan stated in a deposition: "Although I didn't know it at the time, the second album was destined to become a great success because it was to include 'Blowin' in the Wind'." Besides "Blowin' in the Wind", "Masters of War", "Girl from the North Country", "A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall" and "Don't Think Twice, It's All Right" have all been acclaimed as masterpieces, and they have been mainstays of Dylan's performing repertory to the present day. The album's balance between serious subject matter and levity, earnest finger-pointing songs and surreal jokes captured a wide audience, including <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, who were on the cusp of global success. <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> recalled: "In Paris in 1964 was the first time I ever heard Dylan at all. <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul</a> got the record ("The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan") from a French DJ. For three weeks in Paris we didn't stop playing it. We all went potty about Dylan."

The album was re-issued in 2010 as part of "<a href="The%20Original%20Mono%20Recordings">The Original Mono Recordings</a>", a <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Legacy</a> <a href="box%20set">box set</a> that included the monaural versions of Dylan's first eight albums.

The <a href="album%20cover">album cover</a> features a photograph of Dylan with <a href="Suze%20Rotolo">Suze Rotolo</a>. It was taken in February 1963—a few weeks after Rotolo had returned from Italy—by <a href="Columbia%20Records">CBS</a> staff photographer <a href="Don%20Hunstein">Don Hunstein</a> at the corner of Jones Street and West <a href="4th%20Street">4th Street</a> in the <a href="West%20Village">West Village</a>, New York City, close to the apartment where the couple lived at the time. In 2008, Rotolo described the circumstances surrounding the famous photo to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>": "He wore a very thin jacket, because image was all. Our apartment was always cold, so I had a sweater on, plus I borrowed one of his big, bulky sweaters. On top of that I put on a coat. So I felt like an Italian sausage. Every time I look at that picture, I think I look fat." In her memoir, "A Freewheelin' Time", Rotolo analyzed the significance of the <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a>:
Critic <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> summed up the iconic impact of the cover as "a photograph that inspired countless young men to hunch their shoulders, look distant, and let the girl do the clinging".

The cover photo is recreated in the 2001 <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> film "<a href="Vanilla%20Sky">Vanilla Sky</a>".

The success of "Freewheelin" transformed the public perception of Dylan. Before the album's release, he was one among many folk-singers. Afterwards, at the age of 22, Dylan was regarded as a major artist, perhaps even a spokesman for disaffected youth. As one critic described the transformation, "In barely over a year, a young plagiarist had been reborn as a songwriter of substance, and his first album of fully realized original material got the 1960s off their musical starting block." Janet Maslin wrote of the album: "These were the songs that established him as the voice of his generation—someone who implicitly understood how concerned young Americans felt about <a href="nuclear%20disarmament">nuclear disarmament</a> and the growing <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>: his mixture of moral authority and nonconformity was perhaps the most timely of his attributes."

This title of "Spokesman of a Generation" was viewed by Dylan with disgust in later years. He came to feel it was a label that the media had pinned on him, and in his autobiography, "<a href="Chronicles%2C%20Volume%20One">Chronicles</a>", Dylan wrote: "The press never let up. Once in a while I would have to rise up and offer myself for an interview so they wouldn't beat the door down. Later an article would hit the streets with the headline "Spokesman Denies That He's A Spokesman". I felt like a piece of meat that someone had thrown to the dogs."

The album secured for Dylan an "unstoppable cult following" of fans who preferred the harshness of his performances to the softer cover versions released by other singers. <a href="Richard%20Williams%20%28journalist%29">Richard Williams</a> has suggested that the richness of the imagery in "Freewheelin" transformed Dylan into a key performer for a burgeoning college audience hungry for a new cultural complexity: "For students whose exam courses included <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">Eliot</a> and <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">Yeats</a>, here was something that flattered their expanding intellect while appealing to the teenage rebel in their early-sixties souls. <a href="James%20Dean">James Dean</a> had walked around reading <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>; here were both in a single package, the words and the attitude set to music." Andy Gill adds that in the few months between the release of "Freewheelin"' in May 1963, and Dylan's next album "<a href="The%20Times%20They%20Are%20a-Changin%27%20%28album%29">The Times They Are A-Changin'</a>" in January 1964, Dylan became the hottest property in American music, stretching the boundaries of what had been previously viewed as a collegiate folk music audience.

Critical opinion about "Freewheelin" has been consistently favorable in the years since its release. Dylan biographer <a href="Howard%20Sounes">Howard Sounes</a> called it "Bob Dylan's first great album". In a survey of Dylan's work published by "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" magazine in 2000, the "Freewheelin’" album was described as "easily the best of [Dylan's] acoustic albums and a quantum leap from his debut—which shows the frantic pace at which Dylan's mind was moving." The magazine went on to comment, "You can see why this album got The Beatles listening. The songs at its core must have sounded like communiques from another plane."

For Patrick Humphries, "rarely has one album so effectively reflected the times which produced it. "Freewheelin" spoke directly to the concerns of its audience. and addressed them in a mature and reflective manner: it mirrored the state of the nation." <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a>'s verdict on the album in the <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> guide was: "It's hard to overestimate the importance of "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan", the record that firmly established Dylan as an unparalleled songwriter ... This is rich, imaginative music, capturing the sound and spirit of America as much as that of <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>, <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a>, or <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a>. Dylan, in many ways, recorded music that equaled this, but he never topped it."

In March 2000, <a href="Van%20Morrison">Van Morrison</a> told the Irish rock magazine "<a href="Hot%20Press%20%28magazine%29">Hot Press</a>" about the impact that "Freewheelin"' made on him: "I think I heard it in a record shop in Smith Street. And I just thought it was incredible that this guy's not singing about 'moon in June' and he's getting away with it. That's what I thought at the time. The subject matter wasn't pop songs, ya know, and I thought this kind of opens the whole thing up ... Dylan put it into the mainstream that this could be done."

"Freewheelin"' was one of 50 recordings chosen by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> to be added to the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a> in 2002. The citation read: "This album is considered by some to be the most important collection of original songs issued in the 1960s. It includes "Blowin' in the Wind," the era's popular and powerful protest anthem." The following year (2003), "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" "Magazine" ranked it number 97 on their list of <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">the 500 greatest albums of all time</a> (this ranking would later be changed to number 98 in the published book version of the list).

The album was included in <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>'s "Basic Record Library" of 1950s and 1960s recordings, published in "" (1981). It was also included in Robert Dimery's "<a href="1001%20Albums%20You%20Must%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die</a>".

Some very early first pressing copies contained four songs that were ultimately replaced by Columbia on all subsequent pressings. These songs were "Rocks and Gravel", "Let Me Die in My Footsteps," "Gamblin' Willie's Dead Man's Hand" and "Talkin' John Birch Blues". Copies of the "original" version of "The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan" (in both mono and stereo) are extremely rare.
The original track listing was as follows:

Battle of Rennell Island

The Battle of Rennell Island (Japanese: レンネル島沖海戦) took place on 29–30 January 1943. It was the last major <a href="naval%20battle">naval engagement</a> between the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> and the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Navy">Imperial Japanese Navy</a> during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a> of World War II. It occurred in the <a href="South%20Pacific%20Area">South Pacific</a> between <a href="Rennell%20Island">Rennell Island</a> and <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> in the southern <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>.

In the battle, Japanese naval land-based <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s, seeking to provide protection for the <a href="Operation%20Ke">impending evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal</a>, made several attacks over two days on U.S. warships operating as a <a href="task%20force">task force</a> south of this island. In addition to approaching Guadalcanal with the objective of engaging any Japanese ships that might come into range, the U.S. task force was protecting an <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> transport ship convoy carrying replacement troops there.

As a result of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> was sunk, a <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> was heavily damaged, and the rest of the U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending the battle for the island.

On 7 August 1942, Allied forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as bases for threatening the supply routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a campaign with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.

The last major attempt by the Japanese to drive Allied forces from Guadalcanal and Tulagi was defeated during the decisive <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> in early November 1942. Thereafter, the Japanese Navy was able to deliver only subsistence supplies and a few replacement troops to Japanese <a href="Japanese%20Imperial%20Army">Army</a> forces on Guadalcanal. Because of the threat from Allied aircraft based at <a href="Honiara%20International%20Airport">Henderson Field</a> on Guadalcanal, plus nearby U.S. <a href="aircraft%20carriers">aircraft carriers</a>, the Japanese delivered these supplies at night, usually by <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> or <a href="submarine">submarine</a>, in operations the Allies called the "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>." However, these supplies and replacements were not enough to sustain Japanese troops on the island, who by 7 December 1942, were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. On 12 December 1942, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite initial opposition from Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies, on 31 December 1942 the <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a>, with approval from the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a>, agreed to evacuate all Japanese forces from the island and establish a new line of defense for the Solomons on <a href="New%20Georgia">New Georgia</a>.

The evacuation was code-named "<a href="Operation%20Ke">Operation Ke</a>" (ケ号作戦), and was scheduled to begin on 14 January 1943. An important element in the plan was an <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> campaign starting 28 January 1943, to inhibit Allied aircraft or warships from disrupting the final stage of the "Ke" operation, which was the actual evacuation of all Japanese troops from Guadalcanal.

Allied forces misinterpreted the "Ke" preparations as the beginning of another Japanese offensive to try to retake Guadalcanal. At the same time, Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey%20Jr.">William Halsey Jr.</a>, the Allied theatre commander, was under pressure from his superiors to complete the replacement of the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Marine Regiment</a>, which had been in combat on Guadalcanal since August, with fresh <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> troops. Halsey hoped to take advantage of what he believed was an impending Japanese offensive to draw Japanese naval forces into a battle, while at the same time delivering the replacement Army troops to Guadalcanal. On 29 January 1943, Halsey sent five <a href="task%20force">task force</a>s toward the southern Solomons area to cover the relief convoy and to engage any Japanese naval forces that came into range. These five task forces included two fleet <a href="aircraft%20carrier">carriers</a>, two <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a>s, three <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s, 12 cruisers, and 25 destroyers.

In front of this array of task forces was Task Group 62.8, the troop convoy of four transports and four destroyers. Ahead of the troop convoy, between <a href="Rennell%20Island">Rennell Island</a> and Guadalcanal, was Task Force 18 (TF 18) Rear Admiral <a href="Robert%20C.%20Giffen">Robert C. Giffen</a>, a close support group of heavy cruisers , , and , light cruisers , , and ; escort carriers and ; and eight destroyers. Admiral Giffen commanded TF 18 from "Wichita". A fleet carrier task force—centered on the carrier —steamed about behind TG 62.8 and TF 18. The other fleet carrier and battleship task forces were about farther back. Admiral Giffen, with "Wichita" and the two escort carriers, had just arrived in the Pacific after participating in <a href="Operation%20Torch">Operation Torch</a> in the <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North African Campaign</a>. Also, "Chicago" had just arrived back in the South Pacific, after completing repairs from damage suffered during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Savo%20Island">Battle of Savo Island</a> almost six months before.

In addition to protecting the troop convoy, TF 18 was charged with rendezvousing with a force of four U.S. destroyers, stationed at Tulagi, at 21:00 on 29 January in order to conduct a sweep up "<a href="The%20Slot">The Slot</a>" north of Guadalcanal the next day to screen the unloading of the troop transports at Guadalcanal. However, the escort carriers, under Commodore Ben Wyatt, were too slow () to allow Giffen's force to make the scheduled rendezvous, so Giffen left the carriers behind with two destroyers at 14:00 and pushed on ahead at . Wary of the threat from Japanese submarines, which Allied intelligence indicated were likely in the area, Giffen arranged his cruisers and destroyers for anti-submarine defense, not expecting an air attack. The cruisers were aligned in two columns, spaced apart. "Wichita", "Chicago", and "Louisville", in that order, were to starboard, and "Montpelier", "Cleveland", and "Columbia" were to port. The six destroyers were in a semicircle ahead of the cruiser columns.

Giffen's force was tracked by Japanese submarines, who reported its location and movement. Around mid-afternoon, based on the submarine reports, 16 <a href="Mitsubishi%20G4M">Mitsubishi G4M</a> Type 1 <a href="bomber">bomber</a>s from the 705 Air Group (705AG) and 16 <a href="Mitsubishi%20G3M">Mitsubishi G3M</a> Type 96 bombers from the 701 Air Group (701AG) took off from Rabaul carrying torpedoes to attack Giffen's force. One Type 96 turned back with engine trouble, leaving 31 bombers in the attack force. The leader of the 705AG aircraft was Lieutenant Tomō Nakamura and Lieutenant Commander Joji Hagai commanded the 701AG planes.

At sunset, as TF 18 headed northwest north of Rennell Island and south of Guadalcanal, several of Giffen's ships detected unidentified aircraft on <a href="radar">radar</a> west of their formation. Having previously insisted on absolute radio silence, Giffen gave no orders about what to do about the unidentified contacts, or any orders at all, for that matter. With the setting of the sun, TF 18's <a href="combat%20air%20patrol">combat air patrol</a> (CAP) from the two escort carriers returned to their ships for the night, leaving Giffen's ships without air cover.

The radar contacts were, in fact, the approaching 31 Japanese torpedo bombers, who circled around to the south of TF 18 so that they could attack from the east, with the black backdrop of the eastern sky behind them. From this direction, the Japanese bombers were hidden by the night sky, but Giffen's ships were silhouetted against the twilight of the western horizon. The 705AG aircraft attacked first, beginning at 19:19. Nakamura's aircraft missed with all of their torpedoes and one was shot down by <a href="anti-aircraft%20warfare">anti-aircraft</a> fire from Giffen's ships.

Believing the attack was over, Giffen ordered his ships to cease zigzagging and continue towards Guadalcanal on the same course and at the same speed. Meanwhile, a Japanese reconnaissance aircraft began dropping <a href="flares">flares</a> and floatlights to mark the course and speed of TF 18 for the impending attack by Hagai's bombers.

At 19:38, 701AG attacked, planting two torpedoes in "Chicago", causing heavy damage and bringing the cruiser to a dead stop. Another torpedo hit "Wichita" but did not explode. Two bombers were shot down by anti-aircraft fire, including Hagai's; he was killed. At 20:08, Giffen ordered his ships to reverse direction, to slow to , and to cease firing their anti-aircraft guns. The absence of muzzle flashes concealed the ships from the Japanese aircraft, who all departed the area by 23:35. In pitch darkness, "Louisville" managed to take the crippled "Chicago" under tow and slowly headed south, away from the battle area, escorted by the rest of TF 18.

Halsey immediately took steps to try to protect "<a href="USS%20Chicago%20%28CA-29%29">Chicago</a>", notifying the escort carriers to make sure they had a CAP in place at first light, ordering the "Enterprise" task force to approach and augment the escort carrier CAP, and sending the fleet <a href="tugboat">tug</a> to take over the tow from "Louisville", which was accomplished at 08:00. Between daybreak and 14:00, numerous Japanese scout aircraft approached TF 18. Although they were all chased away by the CAP, they observed and reported the position of "Chicago". At 12:15, a force of 11 Type 1 torpedo bombers from the 751 Air Group (751AG), based at <a href="Kavieng">Kavieng</a> and staging through <a href="Buka%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Buka</a>, launched to attack the damaged U.S. cruiser. An Australian <a href="Coastwatchers">coastwatcher</a> in the Solomon Islands warned the U.S. forces of the bombers, and estimated their arrival time as 16:00. However, Halsey ordered the other cruisers to leave "Chicago" behind and head for <a href="Efate">Efate</a> in the <a href="Vanuatu">New Hebrides</a>. They departed at 15:00, leaving behind six destroyers to protect "Chicago" and "Navajo".

At 15:40, "Enterprise" was away from "Chicago", with ten of her <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a> forming a CAP over the damaged cruiser. At this time, four of the CAP fighters chased and shot down a scout Type 1 bomber. At 15:54, "Enterprise"s radar detected the incoming bomber flight, and launched 10 more fighters. The escort carriers, however, had difficulties in getting their aircraft launched, and their aircraft did not attack the bombers until the engagement was over.
At first, the Japanese bombers appeared to be trying to approach and attack "Enterprise" but turned toward "Chicago" after six "Enterprise" CAP fighters began to engage them. Four other CAP fighters chased the 751AG aircraft as they entered the anti-aircraft fire from "Chicago"s escorting destroyers. Two of the bombers were shot down before they could release their ordnance. Six more were shot down moments later, but not before they dropped their torpedoes.

One torpedo hit the destroyer in her forward engine room, killing 22 of her crew and causing heavy damage. "Chicago" was hit by four torpedoes, one forward of the bridge and three others in her engineering spaces. Captain Ralph O. Davis of "Chicago" ordered the ship to be abandoned, and she sank, stern first, 20 minutes later. "Navajo" and the escorting destroyers rescued 1,049 survivors from "Chicago", but 62 of her crew died. A final attack force of Japanese torpedo bombers failed to find the remaining U.S. ships. "Navajo" took "La Vallette" under tow, and all of the remaining ships of TF 18 made port at Espiritu Santo without further incident.

The Japanese widely publicized the results of the engagement, claiming to have sunk a battleship and three cruisers. The U.S. on the other hand, tried to conceal the loss of "Chicago" from the public for some time, with Admiral <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a> threatening to "shoot" any of his staff who leaked the loss of "Chicago" to the press. Halsey and Nimitz blamed Giffen for the defeat and so stated in Giffen's official performance report for the period. The defeat and resulting recriminations did not affect Giffen's career; he continued to lead Allied battleship and cruiser task forces in the Pacific until 1944 and was later promoted to <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a>.

With Japanese aircraft engaged with TF 18, the Allied transports completed their mission of replacing the remaining Marines on Guadalcanal over the last two days in January 1943. During this time, the other Allied task forces, including the two fleet carrier task forces, took station in the <a href="Coral%20Sea">Coral Sea</a>, in anticipation of an expected Japanese offensive in the southern Solomons.

With TF 18 forced to retreat, very few Allied naval forces were left in the immediate Guadalcanal area, allowing the Japanese to retrieve most of their remaining ground forces from Guadalcanal (<a href="Operation%20Ke">Operation Ke</a>) over three nights between 2 and 7 February 1943. The Allies were not aware of the Japanese withdrawal until it was over, but the evacuation of a small number of starving troops and the loss of one cruiser became a footnote to the securing of Henderson Field and Guadalcanal, which provided the air support springboard to successfully complete the Solomon Islands campaign, a major turning point in the Pacific War.

Uru: Ages Beyond Myst

Uru: Ages Beyond Myst is an <a href="adventure%20game">adventure video game</a> developed by <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> and published by <a href="Ubisoft">Ubisoft</a>. Released in 2003, the title is the fourth game in the <a href="Myst%20%28series%29">"Myst" canon</a>. Departing from previous games of the franchise, "Uru" takes place in the modern era and allows players to customize their onscreen <a href="Avatar%20%28computing%29">avatars</a>. Players use their avatars to explore the abandoned city of an ancient race known as the D'ni, uncover story clues and solve puzzles.

Cyan began developing "Uru" shortly after completing "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>" in 1997, leaving future "Myst" sequels to be produced by third-party developers. "Uru" required five years and $12 million to complete. "Uru" was initially conceived as a multiplayer game; the single-player portion was released, but the multiplayer component, "Uru Live", was delayed and eventually canceled. The online video game service <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a> released the multiplayer portion of "Uru" as "" in February 2007, but the service was canceled again the following year due to a lack of subscribers. GameTap passed the rights to "Uru Live" back to Cyan, who re-launched the game for free in 2010.

"Uru" was not as well received as previous "Myst" titles. Critics admired the visuals and new features of the game but criticized the lack of multiplayer in the retail version and clunky controls. Compared to previous games in the series, which had sold millions of units, "Uru"s sales were considered disappointing. The game was a critical and commercial disappointment for Cyan, causing the company financial troubles; nevertheless, it has attracted a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>.

"Uru: Ages Beyond Myst" is a puzzle-adventure game that takes place in worlds known as Ages. Gameplay can be viewed from <a href="First-person%20shooter">first-</a> and <a href="Third-person%20shooter">third-person</a> perspectives, a departure from other "Myst" titles. Players navigate Ages from the third-person perspective, but can switch to the first-person view for closer inspection of clues and objects. Players in "Uru" can neither pick up objects nor carry an inventory of items; puzzle items must be pushed or kicked into place. The onscreen interface is minimal, having no health meters, maps, or compasses to distract from exploration.

Players create their own <a href="Avatar%20%28computing%29">avatars</a> when beginning the game. Different skin tones, facial features, clothing, and hairstyles are available for customizing these player representations. Players also receive a special linking book, a volume that serves as a portal to a personal world or Age, known as Relto. The main objective of the game is to explore and restore power to other Ages; players must also find seven "journey cloths". These cloths serve as <a href="Saved%20game">save points</a> in lieu of a game-saving option; characters are transported to the last cloth they touched when they restart. As in previous "Myst" games, player characters cannot die. For example, falling off a cliff sends characters back to Relto. The personal Age serves as a hub in "Uru", containing a bookshelf with linking books to Ages players have explored, as well as avatar customization options and game information.

During the course of the game, players uncover clues about the D'ni, an ancient civilization, and the archeological group dedicated to learning more about them, the D'ni Restoration Council. Aspects of the D'ni civilization such as social structure, marriage, and how Ages came about are also imparted as players progress through the Ages. Players may collect Relto pages, which offer cosmetic customization to the player's personal Age—for example, making it rain or adding a waterfall.

"Uru" was originally to ship with a <a href="Massively%20multiplayer%20online%20game">massively multiplayer online</a> component, which was delayed and never integrated into the retail release. Initially branded "Uru Live", the multiplayer portion was designed to allow two or more players to work together to overcome obstacles or complete puzzles. Players would be able to chat in real time and cooperate in specially-designed puzzles. In previews of the multiplayer component, there were three distinct types of Ages. The personal Age provided links to other Ages, which were unlocked by solving puzzles in prerequisite worlds. Neighborhood Ages were analogous to an invite-only party, and City Ages provided places for players to congregate; <a href="IGN">IGN</a> called the Age "a giant lounge".

Uru takes place many years after the events of "". Unlike previous games in the series, "Uru"s story mixes fictional plot elements with real-world events. According to the game's fictional history, archeologists found an entrance to a vast cave system in the 1980s near a volcano in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>. The caves led to an ancient abandoned city built by the enigmatic D'ni civilization. The D'ni practiced an ancient ability known as the Art. By writing a description of another world, the D'ni created "linking books" that served as portals to the worlds described, known as Ages. Soon after making contact with a single human, the entire civilization suddenly disappeared two hundred years ago. In "Uru"s story, the video game "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>" was created when the archeological leaders approached a development studio, <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan</a>, and asked them to create a game to educate the public about the D'ni. "Myst" sold millions of copies, and Cyan continued to produce games based on D'ni findings. In the present day, a group known as the D'ni Restoration Council or DRC reopens the passages to the D'ni caverns and begins to rebuild the abandoned cities.

Players begin "Uru"s story in New Mexico near the Cleft, a deep fissure in the ground near the entrance to the D'ni caverns. A man who introduces himself as Zandi sits in front of his trailer by the Cleft, encouraging the player to discover the environment and join the exploration. The player stumbles across a hologram of a woman, <a href="Characters%20of%20Myst%23Yeesha">Yeesha</a>, who tells the story of the D'ni and requests help to rebuild the civilization.

<a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> began development on its next project after the company finished 1997's "<a href="Riven">Riven</a>", the sequel to the bestselling "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>". The game that became "Uru" would take more than five years and $12 million to complete. While under development, "Uru" was codenamed "DIRT" ("D'ni in real time"), then "MUDPIE" (for "Multi-User DIRT, Persistent / Personal Interactive Entertainment / Experience / Exploration / Environment"). "Uru" was officially announced as "Myst Online", before being renamed "Uru" in early 2003. "Myst" co-creator <a href="Rand%20Miller">Rand Miller</a> released a statement along with an outline of the game:

"Uru" is a revolutionary adventure game that takes the best qualities of the "Myst" franchise and makes them even better. The single-player experience will eclipse the beauty, grandeur, and mind-challenging elements of previous titles. Plus, with the option to join a constantly updated online universe, the adventure never has to end. From new machines and puzzles to special events and entirely new Ages, players will find more to do, more to see, and more to explore each time they return—and this time, they can discover everything with old and new friends.

Miller considered "Uru" a major departure from "Myst" and "Riven" in that Cyan wanted to create a persistent world, where actions occurred while the player was not online. Miller did not consider the game a true <a href="massively%20multiplayer%20online%20game">massively multiplayer online game</a>, saying "there is not leveling and skills and monsters and experience in any artificial sense. The 'leveling' is finding and exploring and owning new Ages that are released regularly; the experience is what you really learn while exploring that will help you later—not points on a scale." Miller considered there to be two benefits to such a system: firstly that players would care more about being part of the story, and secondly that even new players could make discoveries and be part of the community. The game was designed as more of a spin-off than a sequel to previous "Myst" games, due to the merging of items from the contemporary (traffic cones and T-shirts) to the fantastic (books that transport the user to new worlds).

The game was originally conceived as a multiplayer-only game, where players could meet and solve new puzzles that would be added monthly. At the request of publisher Ubisoft, Cyan eventually developed a single-player portion as well. Cyan announced players would be invited to participate in a multiplayer beta test, which drew 10,000 to 40,000 participants. "Uru" was released in November 2003, while the multiplayer portion was delayed. Small groups of players were allowed to come online to test the multiplayer part of the game, and journalists were told they would be invited to play soon after, but "Uru Live" was canceled before being released. Cyan stated that there were not enough projected subscribers to support the service.

After "Uru"s release and "Uru Live"s demise, Cyan announced that new content would be added via expansion packs. The first, "Uru: To D'ni", added the never-released "Uru Live" online content, thus focusing on the past of the D'ni. "Uru: The Path of the Shell", extended the story of "Uru" in the present and added multiple never-before-seen Ages. Unlike the first expansion pack, "Uru: The Path of the Shell" was not free, but was boxed and sold in stores. "Uru", "To Dni", and "The Path of the Shell" were also packaged together and sold as "Uru: Complete Chronicles".

"Uru"s music was composed by <a href="Tim%20Larkin">Tim Larkin</a>, who had started his career at game publisher <a href="Broderbund">Brøderbund</a>, and lobbied hard to be included on "Riven"s development team. Larkin worked on creating different sound effects for "Riven" and was chosen to score "Uru" after composer and "Myst" co-creator <a href="Robyn%20Miller">Robyn Miller</a> left Cyan in early 1998. The music for the game was collected as a soundtrack, "Uru Music", that was released in 2003.

Larkin chose the instrumentation for each track based on the various digital environments in the game. When the player is in the game's representation of New Mexico, for example, Larkin used a <a href="resonator%20guitar">resonator guitar</a> and flutes, creating what he called something "indigenous to a southwest type of feel that's very contemporary". In other areas Larkin described the game's music as being "less typical than you would find in most games" because of the exotic landscape the developers had created. To create contemporary and exotic types of music in the game, Larkin employed a combination of real and synthesized instruments. Sometimes Larkin replaced synthesized performances with those of real musicians, as in the track "Gallery Theme", where a synthesized vocal part was eventually discarded in favor of <a href="soprano">soprano</a> Tasha Koontz. To create an exotic feel, Larkin used a group of <a href="Maasai%20people">Maasai</a> tribesmen's chanting, who were recorded during their visit to <a href="Spokane%2C%20Washington">Spokane, Washington</a>, where <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> was located at that time.

The "Uru" soundtrack received two Game Audio Network Guild (G.A.N.G.) nominations in 2004—one for "Best Original Vocal Song (Choral)" for the "Gallery Theme" (which won), and another for "Best Original Soundtrack." Beyond its use in Uru, "Gallery Theme" was later used in the theatrical trailer for Steven Spielberg's film, "<a href="Munich%20%28film%29">Munich</a>". The "Uru" soundtrack comes on an <a href="enhanced%20CD">enhanced CD</a>, containing a (nearly) four-minute music video called "Uru: The Makers" and an audio-only interview with Rand Miller and Tim Larkin.

To compensate for the cancellation of "Uru Live", Cyan published all the developed online content as single-player expansion packs. Meanwhile, a small group of dedicated fans, many of them the "Uru Live" beta testers, were allowed to maintain their unofficial servers, called "shards". Cyan released binaries of the original "Uru Live" servers under the banner "Until Uru" and coordinated with the fan shards so that players could verify their authentication keys, necessary to play the game. The shards were often unstable and no new content was released; rather, they provided a place for fans to socialize. In February 2006, Cyan opened their own official shard, called D'mala, open at no charge to "Uru" owners, though an invitation from the community was required. Miller revealed in a letter to fans that Cyan had received "limited funding from a third party that allows us to breathe some refreshing new life and optimism into all things "Uru"." As with the fan-operated servers, D'mala would feature no new content, instead allowing Cyan staff called "surveyors" to interact with fans and gather information.

In April 2006, <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a> announced it was relaunching "Uru Live" as "". A major reason for the resurrection of the game was the fan support. According to GameTap's vice president of content Ricardo Sanchez, "One of the reasons [GameTap was] so attracted to "Uru Live" is that it had this persistent group that kept it alive during the dark days of its absence." While Cyan devoted its time to "Myst Online", it promised not to shut down "Until Uru" in the meantime, although it would offer no new authentication keys. GameTap released "Myst Online" in February 2007. A Macintosh version, using the <a href="TransGaming%20Technologies%23Cider">Cider</a> translation layer engine so that Intel-processor Macs did not need a Windows installation to run the game, was released in March. At the time, "Myst Online" was the only Mac-compatible game on GameTap. New content for the game was released in the form of online "episodes", adding new Ages, puzzles, and plot continuation with each episode. For business reasons GameTap announced in February 2008 that the game would go offline in April; Cyan reacquired the rights to the game and announced that it would give the "Myst Online" source code and tools to the fans, making the game an <a href="Open-source%20software">open-source project</a>.
In 2010, <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> released the game free of charge, under the name "Myst Online: Uru Live again" ("MO:ULagain"). It is currently hosted on Cyan-maintained servers.

In 2011, <a href="Cyan%20Worlds">Cyan Worlds</a> and OpenUru.org announced the release of "Myst Online"s client and 3ds Max plugin under the GNU GPL v3 license.

Initial reception to "Uru" was generally positive, but less so than previous games in the series. The game has average critic scores of 79/100 and 76.19% from aggregate web sites <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> and <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a>, respectively. Though "Uru" was a departure from previous "Myst" titles, the differences were usually praised. "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>"s Lisa Mason said "Uru" "successfully updated" the adventure game genre. The visuals and music were highly praised, and GameZone called the world of the D'ni beautifully rendered and brilliantly designed. Newspapers appreciated the contrast "Uru" offered from violence-filled contemporary games.

The game's third-person controls and the addition of instant failures by falling were not well received. Denise Cook of "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>" called the third person option "choked" and "quirky". While Cook appreciated the added depth and immersion provided by the real-time rendering, she found incidents such as slipping off rocks, falling into lava, and plummeting into canyons irksome additions to the previously stress-free "Myst" formula. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>'s Carla Harker found several puzzles highly difficult solely due to the poorly implemented control scheme which "never becomes intuitive". "Computer Gaming World"s Robert Coffey and Cook considered the plot of the single-player release minimal and forgettable.

A major critic complaint about "Uru" was that the game did not ship with the multiplayer component. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>'s Andrew Park questioned why the game shipped with the multiplayer element open only for select players when the component had previously been beta-tested. GameSpy was disappointed that the feature advertised on the box and in the game manual was not available in the product. Reviewer Bob Mandel found that the most disappointing part of the dropped multiplayer game was that "as you progress through the game, a number of tantalizing clues emerge of places you can go and activities you can undertake only through the promised online mode."

"Uru"s sales were considered disappointing, whereas the first three "Myst" games had sold more than 12 million units collectively before "Uru"s release. Among computer games, <a href="The%20NPD%20Group">The NPD Group</a> ranked "Uru" ninth for the weeks ending November 22 and December 6, and 13th for the month of December 2003 overall. In North America, the game sold 78,329 units during 2003, and another 18,860 during the first two months of 2004. Although it sold between 100,000 and 400,000 copies in the United States by August 2006, it was beaten by "Myst III: Exile"s sales in the region. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine pointed to "Uru"s relative failure as evidence the franchise had lost its touch, a notion the developers of "" sought to dispel. "Uru"s poor sales were also considered a factor in financially burdening Cyan, contributing to the company's near-closure in 2005. The title's original graphics and story nevertheless attracted a cult following.

"Uru: Ages Beyond Myst" won "<a href="PC%20Gamer%20US">PC Gamer US</a>"s 2003 "Best Adventure Game" and "Best Sound" awards. The magazine's Chuck Osborn called it "the future of the genre" and "an exhilarating innovation". "<a href="Computer%20Games%20Magazine">Computer Games Magazine</a>" presented "Uru" with its "Best Art Direction" award, for which it tied with "<a href="Tron%202.0">Tron 2.0</a>". The game was nominated in "<a href="EP%20Daily">The Electric Playground</a>"s "Best Adventure Game for PC" category, but lost this prize to "<a href="Beyond%20Good%20%26amp%3B%20Evil%20%28video%20game%29">Beyond Good & Evil</a>".

He also contributed to albums by <a href="Charles%20Douglas%20%28musician%29">Charles Douglas</a> and former Pixies band-mate <a href="Frank%20Black">Frank Black</a>. Santiago resumed his role as the Pixies' lead guitarist when they reunited in 2004.

Santiago has described his guitar technique as "angular and bent", and he cites <a href="Les%20Paul">Les Paul</a>, <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a>, <a href="Chet%20Atkins">Chet Atkins</a>, <a href="Wes%20Montgomery">Wes Montgomery</a>, <a href="Joe%20Pass">Joe Pass</a> and <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a> as major influences on his style.

Santiago was born in <a href="Manila">Manila</a>, <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, on June 10, 1965, the third of six sons of an <a href="anesthesiologist">anesthesiologist</a>. In 1972, when <a href="Ferdinand%20Marcos">President Marcos</a> declared martial law, the family immigrated to the United States. After two years in <a href="Yonkers%2C%20New%20York">Yonkers, New York</a>, the family moved to <a href="Longmeadow%2C%20Massachusetts">Longmeadow, Massachusetts</a>, where Santiago attended <a href="Longmeadow%20High%20School">Longmeadow High School</a> and graduated from <a href="Wilbraham%20%26amp%3B%20Monson%20Academy">Wilbraham & Monson Academy</a> in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a <a href="Hammond%20organ">Hammond organ</a> at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother's wall for decoration. The first song he learned to play was <a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground">The Velvet Underground</a>'s "Rock and Roll".

As a teenager, Santiago became interested in computer programming, naming his first program "Iggy" and his second "Pop" after <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>er <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a>. He participated in a cycle ride across the United States in aid of charity, but on completing it did not bother to collect the sponsor's money.

After graduating from high school in 1983, Santiago studied at the <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. He remained without a major as long as the university would permit him to, but eventually chose <a href="economics">economics</a>. He met <a href="Frank%20Black">Charles Thompson</a>, an anthropology student and the future <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a> frontman, after he heard Thompson and his roommate playing their guitars. Santiago rushed home to collect his guitar, and was soon playing "non-blues-scale, non-cover-song rock" with Thompson.

Santiago and Thompson shared a room at the start of the second semester. Santiago soon introduced his new roommate to <a href="Punk%20rock%23Early%20history">1970s punk</a> and the music of <a href="David%20Bowie">David Bowie</a>. He later recalled their time together in college: "Charles and I had a suite at the college dorm. We'd go to shows, I remember seeing <a href="Black%20Flag%20%28band%29">Black Flag</a> and Angst. Initially, I think we just liked each other. I did notice right away that he was playing music ... He'd write 'em [the songs], and I'd throw my ideas on the guitar." In their second year of college, Thompson traveled to <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> as an exchange student. After six months there living with a "weird, psycho roommate," Thompson sent Santiago a letter with the words "We gotta do it, now is the time, Joe, we gotta chase our dreams"; Santiago replied, saying "Yes, now's the time." Upon receiving this reply, Thompson decided to return to <a href="Amherst%2C%20Massachusetts">Amherst</a> to start a rock band with Santiago.

Upon Thompson's return to Massachusetts, the pair dropped out of college and moved to Boston. They both took temporary jobs in warehouses, with Santiago working for a butcher block company. In January 1986, Thompson formed the Pixies with Santiago. Thompson gave Santiago the choice of <a href="bass%20guitar">bass</a> or <a href="lead%20guitar">lead guitar</a>; Santiago chose to play lead. The pair arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word randomly from a dictionary and liked the definition, "mischievous little elves." They recruited <a href="Kim%20Deal">Kim Deal</a> a week later after placing a classified ad in a Boston paper for a bassist "into <a href="H%C3%BCsker%20D%C3%BC">Hüsker Dü</a> and <a href="Peter%2C%20Paul%20and%20Mary">Peter, Paul and Mary</a>." Drummer <a href="David%20Lovering">David Lovering</a> was later hired on recommendation from Deal's husband.

The Pixies rehearsed throughout 1986, and began performing around Boston in late 1986 and during 1987. Santiago met his future wife, <a href="Linda%20Mallari">Linda Mallari</a>, when he sat beside her after a 1987 Pixies show at <a href="The%20Rathskeller">The Rat</a>. Mallari noted their shared Filipino ancestry and suggested they write music together. She then offered to join the Pixies, but Santiago replied, "We already have a chick in the band." Throughout Santiago's time with the Pixies, the two often met up to write songs and drink martinis, but they did not release any material. According to Santiago, they "broke up a couple of times" early in their relationship.

The Pixies signed to the English <a href="independent%20record%20label">independent record label</a> <a href="4AD">4AD</a> in 1987. On meeting the head of the label, <a href="Ivo%20Watts-Russell">Ivo Watts-Russell</a>, Santiago remarked: "All I care about is that you make me famous in the Philippines because all the chicks are really pretty". Watts-Russell later said "that's probably all I ever heard Joey really say," and by that time, Santiago's quietness had been noted by those close to the band. The Pixies' first release, "<a href="Come%20On%20Pilgrim">Come On Pilgrim</a>", featured his trademark angular lead guitar on tracks such as "The Holiday Song" and "Vamos".

After the band's next two albums, "<a href="Surfer%20Rosa">Surfer Rosa</a>" (1988) and "<a href="Doolittle%20%28album%29">Doolittle</a>" (1989), the relationship between the band members became strained; the Pixies were constantly touring and had released three albums in two years. During their homecoming Boston concert, on the post-"Doolittle" "Fuck or Fight" tour, Santiago smashed up his instrument and stormed offstage. The band announced a break soon afterwards. During this time, Santiago visited the <a href="Grand%20Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> to "find himself." After the band reconvened in 1990, Santiago contributed to the band's later releases, "<a href="Bossanova%20%28Pixies%20album%29">Bossanova</a>" (1990) and "<a href="Trompe%20le%20Monde">Trompe le Monde</a>" (1991), adopting a surf guitar style in the former. The Pixies eventually broke up in 1992, mostly due to tensions between Francis and Deal, although the breakup was not publicly announced until 1993.

After the breakup of the Pixies, Santiago went into a depression for the first couple of years but remained on good terms with bandmate Black Francis (who soon adopted the name Frank Black). Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, "<a href="Frank%20Black%20%28album%29">Frank Black</a>", contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including "<a href="Teenager%20of%20the%20Year%20%28album%29">Teenager of the Year</a>" (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album "Mangled". He also formed <a href="The%20Martinis">The Martinis</a> a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded "Free" (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of "<a href="Empire%20Records">Empire Records</a>". The band played live only occasionally until 2001.

In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including "<a href="Crime%20and%20Punishment%20in%20Suburbia">Crime and Punishment in Suburbia</a>" in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the <a href="Fox%20Network">Fox Network</a> TV series "<a href="Undeclared">Undeclared</a>" with <a href="Michael%20Andrews%20%28musician%29">Michael Andrews</a>. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with <a href="Alex%20McAulay">Charles Douglas</a> on his 2004 album "Statecraft". He scored the 2003 film "The Low Budget Time Machine" and wrote two songs, "Birthday Video" and "Fake Purse," for the Showtime television series "<a href="Weeds%20%28TV%20series%29">Weeds</a>" in 2005.

Mallari and Santiago continued to write new material as part of the Martinis, but no longer played live. Their debut album, "<a href="Smitten%20%28The%20Martinis%20album%29">Smitten</a>", took two years to write and was released in 2004; the pair collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer <a href="Josh%20Freese">Josh Freese</a>, during the recording. Santiago described the album as "a lot poppier and quirkier" than the band's previous material. The band simultaneously released "The Smitten Sessions", a limited edition <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a>.

After the Pixies broke up in 1993, Santiago had stayed in touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later explained: "He called me on my cellphone and I was in <a href="Cape%20Cod">Cape Cod</a> visiting family. He said in this coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, I wonder who started it?' I go, 'Charles, did you do that?' and he goes, 'Yeah.'" Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and by the summer of 2004 the band had reunited. <a href="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the "<a href="Shrek%202">Shrek 2</a>" soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, "worked it up a bit in Joey's <a href="Pro%20Tools">Pro Tools</a> thing", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, "<a href="Bam%20Thwok">Bam Thwok</a>".

Aside from the Pixies and The Martinis, Santiago scored the soundtrack of the documentary "<a href="Radiant%20City">Radiant City</a>" in 2006. He signed with the commercial sound agency Elias Arts in the same year, and focused on composing music for television commercials. In a March 2006 Billboard.com interview, he dismissed the possibility of a new Pixies album for the time being: "I'd only be interested if it happens in an organic manner; if all our schedules are aligned and we're all feeling it. That's the only reason to do it." Santiago also played a benefit concert for drummer <a href="Wally%20Ingram">Wally Ingram</a> in February 2007 as part of The Martinis; the band's first gig for six years.

Santiago describes his guitar playing as "angular and bent," "all derived from guitar moments that perk my ears up". Notable in his style is how he uses distortion and feedback to leave spaces open. A good example is the intro of There Goes My Gun. He attributes much of his style to songs he enjoyed when first learning the guitar, such as <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' "<a href="Savoy%20Truffle">Savoy Truffle</a>", where "George Harrison played that bent note that I fell in love with and later milked it for all it was worth." He used such techniques with the Pixies: "<a href="Doolittle%20%28album%29">Doolittle's</a>" "Dead" begins with Santiago's guitar "squawking" on an E-flat like "a wounded animal". As Santiago was learning the guitar, he saw himself as a self-conscious amateur, and still speaks of a lack of confidence in his playing.

Santiago, rather than listening to popular radio, borrowed <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> records from the public library as he was growing up; he first discovered <a href="Les%20Paul">Les Paul</a> and <a href="Jimi%20Hendrix">Jimi Hendrix</a>, who led to jazz guitarist <a href="Wes%20Montgomery">Wes Montgomery</a>. Santiago later commented on Montgomery's influence: "And that's when I said, 'Ah, that's a hook. That's some hooky stuff in the jazz world'". He discovered jazz and <a href="country%20music">country</a> artists such as <a href="Joe%20Pass">Joe Pass</a> and <a href="Chet%20Atkins">Chet Atkins</a> after studying the liner notes of albums. Santiago was directly influenced by the "<a href="Hendrix%20chord">Hendrix chord</a>", the sharp 9th dominant chord which, in the words of author Ben Sisario, "tapped a hidden rage that matched the horror of Thompson's scream". As a teenager, Santiago also listened to classic rock and <a href="protopunk">protopunk</a> artists such as <a href="The%20Who">The Who</a>, <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a>, <a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground">The Velvet Underground</a> and <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a>.

The stage antics of Santiago often contrasted with his generally quiet demeanor; he often experimented with his guitar and equipment during songs. Deal's husband, John Murphy, said that during performances of "Vamos", which features guitar feedback throughout, Santiago used to "whack the crap out of his amp", often picking up the amplifier and moving it around. During some solos, Santiago would often pull the guitar up to his mouth and break guitar strings with his teeth.

As on September 16, 2016, Pixies announced via their social media accounts that Joey Santiago had checked into a rehabilitation center to treat his alcohol and drug issues.

Pulaski Skyway

The Pulaski Skyway is a four-lane <a href="bridge">bridge</a>-<a href="causeway">causeway</a> in the <a href="Gateway%20Region">northeastern part</a> of the U.S. state of <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>, carrying an <a href="freeway">expressway</a> designated <a href="U.S.%20Route%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B1/9">U.S. Route 1/9</a> (US 1/9) for most of its length. The landmark structure has a total length of . Its longest bridge spans . Traveling between <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark</a> and <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City</a>, the roadway crosses the <a href="Passaic%20River">Passaic</a> and <a href="Hackensack%20River">Hackensack</a> rivers, <a href="Kearny%20Point">Kearny Point</a>, the peninsula between them, and the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Meadowlands">New Jersey Meadowlands</a>.

Designed by <a href="Sigvald%20Johannesson">Sigvald Johannesson</a>, the <a href="Casimir%20Pulaski">General Casimir Pulaski</a> Skyway opened in 1932 as the last part of the <a href="Route%201%20Extension">Route 1 Extension</a>, one of the first <a href="controlled-access%20highway">controlled-access highway</a>s or "super-highways" in the United States, to provide a connection to the <a href="Holland%20Tunnel">Holland Tunnel</a>. One of several major projects built during the reign of <a href="Hudson%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hudson County</a> political boss <a href="Frank%20Hague">Frank Hague</a>, its construction was a source of political and labor disputes. The viaduct is listed in the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">state</a> and <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">federal</a> registers of historic places.

Unpredictable traffic congestion and its <a href="functionally%20obsolete">functionally obsolete</a> design make the Skyway one of the most unreliable roads in the United States. , the bridges handle about 74,000 crossings per day, none of which were by trucks since they had been barred from the road in 1934. The bridges have been altered little since opening. In 2007, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Department%20of%20Transportation">New Jersey Department of Transportation</a> (NJDOT) began a rehabilitation program, which it estimated would cost more than $1 billion and required intermittent closures. The Skyway was closed to eastbound traffic from 2014 to 2018.

Sources differ on the length and terminal points of the skyway, which was built as part of the long . The <a href="National%20Bridge%20Inventory">National Bridge Inventory</a> identifies the <a href="Hudson%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hudson County</a> section as long and the <a href="Essex%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Essex County</a> section as . In a historic roadway and bridge study for NJDOT, it was described as long. NJDOT has indicated the overall length of the bridge structures to be and identified the Hudson County section as long. Other sources, along with the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", and "<a href="The%20Star-Ledger">The Star-Ledger</a>", describe it as being long.

The four-lane iconic skyway carries the <a href="U.S.%20Route%201/9">US 1/9</a> <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrency</a> for most its length. While the skyway generally runs east–west between Newark and Jersey City, <a href="U.S.%20Route%201%20in%20New%20Jersey">US 1</a> and <a href="U.S.%20Route%209%20in%20New%20Jersey">US 9</a> are generally north–south routes. The west end of the skyway begins as US 1/9 roadway ascends and passes over <a href="Raymond%20Boulevard">Raymond Boulevard</a> in Newark's <a href="Ironbound">Ironbound</a> neighborhood. At <a href="Tonnele%20Circle">Tonnele Circle</a>, US 1/9 exits to grade and follows Tonnele Avenue north towards the <a href="Lincoln%20Tunnel">Lincoln Tunnel</a> and <a href="George%20Washington%20Bridge">George Washington Bridge</a> and the skyway becomes the four-lane <a href="New%20Jersey%20Route%20139">Route 139</a> as it passes over it. While the road continues to the <a href="Holland%20Tunnel">Holland Tunnel</a>, the skyway soon comes to its eastern end at a <a href="cut%20%28earthmoving%29">cut</a> in <a href="Bergen%20Hill">Bergen Hill</a>, just west of <a href="County%20Route%20501%20%28New%20Jersey%29">John F. Kennedy Boulevard</a>. In addition to crossing the Hackensack and the Passaic, the skyway also passes over the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Turnpike">New Jersey Turnpike</a>, with which it has no interchange. Under most of the skyway is other vehicular, rail, maritime, and industrial infrastructure built on <a href="land%20reclamation">landfilled</a> <a href="wetlands">wetlands</a> of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Meadowlands">New Jersey Meadowlands</a>.

Some maps, including one of Newark (1938) and one of Elizabeth (1967), labeled the US 1/9 southern approach starting north of <a href="Newark%20Liberty%20International%20Airport">Newark Airport</a> as the Pulaski Skyway. An NJDOT single line diagram (2010) shows the General Pulaski Skyway starting at mile post 49.00, which is just north of the renamed <a href="Newark%20Liberty%20International%20Airport">Newark Liberty International Airport</a>. <a href="Google%20Maps">Google Maps</a> includes the Route 139 eastern approach.

There is limited intermediate access to the skyway: two single-lane ramps rise to the inner lanes of the elevated structure, requiring traffic to enter or exit from the left providing access at the <a href="Marion%20Section">Marion Section</a> (southbound entrance and northbound exit only) of Jersey City and <a href="South%20Kearny%2C%20New%20Jersey">South Kearny</a> (northbound entrance and southbound exit only).

Trucks have been prohibited for the "safety and welfare of the public" since 1934 because of the state's approval of a local ordinance that was championed by <a href="Frank%20Hague">Frank Hague</a>, mayor of Jersey City. They are detoured to use <a href="U.S.%20Route%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B1/9%20Truck">U.S. Route 1/9 Truck</a>, along the <a href="Route%20of%20the%20Lincoln%20Highway%23New%20Jersey">route of the Lincoln Highway</a> that carried traffic before the skyway's construction. Pedestrians and cyclists cannot use the road as there are no dedicated bicycle lanes or <a href="sidewalk">sidewalk</a>s. The speed limit on the skyway is , but is generally not enforceable as there is nowhere for police to pull over speeders because of the absence of shoulders.

In 2011, the <a href="Texas%20Transportation%20Institute">Texas Transportation Institute</a> determined that the Skyway was the sixth-most unreliable road in the United States because of the unpredictability of traffic congestion and therefore travel times.

Except for crossings over Jersey City rail lines and the <a href="Hackensack%20River">Hackensack</a> and the <a href="Passaic%20River">Passaic</a>, the main part of the skyway is a steel <a href="deck%20truss">deck truss</a> <a href="cantilever%20bridge">cantilever bridge</a>, supported by concrete <a href="pier%20%28architecture%29">piers</a>. Each of the two river crossings is a combination of a subdivided (K-shaped) <a href="through%20truss">through</a> <a href="Pratt%20truss">Pratt truss</a> between the supports and a basic Pratt truss structure connecting each end to the deck truss part of the skyway. Spanning the rivers, they reach a clearance height of . In Jersey City, three short Pratt through truss spans take the roadway over rail lines, the westernmost passing over the <a href="PATH%20%28rail%20system%29">Port Authority Trans-Hudson</a> (PATH) <a href="rapid%20transit">rapid transit</a> line and the <a href="North%20Jersey%20Shared%20Assets%20Area">Conrail</a> <a href="Passaic%20and%20Harsimus%20Line">Passaic and Harsimus Line</a>. The two easternmost Pratt through truss spans are in the vicinity of <a href="Marion%20Junction%20%28New%20Jersey%29">Marion Junction</a>, one of which passes over the <a href="Marion%20Running%20Track">Marion Running Track</a>, to the east of which the skyway is low enough to use simple vertical supports.

Design began in 1919 for the <a href="Holland%20Tunnel">Holland Tunnel</a>, the first fixed roadway connection between New Jersey and New York City; construction began in 1922, and the tunnel opened in late 1927. To provide for a continuous highway connection on the New Jersey side, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Legislature">New Jersey Legislature</a> passed a bill in 1922 authorizing the extension of <a href="Route%201%20%28New%20Jersey%20pre-1927%29">Route 1</a> from its end at <a href="Elizabeth%2C%20NJ">Elizabeth</a> through Newark and Jersey City to the proposed tunnel. It was conceived as the nation's first <a href="controlled-access%20highway">"super-highway"</a>. State highway engineer <a href="Hugh%20L.%20Sloan">Hugh L. Sloan</a> appointed old acquaintance <a href="Fred%20Lavis">Fred Lavis</a>, a consulting engineer who had worked on foreign rail lines and the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> and written four books on locating and designing rail lines, to design this <a href="Route%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B1%20Extension">Route 1 Extension</a>. Sigvald Johannesson designed the Skyway portion.

<a href="Frank%20Hague">Frank Hague</a>, mayor of Jersey City and boss of the state's <a href="political%20machine">political machine</a>, directed the state to avoid the <a href="Cut%20%28earthmoving%29">open cuts</a> that were already common where the railroads crossed <a href="Bergen%20Hill">Bergen Hill</a>, and to include an access ramp in Kearny to spur industrial development. Construction of the highway, which was mostly raised on <a href="Embankment%20%28transportation%29">embankments</a> and passed through Bergen Hill in a cut, began in mid-1925. The two major eastern and western sections in Jersey City and Newark—including the <a href="viaduct">viaduct</a> leading to the "covered roadway" (<a href="New%20Jersey%20Route%20139">Route 139</a>) and the embankments in eastern Newark—were opened on December 16, 1928, about a year after the tunnel opened. Traffic was still required to use the <a href="Route%20of%20the%20Lincoln%20Highway%23New%20Jersey">Lincoln Highway</a> to cross the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway%20Hackensack%20River%20Bridge">Hackensack</a> and the <a href="Lincoln%20Highway%20Passaic%20River%20Bridge">Passaic</a> on the since replaced <a href="moveable%20bridge">drawbridges</a> that frequently stopped traffic to allow ships to pass.
Lavis's design for the final viaduct passageway, which would be raised on concrete piers across the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Meadowlands">Meadowlands</a>, included two <a href="vertical-lift%20bridge">vertical-lift bridge</a>s above the Passaic and Hackensack rivers, sufficient for the majority of ships to pass underneath. He resigned in 1928, believing his task was complete, but in January 1929 the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> objected to the continued existence of the Lincoln Highway bridges once the skyway was complete. Since the Route 1 Extension was not intended for local traffic, and replacing the vertical-lift bridges with tunnels would have been expensive, a compromise was worked out by late 1929 to raise the river bridges to while allowing the Lincoln Highway drawbridges to remain in place. The concrete jacketing of the steel was removed from the plans since it would make the taller <a href="Bridge%23Fixed%20or%20movable%20bridges">fixed bridges</a> heavier. This resulted in more maintenance.

Four companies—the <a href="American%20Bridge%20Company">American Bridge Company</a>, <a href="McClintic-Marshall%20Company">McClintic-Marshall Company</a>, <a href="Phoenix%20Bridge%20Company">Phoenix Bridge Company</a>, and <a href="Taylor-Fichter%20Steel%20Construction%20Company">Taylor-Fichter Steel Construction Company</a>—were awarded contracts for the so-called "Diagonal Highway", with construction to start in April 1930. The two river bridges, McClintic-Marshall's portion, were completed first, and the $21 million road was opened at 8:00 a.m. on November 24, 1932, after an official ceremony the previous day on the Kearny ramp. Owing to the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> and problems with funding, Governor <a href="A.%20Harry%20Moore">A. Harry Moore</a> directed the Highway Commission on October 25, 1932 to make a formal request to the <a href="U.S.%20Bureau%20of%20Public%20Roads">U.S. Bureau of Public Roads</a> to charge tolls on the Diagonal Highway. It was thought that tolls would be illegal because of the use of $600,000 of federal aid to build the road, but that it might be possible to transfer this funding to other projects. A bill was introduced into the state legislature on May 1, 1933, to add tolls to the road (then known as the "sky way"), at a rate of 10 cents for cars and 20 cents for trucks. The legal obstacle to federal aid was resolved by gaining approval to transfer the funds.
During planning and construction, and for about half a year after opening, the road had no official name and was known as the Diagonal Highway, Newark–Jersey City Viaduct, or High-Level Viaduct. On May 3, 1933, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Legislature">New Jersey Legislature</a> passed a bill sponsored by Assemblyman Eugene W. Hejke of Jersey City naming the road the General Casimir Pulaski Memorial Skyway after <a href="Casimir%20Pulaski">Casimir Pulaski</a>, the Polish military leader who helped train and lead <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> troops in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. An official ceremony was held on October 11, 1933, including the unveiling of signs with an abbreviated designation, Gen. Pulaski Skyway.

Surveys taken during 1932 and 1933 proved that the skyway saved time on the new and old routes. Not only was the distance shortened by , but it took at least six minutes less to travel the new route during regular traffic. Trucks gained even more time, saving anywhere from five to eleven minutes. During times of previous traffic congestion on weekends on the old route, the viaduct saved around 25 minutes or more from the elimination of traffic congestion. In addition, the new route did not have the much longer delays and traffic back-ups that were caused whenever the bridges on the old highway were opened. It was found that the skyway also diverted a good deal of traffic from other routes.

Pulaski Skyway construction ended up causing a dispute between <a href="Mayor%20of%20Jersey%20City">Mayor of Jersey City</a> <a href="Frank%20Hague">Frank Hague</a>, who ran a statewide political machine, and <a href="Theodore%20M.%20Brandle">Theodore M. Brandle</a>, a "<a href="labor%20czar">labor czar</a>" allied with Hague. Brandle and Hague had become friends through Hague's efforts to get approval of unions. Brandle helped organize <a href="Branleygran%20Company">Branleygran Company</a>, a <a href="construction%20bond">construction bond</a> <a href="underwriter">underwriter</a>, which Hague channeled construction projects towards. During the mid-1920s redevelopment of <a href="Journal%20Square">Journal Square</a>, Brandle's Labor National Bank, founded in June 1926, acquired a new 15-story headquarters, the <a href="Labor%20Bank%20Building">Labor Bank Building</a>. Essentially Brandle controlled any construction projects in northern New Jersey, and any strikes he might call would be backed by Hague's police.

The relationship between Hague and Brandle started to go bad in late 1931, during construction of <a href="Beacon%2C%20Jersey%20City">Jersey City Medical Center</a>, an important project to Hague. Leo Brennan, a contractor approved by Hague without consulting Brandle, who was building a backup power station for the hospital, refused to work with Brandle's card-file system, by which he kept track of union members and blacklisted those whom he disliked. The annoyed Brandle called a strike, but Brennan's workers refused; the police shut down the site after a brawl, but Brennan got court approval to continue. To placate Brandle, who threatened a strike that would stop all construction work on the center, Hague paid off Brennan and hired another contractor that Brandle had approved.

For the construction of the Pulaski Skyway, which began in April 1930, Hague chose four members of the <a href="National%20Erectors%27%20Association">National Erectors' Association</a>, an organization of "<a href="open%20shop">open shop</a>" (anti-union) steel contractors. Performance bonds were paid in cash, bypassing Branleygran, and the companies hired Foster's Industrial and Detective Bureau to guard the site against Brandle's threat to "unionize this job or else". Brandle organized <a href="picketing%20%28protest%29">picket line</a>s of loyal union men, and the two sides frequently fought in the streets or in the work area. Brandle's sole victory was a five-day stoppage in July 1931 by 165 non-union workers, who were interested in higher pay and afraid of the ongoing fights, but decided against joining the union. During the <a href="La%20Follette%20Committee">La Follette Civil Liberties Committee</a> hearings, it was discovered that, in order to save about $50,000 in salary, the <a href="American%20Bridge%20Company">American Bridge Company</a>, one of the four contractors, spent almost $300,000 on keeping its "open shop".
The first casualty of the labor battle was a picketer, shot and temporarily paralyzed by a perimeter guard on November 14, 1931, for throwing stones at workers. Several months later, on February 27, 1932, a car carrying six workers to the construction site was surrounded by union men, who began to beat them with iron bars. One of the workers, William T. Harrison, was dead by the next morning; Hague broke all ties with Brandle and ordered the police to "wage relentless war against the Brandle gang-rioters". In April 1932, 21 ironworkers were indicted as suspects in the Harrison murder. The trial was held on December 6, 1932, two weeks after the completion of the skyway. Every defendant was found not guilty, since county prosecutor John Drewen was unable to place any of them at the scene of the crime, and witnesses and defendants testified that they had been forced under torture or the threat of prosecution to sign <a href="affidavit">affidavit</a>s and <a href="confession%20%28legal%29">confessions</a>. In addition to William T. Harrison's death, 14 lives were claimed by work-related accidents during construction.

Hague refused to allow Brandle and the unions to win, and began to force unions to <a href="foreclose">foreclose</a> through his control of the courts. On the public side, Hague attacked the "labor racketeers" with words, and the local newspapers gladly went along. In 1937 and 1938, Hague turned Jersey City into a <a href="police%20state">police state</a> to fight the <a href="Congress%20of%20Industrial%20Organizations">Congress of Industrial Organizations</a> (CIO), which was trying to inform workers of their rights under the 1935 <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Act">National Labor Relations Act</a>. Socialist <a href="Norman%20Thomas">Norman Thomas</a> was prevented from speaking in Jersey City and Newark by Hague and his friends. This and other similar cases turned the national spotlight on Hague, and he was attacked by the "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">New Yorker</a>" and "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" in early 1938. Finally, in 1947, Governor <a href="Alfred%20E.%20Driscoll">Alfred E. Driscoll</a> cut off Hague's judicial power, and the mayor retired.

The slippery concrete surfacing, steep left-side ramps, center <a href="breakdown%20lane">breakdown lane</a>, and wide-open alignment built for high speeds all contributed to a high number of crashes. Mayor <a href="Frank%20Hague">Frank Hague</a> of Jersey City passed an ordinance in November 1933 banning trucks from its section of the skyway, which effectively banned them from the whole road. Enforcement began on January 15, 1934, when Jersey City police began arresting truck drivers using the skyway. The <a href="New%20Jersey%20State%20Highway%20Commission">New Jersey State Highway Commission</a> approved the ban on January 23.

As a result of controversy caused by the ban, 300,000 ballots were distributed on February 6 to motorists on the skyway, asking whether trucks should be banned. Mayor Hague promised to go with the majority, which agreed with the ban. The matter was also taken to court, with one of the convicted truck drivers arguing that the ban was an unreasonable restraint of <a href="interstate%20commerce">interstate commerce</a>, and that since the federal government contributed money towards the road, Jersey City lacked the power to ban trucks. On August 14, Justice <a href="Thomas%20Whitaker%20Trenchard">Thomas W. Trenchard</a> of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Supreme%20Court">New Jersey Supreme Court</a> upheld the ban, stating that "the court is not at liberty to substitute its judgment for that of the municipality's as to the best and most feasible manner of curing traffic evils and traffic congestion where such regulation bears a direct relationship to public safety and is reasonable and not arbitrary." The Tonnele Circle Viaduct, a new offramp allowing westbound trucks from the Holland Tunnel to bypass <a href="Tonnele%20Circle">Tonnele Circle</a> to southbound <a href="U.S.%20Route%201/9%20Truck">US 1/9 Truck</a>, which now also leads to <a href="Interstate%20280%20%28New%20Jersey%29">Interstate 280</a> (I-280), opened on September 14, 1938. The <a href="Newark%20Bay%20Extension%20of%20the%20New%20Jersey%20Turnpike">Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike</a> (<a href="I-78%20%28NJ%29">I-78</a>) opened in September 1956, allowing trucks to bypass the old surface road, US 1/9 Truck.

On May 21, 1952, large numbers of trucks were spotted by Jersey City police entering the city on the skyway. Upon pulling over the drivers, they were told that the exit in <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark</a> for the truck route was closed for construction. A call to Newark police confirmed the situation. <a href="Hudson%20County%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hudson County</a> police refused to force trucks to exit before Jersey City, since there was no state law banning trucks from the skyway. Jersey City Police Chief James McNamara gave in, and trucks were temporarily allowed to use the skyway, though only in one direction.
When the skyway first opened, it carried five lanes; the center one was intended as a breakdown lane, but was used as a <a href="Reversible%20Lane%23Passing%20lanes">"suicide lane"</a> for passing slower traffic. By the 1950s, the skyway was seeing over 400 crashes per year; an aluminum <a href="median%20barrier">median barrier</a> was added in mid-1956, in addition to a new pavement coating designed to make the road less slippery.
The skyway was a constraint in the building of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Turnpike">New Jersey Turnpike</a> in 1951. The turnpike had to be built low enough to provide enough clearance underneath the skyway, but high enough to then provide sufficient clearance over the nearby <a href="Passaic%20River">Passaic River</a>. Turnpike engineers could have built over the skyway (at a much higher cost) or under the skyway's trusses; the latter option was chosen. As part of a 2005 <a href="seismic%20retrofit">seismic retrofit</a> project, the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Turnpike%20Authority">New Jersey Turnpike Authority</a> lowered the Passaic River Viaduct Bridge on its easterly alignment to increase vertical clearance and allow for full-width <a href="shoulder%20%28road%29">shoulders</a> underneath the Pulaski Skyway. Engineers replaced the bearings and lowered the turnpike bridge by , without shutting it to traffic.

By the 2000s, the Pulaski Skyway was considered <a href="functionally%20obsolete">functionally obsolete</a> since its design did not meet highway bridge standards. In 2007, it was rated <a href="structurally%20deficient">structurally deficient</a>. The 2007 collapse of the <a href="I-35W%20Mississippi%20River%20bridge">I-35W Mississippi River bridge</a> in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> raised concerns about the stability of the skyway, which was one of eight New Jersey bridges with similar design features. Within days of the collapse, <a href="New%20Jersey%20Department%20of%20Transportation">NJDOT</a> announced that it would start a previously planned one-year, $10-million project to make critical repairs. The work was the first phase of a planned 10-year, $200-million interim renovation project, and marked the skyway's first significant repairs since 1984.

After work began, it was determined that the repairs needed were more extensive, costly, and time-consuming than expected, and NJDOT estimated that rehabilitation could cost more than $1.2 billion. In 2009, NJDOT estimated that it would take a decade before the state could afford to rehabilitate or replace the structure. In a controversial move in 2011, Governor <a href="Chris%20Christie">Chris Christie</a> directed the <a href="Port%20Authority%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey">Port Authority of New York and New Jersey</a> (PANYNJ) to divert money originally earmarked for the <a href="Access%20to%20the%20Region%27s%20Core">Access to the Region's Core</a> rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8 billion to partially fund efforts to rehabilitate the skyway and <a href="New%20Jersey%20Route%20139">Route 139</a>, replace <a href="Wittpenn%20Bridge">Wittpenn Bridge</a>, and extend <a href="US%20Route%201/9%20Truck">US 1/9 Truck</a>, all part of the larger distribution network in the <a href="Port%20of%20New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey">Port of New York and New Jersey</a>.

In January 2013, NJDOT announced that work on the $335 million projects for repaving and restoration of the roadway would begin at the end of 2013. To facilitate the work, the eastbound lanes (northbound US 1/9) would close for two years after the <a href="Super%20Bowl%20XLVIII">Super Bowl XLVIII</a> in February 2014 at the nearby <a href="Meadowlands%20Sports%20Complex">Meadowlands Sports Complex</a>. The proposal was opposed by local politicians, who contended that it did not satisfactorily address the effect on local traffic and called for more thorough investigation into alternatives. The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options.

The roadway remained open through the use of alternate lane closures during the work until April 12, 2014, affecting the 74,000 daily crossings. The rehabilitation project, with an estimated cost of $1.2–1.5 billion, is being done in phases and spread out over ten contracts, the first of which began in 2012, and the last, for final painting of the steel structure, planned for completion in 2020. The improvements are expected to extend the life of the bridge until at least 2095.
The skyway was closed for eastbound (northbound US 1/9) traffic on April 12, 2014, for two years in order to replace the entire bridge deck. The midway access ramps in South Kearny and Jersey City were closed to regular traffic, but would be available to emergency responders. In April 2015, NJDOT said that unforeseen additional repairs would be made, extending the scheduled April 2016 completion date to sometime later that year and adding $14 million in costs. In March 2018, after several construction delays, it was announced that the Pulaski Skyway was set to be reopened to all traffic that spring. The skyway reopened to all traffic on June 30, 2018, two days earlier than NJDOT had originally announced.

NJDOT worked with <a href="New%20Jersey%20Transit">New Jersey Transit</a> (NJT) to bolster public transportation, encouraged car and van pooling, worked with local community officials, employers, truckers, local port employees, and the public to alleviate problems and address flexible working hours, and publicized alternate transportation options through television, radio, <a href="social%20media">social media</a>, <a href="news%20media">news media</a>, and its skyway website.

To ease congestion, the Turnpike Authority converted a <a href="Shoulder%20%28road%29">shoulder</a> of the <a href="Interstate%2078%20in%20New%20Jersey">Newark Bay-Hudson County Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike</a> to a traveling lane. Temporary <a href="lane%20control%20lights">lane control lights</a> on of the extension would indicate that extra lane is open during peak hours, at which time the speed limit would be reduced. This set-up would be able to handle 1,900 vehicles an hour in addition to the slightly more than 4,000 vehicles per hour on the existing lanes during peak periods. To reduce delays, <a href="variable%20message%20signs">variable message signs</a> would provide motorists with daily traffic alerts and an <a href="Traffic%20light%20control%20and%20coordination">adaptive traffic signal system</a> would be installed and monitored by the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Meadowlands%20Commission">Meadowlands Commission</a> to synchronize traffic lights at 15 intersections along US 1/9 Truck and <a href="New%20Jersey%20Route%20440">Route 440</a> in <a href="South%20Kearny%2C%20New%20Jersey">Kearny Point</a> and <a href="Jersey%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Jersey City</a>. They are part of a larger "<a href="intelligent%20transportation%20system">intelligent transportation system</a>", the <a href="Meadowlands%20Adaptive%20Signal%20System%20for%20Traffic%20Reduction">Meadowlands Adaptive Signal System</a>, a network of traffic-controlled intersections with vehicle detectors in the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Meadowlands">Meadowlands</a>. In anticipation of traffic overflow onto local Jersey City streets, off-duty police officers would be hired to direct traffic heading to the Holland Tunnel during rush hours.

To promote public transportation, NJT and <a href="PATH%20%28rail%20system%29">PATH</a> offered more frequent peak hour train services to <a href="Newark%2C%20New%20Jersey">Newark</a>, <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken</a> and Jersey City on the <a href="Hudson%20Waterfront">Hudson Waterfront</a>, and <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>. NJT added a new bus route for peak hour service between <a href="Watchung%2C%20New%20Jersey">Watchung</a> and <a href="Newark%20Penn%20Station">Newark Penn Station</a>, along the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2022%20in%20New%20Jersey">US 22</a> corridor, and their bus schedules accommodated additional passengers on existing routes.

On June 12, 2014, the PANYNJ acknowledged that the <a href="Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission">Securities and Exchange Commission</a>, <a href="New%20York%20County%20District%20Attorney">New York County District Attorney</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20for%20the%20District%20of%20New%20Jersey">United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey</a> were investigating its diversion of $1.8 billion to fund the Pulaski Skyway and other New Jersey roadway rehabilitation projects. These inquiries were related to how this funding, which was made at the urging of the Christie administration, was potentially misrepresented in documents related to bond sales. State laws require the PANYNJ to spend money only related to its own facilities, unless it gets approval from lawmakers in New Jersey and New York. The PANYNJ documents state that the Pulaski Skyway was designated as also providing access to the Lincoln Tunnel, even though it is miles from the tunnel and does not connect to it directly. In December 2014, <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> filed a complaint with the <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> that claims that since 2004 the PANYNJ has diverted more than $2 billion from the <a href="Aviation%20in%20the%20New%20York%20metropolitan%20area">metro area airports</a> to non-airport uses and that in 2014 alone it spent $181 million to repair the Pulaski Skyway and $60 million on the Wittpenn Bridge, NJDOT-owned and -operated structures.

The Pulaski Skyway is the subject of "The Last Three Miles", a book written by Steven Hart published in 2007. The Skyway has been used in radio, film, television, and at least one video game. In the 1938 radio drama "<a href="The%20War%20of%20the%20Worlds%20%28radio%29">The War of the Worlds</a>", one of the Martian machines straddles the skyway (a scene replicated in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Worlds%20%282005%20film%29">2005 film</a> wherein the first machine appears in the shadow of the bridge). It was featured in the 1979 film "<a href="Hair%20%28film%29">Hair</a>". <a href="Alfred%20Hitchcock">Alfred Hitchcock</a>'s 1943 film "<a href="Shadow%20of%20a%20Doubt">Shadow of a Doubt</a>" and the 1999–2007 television drama "<a href="The%20Sopranos">The Sopranos</a>" include shots of the bridge in the opening montages. <a href="Clutch%20%28band%29">Clutch</a> included the track "Pulaski Skyway" on its 2005 release "<a href="Robot%20Hive/Exodus">Robot Hive/Exodus</a>."

Zino's petrel

The Zino's petrel or freira ("Pterodroma madeira") is a small <a href="seabird">seabird</a> in the <a href="gadfly%20petrel">gadfly petrel</a> <a href="genus">genus</a> which is <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to the island of <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>. This long-winged petrel has a grey back and wings, with a dark "W" marking across the wings, and a grey upper tail. The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a triangle of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. It is very similar in appearance to the slightly larger <a href="Fea%27s%20petrel">Fea's petrel</a>, and separating these two <a href="Macaronesia">Macaronesia</a>n species at sea is very challenging. Zino's was formerly considered to be a <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of the <a href="soft-plumaged%20petrel">soft-plumaged petrel</a>, "P. mollis", but they are not closely related, and Zino's was raised to species status because of differences in <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, calls, breeding behaviour and <a href="Mitochondrion">mitochondrial</a> <a href="DNA">DNA</a>. It is Europe's most endangered seabird, with breeding areas restricted to a few ledges high in the central mountains of Madeira.

Zino's petrel nests in burrows which are visited only at night, to the accompaniment of their haunting calls. The single white egg is incubated by both adults, one sitting during the day while the other feeds on fish and squid at sea. Eggs, chicks and adults have been subject to predation by introduced cats and rats, and in the past have been taken for food by local shepherds. Predator control, and other measures such as the removal of grazing animals which trample the burrows, has enabled the population to recover to 65–80 breeding pairs; it remains <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a> on the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. However, conservation efforts had a major setback in August 2010 when fires killed three adults and 65% of the chicks.

The gadfly petrels in the genus "Pterodroma" are seabirds of temperate and tropical oceans. Many are little-known, and their often similar appearance have caused the taxonomy of the group to be rather fluid. The forms breeding in Macaronesia on Madeira, <a href="Bugio%20Island">Bugio</a> in the <a href="Desertas%20Islands">Desertas Islands</a>, and in the <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> archipelago were long considered to be subspecies of the Southern Hemisphere soft-plumaged petrel, "P. mollis", but mitochondrial DNA analysis, and differences in size, vocalisations, breeding behaviour, showed that the northern birds are not closely related to "P. mollis", and that the <a href="Bermuda%20petrel">Bermuda petrel</a> or Cahow may be the closest relative of the Macaronesian birds. Sangster recommended establishing Zino's petrel on Madeira and Fea's petrel on the Desertas and Cape Verde as full species, and the species split was accepted by the <a href="Association%20of%20European%20Rarities%20Committees">Association of European Rarities Committees</a> (AERC) in 2003.

Nunn and Zino estimated that the two Macaronesian species diverged at the end of the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a>, 850,000 years ago. An analysis of feather <a href="louse">lice</a> taken from Fea's petrels, "Pterodroma feae deserti", from Bugio Island, and from Zino's petrels from the Madeiran mainland showed that there were marked differences between the two seabirds in terms of the parasites they carried, suggesting that they have long been isolated, since lice can normally only be transferred through physical contact in the nest. The species on Zino's petrel are most similar to those of the Bermuda petrel, whereas Fea's petrel's lice are like those of Caribbean and Pacific "Pterodroma" species. This suggests that despite the close physical proximity of the two species of gadfly petrel found in the Madeiran archipelago, they may have arisen from separate colonisations of mainland Madeira and, later, the <a href="Desertas%20Islands">Desertas Islands</a>. Although their reproductive isolation has allowed the separate evolutionary development of the two species, genetic evidence shows the three Macaronesian petrels are each other's closest relatives.

The petrels breeding in the high central mountains of Madeira were first recorded in 1903 by German naturalist and priest <a href="Ernst%20Johann%20Schmitz">Ernst Johann Schmitz</a>, who failed to realise that they were different from the Fea's petrels he had seen in the Desertas. The species was formally described as a race of soft-plumaged petrel by Australian amateur <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Gregory%20Mathews">Gregory Mathews</a> in 1934. Following the recognition of the Madeiran birds as a full species, they were named after the Portuguese ornithologist, <a href="Paul%20Alexander%20Zino">Paul Alexander Zino</a>, who was instrumental in their conservation during the latter half of the twentieth century. The genus name "Pterodroma" is derived from Greek "πτερον", "pteron", "a wing", and "δρομος", "dromos", "running", and refers to the bird's swift erratic flight. The specific "madeira" refers to the island on which it breeds. The Portuguese name "Freira" means "nun"; the inhabitants of <a href="Curral%20das%20Freiras">Curral das Freiras</a> (Nun's Valley) near the breeding site claimed that the nocturnal wailing of the petrels in the breeding season were the calls of the suffering souls of the nuns. The sisters had taken refuge in the valley from attacks on the island by French pirates in 1566 that lasted for 15 days.

"Pterodroma" petrel remains dated at between 60,000 and 25,000 years <a href="Before%20Present">BP</a> were found in two cave sites in Gibraltar. They consist of a more abundant form similar in size to Zino's, and a larger, less common type. It is uncertain whether they represent the site of a former breeding colony, or are the result of a seabird wreck in which storms blow birds inland. They do suggest, however, that members of the genus were formerly more widespread.

This long-winged petrel is long with an wingspan, and an average weight of 290 g (10.3 in). It has a grey back, grey wings with a dark "W" marking across them, and a grey upper tail. The undersides of the wings are blackish apart from a triangle of white at the front edge near the body, and the belly is white with grey flanks. The head has a mottled whitish-brown forehead, a dark cap, and a dark spot below and behind the brown eye. The bill is black and the legs are flesh pink, the colour continuing onto the first third of the feet, the rest of the toes and webs being black-brown. It gives the general impression of a small <a href="Cory%27s%20shearwater">Cory's</a> or <a href="great%20shearwater">great shearwater</a>, with a fast flight; in strong winds it shears high above the surface with angled wings. Nothing is known of the fresh juvenile plumage or the <a href="Moulting">moult</a> sequence, and ageing birds is currently not feasible.

This species is very similar in appearance to the <a href="Fea%27s%20petrel">Fea's petrel</a>, but is smaller. The size difference and lighter flight may not be apparent at sea, especially with lone birds, but a recent study helped to clarify other useful features. Zino's has a diagnostically small, delicate, often rather long and slender bill, which may be obvious in the most slender-billed examples, which are probably mostly females, but can be difficult to determine in larger-billed, probably adult male, birds. Another useful feature is a large whitish panel on the underwing. The wing panel is exclusive to Zino's but is only shown by 15% of the birds. Zino's has a more rounded wing tip, but "P. feae deserti" sometimes shows a rounded wing tip, so this feature is not diagnostic. Previously suggested criteria such as head, upperwing and flank patterns were found to be inconclusive. Off the eastern United States and the Azores, both Macronesian petrels are easily distinguished from the larger Bermuda petrel by that species' upperparts, which are uniformly dark but for a pale grey rump.

This species at its breeding sites gives a long mournful call like the hooting of a <a href="tawny%20owl">tawny owl</a>, and a much less frequent sound like the whimpering of a pup. It is silent at sea. The breeding calls are very similar to those of Fea's petrel, and Bretagnolle's analysis of the calls of the soft-plumaged petrel complex led him to suggest in 1995 only a two-way species split, with the northern forms "madeira", "feae" and "deserti" all as subspecies of Fea's petrel.

The <a href="Hadoram%20Shirihai">Hadoram Shirihai</a> expeditions to the Madeira archipelago in 2008, 2009 and 2010 each had sightings of a "Pterodroma" petrel (possibly the same bird) with largely white underwings, but upperwings like Zino's or Fea's. This plumage does not correspond to any known "Pterodroma" species. It may have been an unusual variant of Zino's but this is unlikely since no similar bird has been seen amongst the more than 100 caught at the nest. It may alternatively be a single aberrant individual, a hybrid or an unknown taxon from Madeira or elsewhere. No conclusion is possible on current knowledge.

Zino's petrel is endemic to the main island of Madeira, where it breeds on inaccessible and well-vegetated ledges in the central mountains between <a href="Pico%20do%20Arieiro">Pico do Areeiro</a> and <a href="Pico%20Ruivo">Pico Ruivo</a>. The typical ledge plants are endemic <a href="Raunki%C3%A6r%20plant%20life-form%23Hemicryptophytes">hemicryptophytes</a>s and <a href="Subshrub">Chamaephytes</a>, but grasses may also be present. It nests at heights above . It was formerly more widespread, since <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains have been found in a cave in eastern Madeira, and on nearby <a href="Porto%20Santo%20Island">Porto Santo Island</a>. The breeding ledges have to be inaccessible to introduced goats so that they remain rich in endemic flora. The vegetation ensures that there is sufficient earth on the ledges to allow the birds to burrow and make their nests, and trampling by grazing animals reduces the soil cover.

This petrel is only present in Madeiran waters during the breeding season. Its distribution at sea during the rest of the year is poorly known due to the rarity of the species and the difficulty of separating it from other "Pterodroma" petrels at sea. Birds identified as either Zino's or Fea's have been recorded from both sides of the North Atlantic, and in Ireland and Britain there has been a large increase in the number of reports, perhaps because global warming brings increasing numbers of tropical species into temperate waters. The timing of the reports, mainly in late spring and summer in the western North Atlantic, and in late summer and early autumn in the east, has suggested that birds follow a clockwise route around the North Atlantic after leaving their breeding sites. However, the few birds that have been identified with certainty have all been Fea's. Zino's petrel may have a similar strategy, since preliminary results from geolocation studies indicate widespread dispersal over the North Atlantic central ridge during the breeding season, and migration towards the Brazilian coast in the non-breeding period. "Pterodroma" petrels have been recorded in the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a> and the <a href="Azores">Azores</a> on surprisingly few occasions; a claim of possible Zino's from South Africa is now thought to be erroneous.

Zino's petrel breeds two months earlier than the Fea's petrel's on Bugio, only away. The birds return from sea to their breeding grounds in late March or early April and courting occurs over the main breeding area during the late evening and early morning hours. The nest is a shallow burrow or old rabbit tunnel up to long in thick soil on vegetated ledges. The length of the burrow is related to the age of the pair that uses it, young birds making shorter tunnels, which are extended in subsequent years. The oval white egg is laid from mid-May to mid-June in a chamber at the end of the burrow and incubated for 51–54 days, each parent alternating between sitting on the nest and feeding at sea. The young <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 85 days later in late September and October. This petrel is strictly nocturnal at the breeding sites to avoid predation by <a href="gull">gull</a>s. It stays offshore during the day, coming to land in darkness. It calls from about 30 minutes after nightfall until dawn, including on moonlit nights.

This species mates for life, and pairs return to the same burrow year after year. The single egg is not replaced if lost. This is a long-lived species: one bird has returned to its burrow for ten consecutive years, and the lifespan is estimated to be about 16 years. The age of first breeding is unknown, but assumed to be four or more years. Despite the proximity of the breeding sites, Zino's and Fea's petrels have never been found at each other's nesting areas, and Zino's is not known to hybridise with any other species.

Zino's petrel, like its relatives, feeds on small squid and fish. The vomited stomach contents of one bird contained <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, the <a href="bioluminescence">bioluminiscent</a> fish "<a href="Electrona%20risso">Electrona risso</a>" and small <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s. Like other small petrels, Zino's does not normally follow ships.

Their nocturnal approach to the breeding sites means that Zino's petrels avoid the attentions of gulls or diurnal raptors, and the only owl on the island, the <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a>, is a rodent hunter. Other than bats, there are no native land mammals on Madeira, although there are a number of introduced species, two of which will take birds or chicks. These are <a href="brown%20rat">brown rat</a>s and feral domestic <a href="cat">cat</a>s. Even the high mountain nest sites of the Zino's petrel are not safe from these adaptable predators, ten adults being killed by cats in 1990. Feather <a href="louse">lice</a> found on Zino's petrels include "<a href="Trabeculus%20schillingi">Trabeculus schillingi</a>", "<a href="Saemundssonia">Saemundssonia</a>" species and an unnamed species of "<a href="Halipeurus">Halipeurus</a>".

Zino's petrel has a very restricted range on the mountaintops of a single island, and is the most endangered European seabird. The birds, already confined to a limited area when discovered, were thought to be extinct by the mid-twentieth century. Two freshly fledged juveniles were found within the walls of the governor's palace in <a href="Funchal">Funchal</a> in the early 1940s, presumably attracted there by lights, but the species was not seen again until 1969. In 1969, Paul Zino played a tape of Fea's petrel from Bugio to a shepherd from Curral das Freiras; he immediately recognised the call, and led the researchers to the remaining nesting area. Predation by introduced rats meant that breeding success in the small population was low, and no young at all fledged in 1985. The Freira Conservation Project was founded in 1986 with the aim of increasing the population of Zino's petrel by controlling rats and human interference; the control was extended to cats after the mass predation of 1990.

There are now 130–160 known individuals (65–80 breeding pairs) confirmed to breed on just six ledges. There may be some disturbance from visitors at night and from the construction of a NATO radar station on the summit of <a href="Pico%20do%20Arieiro">Mount Areeiro</a>, and in the longer term climate change may have an adverse effect, since all nests are within of the top of the highest mountain in the breeding area. Formerly, shepherds collected nestlings for food, and egg collectors have raided burrows. Currently, the main threats continue to be predation of eggs and chicks by <a href="brown%20rat">rats</a>, and of nesting adults by <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a>s, although at much reduced levels due to trapping.

Zino's petrel is protected under the EU's Wild Birds Directive, and its breeding sites lie within the <a href="Parque%20Natural%20da%20Madeira">Parque Natural da Madeira</a> <a href="national%20park">national park</a>. Following the purchase of about of land around the main breeding site, all livestock has been removed from the breeding areas, allowing the vegetation to recover, although breeding still only occurs on ledges that were never accessible to grazing animals. The research and predator control by the Freira Conservation Project and the national park which started in 1986 was expanded in 2001 with additional EU funding. The increase in productivity (29 chicks fledged in 2004) meant that this species was downgraded from <a href="critically%20endangered">critically endangered</a> to endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2004. Its population appeared to be stable or increasing slightly up to the summer of 2010.

A disaster struck the colony on 13 August 2010, when a forest fire swept through the breeding site killing three adults and 25 of the 38 chicks. The fire destroyed the vegetation and several nesting burrows. Conservation action to protect the 13 remaining chicks included removing dead birds and burnt vegetation, reinforcing the surviving nests, and setting poison bait for rats around the now exposed nest sites. In the longer term, the action plan includes the provision of artificial burrows, seed dispersal to help the vegetation recover, and the use of anti-erosion materials.

Marie Lloyd

Matilda Alice Victoria Wood (12 February 1870 – 7 October 1922), professionally known as Marie Lloyd ; was an English <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> singer, comedian and <a href="musical%20theatre">musical theatre</a> actress. She was best known for her performances of songs such as "<a href="The%20Boy%20I%20Love%20Is%20Up%20in%20the%20Gallery">The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery</a>", "<a href="My%20Old%20Man%20%28Said%20Follow%20the%20Van%29">My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)</a>" and "<a href="Oh%21%20Mr%20Porter">Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do</a>". She received both criticism and praise for her use of <a href="innuendo">innuendo</a> and <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a> during her performances, but enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the "Queen of the Music Hall".

Born in London, she was showcased by her father at the Eagle Tavern in <a href="Hoxton">Hoxton</a>. In 1884, she made her professional début as Bella Delmere; she changed her stage name to Marie Lloyd the following year. In 1885, she had success with her song "The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery", and she frequently topped the bill at prestigious theatres in London's <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>. In 1891, she was recruited by the <a href="impresario">impresario</a> <a href="Augustus%20Harris">Augustus Harris</a> to appear in that year's spectacular <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> Christmas <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> "Humpty Dumpty". She starred in a further two productions at the theatre, "Little Bo Peep" (1892) and "Robinson Crusoe" (1893). By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain's theatre censors due to the risqué content of her songs.

Between 1894 and 1900, she became an international success when she toured France, America, Australia and Belgium with her solo music hall act. In 1907, she assisted other performers during the <a href="Music%20Hall%20War%20of%201907">music hall war</a> and took part in demonstrations outside theatres, protesting for better pay and conditions for performers. During the First World War, in common with most other music hall artists, she supported recruitment into the armed services to help the <a href="war%20effort">war effort</a>, touring hospitals and industrial institutions to help boost morale. In 1915, she performed her only wartime song "Now You've Got Your Khaki On", which became a favourite among front-line troops.

Lloyd had a turbulent private life that was often the subject of press attention: she was married three times, divorced twice, and frequently found herself giving court testimony against two of her husbands who had physically abused her. In later life, she was still in demand at music halls and had a late success in 1919 with her performance of "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)", which became one of her most popular songs. Privately, she suffered from bouts of ill-health and became alcohol-dependent, both of which imposed restrictions on her performing career by the 1920s. In 1922, she gave her final performance at the <a href="Alhambra%20Theatre">Alhambra Theatre</a>, London, during which she became ill on stage. She died a few days later at the age of 52.

Lloyd was born on 12 February 1870 in <a href="Hoxton">Hoxton</a>, London. Her father, John Wood (1847–1940), was an <a href="artificial%20flower">artificial flower</a> arranger and waiter; her mother, Matilda Mary Caroline "<a href="n%C3%A9e">née</a>" Archer (1849–1931), was a dressmaker and costume designer. Lloyd was the eldest of nine children and became known within the family circle as Tilley. The Wood family were respectable, hard-working, and financially comfortable. Lloyd often took career advice from her mother, whose influence was strong in the family. Lloyd attended a school in Bath Street, London, but disliked formal education and often played truant; with both her parents working, she adopted a maternal role over her siblings, helping to keep them entertained, clean and well cared-for. Along with her sister <a href="Alice%20Lloyd%20%28actor%29">Alice</a>, she arranged events in which the Wood children performed at the family home. Lloyd enjoyed entertaining her family and decided to form a <a href="Minstrel%20show">minstrel</a> act in 1879 called the Fairy Bell <a href="Dance%20troupe">troupe</a>, comprising her siblings.
Lloyd and the troupe made their début at a mission in Nile Street, Hoxton, in 1880 and followed this with an appearance at the <a href="Hoxton%20Hall">Blue Ribbon Gospel Temperance Mission</a> later the same year. Costumed by Matilda, they toured local <a href="Flophouse">doss-houses</a> in <a href="East%20London">East London</a>, where they performed <a href="temperance%20movement">temperance</a> songs, teaching people the dangers of alcohol abuse. Eager to show off his daughter's talent, John secured her unpaid employment as a table singer at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton, where he worked as a waiter. Among the songs she performed there was "My Soldier Laddie". Together with her performances at the Eagle, Lloyd briefly contributed to the family income by making babies' boots, and, later, curled feathers for hat making. She was unsuccessful at both and was sacked from the latter after being caught dancing on the tables by the foreman. She returned home that evening and declared that she wanted a permanent career on the stage. Although happy to have her performing in her spare time, her parents initially opposed the idea of her appearing on the stage full-time. She recalled that when her parents "saw that they couldn't kick their objections as high as [she] could kick [her] legs, they very sensibly came to the conclusion to let things take their course and said 'Bless you my child, do what you like'."

On 9 May 1885, at the age of 15, Lloyd made her professional solo stage début at the Grecian <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> (in the same premises as the Eagle Tavern), under the name "Matilda Wood". She performed "In the Good Old Days" and "My Soldier Laddie", which proved successful, and earned her a booking at the <a href="Falstaff">Sir John Falstaff</a> music hall in <a href="Old%20Street">Old Street</a> where she sang a series of romantic ballads. Soon after this, she chose the stage name Bella Delmere and appeared on stage in costumes designed by her mother. Her performances were a success, despite her singing other artists' songs without their permission, a practice which brought her a threat of an <a href="injunction">injunction</a> from one of the original performers. News of her act travelled; that October, she appeared at the Collins music hall in <a href="Islington">Islington</a> in a special performance to celebrate the theatre's refurbishment, the first time she had appeared outside Hoxton, and two months later, she was engaged at the Hammersmith Temple of Varieties and the <a href="New%20London%20Theatre">Middlesex Music Hall</a> in <a href="Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>. On 3 February 1886, she appeared at the prestigious Sebright Music Hall in <a href="Bethnal%20Green">Bethnal Green</a>, where she met George Ware, a prolific composer of music hall songs. Ware became her agent and, after a few weeks, she began performing songs purchased from little-known composers. As her popularity grew, Ware suggested that she change her name. "Marie" was chosen for its "posh" and "slightly French" sound, and "Lloyd" was taken from an edition of "<a href="Lloyd%27s%20Weekly%20Newspaper">Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper</a>".

Lloyd established her new name on 22 June 1886, with an appearance at the Falstaff Music Hall, where she attracted wide notice for the song "<a href="The%20Boy%20I%20Love%20Is%20Up%20in%20the%20Gallery">The Boy I Love Is Up in the Gallery</a>" (which was initially written for <a href="Nelly%20Power">Nelly Power</a> by Lloyd's agent George Ware). By 1887, her performance of the song had become so popular that she was in demand in London's <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>, including the Oxford Music Hall, where she excelled at <a href="Skirt%20dance">skirt dancing</a>. George Belmont, the Falstaff's proprietor, secured her an engagement at the Star Palace of Varieties in <a href="Bermondsey">Bermondsey</a>. She soon began making her own costumes, a skill she learned from her mother, and one she used for the rest of her career. She undertook a month-long tour of Ireland at the start of 1886, earning £10 per week after which she returned to East London to perform at, amongst others, the Sebright Music Hall, Bethnal Green. On 23 October, "<a href="The%20Era%20%28newspaper%29">The Era</a>" called her "a pretty little soubrette who dances with great dash and energy."
By the end of 1886, Lloyd was playing several halls a night and earned £100 per week. She was now able to afford new songs from established music hall composers and writers, including "Harry's a Soldier", "She Has a Sailor for a Lover", and "Oh Jeremiah, Don't you Go to Sea". By 1887, Lloyd began to display a skill for <a href="Ad%20libitum%23Drama">ad lib</a>, and to gain a reputation for her impromptu performances. It was during this period that she first sang "Whacky-Wack" and "When you Wink the Other Eye", a song which introduced her famous wink at the audience. Unlike her West End audiences who enjoyed her coarse humour, her "<a href="Ribaldry%23Bawdy%20song">blue</a>" performances did not impress audiences in the <a href="East%20End%20of%20London">East End</a>.

While appearing at the Foresters music hall in <a href="Mile%20End">Mile End</a>, she met and began dating Percy Charles Courtenay, a ticket <a href="tout">tout</a> from <a href="Streatham">Streatham</a>, London. The courtship was brief, and the couple married on 12 November 1887 at <a href="St%20John%20the%20Baptist%2C%20Hoxton">St John the Baptist, Hoxton</a>. In May 1888, Lloyd gave birth to a daughter, Marie (1888–1967). The marriage was mostly unhappy, and Courtenay was disliked by Lloyd's family and friends. Before long, Courtenay became addicted to alcohol and gambling, and grew jealous of his wife's close friendship with the 13-year-old actress Bella Burge, to whom Lloyd had rented a room in the marital house. He also became angry at the numerous parties Lloyd hosted for fellow members of the music hall profession including <a href="Gus%20Elen">Gus Elen</a>, <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Stratton">Eugene Stratton</a>.

In October 1888, Lloyd returned from maternity leave and joined rehearsals for the 1888–89 pantomime "The Magic Dragon of the Demon Dell; or, The Search for the Mystic Thyme", in which she was cast as Princess Kristina. The production, which was staged between <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> and February at the Britannia theatre in Hoxton, gave her the security of working close to home for a two-month period. The engagement also gave her much-needed experience of playing to a big audience. The following year, she appeared at more Bohemian venues including the <a href="Empire%2C%20Leicester%20Square">Empire</a> and the <a href="Alhambra%20Theatre">Alhambra</a> theatres, the <a href="London%20Trocadero">Trocadero Palace of Varieties</a>, and the <a href="Victoria%20Palace%20Theatre">Royal Standard playhouse</a>. In 1889, she gave birth to a <a href="stillbirth">stillborn</a> child, which further damaged her marriage.
By the start of the 1890s, Lloyd had built up a successful catalogue of songs, which included "What's That For, Eh?", about a little girl who asks her parents the meaning of various everyday household objects. Her biographer and theatre historian <a href="W.%20J.%20MacQueen-Pope">W. J. MacQueen-Pope</a> described the song as being "blue" and thought that it spoke volumes about her reputation thanks to her "wonderful wink, and that sudden, dazzling smile, and the nod of the head." Similar-styled songs followed; "She'd Never had her Ticket Punched Before", told the story of a young, naive woman travelling to London on her own by train. This was followed by "The Wrong Man Never Let a Chance go By"; "We Don't Want to Fight, But, by Jingo, If we Do"; "Oh You Wink the Other Eye" and "Twiggy Vous"—a song which won her much success and increased her popularity abroad. After an evening's performance at the Oxford music hall, a French well-wisher requested a conversation and to meet Lloyd backstage. Flanked by Courtenay, she appeared at the stage door, where Courtenay threatened the man with violence as both had become suspicious of his interest in her. She took a chance and invited the man into her dressing room, where he identified himself as a member of the French government. He confirmed to her that "Twiggy Vous" was "most popular in Paris"; she was delighted at the news. At the end of the year, Lloyd returned to London where she appeared in the Christmas pantomime "Cinderella" in Peckham alongside her sister Alice.

Between 1891 and 1893, Lloyd was recruited by the <a href="impresario">impresario</a> <a href="Augustus%20Harris">Augustus Harris</a> to appear alongside Dan Leno in the spectacular and popular <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> Christmas <a href="pantomimes">pantomimes</a>. While lunching with Harris in 1891 to discuss his offer, Lloyd played coy, deliberately confusing the theatre with the lesser known venue <a href="New%20London%20Theatre">the Old Mo</a> so as not to appear conscious of Drury Lane's successful reputation; she compared its structure to that of a prison. Secretly, she was thrilled with the offer, for which she would receive £100 per week. The pantomime seasons lasted from Boxing Day to March and were highly lucrative, but Lloyd found working from a script restrictive. Her first role was Princess Allfair in "Humpty Dumpty; or, The Yellow Dwarf and the Fair One", which she dismissed as being "Bloody awful, eh?" She received mixed reviews for her opening performance. "The Times" described her as being "playful in gesture, graceful in appearance, but not strong in voice." Despite the weak start (which Lloyd blamed on nerves), the pantomime received glowing reviews from the theatrical press. The "London Entr'acte" thought that she "delivere[d] her text quite pungently, and sings and dances with spirit too." She was noted for her acrobatic dancing on stage, and was able to display handstands, tumbles and high kicks. As a boy, the writer <a href="Compton%20Mackenzie">Compton Mackenzie</a> was taken to the show's opening night and admitted that he was "greatly surprised that any girl should have the courage to let the world see her drawers as definitely as Marie Lloyd."

Lloyd's biographer <a href="Midge%20Gillies">Midge Gillies</a> defines 1891 as being the year that she officially "made it" thanks to a catalogue of hit songs and major success in the halls and pantomime. When she appeared at the Oxford music hall in June, the audience cheered so loudly for her return that the following act could not be heard; "The Era" called her "the favourite of the hour". During the summer months, she toured North England, including <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> and <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>. At the last she stayed an extra six nights due to popular demand, which caused her to cancel a trip to Paris. The 1892 pantomime was "Little Bo Peep; or, Little Red Riding Hood and Hop O' My Thumb", in which she played Little Red Riding Hood. The production was five hours long and culminated with the show's <a href="harlequinade">harlequinade</a>. During one scene, her improvisational skills caused some scandal when she got out of bed to pray, but instead reached for a <a href="chamber%20pot">chamber pot</a>. The stunt angered Harris, who ordered her not to do it again or risk immediate dismissal. <a href="Max%20Beerbohm">Max Beerbohm</a>, who was in a later audience, said "Isn't Marie Lloyd charming and sweet in the pantomime? I think of little besides her." On 12 January 1892, Lloyd and Courtenay brawled drunkenly in her Drury Lane dressing room after an evening's performance of "Little Bo-Peep". Courtenay pulled a decorative sword off the wall and threatened to cut her throat; she escaped from the room with minor bruises and reported the incident to the <a href="Bow%20Street">Bow Street</a> police station. In early 1893, she travelled to <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a> where she starred as Flossie in another unsuccessful piece called "The A.B.C Girl; or, Flossie the Frivolous", which, according to MacQueen-Pope, "ended the Queen of Comedy's career as an actress".
Lloyd made her American stage début in 1893, appearing at <a href="Koster%20and%20Bial%27s%20Music%20Hall">Koster and Bial's Music Hall</a> in New York. She sang "Oh You Wink the Other Eye", much to the delight of her American audiences. Other numbers were "After the Pantomime" and "You Should Go to France and See the Ladies Dance", which both required her to wear provocative costumes. Her performances pleased the theatre proprietors, who presented her with an antique tea and coffee service. News of her success reached home, and the "London Entr'acte" reported that "Miss Marie Lloyd made the biggest hit ever known at Koster and Bial's variety hall, New York."

Upon her return to London, Lloyd introduced "Listen With the Right Ear", which was an intended follow-up to "Oh You Wink the Other Eye". Shortly after her return, she sailed to France, to take up an engagement in Paris. Her biographer <a href="Daniel%20Farson">Daniel Farson</a> thought that she received "greater acclaim than any other English comedienne who had preceded her". She changed the lyrics to some of her best-known songs for her French audience and retitled them, "The Naughty Continong"; "Twiggy Vous"; "I'm Just Back from Paris" and "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris". At Christmas in 1893, she returned to London to honour her final Drury Lane commitment, starring as Polly Perkins in "Robinson Crusoe". The part allowed her to perform "The Barmaid" and "The Naughty Continong" and saw her perform a <a href="mazurka">mazurka</a> with Leno. Talking to a friend years later about her Drury Lane engagements, she admitted that she was "the proudest little woman in the world".

In May 1894, Courtenay followed Lloyd to the Empire, Leicester Square, where she was performing, and attempted to batter her with a stick, shouting: "I will gouge your eyes out and ruin you!" His assault missed Lloyd, but struck Burge in the face instead. As a result of the incident, Lloyd was sacked from the Empire for fear of a reprisal. Lloyd left the marital home, moving to 73 Carleton Road, <a href="Tufnell%20Park">Tufnell Park</a> and successfully applied for a restraining warrant, which prevented Courtenay from contacting her. A few weeks later, Lloyd began an affair with the music hall singer <a href="Alec%20Hurley">Alec Hurley</a>, which resulted in Courtenay initiating divorce proceedings in 1894 on the grounds of her adultery. That year, together with a short tour of the English provinces, Lloyd travelled to New York with Hurley, where she appeared at the <a href="Imperial%20Theatre">Imperial Theatre</a>, staying for two months. On her return to England, she appeared in the Liverpool Christmas pantomime as the principal boy in "Pretty Bo-Peep, Little Boy Blue, and the Merry Old Woman who lived in a Shoe". Her performance was praised by the press, who called her "delightfully easy, graceful and self-possessed."

By 1895, Lloyd's risqué songs were receiving frequent criticism from theatre reviewers and influential <a href="feminist">feminist</a>s. As a result, she often experienced resistance from strict theatre censorship which dogged the rest of her career. The writer and feminist <a href="Laura%20Ormiston%20Chant">Laura Ormiston Chant</a>, who was a member of the Social Purity Alliance, disliked the bawdiness of music hall performances, and thought that the venues were attractive to prostitutes. Her campaign persuaded the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> to erect large screens around the promenade at the Empire Theatre in Leicester Square, as part of the licensing conditions. The screens were unpopular and protesters, among them the young <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>, later pulled them down. That November at the <a href="Tivoli%20Music%20Hall%20%28London%29">Tivoli theatre</a>, Lloyd performed "Johnny Jones", a ditty about a girl who is taught the facts of life by her best male friend. The song, although not lyrically obscene, was considered to be offensive largely because of the manner in which Lloyd sang it, adding winks and gestures, and creating a conspiratorial relationship with her audience. Social reformers cited "Johnny Jones" as being offensive, but less so compared to other songs of the day. Upon the expiry of a music hall's entertainments licence, the Licensing Committee tried to use the lyrical content of music hall songs as evidence against a renewal. As a result, Lloyd was summoned to perform some of her songs in front of a council committee. She sang "Oh! Mr Porter" (composed for her by <a href="George%20Le%20Brunn">George Le Brunn</a>), "A Little of What You Fancy" and "She Sits Among the Cabbages and Peas", which she retitled "I Sits Amongst the Cabbages and Leeks" after some protest. The numbers were sung in such a way that the committee had no reason to find anything amiss. Feeling disgruntled at the council's interference, she then rendered <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred Tennyson's</a> <a href="drawing-room">drawing-room</a> ballad "<a href="Come%20into%20the%20Garden%2C%20Maud">Come into the Garden, Maud</a>" and displayed leers and nudges, to illustrate each innuendo. The committee were left stunned at the performance, but Lloyd argued afterwards that the rudeness was "all in the mind".
Despite their opposing views on music hall entertainment, Lloyd and Chant shared similar political views, and were wrongly assumed by the press to be enemies. An inspector who reported on one of Lloyd's performances at the Oxford music hall thought that her lyrical content was fine but her knowing nods, looks, smiles and the suggestiveness in her winks to the audience suggested otherwise. The restrictions imposed on the music halls were, by now beginning to affect trade, and many were threatened with closure. To avoid social unrest, Hackney council scrapped the licensing restrictions on 7 October 1896. In 1896, Lloyd sailed to South Africa with her daughter, who appeared as Little Maudie Courtenay on the same bill as her mother. Lloyd came to the attention of <a href="Barney%20Barnato">Barney Barnato</a>, a British entrepreneur who was responsible for <a href="randlord">mining diamond and gold</a>. Barnato lavished gifts on her in an attempt to woo her, but his attempts were unsuccessful; nevertheless, the two remained friends until his death in 1897. The tour was a triumph for Lloyd, and her songs became popular among her South African audience. She performed "Wink the Other Eye", "Twiggy-Vous", "Hello, Hello, Hello", "Whacky, Whacky, Whack!", "Keep Off the Grass", and "Oh! Mr Porter". Feeling satisfied at the success she had achieved, Lloyd returned to London once the two-month tour had ended.
The following year, Lloyd travelled to New York where she re-appeared at Koster and Bial's Music Hall. Her first song was about a young woman who lacked confidence in finding a suitor. The chorus, "Not for the very best man that ever got into a pair of trousers", proved hilarious; "The Era" observed that the line "tickled the audience immensely". Following this, she performed a song about a French maid who appeared innocent and petite at first sight, but turned out not to be so. "The Era" described the character as being "not so demure as she looked, for she confided to her auditors that she 'knew a lot about those tricky little things they don't teach a girl at school'." Many other songs followed and were all warmly received. At the conclusion of each performance, she received gifts from the audience including bouquets and floral structures. "The Era" commented that "Miss Lloyd's clever character work, her versatility and unflagging endeavours to please were rewarded with deserved success". After the tour, Lloyd returned to London, and moved to Hampstead with Hurley. That Christmas, she appeared in pantomime, this time at the Crown Theatre in <a href="Peckham">Peckham</a> in a production of "Dick Whittington" in which she played the title role. In it, she sang "A Little Bit Off the Top", which MacQueen-Pope describes as being "one of the pantomime songs of the year". "The Music Hall and Theatre Review" was equally complimentary, saying: "Brilliant Repertory, Charming Dresses, A Unique Personality!" During the Christmas period of 1898–9, Lloyd returned to the Crown where she took her benefit, during which she appeared in "Dick Whittington". The entertainment culminated with a song from <a href="Vesta%20Victoria">Vesta Victoria</a>, and a short piece called "The Squeaker", starring <a href="Joe%20Elvin">Joe Elvin</a>.

In February 1900, Lloyd was the subject of another benefit performance at the Crown Theatre in Peckham. <a href="Kate%20Carney">Kate Carney</a>, Vesta Tilley and Joe Elvin were among the star turns who performed before the main piece, "Cinderella", which starred Lloyd, her sister Alice, Kittee Rayburn and Jennie Rubie. The same year, although her divorce was not yet finalised, Lloyd went to live with Hurley in <a href="Southampton%20Row">Southampton Row</a>, London. Hurley, an established singer of <a href="Costermonger">coster</a> songs, regularly appeared on the same bill as Lloyd; his calm nature was a contrast to the abusive personality of Courtenay. Lloyd and Hurley set sail for a tour of Australia in 1901, opening at <a href="Harry%20Rickards">Harry Rickards</a> Opera House in Melbourne on 18 May with their own version of "The Lambeth Walk". After the successful two-month tour, Lloyd and Hurley returned to London where she appeared in the only <a href="revue">revue</a> of her career. Entitled "The Revue", it was written by <a href="Charles%20Raymond">Charles Raymond</a> and Phillip Yorke with lyrics by Roland Carse and music by Maurice Jacobi. It was staged at the Tivoli theatre, in celebration of the Coronation of King Edward VII. Lloyd and Courtenay's divorce became absolute on 22 May 1905, and she married Hurley on 27 October 1906. Hurley, although ecstatic with his earlier success in Australia, began feeling sidelined by his wife's popularity. MacQueen-Pope suggested that "[Hurley] was a star who had married a planet. Already the seeds of disaster were being sown."

Shortly after her marriage to Hurley, Lloyd went to <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> to recuperate from exhaustion. Within days she was back performing in London music halls. From the start of the new century, music hall artistes and theatre managers had been in dispute over working conditions, a reduction in pay and perks, and an increased number of matinée performances. The first significant rift was a 1906 strike, initiated by the <a href="Variety%20Artistes%27%20Federation">Variety Artistes' Federation</a>. The following year, <a href="Music%20Hall%20War%20of%201907">the Music Hall War</a> commenced, which saw the Federation fight for more freedom and better working conditions on behalf of music-hall performers. Although popular enough to command her own fees, Lloyd supported the strike, acted as a <a href="picketing%20%28protest%29">picket</a> for the strikers and gave generously to the strike fund. To raise spirits, she often performed on picket lines and took part in a fundraising performance at the <a href="Scala%20Theatre">Scala Theatre</a>. During one demonstration, she recognised someone trying to enter and shouted, "Let her through, girls, she'll close the music hall faster than we can." The singer was <a href="Belle%20Elmore">Belle Elmore</a>, later murdered by her husband, <a href="Dr.%20Crippen">Dr. Crippen</a>. The dispute ended later the same year with a resolution broadly favourable to the performers. In 1909, Lloyd appeared at the Gaiety Theatre in <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a> where a critic for "The Courier" noted "Her bright smile and fascinating presence has much to do with her popularity, while her songs are of the catchy style, perhaps not what a Dundee audience is familiar with, but still amusing and of an attractive style."

Despite their marital problems, Lloyd went on an American tour with Hurley in 1908. She was eager to equal the success of her sister Alice, who had become popular in the country a few years previously. By 1910, Marie's relationship with Hurley had ended, due in part to her endless parties and her developing friendship with the jockey <a href="Bernard%20Dillon">Bernard Dillon</a>, winner of the 1910 <a href="Derby%20%28horse%20race%29">Derby</a>. Lloyd and the young sportsman began an open and passionate affair. For the first time, her private life eclipsed her professional career. She was seldom mentioned in the theatrical press in 1910, and when she did perform, it was not to the best of her abilities. The writer <a href="Arnold%20Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a>, who witnessed her on stage at the Tivoli Theatre in 1909, admitted that he "couldn't see the legendary cleverness of the vulgarity of Marie Lloyd" and accused her songs of being "variations of the same theme of sexual naughtiness." As with Courtenay years previously, the shy and retiring Dillon was finding it hard to adapt to Lloyd's elaborate and sociable lifestyle. Dillon's success on the racecourse was short lived. In 1911, he was expelled from the <a href="Jockey%20Club">Jockey Club</a> for borrowing £660 to bet on his own horses to win. Dillon's horses lost, and he ended up in debt to trainers. He became jealous of Lloyd's successful life in the spotlight. Depression led to drink and obesity, and he started to abuse her. Hurley, meanwhile, had initiated divorce proceedings, the strain of which caused him to drink heavily, which in turn finished his theatrical career. Lloyd left the marital home in Hampstead and moved to <a href="Golders%20Green">Golders Green</a> with Dillon, a move which MacQueen-Pope describes as being "the worst thing she ever did."

A new show in London in 1912 showcased the best of music hall's talent. The <a href="Royal%20Variety%20Performance">Royal Command Performance</a> took place at the <a href="Palace%20Theatre%2C%20London">Palace Theatre</a> in London, which was managed by <a href="Alfred%20Butt">Alfred Butt</a>. The show was organised by <a href="Oswald%20Stoll">Oswald Stoll</a>, an Australian impresario who managed a string of <a href="West%20End%20of%20London">West End</a> and provincial theatres. Stoll, although a fan of Lloyd's, disliked the vulgarity of her act and championed a return to a more family-friendly atmosphere within the music hall. Because of this, and her participation in the earlier music hall war, Stoll left her out of the line-up. He placed an advert in "The Era" on the day of the performance warning that "Coarseness and vulgarity etc are not allowed ... this intimation is rendered necessary only by a few artists". In retaliation, Lloyd staged her own show at the <a href="London%20Pavilion">London Pavilion</a>, advertising that "every one of her performances was a command performance by order of the British public". She performed "One Thing Leads to Another", "Oh Mr Porter", and "The Boy I Love Is up in the Gallery" and was hailed as "the Queen of Comedy" by critics. The same year, she travelled to <a href="Devon">Devon</a> where she appeared at the Exeter Hippodrome to much success. "The Devon and Exeter Gazette", reported that Lloyd's performance of "Every Movement Tells a Tale", was "thoroughly enjoyed" by the audience and "[received] round after round of applause". The paper also praised her recital of a "Cockney girl's honeymoon in Paris", which was met by "roars of laughter".

In 1913, Lloyd was booked by the Orpheum Syndicate to appear at the <a href="Palace%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">New York Palace Theatre</a>. She and Dillon set sail on the <a href="RMS%20Olympic">RMS "Olympic"</a> under the name Mr and Mrs Dillon and were met at the American port by her sister Alice, who had resided in the country for many years. Upon arrival, Lloyd and Dillon were refused entry when the authorities found out that they were not married, as they had claimed when applying for entry visas. They were detained and threatened with deportation on the grounds of <a href="moral%20turpitude">moral turpitude</a> and were sent to <a href="Ellis%20Island">Ellis Island</a> while an enquiry took place. Dillon was charged under the <a href="Mann%20Act">White Slave Act</a> with attempting to take into the country a woman who was not his wife, and Lloyd was charged with being a passive agent. After a lengthy enquiry, a surety of $300 each, and an imposed condition that they were to live apart while in America, the couple were allowed to stay until March 1914. Alice later stated that "the indignity of the subsequent experience [while in custody] went to Marie's heart in a way she never survived. She could not bear to talk of that awful twenty-four hours."
Despite the problems, the tour was a success, and Lloyd performed to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs "The Tiddly Wink", "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, partly due to the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, <a href="Edward%20Franklin%20Albee%20II">Edward Albee</a>, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The "New York Telegraph" speculated "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition." Back in England, Hurley had died of <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a> and <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying "until we meet again". She was reported in "<a href="The%20Morning%20Telegraph">The Morning Telegraph</a>" as saying: "With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends." Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, the ceremony taking place at the British <a href="Consulate">Consulate</a> in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>. When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, "[I will] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered."

Lloyd and Dillon returned to England in June 1914. Lloyd started a provincial tour of Liverpool, <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a>, <a href="Southend">Southend</a>, Birmingham and <a href="Margate">Margate</a>, and finished the summer season at the London Hippodrome. She sang "The Coster Honeymoon in Paris" and "Who Paid the Rent for Mrs Rip Van Winkle?", the latter of which had been received particularly well with her American audiences. Within a fortnight, Britain was <a href="World%20War%20I">at war</a>, which threw the music-hall world into disarray. The atmosphere in London's music halls had turned patriotic, and theatre proprietors often held charity events and benefits to help the <a href="war%20effort">war effort</a>. Lloyd played her part and frequently visited hospitals, including the Ulster Volunteer Force Hospital in <a href="Belfast">Belfast</a>, where she interacted with wounded servicemen. She also toured munitions factories to help boost public morale, but received no official recognition for her work. During 1914, she scored a hit with "A Little of What you Fancy", which critics thought captured her life perfectly up until that point. The song is about a middle-aged woman who encourages the younger generation to enjoy themselves, rather than indulging in life's excitement herself. During the rendition, Lloyd depicts a young couple who cuddle and kiss on a railway carriage, while she sits back and recalls memories of her doing the same in years gone by.

In January 1915, Lloyd appeared at the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace">Crystal Palace</a> where she entertained over ten thousand troops. At the end of that year, she performed her only war song, "Now You've Got your Khaki On", composed for her by Charles Collins and Fred W. Leigh, about a woman who found the army uniform sexy and thought that wearing it made the average pot-bellied gentleman look like a muscle-toned soldier. Lloyd's brother John appeared with her on stage dressed as a soldier and helped characterise the ditty. Following this, she sang the already well-established songs "If You Want to Get On in Revue", which depicted a young girl who offered sexual favours to promote her theatrical career, and "The Three Ages of Woman", which took a cynical look at men from a woman's perspective. She seldom toured during the war, but briefly performed in <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>, <a href="Watford">Watford</a> and <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> in 1916. By the end of that year, she had suffered a nervous breakdown which she blamed on her hectic workload and a delayed reaction to Hurley's death. During the war years, Lloyd's public image had deteriorated. Her biographer Midge Gillies thought that Lloyd's violent relationship with Dillon and professional snubs in public had left the singer feeling like "someone's mother, rather than their sweetheart."

In July 1916, Dillon was conscripted into the army, but disliked the discipline of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers, but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials that he was too obese to carry out military duties. On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions. One night, Lloyd's friend Bella Burge received a knock at the front door to find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises. When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband. By 1917, Dillon's drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife. Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table. Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month's hard labour. Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse. That year, she was earning £470 per week performing in music halls and making special appearances. By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts, and began feeling sidelined by her peers; <a href="Vesta%20Tilley">Vesta Tilley</a> had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty. The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, "<a href="My%20Old%20Man%20%28Said%20Follow%20the%20Van%29">My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)</a>", which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins. The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man. The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London at the beginning of the 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.

In July 1919, Lloyd was again left off the cast list for the Royal Variety Performance, which paid tribute to the acts who helped raise money and boost morale during the war years. She was devastated at the snub and grew bitter towards her rivals who had been acknowledged. Her biographer Midge Gillies compared Lloyd to a "talented old aunt who must be allowed to have her turn at the piano even though all everyone really wants is jazz or go to the Picture Palace". She toured <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> in 1919, and in 1920 she was earning £11,000 a year. Despite the high earnings, she was living beyond her means, with a reckless tendency to spend money. She was famous for her generosity, but was unable to differentiate between those in need and those who simply exploited her kindness. Her extravagant tastes, an accumulation of <a href="writ">writ</a>s from disgruntled theatre managers, an inability to save money, and generous hand-outs to friends and family, resulted in severe money troubles during the final years of her life.

In 1920, Lloyd appeared twice at <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a> Magistrates Court and gave evidence of the abuse she had suffered from Dillon. Soon afterwards, she separated from him and, as a result, became depressed. When asked by <a href="Counsel">prosecutors</a> how many times Dillon had assaulted her since Christmas 1919, Lloyd replied "I cannot tell you, there were so many [occasions]. It has happened for years, time after time, always when he is drunk." By now, she was becoming increasingly unreliable on stage; she appeared at a theatre in Cardiff for a mere six minutes before being carried off by stage hands. During the performance, she seemed dazed and confused, and she stumbled across the stage. She was conscious of her weak performances and frequently cried between shows. <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a> was among the audience at the Bedford Music Hall on 8 April 1921 and described Lloyd as "A mass of corruption – long front teeth – a crapulous way of saying 'desire', and yet a born artist – scarcely able to walk, waddling, aged, unblushing."

In April 1922, Lloyd collapsed in her dressing room after singing "The Cosmopolitan Girl" at the Gateshead Empire in Cardiff. Her doctor diagnosed exhaustion, and she returned to the stage in August. Her voice became weak, and she reduced her act to a much shorter running time. Her biographer <a href="Naomi%20Jacob">Naomi Jacob</a> thought that Lloyd was "growing old, and [she] was determined to show herself to her public as she really was ... an old, grey-faced, tired woman". On 12 August 1921, Lloyd failed to show for an appearance at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a>, choosing instead to stay at home and write her will.

In early 1922, Lloyd moved in with her sister Daisy to save money. On 4 October, against her doctor's advice, she appeared at the Empire Music Hall in <a href="Edmonton%2C%20London">Edmonton</a>, North London, where she sang "I'm One of the Ruins That Cromwell Knocked About a Bit". Her performance was weak, and she was unsteady on her feet, eventually falling over on stage. Her erratic and brief performance proved hilarious for the audience, who thought that it was all part of the act. Three days later, while appearing at the Alhambra Theatre, she was taken ill on stage and was found later in her dressing room crippled with pain, complaining of stomach cramps. She returned home later that evening, where she died of heart and kidney failure three days later, aged 52. More than 50,000 people attended her funeral at <a href="Hampstead%20Cemetery">Hampstead Cemetery</a> on 12 October 1922. Lloyd was penniless at the time of her death and her estate, which was worth £7,334, helped to pay off debts that she and Dillon had incurred over the years.

Writing in "<a href="The%20Dial">The Dial</a>" magazine the following month, <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a> claimed: "Among [the] small number of music-hall performers, whose names are familiar to what is called the lower class, Marie Lloyd had far the strongest hold on popular affection." Her biographer and friend MacQueen-Pope thought that Lloyd was "going downhill of her own volition. The complaint was incurable, some might call it heartbreak, perhaps a less sentimental diagnosis is disillusionment." The <a href="impersonator">impersonator</a> Charles Austin paid tribute by saying "I have lost an old pal, and the public has lost its principal stage favourite, one who can never be replaced."

Silverchair were an Australian <a href="Rock%20music">rock</a> band, which formed in 1992 as Innocent Criminals in <a href="Merewether%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Merewether</a>, <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a> with the line-up of <a href="Ben%20Gillies">Ben Gillies</a> on drums, <a href="Daniel%20Johns">Daniel Johns</a> on vocals and guitars, and <a href="Chris%20Joannou">Chris Joannou</a> on bass guitar. The group got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a national demo competition conducted by <a href="SBS%20One">SBS TV</a> show "Nomad" and ABC radio station, <a href="Triple%20J">Triple J</a>. The band was signed by <a href="Murmur%20%28record%20label%29">Murmur</a>, and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages.

During their career, Silverchair won more <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards">ARIA Music Awards</a> than any other artist in history with 21 wins from 49 nominations. The band have also received six <a href="APRA%20Awards%20%28Australia%29">APRA Awards</a> with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the <a href="APRA%20Awards%20of%202008">2008 ceremony</a>. All five of their studio albums have debuted at number-one on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Albums Chart</a>: "<a href="Frogstomp">Frogstomp</a>" (1995), "<a href="Freak%20Show%20%28album%29">Freak Show</a>" (1997), "<a href="Neon%20Ballroom">Neon Ballroom</a>" (1999), "<a href="Diorama%20%28Silverchair%20album%29">Diorama</a>" (2002) and "<a href="Young%20Modern">Young Modern</a>" (2007). Three of the group's singles have reached number-one on the related ARIA Singles Chart: "<a href="Tomorrow%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Tomorrow</a>" (1994), "<a href="Freak%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Freak</a>" (1997) and "<a href="Straight%20Lines%20%28song%29">Straight Lines</a>" (2007).

Silverchair's <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> sound had evolved throughout their career, differing styles on specific albums steadily growing more ambitious over the years, from <a href="grunge">grunge</a> on their debut to more recent work displaying orchestral and <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a> influences. The songwriting and singing of Johns had evolved steadily while the band had developed an increased element of complexity. In 2003, following the release of "Diorama", the band announced a <a href="wikt%3Ahiatus">hiatus</a>, during which time members recorded with side projects <a href="The%20Dissociatives">The Dissociatives</a>, <a href="The%20Mess%20Hall">The Mess Hall</a>, and <a href="Tambalane">Tambalane</a>. Silverchair were reunited at the 2005 <a href="Wave%20Aid">Wave Aid</a> concerts. In 2007, they released their fifth album, "<a href="Young%20Modern">Young Modern</a>", and played the <a href="Across%20the%20Great%20Divide%20tour">Across the Great Divide tour</a> with contemporaries <a href="Powderfinger">Powderfinger</a>. In May of 2011, Silverchair announced an indefinite hiatus. As of January 2019, Silverchair have sold over 10 million albums worldwide.

Silverchair's founders, <a href="Ben%20Gillies">Ben Gillies</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Johns">Daniel Johns</a>, attended the same primary school in the <a href="Newcastle%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Newcastle</a> suburb of <a href="Merewether%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Merewether</a>. As teenagers, singer-guitarist Johns and drummer Gillies, started playing music together – in one class they built a stage out of desks and played rap songs for their schoolmates. When they moved on to <a href="Newcastle%20High%20School%20%28Australia%29">Newcastle High School</a>, a fellow student, <a href="Chris%20Joannou">Chris Joannou</a>, joined the pair on bass guitar. In 1992, they formed Innocent Criminals with Tobin Finane as a second guitarist – but he soon left. They played numerous shows around the <a href="Hunter%20Region">Hunter Region</a> in their early teens, their repertoire was cover versions of <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a> and <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>. In 1994 Innocent Criminals entered YouthRock, a national competition for school-based bands and placed first ahead of older competition. Early in the year they recorded demos of "Acid Rain", "Cicada", "Pure Massacre" and "<a href="Tomorrow%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Tomorrow</a>" at Platinum Sound Studios.

In April, the band's mainstream breakthrough came when they won a national competition called Pick Me, using their demo of "Tomorrow". The competition was conducted by the <a href="Special%20Broadcasting%20Service">SBS</a> TV show "Nomad" and <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (ABC) alternative radio station <a href="Triple%20J">Triple J</a>. As part of the prize, Triple J recorded the song and ABC filmed a <a href="music%20video">video</a>, which was aired on 16 June. For the video's broadcast, they had changed their name to Silverchair (styled as silverchair until 2002). In a 1994 interview with Melbourne magazine "Buzz", the band claimed the name derived from a radio request for "<a href="Sliver%20%28song%29">Sliver</a>" by <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a> and "<a href="Berlin%20Chair">Berlin Chair</a>" by <a href="You%20Am%20I">You Am I</a> being mixed up as Silver Chair. It was later revealed they were named for the <a href="C.%20S.%20Lewis">C. S. Lewis</a>-penned novel "<a href="The%20Silver%20Chair">The Silver Chair</a>" from "<a href="The%20Chronicles%20of%20Narnia">The Chronicles of Narnia</a>" series.

Following a bidding war between rival labels, Silverchair signed a three-album recording contract with <a href="Sony%20Music">Sony Music</a> subsidiary <a href="Murmur%20%28record%20label%29">Murmur Records</a>. Initially the group were managed by their parents. Sony A&R manager John Watson, who was jointly responsible for signing the group, subsequently left the label to become their band manager. In September, their Triple J recording of "Tomorrow" was released as a four-track extended play. From late October, it spent six weeks at number-one on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Singles Chart</a>. In 1995, a re-recorded version of "Tomorrow" (and a new video) was made for the United States market, becoming the most played song on US modern rock radio that year.

Silverchair's debut album, "<a href="Frogstomp">Frogstomp</a>", was recorded in nine days with production by <a href="Kevin%20Shirley">Kevin Shirley</a> (<a href="Lime%20Spiders">Lime Spiders</a>, <a href="Peter%20Wells%20%28guitarist%29">Peter Wells</a>) and was released in March 1995. At the time of recording, the band members were 15 years old, and still attending high school. "Frogstomp"'s lyrical concepts were fiction-based, drawing inspiration from television, hometown tragedies, and perceptions of the pain of friends. The album was well received: <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> and "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" rated it in four and four-and-a-half stars respectively, praising the intensity of the album, especially "Tomorrow". Aside from Innocent Criminals, the band has used The George Costanza Trio and Short Elvis as aliases.

"Frogstomp" was a number-one album in Australia and New Zealand. It reached the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> Top 10, making Silverchair the first Australian band to do so since <a href="INXS">INXS</a>. It was certified as a US double-<a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">platinum album</a> by the <a href="RIAA">RIAA</a>, triple-platinum in Canada by the <a href="Music%20Canada">CRIA</a> and multi-platinum in Australia. The album sold more than 4 million copies worldwide."Paste" magazine called this album the "<a href="last%20stand">last stand</a>" of <a href="grunge">grunge</a>. As "Frogstomp" and "Tomorrow" continued to gain popularity through 1995, the group toured the US where they supported <a href="Red%20Hot%20Chili%20Peppers">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> in June, <a href="The%20Ramones">The Ramones</a> in September, and played on the roof of <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a> at the <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award">MTV Music Awards</a> – in between touring they continued their secondary education in Newcastle. At the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%201995">ARIA Music Awards of 1995</a>, the band won five awards out of nine nominations. To collect their awards on the night they sent Josh Shirley, the young son of the album's producer.

In a January 1996 murder case, the defendant counsel for Brian Bassett, 16, and Nicholaus McDonald, 18, of <a href="McCleary%2C%20Washington">McCleary, Washington</a>, claimed that the pair listened to "<a href="Israel%27s%20Son">Israel's Son</a>", from "Frogstomp", which contributed to the murder of Bassett's parents and a younger brother. McDonald's lawyer cited the lyrics "'Hate is what I feel for you/I want you to know that I want you dead'" which were "almost a script. They're relevant to everything that happened". The band's manager, Watson, issued a statement that they did not condone nor intend any such acts of violence. Prosecutors rejected the defence case and convinced the jury that the murder was committed to "steal money and belongings and run off to California."

Silverchair began recording their second studio album, "<a href="Freak%20Show%20%28album%29">Freak Show</a>", in May 1996 while experiencing the success of "Frogstomp" in Australia and the US. It was produced by <a href="Nick%20Launay">Nick Launay</a> (<a href="Birthday%20Party%20%28band%29">Birthday Party</a>, <a href="Models%20%28band%29">Models</a>, <a href="Midnight%20Oil">Midnight Oil</a>) and was released in February 1997. The album reached number-one in Australia and yielded three Top 10 singles – "<a href="Freak%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Freak</a>", "<a href="Abuse%20Me%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Abuse Me</a>", and "<a href="Cemetery%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Cemetery</a>". Its fourth single, "<a href="The%20Door%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">The Door</a>", reached No. 25. The songs focused on the anger and backlash that the expectations of "Frogstomp" brought upon the band. "Freak Show" was certified gold in the US, 2× platinum in Australia and global sales eventually exceeded 1.5 million copies.

By late 1997, the trio had completed their secondary education and, from May 1998, they worked on their third album, "<a href="Neon%20Ballroom">Neon Ballroom</a>" which had Launay producing again. It was released in March 1999 and peaked at number-one in Australia. McFarlane said, "As well as being the band's best album to date, it was universally acknowledged as one of the best albums of the year." The band originally intended to take a 12-month-break, but in the end decided to devote their time to making music. "Neon Ballroom" provided three Australian top 20 singles: "<a href="Anthem%20for%20the%20Year%202000">Anthem for the Year 2000</a>", "<a href="Ana%27s%20Song%20%28Open%20Fire%29">Ana's Song (Open Fire)</a>" and "<a href="Miss%20You%20Love">Miss You Love</a>"; a fourth single, "Paint Pastel Princess", did not reach the top 50. The albums charted well internationally: "Freak Show" reached No. 2 in Canada, and "Neon Ballroom" reached No. 5. Both reached the top 40 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">United Kingdom Albums Chart</a>. "Abuse Me" reached No. 4 on "Billboard"'s <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Hot Modern Rock Tracks</a> and <a href="Hot%20Mainstream%20Rock%20Tracks">Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks</a> charts. "Ana's Song (Open Fire)" peaked at No. 12 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks.

In 1999, Johns announced that he had developed the eating disorder <a href="anorexia%20nervosa">anorexia nervosa</a>, due to anxiety. Johns noted that the lyrics to "Ana's Song (Open Fire)" dealt with his disorder, where he would "eat what he needed … to stay awake." He revealed that his eating problems developed from the time of "Freak Show" and when "Neon Ballroom" was written he "hated music, really everything about it", but felt that he "couldn't stop doing it; I felt like a slave to it." Johns sought therapy and medication but felt "It's easier for me to express it through music and lyrics".

Silverchair added an auxiliary keyboardist, Sam Holloway (ex-<a href="Cordrazine%20%28band%29">Cordrazine</a>), for the Neon Ballroom Tour. The US leg had the group playing with <a href="The%20Offspring">The Offspring</a> and Red Hot Chili Peppers, while Silverchair's tour of UK and European had <a href="The%20Living%20End">The Living End</a> as the support act. "Rolling Stone"'s Neva Chonin attributed their chart success to the album's more "mature" sound. In Europe and South America it became the group's most successful album to date. The group appeared at festivals in <a href="Reading%20Festival">Reading</a> and <a href="Edgefest">Edgefest</a>, amongst others. Following the tour, the band announced that they would be taking a 12-month-break. Their only live performance in 2000 was at the <a href="Falls%20Festival">Falls Festival</a> on New Year's Eve. On 21 January 2001, the band played to 250,000 people at <a href="Rock%20in%20Rio%23Rock%20in%20Rio%203">Rock in Rio</a>, a show they described as the highlight of their career.

After the release of "Neon Ballroom", Silverchair's three-album contract with Sony Music had ended. The group eventually signed with <a href="Atlantic%20Records">Atlantic Records</a> for North and South America, and formed their own label with Watson, (distributed by <a href="EMI">EMI</a>), for Australia and Asia. In November 2000, after the group had left the label, Sony issued "<a href="The%20Best%20of%20Silverchair%20Volume%201">The Best of Volume 1</a>" without the band's involvement. Johns disavowed the compilation, "We thought about putting out ads in the street press to make people aware that we weren't endorsing it, but that would have blown the whole thing out of proportion ... If people want to buy it, they can buy it but I wouldn't buy it if I was a silverchair fan."

In June 2001, Silverchair entered a studio in Sydney with producer <a href="David%20Bottrill">David Bottrill</a> (<a href="Tool%20%28band%29">Tool</a>, <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>, <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a>) to start work on their fourth album, "<a href="Diorama%20%28Silverchair%20album%29">Diorama</a>". Johns formally assumed the role of a co-producer. The album name means "a world within a world". Most tracks came from Johns' new-found method of writing material on a piano, a technique he developed during the band's break after "Neon Ballroom".

In order to complete the vision for "Diorama", several other musicians contributed to the album, including <a href="Van%20Dyke%20Parks">Van Dyke Parks</a>, who provided orchestral arrangements to "Tuna in the Brine", "<a href="Luv%20Your%20Life">Luv Your Life</a>", and "<a href="Across%20the%20Night">Across the Night</a>". <a href="Paul%20Mac">Paul Mac</a> (from <a href="Itch-E%20and%20Scratch-E">Itch-E and Scratch-E</a>) and <a href="Jim%20Moginie">Jim Moginie</a> (from Midnight Oil) both on piano also collaborated with the band. While recording "Diorama", Johns referred to himself as an artist, rather than simply being in a "rock band". Upon its release, critics commented that the album was more artistic than previous works.

Early in December, the first single, "<a href="The%20Greatest%20View">The Greatest View</a>", was released to Australian radio networks. Its physical release in January 2002 coincided with the band's appearance on the <a href="Big%20Day%20Out">Big Day Out</a> tour. Early in 2002, Johns was diagnosed with <a href="reactive%20arthritis">reactive arthritis</a> which made it difficult for him to play the guitar and subsequent performances supporting the album's release were cancelled. In March, "Diorama" was issued and topped the ARIA Albums Chart – it became their fourth number-one album and spent 50 weeks in the top 50.

Five singles were released from the album: "The Greatest View", "<a href="Without%20You%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">Without You</a>", "Luv Your Life", "Across the Night", and "<a href="After%20All%20These%20Years%20%28Silverchair%20song%29">After All These Years</a>" – "The Greatest View" charted highest, reaching No. 3. In October, Silverchair were successful at the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202002">ARIA Music Awards of 2002</a>, winning five awards including 'Best Rock Album' and 'Best Group', and 'Producer of the Year' for Johns. The band played "The Greatest View" at the ceremony: the song was also nominated for 'Best Video'. Two singles (and a related video) were nominated for further ARIA Awards in <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202003">2003</a>. Following the 2002 ARIA Awards, the band announced an indefinite hiatus. Johns said it was necessary "given the fact the band were together for over a decade and yet were only, on average, 23 years old". From March to June 2003, Silverchair undertook the Across the Night Tour to perform "Diorama". Their hometown performance on 19 April was recorded as "<a href="Live%20from%20Faraway%20Stables">Live from Faraway Stables</a>" for a 2×CD and 2xDVD released in November. After the tour finished in June the group announced an indefinite <a href="wikt%3Ahiatus">hiatus</a>.

In 2000, while also working with Silverchair, Johns and Mac released an internet-only EP, "<a href="I%20Can%27t%20Believe%20It%27s%20Not%20Rock">I Can't Believe It's Not Rock</a>". In mid-2003, during Silverchair's hiatus, the pair re-united and formed <a href="The%20Dissociatives">The Dissociatives</a>, releasing a <a href="The%20Dissociatives%20%28album%29">self-titled album</a> in April 2004. The duo provided the theme music for the popular ABC-TV music quiz show "<a href="Spicks%20and%20Specks%20%28TV%20series%29">Spicks and Specks</a>" – as a reworking of the <a href="Bee%20Gees">Bee Gees</a>' 1966 hit of the <a href="Spicks%20and%20Specks%20%28song%29">same name</a>. Johns also collaborated with then-wife <a href="Natalie%20Imbruglia">Natalie Imbruglia</a> on her "<a href="Counting%20Down%20the%20Days">Counting Down the Days</a>" album, released in April 2005.

Joannou worked with <a href="blues-rock">blues-rock</a> group <a href="The%20Mess%20Hall">The Mess Hall</a>; he co-produced – with <a href="Matt%20Lovell">Matt Lovell</a> – their six-track extended play, "<a href="Feeling%20Sideways">Feeling Sideways</a>", which was released in May 2003. The album was nominated for the ARIA Award for 'Best Independent Release' in 2003. Joannou and Lovell co-produced The Mess Hall's studio album, "<a href="Notes%20from%20a%20Ceiling">Notes from a Ceiling</a>" which was issued in June 2005. Joannou and Lovell received a nomination at the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202005">ARIA Music Awards of 2005</a> for 'Producer of the Year'. In 2003, Gillies formed <a href="Tambalane">Tambalane</a> with <a href="Wes%20Carr">Wes Carr</a>, initially as a song-writing project, they released a self-titled album in 2005 and toured Australia.

The <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Boxing Day tsunami</a> resulted in the <a href="WaveAid">WaveAid</a> fund-raising concert held in January 2005: Silverchair performed to help raise funds for aid organisations working in disaster affected areas. As a result of WaveAid the band decided to resume working together. Gillies explained the band's reunion as due to a special "chemistry" between band members, telling "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>", "It only took us 15 years, but recently we've realised, 'We've really got something special and we should just go for it.'"

After performing at Wave Aid, Silverchair reunited and by late 2005 began preparations for their next studio album, "<a href="Young%20Modern">Young Modern</a>". Johns had written about 50 songs during the hiatus for a possible solo album or other project but decided to use them for Silverchair. In 2006, after five weeks practice the group demoed tracks in the <a href="Hunter%20Region">Hunter Region</a>, and then recorded at Los Angeles' Seedy Underbelly Studios with Launay as producer. Parks again arranged orchestral tracks for the band – they travelled to <a href="Prague">Prague</a> to record with the <a href="Czech%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Czech Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. The group also used Mac, <a href="Luke%20Steele%20%28singer%29">Luke Steele</a> (<a href="The%20Sleepy%20Jackson">The Sleepy Jackson</a>) and <a href="Julian%20Hamilton">Julian Hamilton</a> (<a href="The%20Presets">The Presets</a>, The Dissociatives) – Hamilton also co-wrote songs with Johns. Silverchair self-funded the album's production to ease the pressures faced previously when working with a record label.

The band toured extensively before releasing the album, performing at <a href="Homebake">Homebake</a> and numerous other shows. Both Mac and Hamilton joined the tour as auxiliary members providing keyboards. In October, they performed a cover of <a href="Midnight%20Oil">Midnight Oil</a>'s 1981 single, "Don't Wanna Be the One", at the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202006">ARIA Music Awards of 2006</a> as part of that band's induction into the <a href="ARIA%20Hall%20of%20Fame">ARIA Hall of Fame</a>. During the performance Johns spray-painted "PG 4 PM" (<a href="Peter%20Garrett">Peter Garrett</a> for Prime Minister) on a stage wall, paying tribute to that band's front-man, then a Federal Member of Parliament and Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts.

"Young Modern" was released in March 2007, as was the first single, "<a href="Straight%20Lines%20%28song%29">Straight Lines</a>". Three more singles, "<a href="Reflections%20of%20a%20Sound">Reflections of a Sound</a>", "<a href="If%20You%20Keep%20Losing%20Sleep">If You Keep Losing Sleep</a>", and "<a href="Mind%20Reader%20%28song%29">Mind Reader</a>", were subsequently released. "Young Modern" became the fifth Silverchair album to top the ARIA Albums chart – they became the first artists to have five number-one albums. "Straight Lines" also became the band's third No. 1 single in Australia. In June, Silverchair and fellow rock group <a href="Powderfinger">Powderfinger</a> announced the <a href="Across%20the%20Great%20Divide%20Tour">Across the Great Divide Tour</a>. The tour promoted the efforts of <a href="Reconciliation%20Australia">Reconciliation Australia</a> in mending the 17-year gap in life expectancy between <a href="Indigenous%20Australia">Indigenous</a> and non-Indigenous children. Support acts on the tour were <a href="John%20Butler%20%28musician%29">John Butler</a>, <a href="Missy%20Higgins">Missy Higgins</a>, <a href="Kev%20Carmody">Kev Carmody</a>, <a href="Troy%20Cassar-Daley">Troy Cassar-Daley</a>, <a href="Clare%20Bowditch">Clare Bowditch</a> and <a href="Deborah%20Conway">Deborah Conway</a>.

"Young Modern" and "Straight Lines" each won three awards at the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202007">ARIA Music Awards of 2007</a>, taking Silverchair's total to 20. The group also won three <a href="APRA%20Awards%20%28Australia%29">APRA Awards</a> for their song "Straight Lines", including Songwriter of the Year, which Johns was awarded for a record third time. At the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202008">ARIA Music Awards of 2008</a> both Silverchair and Powderfinger won 'Best Music DVD' for "<a href="Across%20the%20Great%20Divide%20Tour%20%28DVD%29">Across the Great Divide</a>", for Silverchair this was their 21st win from 49 nominations.

According to Silverchair's website, as of June 2009, the group had begun work on the follow-up to "Young Modern", they had spent three weeks recording in Australia with future sessions earmarked for later that year. No release date was set, but the band uploaded in-studio videos of them working on several tracks to their official website. In December, Johns called in to Triple J's breakfast show, "Robbie, Marieke and The Doctor", and discussed the band's new album which they were working on in Newcastle. He told them "the main difference is there's a lot of experimentation with instruments and synths... I think there's only guitar on four songs out of fifty so far," but added the new material is "surprisingly rocky given there's no guitar." In April 2010, via the band's website, Joannou announced that they would perform two new songs called "16" and "Machina Collecta" at May's Groovin the Moo festival. He said work was progressing well and confirmed there was, as yet, no title for the proposed album and that they were simply referring to it as "Album No. 6". The final concert of the festival was at <a href="Bunbury%2C%20Western%20Australia">Bunbury</a> on 15 May. By year's end, work on the album had stopped as each member pursued other interests.

On 25 May 2011, Silverchair announced an indefinite hiatus:

"Sydney Morning Herald"s music writer, <a href="Bernard%20Zuel">Bernard Zuel</a>, said the band's use of "indefinite hibernation" was a way to soften the blow of the group's break-up for fans; he expected future reunions and performances for worthy causes. By June, Gillies was in the final stages of about 12 months of working on his solo album and he said that it was not a continuation of his earlier work with Tambalane. In October, Johns was working on the soundtrack for "My Mind's Own Melody" – a short film. In May 2012 Johns recorded the new anthem for <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a> titled 'Atlas.' It is the first piece of commercial music Johns has composed.

The members of Silverchair have stated that they have not ruled out a reunion. Gillies has said that there are plans to release a new Silverchair album, which was almost finished before the hiatus.

Silverchair are generally classified as an <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> and <a href="grunge">grunge</a> band, although their loyalty to specific genres has changed as they have matured. Much of the band's early grunge and post-grunge work was inspired by Nirvana, <a href="Pearl%20Jam">Pearl Jam</a>, <a href="Soundgarden">Soundgarden</a>, <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a> and <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>. According to Australian rock music historian <a href="Ian%20McFarlane">Ian McFarlane</a>, ""frogstomp" captured the tempo of the times with its mix of Soundgarden/Pearl Jam/Bush post-grunge noise and teenage lyrical angst."

In their early years the perceived stylistic similarities led to Silverchair being derisively dubbed as 'silverhighchair', 'not Soundgarden but ' or 'Nirvana in Pyjamas' by the Australian media. The latter is a sarcastic conflated reference to the band's youth and the popular Australian children's TV series "<a href="Bananas%20in%20Pyjamas">Bananas in Pyjamas</a>". McFarlane stated ""Freak Show" and tracks like 'Freak' were firmly in Nirvana territory with a hint of Led Zeppelin's Eastern mysticism". Gillies noted that the band were inspired by the <a href="Seattle%20Sound">Seattle Sound</a>, as well as <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> and <a href="The%20Doors">The Doors</a>, and were highly impressionable in their youth. Johns admitted that "We were always influenced a lot by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin it just so happened that we weren't very good at playing that style of music. So we were put in the whole grunge category because it was such a garage-y, heavy music term."

Australian rock music journalist <a href="Ed%20Nimmervoll">Ed Nimmervoll</a> felt that Johns "had never intended to use his problems for inspiration, but in the end the music was the best way to unburden himself. 'Neon Ballroom' took six months to record. The album's passion and musical sophistication proved to the world that silverchair were a force to be reckoned with". According to "<a href="100%20Best%20Australian%20Albums">100 Best Australian Albums</a>", by three fellow journalists, <a href="John%20O%27Donnell%20%28music%20journalist%29">John O'Donnell</a>, <a href="Toby%20Creswell">Toby Creswell</a> and <a href="Craig%20Mathieson">Craig Mathieson</a>, "Neon Ballroom"s lead-in track, "Emotion Sickness", described Johns' life in the 1990s and "addressed [his] desire to move beyond the imitative sounds of Silverchair's first two albums ... and create something new and original". "Ana's Song (Open Fire)" directly focussed on his eating disorder; "[it] became a hit all over the world and opened up for discussion the fact that males could also be affected by anorexia."

Allmusic's <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> felt "Diorama" "was a shockingly creative and impressive step forward that showed the band shedding its grunge past and adding horns, strings, and mature lyrics to its arsenal." Fellow Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano noted that "they somehow kept going and kept improving ... Silverchair has grown up and put together a fine mix of orchestral pop and rock on Diorama." Bernard Zuel described how the "Diorama" concert tour marked a move from hard rock towards <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a>: "they stepped out of the arenas and barns and 'got classy' ... finally having admitted to harbouring artistic ambition (a very un-Australian band thing to do), they've proved they have the ability".

In writing "Young Modern", Johns tried to make the music sound very simple, despite a complex musical structure. The lyrics were written after the music was created, sometimes as late as the day of recording. As Johns dreads writing lyrics, he suggested that the band could produce an instrumental album at some stage in the future. Johns is the band's primary songwriter, and notes that while Joannou and Gillies do not have significant influence on what he writes, they are key to the band's overall sound. For that album, Hamilton co-wrote four songs with Johns including the APRA Award-winning "Straight Lines". Joannou believed that "Young Modern" was simpler than "Diorama" but "still as complex underneath with simple pop song elements". He said that much of the band's success resulted from trying to push themselves harder in recording and writing. Self-producing has allowed the band to do so without the pressures of a record label.

Gillies notes that Silverchair will often "run the risk of losing fans" with their work, and this was evident in the changes in musical direction in "Diorama" and "Young Modern". However, he described this as a good thing, describing the fact "that we haven't been pigeonholed, and people really don't know what to expect" as one of the attractive elements of the band. Despite the ups and downs of success at a young age, Gillies says the band "appreciate what we've achieved and what we've got" in their careers. The band have received six <a href="APRA%20Awards%20%28Australia%29">APRA Awards</a> with Johns winning three songwriting awards at the <a href="APRA%20Awards%20of%202008">2008 ceremony</a>.

"Frogstomp" was described as similar to Nirvana and Pearl Jam; Erlewine noted that it followed in "the alternative rock tradition" of those bands. Erlewine also stated that "their songwriting abilities aren't as strong" as those of their peers. However, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" claimed that the band had risen above their peers, applauding Johns' "ragged vocals". "<a href="Herald%20Sun">Herald Sun</a>" journalist Nue Te Koha praised "Frogstomp" for "breaking the drought of Australian music making an impact overseas". However, he felt "It is highly debatable whether the three teens have gone to the world with a new sound or something identifiably Australian ... Silverchair's image and sound are blatantly ... Nirvana meets Pearl Jam". Nimmervoll disputed Te Koha's view, "It's not original, it's not Australian. Bah, humbug ... It's just as well Britain didn't say the same thing when The Beatles reinvented American R&B".

"Freak Show" saw the band show more of their own musical style, rather than copying others, and thus received more praise for its songwriting than its predecessor. <a href="Yahoo%21%20Music">Yahoo! Music</a>'s Sandy Masuo described the lyrics as "moving" and "emotional". Johns' vocal delivery was complemented: his "bittersweet, crackly voice tops the ample power chordage ... [he] hits shivery, emotional notes that convey both sweet idealism and disappointment". Zuel felt that with this album, the band "have outgrown the jokes, predictions and their own understated teenage ambitions to find they have become (gasp!) career musicians."

In "100 Best Australian Albums" (2010) their third album, "Neon Ballroom", was placed at No. 25 according to its authors. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" approved of the further advancement in "Neon Ballroom", commenting on "plush strings on these adult arrangements". There were once again significant advancements in songwriting; Johns was described as "furious, motivated, and all grown up". However, "Rolling Stone" said the album seemed confused, commenting that Silverchair "can't decide what they want to do" with their music. Meanwhile, "Diorama" was seen as an extension of the band's originality, with its "[h]eavy orchestration, unpredictable melodic shifts and a whimsical pop sensibility". According to <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>' Nikki Tranter, the album stood out in an otherwise dull Australian music market.

Allmusic's Clayton Bolger described "Young Modern" as an improvement by the band, praising "catchy melodic hooks, inspired lyrical themes, and stunning string arrangements". He claimed the album was the pinnacle of the band's development. PopMatters' Nick Pearson saw the opposite, claiming that "[o]nce you reach the level of intellectual maturity where you can tell the difference between cryptic but poetic lyrics and nonsensical crap, you have outgrown Silverchair". Pearson called the album an attempt to secure a safer territory and assure sales, after the success of past works, calling it more boring than its predecessors. Other reviewers noted influences from cult British band <a href="XTC">XTC</a>.

In July 2009 "Tomorrow" was voted number 33 by the Australian public in Triple J's Hottest 100 of all time. As of January 2018, the group have sold 9 million albums worldwide. At the annual <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards">ARIA Music Awards</a>, Silverchair holds the record for the most nominated artist, with 49, and the most number of awards won, with 21. Their breakthrough year was in <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%201995">1995</a>, when they won five out of nine nominations, including 'Best New Talent', and 'Breakthrough Artist' for both album and single categories. Their most successful year was at the <a href="ARIA%20Music%20Awards%20of%202007">2007 ceremony</a> when they won six of eight nominations.

George Formby

George Formby, (born George Hoy Booth; 26 May 1904 – 6 March 1961), was an English actor, singer-songwriter and comedian who became known to a worldwide audience through his films of the 1930s and 1940s. On stage, screen and record he sang light, <a href="Novelty%20song">comical songs</a>, usually playing the <a href="ukulele">ukulele</a> or <a href="banjolele">banjolele</a>, and became the UK's highest-paid entertainer.

Born in <a href="Wigan">Wigan</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, he was the son of <a href="George%20Formby%20Sr">George Formby Sr</a>, from whom he later took his stage name. After an early career as a stable boy and jockey, Formby took to the <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> stage after the early death of his father in 1921. His early performances were taken exclusively from his father's act, including the same songs, jokes and characters. In 1923 he made two career-changing decisions – he purchased a ukulele, and married <a href="Beryl%20Ingham">Beryl Ingham</a>, a fellow performer who became his manager and transformed his act. She insisted that he appear on stage formally dressed, and introduced the ukulele to his performance. He started his recording career in 1926 and, from 1934, he increasingly worked in film to develop into a major star by the late 1930s and 1940s, and became the UK's most popular entertainer during those decades. The media historian Brian McFarlane writes that on film, Formby portrayed gormless Lancastrian innocents who would win through against some form of villainy, gaining the affection of an attractive middle-class girl in the process.

During the Second World War Formby worked extensively for the <a href="Entertainments%20National%20Service%20Association">Entertainments National Service Association</a> (ENSA), and entertained civilians and troops, and by 1946 it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel. After the war his career declined, although he toured <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">the Commonwealth</a>, and continued to appear in <a href="Variety%20show">variety</a> and <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>. His last television appearance was in December 1960, two weeks before the death of Beryl. He surprised people by announcing his engagement to a school teacher seven weeks after Beryl's funeral, but died in <a href="Preston%2C%20Lancashire">Preston</a> three weeks later, at the age of 56; he was buried in <a href="Warrington">Warrington</a>, alongside his father.

Formby's biographer, <a href="Jeffrey%20Richards">Jeffrey Richards</a>, considers that the actor "had been able to embody simultaneously Lancashire, the working classes, the people, and the nation." Formby was considered Britain's first properly home-grown screen comedian. He was an influence on future comedians—particularly <a href="Charlie%20Drake">Charlie Drake</a> and <a href="Norman%20Wisdom">Norman Wisdom</a>—and, culturally, on entertainers such as <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a>, who referred to him in their music. Since his death Formby has been the subject of five biographies, two television specials and two works of public sculpture.

George Formby was born George Hoy Booth at 3 Westminster Street, <a href="Wigan">Wigan</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, on 26 May 1904. He was the eldest of seven surviving children born to James Lawler Booth and his wife Eliza, Hoy, although this marriage was <a href="bigamous">bigamous</a> because Formby Sr was still married to his first wife, Martha Maria Salter, a twenty-year-old music hall performer. Booth was a successful <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a> comedian and singer who performed under the name <a href="George%20Formby%20Sr">George Formby</a> (he is now known as George Formby Sr). Formby Sr suffered from a chest ailment, identified variously as <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>, <a href="asthma">asthma</a> or <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, and would use the cough as part of the humour in his act, saying to the audience, "Bronchitis, I'm a bit tight tonight", or "coughing better tonight". One of his main characters was that of John Willie, an "archetypal Lancashire lad". In 1906 Formby Sr was earning £35 a week at the music halls, which rose to £325 a week by 1920, and Formby grew up in an affluent home. Formby Sr was so popular that <a href="Marie%20Lloyd">Marie Lloyd</a>, the influential music hall singer and actress, would only watch two acts: his and that of <a href="Dan%20Leno">Dan Leno</a>.
Formby was born blind owing to an obstructive <a href="caul">caul</a>, although his sight was restored during a violent coughing fit or sneeze when he was a few months old. After briefly attending school—at which he did not prosper, and did not learn to read or write—Formby was removed from formal education at the age of seven and sent to become a <a href="stable%20boy">stable boy</a>, briefly in Wiltshire and then in <a href="Middleham">Middleham</a>, Yorkshire. Formby Sr sent his son away to work as he was worried Formby would watch him on stage; he was against Formby following in his footsteps, saying "one fool in the family is enough". After a year working at Middleham, he was apprenticed to Thomas Scholfield at Epsom, where he ran his first professional races at the age of 10, when he weighed less than .

In 1915 Formby Sr allowed his son to appear on screen, taking the lead in "<a href="By%20the%20Shortest%20of%20Heads">By the Shortest of Heads</a>", a thriller directed by <a href="Bert%20Haldane">Bert Haldane</a> in which Formby played a stable boy who outwits a gang of villains and wins a £10,000 prize when he comes first in a horse race. The film is now considered <a href="lost%20film">lost</a>, with the last-known copy having been destroyed in 1940. Later in 1915, and with the closure of the English racing season because of the First World War, Formby moved to Ireland where he continued as a jockey until November 1918. Later that month he returned to England and raced for <a href="Edward%20Stanley%2C%2017th%20Earl%20of%20Derby">Lord Derby</a> at his <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Suffolk">Newmarket</a> stables. Formby continued as a jockey until 1921, although he never won a race.

On 8 February 1921 Formby Sr succumbed to his bronchial condition and died, at the age of 45; he was buried in the Catholic section of <a href="Warrington">Warrington Cemetery</a>. After his father's funeral Eliza took the young Formby to London to help him cope with his grief. While there, they visited the <a href="Victoria%20Palace%20Theatre">Victoria Palace Theatre</a>—where Formby Sr had previously been so successful—and saw a performance by the Tyneside comedian <a href="Tommy%20Dixon%20%28comedian%29">Tommy Dixon</a>. Dixon was performing a copy of Formby Sr's act, using the same songs, jokes, costumes and mannerisms, and billed himself as "The New George Formby", a name which angered Eliza and Formby even more. The performance prompted Formby to follow in his father's profession, a decision which was supported by Eliza. As he had never seen his father perform live, Formby found the imitation difficult and had to learn his father's songs from records, and the rest of his act and jokes from his mother.

On 21 March 1921 Formby gave his first professional appearance in a two-week run at the Hippodrome in <a href="Earlestown">Earlestown</a>, Lancashire, where he received a fee of £5 a week. In the show he was billed as George Hoy, using his mother's maiden name—he explained later that he did not want the Formby name to appear in small print. His father's name was used in the posters and advertising, George Hoy being described as "Comedian. (son of George Formby)". While still appearing in Earlestown Formby was hired to appear at the <a href="Moss%20Empires">Moss Empire</a> chain of theatres for £17 10s a week. His first night was unsuccessful and he later said of it, "I was the first turn, three minutes, died the death of a dog". He toured around venues in Northern England, although he was not well received, and was booed and hissed while performing in <a href="Blyth%2C%20Northumberland">Blyth, Northumberland</a>. As a result he experienced frequent periods of unemployment—up to three months at one point. Formby spent two years as a support act touring round the northern halls, and although he was poorly paid, his mother supported him financially.

In 1923 Formby started to play the ukulele, although the exact circumstances of how he came to play the instrument are unknown, and he introduced it into his act during a run at the Alhambra Theatre in Barnsley. When the songs—still his father's material—were well received, he changed his stage name to George Formby, and stopped using the John Willie character. Another significant event was his appearance in <a href="Castleford">Castleford</a>, <a href="West%20Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>, where appearing on the same bill was <a href="Beryl%20Ingham">Beryl Ingham</a>, an <a href="Accrington">Accrington</a>-born champion <a href="clogging">clogdancer</a> and actress who had won the All England Step Dancing title at the age of 11. Beryl, who had formed a dancing act with her sister, May, called "The Two Violets", had a low opinion of Formby's act, and later said that "if I'd had a bag of rotten tomatoes with me I'd have thrown them at him". Formby and Beryl entered into a relationship and married two years later, on 13 September 1924, at a <a href="register%20office">register office</a> in Wigan, with Formby's aunt and uncle as witnesses. Upon hearing the news, Eliza insisted on the couple having a church wedding, which followed two months later.
Beryl took over as George's manager, and changed aspects of his act, including the songs and jokes. She instructed him on how to use his hands, and how to work his audience. She also persuaded him to change his stage dress to <a href="black%20tie">black tie</a>—although he appeared in a range of other costumes too—and to take lessons in how to play the ukulele properly. By June 1926 he was proficient enough to earn a one-off record deal—negotiated by Beryl—to sing six of his father's songs for the <a href="The%20Winner%20Records">Edison Bell/Winner</a> label. Formby spent the next few years touring, largely in the north, but also appearing at the <a href="Shepherd%27s%20Bush%20Empire">Shepherd's Bush Empire</a>, his official London debut. Although he had a further recording session in October 1929, performing two songs for Dominion Records, "Beryl's avaricious demands would prevent any serious contract from coming George's way", according to <a href="David%20Bret">David Bret</a>, Formby's biographer. That changed in 1932, when Formby signed a three-year deal with <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a>. One of the songs he recorded in July was "Chinese Laundry Blues", telling the story of Mr Wu, which became one of his standard songs, and part of a long-running series of songs about the character. Over the course of his career Formby went on to record over 200 songs, around 90 of which were written by <a href="Fred%20Cliffe">Fred Cliffe</a> and <a href="Harry%20Gifford%20%28songwriter%29">Harry Gifford</a>. In the 1932 winter season Formby appeared in his first <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>, "<a href="Babes%20in%20the%20Wood">Babes in the Wood</a>", in Bolton, after which he toured with the "George Formby Road Show" around the north of England, with Beryl acting as the <a href="Master%20of%20ceremonies">commère</a>; the show also toured in 1934.

With Formby's growing success on stage, Beryl decided it was time for him to move into films. In 1934 she approached the producer <a href="Basil%20Dean">Basil Dean</a>, the head of <a href="Associated%20Talking%20Pictures">Associated Talking Pictures</a> (ATP). Although he expressed an interest in Formby, he did not like the associated demands from Beryl. She also met the representative of <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> in the UK, <a href="Irving%20Asher">Irving Asher</a>, who was dismissive, saying that Formby was "too stupid to play the bad guy and too ugly to play the hero." Three weeks later Formby was approached by <a href="John%20E.%20Blakeley">John E. Blakeley</a> of <a href="Blakeley%27s%20Productions">Blakeley's Productions</a>, who offered him a one-film deal.

The film, "<a href="Boots%21%20Boots%21">Boots! Boots!</a>", was shot on a budget of £3,000 in a one-room studio in <a href="Albany%20Street">Albany Street</a>, London. Formby played the John Willie character, while Beryl also appeared, and the couple were paid £100 for the two weeks' work, plus 10 per cent of the profits. The film followed a revue format, and Jo Botting, writing for the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>, describes it as having a "wafer-thin plot" that is "almost incidental." Botting also considers the film has "poor sound quality, static scene set-ups and [a] lack of sets", and while it did not impress the critics, audience figures were high. Formby followed this up with "<a href="Off%20the%20Dole">Off the Dole</a>" in 1935, again for Blakeley, who had re-named his company Mancunian Films. The film cost £3,000 to make, and earned £80,000 at the box office. As with "Boots! Boots!", the film was in a revue format, and Formby again played John Willie, with Beryl as his co-star. According to Formby's biographer, <a href="Jeffrey%20Richards">Jeffrey Richards</a>, the two films for Blakeley "are an invaluable record of the pre-cinematic Formby at work."

The success of the pictures led Dean to offer Formby a seven-year contract with ATP, which resulted in the production of 11 films, although Dean's fellow producer, <a href="Michael%20Balcon">Michael Balcon</a>, considered Formby to be "an odd and not particularly loveable character." The first film from the deal was released in 1935. "<a href="No%20Limit%20%281935%20film%29">No Limit</a>" features Formby as an entrant in the <a href="Isle%20of%20Man">Isle of Man</a> annual <a href="Isle%20of%20Man%20TT">Tourist Trophy</a> (TT) motorcycle race. <a href="Monty%20Banks">Monty Banks</a> directed, and <a href="Florence%20Desmond">Florence Desmond</a> took the female lead. According to Richards, Dean did not try "to play down Formby's Lancashire character" for the film, and employed <a href="Walter%20Greenwood">Walter Greenwood</a>, the <a href="County%20Borough%20of%20Salford">Salford</a>-born author of the 1933 novel "<a href="Love%20on%20the%20Dole">Love on the Dole</a>", as the scriptwriter. Filming was troubled, with Beryl being difficult to everyone present. The writer <a href="Matthew%20Sweet%20%28writer%29">Matthew Sweet</a> describes the set as "a battleground" because of her actions, and Banks unsuccessfully requested that Dean bar Beryl from the studio. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" thought that parts of "No Limit" were "pretty dull stuff", but the race footage was "shot and cut to a maximum of excitement." Regarding the star of the film, the reviewer thought that "our Lancashire George is a grand lad; he can gag and clown, play the banjo and sing with authority ... Still and all, he doesn't do too bad." The film was so popular it was reissued in 1938, 1946 and 1957.

The formula used for "No Limit" was repeated in his following works: Formby played "the urban 'little man' defeated—but refusing to admit it." He portrayed a good-natured, but accident-prone and incompetent Lancastrian, who was often in a skilled trade, or the services. The plots were geared to Formby trying to achieve success in a field unfamiliar to him (in horse racing, the TT Races, as a spy or a policeman), and by winning the affections of a middle-class girl in the process. Interspersed throughout each film is a series of songs by Formby, in which he plays the banjo, banjolele or ukulele. The songs are, in the words of the academic Brian McFarlane, "unpretentiously skilful in their balance between broad comedy and action, laced with ... [Formby's] shy ordinariness."

"No Limit" was followed by "<a href="Keep%20Your%20Seats%2C%20Please">Keep Your Seats, Please</a>" in 1936, which was again directed by Banks with Desmond returning as the co-star. Tensions arose in pre-production with Banks and some of the cast requesting to Dean that Beryl be banned from the set. Tempers had also become strained between Formby and Desmond, who were not on speaking terms except to film scenes. The situation became so bad that Dean avoided visiting his studios for the month of filming. The film contained the song "<a href="The%20Window%20Cleaner">The Window Cleaner</a>" (popularly known as "When I'm Cleaning Windows"), which was soon <a href="List%20of%20songs%20banned%20by%20the%20BBC">banned by the BBC</a>. The corporation's director <a href="John%20Reith%2C%201st%20Baron%20Reith">John Reith</a> stated that "if the public wants to listen to Formby singing his disgusting little ditty, they'll have to be content to hear it in the cinemas, not over the nation's airwaves"; Formby and Beryl were furious with the block on the song. In May 1941 Beryl informed the BBC that the song was a favourite of the royal family, particularly <a href="Mary%20of%20Teck">Queen Mary</a>, while a statement by Formby pointed out that "I sang it before the King and Queen at the Royal Variety Performance." The BBC relented and started to broadcast the song.

When production finished on "Keep Your Seats, Please", Beryl insisted that for the next film there should be "no Eye-Ties and stuck-up little trollops involved", referring to Banks and Desmond, respectively. Dean had tired of the on-set squabbles, and for the third ATP film, "<a href="Feather%20Your%20Nest">Feather Your Nest</a>", he appointed <a href="William%20Beaudine">William Beaudine</a> as the director, and <a href="Polly%20Ward">Polly Ward</a>, the niece of the music hall star Marie Lloyd, as the female lead. Bret describes the songs in the film as "comparatively bland", but "with the exception of the one which would become immortal": "<a href="Leaning%20on%20a%20Lamp-post">Leaning on a Lamp-post</a>."

By the time of the next production, "<a href="Keep%20Fit">Keep Fit</a>" in 1937, Dean had begun to assemble a special team at <a href="Ealing%20Studios">Ealing Studios</a> to help develop and produce the Formby films; key among the members were the director <a href="Anthony%20Kimmins">Anthony Kimmins</a>, who went on to direct five of Formby's films. <a href="Kay%20Walsh">Kay Walsh</a> was cast as the leading lady and, in the absences of Beryl from the set, Formby and Walsh had an affair, after she fell for his "flirtatious behaviour off-camera." Although Beryl was furious with Walsh, and tried to have her removed from the film, a showdown with Dean proved fruitless. Dean informed her that Walsh was to remain the lead in both "Keep Fit", and in Formby's next film ("<a href="I%20See%20Ice">I See Ice</a>", 1938); to mollify her Dean raised Formby's fee for the latter film to £25,000.

When filming concluded on "I See Ice", Formby spent the 1937 summer season performing in the revue "King Cheer" at the <a href="Opera%20House%20Theatre%2C%20Blackpool">Opera House Theatre, Blackpool</a>, before appearing in a 12-minute slot in the <a href="Royal%20Variety%20Performance">Royal Variety Performance</a> at the <a href="London%20Palladium">London Palladium</a> that November. The popularity of his performances meant that in 1937 he was the top British male star in box office takings, a position he held every subsequent year until 1943. Additionally, between 1938 and 1942 he was also the highest-paid entertainer in Britain, and by the end of the 1930s was earning £100,000 a year.
In early 1938 Dean informed the Formbys that in the next film, "It's in the Air", Banks would return to direct and Walsh would again be the leading lady. Beryl objected strongly, and Kimmins continued his directorial duties, while Ward was brought in for the female lead. Beryl, as she did with all Formby's female co-stars, "read the 'keep-your-hands-off-my-husband' riot act" to the actress. In May, while filming "It's in the Air", Formby purchased a <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Limited">Rolls-Royce</a>, with the personalised number plate GF 1. Every year afterwards he would purchase either a new Rolls Royce or <a href="Bentley">Bentley</a>, buying 26 over the course of his life.

In the autumn of 1938 Formby began work on "<a href="Trouble%20Brewing%20%281939%20film%29">Trouble Brewing</a>", released the following year with 19-year-old <a href="Googie%20Withers">Googie Withers</a> as the female lead; Kimmins again directed. Withers later recounted that Formby did not speak to her until, during a break in filming when Beryl was not present, he whispered out of the corner of his mouth "I'm sorry, love, but you know, I'm not allowed to speak to you", something she thought was "very sweet." His second release of 1939—shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War—was "<a href="Come%20On%20George%21">Come On George!</a>", which cast <a href="Pat%20Kirkwood%20%28actress%29">Pat Kirkwood</a> in the female lead; the pair disliked each other intensely, and neither of the Formbys liked several of the other senior cast members. "Come On George!" was screened for troops serving in France before being released in Britain.

At the outbreak of the Second World War Dean left ATP and became the head of the <a href="Entertainments%20National%20Service%20Association">Entertainments National Service Association</a> (ENSA), the organisation that provided entertainment to the <a href="British%20Armed%20Forces">British Armed Forces</a>. Over the course of five months Formby requested to sign up for ENSA, but was denied; Dean relented in February 1940, and Formby was signed on a fixed salary of £10 per week, although he still remained under contact to ATP. He undertook his first tour in France in March, where he performed for members of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20II%29">British Expeditionary Force</a>.

The <a href="social%20research">social research</a> organisation <a href="Mass-Observation">Mass-Observation</a> recorded that Formby's first film of 1940, "<a href="Let%20George%20Do%20It%21">Let George Do It!</a>", gave a particularly strong boost to early-war British civilian morale. In a dream sequence after being drugged, Formby's character parachutes into a <a href="Nuremberg%20Rally">Nuremberg Rally</a> and punches Hitler. According to Richards, the scene provided "the visual encapsulation of the people's war with the English Everyman flooring the Nazi Superman". The scene was so striking that the film became Formby's first international release, in the US, under the title "To Hell With Hitler", and in Moscow—where it was released in 1943 under the title "Dinky Doo"—it was shown to packed houses and received record box-office takings for over ten months. The critics also praised the film, and the "<a href="Kinematograph%20Weekly">Kinematograph Weekly</a>" called it Formby's "best performance to date", and the film, "a box office certainty".

Formby's ENSA commitments were heavy, touring factories, theatres and concert halls around Britain. He also gave free concerts for charities and worthy causes, and raised £10,000 for the Fleetwood Fund on behalf of the families of missing trawlermen. He and Beryl also set up their own charities, such as the OK Club for Kids, whose aim was to provide cigarettes for Yorkshire soldiers, and the Jump Fund, to provide home-knitted balaclavas, scarves and socks to servicemen. Formby also joined the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a> as a dispatch rider, where he took his duties seriously, and fitted them around his other work whenever he could.

Formby continued filming with ATP, and his second film of 1940, "<a href="Spare%20a%20Copper">Spare a Copper</a>", was again focused on an aspect of the war, this time combating <a href="fifth%20column">fifth column</a>ists and saboteurs in a <a href="Merseyside">Merseyside</a> dockyard. Cinema-goers had begun to tire of war films, and his next venture, "<a href="Turned%20Out%20Nice%20Again">Turned Out Nice Again</a>" returned to less contentious issues, with Formby's character caught in a domestic battle between his new wife and mother. Early in the filming schedule, he took time to perform in an ENSA show that was broadcast on the BBC from <a href="Aldwych%20tube%20station">Aldwych tube station</a> as "Let the People Sing"; he sang four songs, and told the audience, "Don't forget, it's wonderful to be British!" Towards the end of 1940 Formby tried to enlist for active military service, despite Beryl informing him that by being a member of ENSA he was already signed up. The examining board rejected him as being unfit, because he had <a href="sinusitis">sinusitis</a> and arthritic toes. He spent the winter season in pantomime at the Opera House Theatre, Blackpool, portraying Idle Jack in "<a href="Dick%20Whittington%20and%20His%20Cat">Dick Whittington</a>". When the season came to an end the Formbys moved to London and, in May 1941, <a href="Royal%20Command%20Performance">performed for the royal family</a> at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>. He had commissioned a new set of inoffensive lyrics for "When I'm Cleaning Windows", but was informed that he should sing the original, uncensored version, which was enjoyed by the royal party, particularly Queen Mary, who asked for a repeat of the song. <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a> presented Formby with a set of gold cuff links, and advised him to "wear them, not put them away".

With the ATP contract at an end, Formby decided not to renew or push for an extension. Robert Murphy, in his study of wartime British cinema, points out that Balcon, Formby's producer at the time, "seems to have made little effort to persuade him not to transfer his allegiance", despite the box office success enjoyed by "Let George Do It" and "Spare a Copper". Numerous offers came in, and Formby selected the American company <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, in a deal worth in excess of £500,000 to make a minimum of six films—seven were eventually made. Formby set up his own company, Hillcrest Productions, to distribute the films, and had the final decision on the choice of director, scriptwriter and theme, while Columbia would have the choice of leading lady. Part of Formby's reasoning behind the decision was a desire for parts with more character, something that would not have happened at ATP.

At the end of August 1941 production began on Formby's first film for Columbia, "<a href="South%20American%20George">South American George</a>", which took six weeks to complete. Formby's move to an American company was controversial, and although his popular appeal seemed unaffected, his "films were treated with increasing critical hostility", according to John Mundy in his 2007 examination of British musical film. The reviewer for "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" wrote that the story was "confused" and considered that "there is not sufficient comic invention in the telling" of it. Murphy writes that the criticism "had more to do with the inadequate vehicles which he subsequently appeared in than in any diminution of his personal popularity."
In early 1942 Formby undertook a three-week, 72-show tour of Northern Ireland, largely playing to troops but also undertaking fund-raising shows for charity—one at the Belfast Hippodrome raised £500. He described his time in Ulster as "the pleasantest tour I've ever undertaken". He returned to the mainland by way of the Isle of Man, where he entertained the troops guarding the <a href="internment%20camps">internment camps</a>. After further charity shows—raising £8,000 for a tank fund—Formby was the <a href="associate%20producer">associate producer</a> for the <a href="Vera%20Lynn">Vera Lynn</a> film "<a href="We%27ll%20Meet%20Again%20%281943%20film%29">We'll Meet Again</a>" (1943). In March he also filmed "<a href="Much%20Too%20Shy">Much Too Shy</a>" which was released in October that year. Although the film was poorly received by the critics, the public still attended in large numbers, and the film was profitable.

In the summer of 1942 Formby was involved in a controversy with the <a href="Lord%27s%20Day%20Observance%20Society">Lord's Day Observance Society</a>, who had filed law suits against the BBC for playing secular music on Sunday. The society began a campaign against the entertainment industry, claiming all theatrical activity on a Sunday were unethical, and cited a 1667 law which made it illegal. With 60 leading entertainers already avoiding Sunday working, Dean informed Formby that his stance would be crucial in avoiding a spread of the problem. Formby issued a statement, "I'll hang up my uke on Sundays only when our lads stop fighting and getting killed on Sundays ... as far as the Lord's Day Observance Society are concerned, they can mind their own bloody business. And in any case, what have "they" done for the war effort except get on everyone's nerves?" The following day it was announced that the pressure from the society was to be lifted.

At the end of the year Formby started filming "<a href="Get%20Cracking">Get Cracking</a>", a story about the Home Guard, which was completed in under a month, the tight schedule brought about by an impending ENSA tour of the Mediterranean. Between the end of filming "Get Cracking" and the release of the film in May 1943, Formby undertook a tour of Northern Scotland and the Orkney Islands, and had nearly completed shooting on his next film, "<a href="Bell-Bottom%20George">Bell-Bottom George</a>". The reviewer for "The Times" opined that ""Get Cracking", although a distinct improvement on other films in which Mr Formby has appeared, is cut too closely to fit the demands of an individual technique to achieve any real life of its own".

"Bell-Bottom George" was described 60 years later by the academic Baz Kershaw as being "unashamedly gay and ... peppered with homoerotic scenes"; Bret concurs, and notes that "the majority of the cast and almost every one of the male extras was unashamedly gay", The film was a hit with what Bret describes as Formby's "surprisingly large, closeted gay following". The reviewer for "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" was impressed with the film, and wrote that "there is a new neatness of execution and lightness of touch about this production ... while George himself can no longer be accused of trailing clouds of vaudevillian glory". The reviewer also considered Formby "our first authentic and strictly indigenous film comedian". After completing filming, the Formbys undertook a further ENSA tour. Although Dean personally disliked the Formbys, he greatly admired the tireless work they did for the organisation. In August Formby undertook a 53-day tour in a significant portion of the Mediterranean, including Italy, Sicily, Malta, Gibraltar, Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Palestine; visiting 750,000 troops in thirteen countries, touring in the process and returning to England in October. The couple travelled around the countryside in a Ford <a href="Mercury%20%28automobile%29">Mercury</a> that Formby had purchased from the racing driver <a href="Malcolm%20Campbell">Sir Malcolm Campbell</a>, which had been converted to sleep two in the back.
In January 1944 Formby described his experiences touring for ENSA in Europe and the Middle East in a BBC radio broadcast. He said that the troops "were worrying quite a lot about you folks at home, but we soon put them right about that. We told them that after four and a half years, Britain was still the best country to live in". Shortly after he began filming "<a href="He%20Snoops%20to%20Conquer">He Snoops to Conquer</a>"—his fifth picture for Columbia—he was visited on set by the Dance Music Policy Committee (DMPC), an organisation responsible for vetting music for broadcast, which had also been given responsibility for checking if music was sympathetic towards the enemy during the war. The DMPC interviewed Formby about three songs that had been included in "Bell-Bottom George": "Swim Little Fish", "If I Had a Girl Like You" and "Bell-Bottom George". Formby was summoned to the BBC's offices to perform his three songs in front of the committee, with his song checked against the available sheet music. A week later, on 1 February, the committee met and decided the songs were innocuous, although Formby was told that he would have to get further clearance if the lyrics were changed. Bret opines that he had been the victim of a plot by a member of the Variety Artists' Federation, following Formby's scathing comments on entertainers who were too scared to leave London to entertain the troops. The comments, which appeared in the forces magazine "Union Jack", were then widely reported in the press in Britain. The Variety Artists' Federation demanded that Formby release names, and threatened him with action if he did not do so, but he refused to give in to their pressure.

Formby went to <a href="Normandy%20landings">Normandy</a> in July 1944 in the vanguard of a wave of ENSA performers. He and Beryl travelled over on a rough crossing to <a href="Arromanches">Arromanches</a> giving a series of impromptu concerts to troops in improvised conditions, including on the backs of farm carts and army lorries, or in bomb-cratered fields. In one location the German front line was too close for him to perform, so he crawled into the trenches and told jokes with the troops there. He then boarded HMS "Ambitious" for his first scheduled concert before returning to France to continue his tour. During dinner with <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Montgomery%20of%20Alamein">General Bernard Montgomery</a>, whom he had met in North Africa, Formby was invited to visit the glider crews of 6th Airborne Division, who had been holding a series of bridges without relief for 56 days. He did so on 17 August in a one-day visit to the front line bridges, where he gave nine shows, all standing beside a sandbag wall, ready to jump into a slit trench in case of problems; much of the time his audience were in foxholes. After the four-week tour of France, Formby returned home to start work on "<a href="I%20Didn%27t%20Do%20It%20%28film%29">I Didn't Do It</a>" (released in 1945), although he continued to work on ENSA concerts and tours in Britain. Between January and March 1945, shortly after the release of "He Snoops to Conquer", he left on an ENSA tour that took in Burma, India and Ceylon (the last is now Sri Lanka). The concerts in the Far East were his last for ENSA, and by the end of the war it was estimated that he had performed in front of three million service personnel.

In 1946 the song "With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock", which Formby had recorded in 1937, began to cause problems at the BBC for broadcasts of Formby or his music. The producer of one of Formby's live television programmes received a letter from a BBC manager that stated "We have no record that "With My Little Stick of Blackpool Rock" is banned. We do however know and so does Formby, that certain lines in the lyric must not be broadcast". Other sources, including the BBC, state that the song was banned from being broadcast. Between July and October 1946 Formby filmed "<a href="George%20in%20Civvy%20Street">George in Civvy Street</a>", which would be his final film. The story concerns the rivalry between two pubs: the Unicorn, bequeathed to Formby's character, and the Lion, owned by his childhood sweetheart—played by <a href="Rosalyn%20Boulter">Rosalyn Boulter</a>—but run by an unscrupulous manager. Richards considers the film to have "symbolic significance"; at the end, with the marriage between the two pub owners, Formby "bowed out of films unifying the nation mythically, communally and matrimonially".

The film was less successful at the box office than his previous works, as audience tastes had changed in the post-war world. Fisher opines that because of his tireless war work, Formby had become too synonymous with the war, causing the public to turn away from him, much as they had from the wartime British Prime Minister, <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Bret believes that post-war audiences wanted intrigue, suspense and romance, through the films of <a href="James%20Mason">James Mason</a>, <a href="Stewart%20Granger">Stewart Granger</a>, <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a> and <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>. Bret also indicates that Formby's cinematic decline was shared by similar performers, including <a href="Gracie%20Fields">Gracie Fields</a>, <a href="Tommy%20Trinder">Tommy Trinder</a> and <a href="Will%20Hay">Will Hay</a>. Formby's biographers, Alan Randall and Ray Seaton, opine that in his late 40s, Formby "was greying and thickening out", and was too old to play the innocent young Lancashire lad. The slump in his screen popularity hit Formby hard, and he became depressed. In early 1946 Beryl checked him into a psychiatric hospital under her maiden name, Ingham. He came out after five weeks, in time for a tour of Scandinavia in May.

On his return from Scandinavia Formby went into pantomime in Blackpool; while there, he learned of his appointment as <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) in the 1946 King's <a href="Birthday%20Honours">Birthday Honours</a>. Although delighted, he was upset that Beryl went without official recognition, and said "if somethin' was comin' our way, ah'd like it to be somethin' Beryl could have shared". Later that year the Formbys toured South Africa shortly before formal racial <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a> was introduced. While there they refused to play <a href="Racial%20segregation">racially-segregated</a> venues. When Formby was cheered by a black audience after embracing a small black girl who had presented his wife with a box of chocolates, <a href="National%20Party%20%28South%20Africa%29">National Party</a> leader <a href="Daniel%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Malan">Daniel François Malan</a> (who later introduced apartheid) telephoned to complain; Beryl replied "Why don't you piss off, you horrible little man?"

Formby returned to Britain at Christmas and appeared in "Dick Whittington" at the <a href="Grand%20Theatre%2C%20Leeds">Grand Theatre, Leeds</a> for nine weeks, and then, in February 1947, he appeared in <a href="Variety%20show">variety</a> for two weeks at the London Palladium. Reviewing the show, "The Times" thought Formby was "more than ever the mechanized perfection of naive jollity. His smile, though fixed, is winning, and his songs ... are catchy". In September that year he went on a 12-week tour of Australia and New Zealand. On his return he was offered more film roles, but turned them down, saying "when I look back on some of the films I've done in the past it makes me want to cringe. I'm afraid the days of being a clown are gone. From now on I'm only going to do variety". He began suffering increasing health problems including a gastric ulcer, and was treated for breathing problems from his heavy smoking. He finished the year in <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>, appearing as <a href="Buttons%20%28pantomime%29">Buttons</a> in "<a href="Cinderella">Cinderella</a>" at the <a href="Liverpool%20Empire%20Theatre">Liverpool Empire Theatre</a>, with Beryl playing <a href="Dandini%20%28character%29">Dandini</a>.

In September 1949 Formby went on a 19 city coast-to-coast Canadian tour, from which he returned unwell. While subsequently appearing in "Cinderella" in Leeds, he collapsed in his dressing room. The attending doctor administered <a href="morphine">morphine</a>, to which Formby briefly became addicted. Further poor health plagued him into 1950, with a bout of <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>, followed by <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>, after which he recuperated in <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, before giving another royal command performance that April. He undertook two further international tours that year: one to Scandinavia, and a second to Canada. His earnings of Ca$200,000 were heavily taxed: Canadian taxes took up $68,000, and UK taxes took 90% of the balance. Formby complained to reporters about the level of taxation, saying "That's it. So long as the government keeps bleeding me dry, I shan't be in much of a hurry to work again!"; he and Beryl spent the rest of the year resting in Norfolk, in temporary retirement.

Formby was tempted back to work by the theatrical <a href="impresario">impresario</a> <a href="Emile%20Littler">Emile Littler</a>, who offered him the lead role of Percy Piggott in "<a href="Zip%20Goes%20a%20Million">Zip Goes a Million</a>", a play based on the 1902 novel "<a href="Brewster%27s%20Millions">Brewster's Millions</a>" by <a href="George%20Barr%20McCutcheon">G. B. McCutcheon</a>; Formby was offered £1,500, plus a share of the box-office takings. The show premiered at the <a href="Coventry%20Theatre">Coventry Hippodrome</a> in September 1951 before opening at the <a href="Palace%20Theatre%2C%20London">Palace Theatre</a>, London on 20 October. "The Times" commented unfavourably, saying that although the audience were appreciative of the play, they "could not conceivably have detected a spark of wit in either the lyrics or the dialogue"; the paper was equally dismissive of Formby, writing that "he has a deft way with a song or a banjo, but little or no finesse in his handling of a comic situation".

A month after the play opened in London, Formby was the guest star on "<a href="Desert%20Island%20Discs">Desert Island Discs</a>", where one of his choices was his father's "Standing on the Corner of the Street". In early 1952 Formby's health began to decline and, on 28 April, he decided to withdraw from "Zip Goes a Million". On the way to the theatre to inform Littler, Formby suffered a heart attack, although it took the doctors five days to diagnose the coronary and admit him to hospital. He was treated for both the attack, and his morphine addiction. He stayed in hospital for nine weeks before returning home to <a href="Lytham%20St%20Annes">Lytham St Annes</a>, Lancashire, where he announced his retirement.

During his recuperation Formby contracted <a href="gastroenteritis">gastroenteritis</a> and had a suspected blood clot on his lung, after which he underwent an operation to clear a fishbone that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of <a href="Southern%20Rhodesia">Southern Rhodesia</a> (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the <a href="Southport%20Winter%20Gardens%23Garrick%20Theatre">Southport Garrick Theatre</a>. That September he turned on the <a href="Blackpool%20Illuminations">Blackpool Illuminations</a>.

From October to December 1953 Formby appeared at the London Palladium in 138 performances of the revue "Fun and the Fair", with <a href="Terry-Thomas">Terry-Thomas</a> and the <a href="Billy%20Cotton">Billy Cotton band</a>; Formby appeared in the penultimate act of the evening, with Terry-Thomas closing the show. Although Formby's act was well-received, the show was not as successful as had been hoped, and Terry-Thomas later wrote that "Formby put the audience in a certain mood which made them non-receptive to whoever followed ... Even though my act was the star spot, I felt on this occasion that my being there was an anti-climax". He requested that the order be changed to have Formby close the show, but this was turned down. Formby suffered from stage fright during the show's run—the first time he had suffered from the condition since his earliest days on stage—and his bouts of depression returned, along with stomach problems.

Formby took a break from work until mid-1954, when he starred in the revue "Turned Out Nice Again", in Blackpool. Although the show was initially scheduled to run for 13 weeks, it was cut short after six when Formby suffered again from dysentery and depression. He again announced his retirement, but continued to work. After some television appearances on "Ask Pickles" and "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Town">Top of the Town</a>", in late 1954 and early 1955 respectively, Formby travelled to South Africa for a tour, where Beryl negotiated an agreement with the South African premier <a href="Johannes%20Strijdom">Johannes Strijdom</a> to play in venues of Formby's choice, and then sailed to Canada for a ten-day series of performances. On the return voyage he contracted <a href="bronchial%20pneumonia">bronchial pneumonia</a>, but still joined the cast of the non-musical play "Too Young to Marry" on his arrival in Britain.

In August 1955 Beryl felt unwell and went for tests: she was diagnosed with cancer of the uterus and was given two years to live. The couple reacted to the news in different ways, and while Beryl began to drink heavily—up to a bottle of whisky a day to dull the pain—George began to work harder, and began a close friendship with a school teacher, Pat Howson.

"Too Young to Marry" toured between September 1955 and November 1956, but still allowed Formby time to appear in the Christmas pantomime "Babes in the Wood" at the Liverpool Empire Theatre. The touring production was well received everywhere except in Scotland, where Formby's attempted Scottish accent is thought to have put people off. For Christmas 1956 he appeared in his first London pantomime, playing Idle Jack in "Dick Whittington and His Cat" at the Palace Theatre, although he withdrew from the run in early February after suffering from <a href="laryngitis">laryngitis</a>. According to Bret, Formby spent the remainder of 1957 "doing virtually nothing", although he appeared in two television programmes, "Val Parnell's Saturday Spectacular" in July and "Top of the Bill" in October.

From March 1958 Formby appeared in the musical comedy "Beside the Seaside", a Holiday Romp in Hull, Blackpool, Birmingham and Brighton. By the time it reached Brighton the play was playing to increasingly small audiences, and the run was cut short as a result. The play may not have been to southern audiences' tastes—the plot centres on a northern family's holiday in Blackpool—and the Brighton audiences may have been too small, but those in the north, particularly Blackpool, thought highly of it and the show was a nightly sell-out. When the show closed Formby was disappointed, and vowed never to appear in another stage musical. The year 1958 was professionally quiet for him; in addition to "Beside the Seaside", he also worked in one-off appearances in three television shows. He began 1959 by appearing in "Val Parnell's Spectacular: The Atlantic Showboat" in January, and in April hosted his own show, "Steppin' Out With Formby". During the summer season he appeared at the Windmill Theatre, <a href="Great%20Yarmouth">Great Yarmouth</a>, although he missed two weeks of performances when he was involved in a car crash on the August Bank Holiday. When doctors examined him, they were concerned with his overall health, partly as a result of his forty cigarettes-a-day smoking habit. He also had high blood pressure, was overweight and had heart problems.

Formby's final year of work was 1960. That May he recorded his last session of songs, "Happy Go Lucky Me" and "Banjo Boy", the former of which peaked at number 40 in the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. He then spent the summer season at the Queen's Theatre in Blackpool in "The Time of Your Life"—a performance which was also broadcast by the BBC. One of the acts in the show was the singer <a href="Yana%20%28singer%29">Yana</a>, with whom Formby had an affair, made easier because of Beryl's absence from the theatre through illness. His final televised performance, a 35-minute BBC programme, "The Friday Show: George Formby", was aired on 16 December. Bret considers the programme to be Formby's "greatest performance—it was certainly his most sincere", although reviewing for "The Guardian", Mary Crozier thought it "too slow". She went on to say "George Formby is really a music-hall star, and it needs the warmth and sociability of the theatre to bring out his full appeal". Beryl's illness was worsening. Worn down by the strain, and feeling the need to escape, Formby took the part of Mr Wu in "Aladdin" in Bristol, having turned down a more lucrative part in Blackpool.

Two hours before the premiere of "Aladdin"—on Christmas Eve 1960—Formby received a phone call from Beryl's doctor, saying that she was in a coma and was not expected to survive the night; Formby went through with the performance, and was told early the next morning that Beryl had died. Her cremation took place on 27 December, and an hour after the service Formby returned to Bristol to appear in that day's matinee performance of "Aladdin". He continued in the show until 14 January when a cold forced him to rest, on doctors' advice. He returned to <a href="Lytham%20St%20Annes">Lytham St Annes</a> and communicated with Pat Howson; she contacted his doctor and Formby was instructed to go to hospital, where he remained for the next two weeks.

On Valentine's Day 1961, seven weeks after Beryl's death, Formby and Howson announced their engagement. Eight days later he suffered a further heart attack which was so severe that he was given the <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a> of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Catholic Church</a> on his arrival at hospital. He was revived and, from his hospital bed, he and Howson planned their wedding, which was due to take place in May. He was still there when, on 6 March, he had a further heart attack and died at the age of 56. The obituarist for "The Times" wrote that "he was the amateur of the old smoking concert platform turned into a music-hall professional of genius", while <a href="Donald%20Zec">Donald Zec</a>, writing in the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>", called him "as great an entertainer as any of the giants of the music-hall". "The Guardian" considered that "with his ukulele, his songs, and his grinning patter, the sum was greater than any of those parts: a Lancashire character", while in the eyes of the public, Formby's "passing was genuinely and widely mourned".

Formby was buried alongside his father in Warrington Cemetery with over 150,000 mourners lining the route. The undertaker was Bruce Williams who, as <a href="Eddie%20Latta">Eddie Latta</a>, had written songs for Formby. An hour after the ceremony the family read the will, which had been drawn up two weeks previously. Harry Scott—Formby's <a href="valet">valet</a> and <a href="wikt%3Afactotum">factotum</a>—was to receive £5,000, while the rest was to go to Howson; at probate Formby's <a href="Estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> was valued at £135,000. Formby's mother and siblings were angered by the will, and contested it. In the words of Bret "mourning ... [Formby] was marred by a greedy family squabbling over his not inconsiderable fortune".

Because the will was contested, Formby's solicitor insisted that a public auction was held for the contents of Formby's house, which took place over three days in June. Howson offered to honour an earlier will by providing £5,000 for Eliza and £2,000 each for Formby's sisters, but the offer was rejected, and the matter went to the <a href="High%20Court%20of%20Justice">High Court</a> in London. The case was heard in May 1963 before <a href="Roger%20Ormrod">Mr Justice Ormrod</a>. At the end, Eliza was granted £5,000, and the sisters received £2,000 each. Formby's solicitor, John Crowther, acted for Howson, and explained that the bequest to Formby's sisters from the older will was made "with reluctance" by Formby, who had described his family as "a set of scroungers". The family appealed the decision and the matter lasted until September 1965, when it was finally dismissed in Howson's favour.

Richards considers that Formby "had been able to embody simultaneously Lancashire, the working classes, the people, and the nation"; Geoff King, in his examination of film comedy, also sees Formby as an icon, and writes that "[Gracie] Fields and Formby gained the status of national as well as regional figures, without sacrificing their distinctive regional personality traits". While the national aspect was important for success outside the north, "the Lancashire accent remained to enhance his homely comic appeal". The media historian Brian McFarlane writes that, on film, Formby portrayed "essentially gormless incompetents, aspiring to various kinds of professional success ... and even more improbably to a middle-class girlfriend, usually in the clutches of some caddish type with a moustache. Invariably he scored on both counts".

On an edition of ITV's "<a href="The%20South%20Bank%20Show">The South Bank Show</a>" in November 1992, Richards commented that Formby "embodied qualities that people admired and found reassuring in the depression ... and you thought that here's a man whom whatever is thrown at him, will come through and come out smiling—and people wanted that". H.J. Igoe, writing in "<a href="The%20Catholic%20Herald">The Catholic Herald</a>", thinks that "Formby has a common English touch. We warm to the kindly turnip face, the revolving eyes, the mouth like a slashed coconut, the silly little songs ... the melodiously tinny voice and twanging banjo. The comedian is the universal works—platoon and bar-room simpleton—mother's boy—the beloved henpeck—the father who cannot hang a picture and underlying his everyday folly there is the sublime wisdom of the ordinary fool who loves and trusts the world. His comedy is earthy, but never lascivious".
Richards identifies in Formby "an innocence that was essentially childlike ... which explains why George was as popular with children as he was with adults"; Igoe agrees, and writes that "we know he loves children, because himself he is a child". Formby's screen and stage persona of innocence and simplicity was not seen as ignorance or stupidity, although Basil Dean disagreed and thought that Formby "didn't act gormless as many successful Lancashire comedians have done, he was gormless". Much of the innocence in Formby's performance is connected to sex, and the use of <a href="double%20entendre">double entendre</a>s within his songs. <a href="John%20Caughie">John Caughie</a> and <a href="Kevin%20Rockett">Kevin Rockett</a>, in their examination of British film, and Richards, see a connection between Formby's approach to sex and the <a href="Postcard%23British%20seaside%20postcards">saucy seaside postcards</a> of <a href="Donald%20McGill">Donald McGill</a>. Richards sees the function of Formby's humour as being the same as McGill's: "the harmless diffusion of a major source of tension in a deeply repressed and conventional society". Formby's delivery of the sexual content—what McFarlane identifies as being "sung with such a toothy grin and air of innocence"—negated any possible indignation, and this contrasts with the more overtly sexual delivery of other performers of the time, such as <a href="Max%20Miller%20%28comedian%29">Max Miller</a> and <a href="Frank%20Randle">Frank Randle</a>.

The ukulele expert Steven Sproat considers that Formby "was incredible ... There hasn't really been a uke player since Formby—or even before Formby—who played quite like him". Much of Formby's virtuosity came from his right-hand technique, the <a href="split%20stroke">split stroke</a>, and he developed his own fast and complicated <a href="Syncopation">syncopated</a> musical style with a very fast right-hand <a href="strum">strum</a>. Joe Cooper, writing in "<a href="New%20Society">New Society</a>", considered that "Nobody has ever reproduced the casual devastating right hand syncopation, which so delicately synchronised with deft left hand chord fingering".

Formby's screen persona influenced <a href="Norman%20Wisdom">Norman Wisdom</a> in the 1950s and <a href="Charlie%20Drake">Charlie Drake</a> in the following decade, although both these performers used <a href="pathos">pathos</a>, which Formby avoided.

Shortly after Formby's death a small group of fans formed the <a href="George%20Formby%20Society">George Formby Society</a>, which had its inaugural meeting at <a href="the%20Imperial%20Hotel%20Blackpool">the Imperial Hotel Blackpool</a>. <a href="George%20Harrison">George Harrison</a> was a fan of Formby, a member of the Society and an advocate of the ukulele. The rest of <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> were also fans—they <a href="Jam%20session">improvised</a> with ukuleles during the recording breaks on "<a href="Let%20It%20Be">Let It Be</a>"—and Formby's influence can be heard in the song "<a href="Her%20Majesty%20%28song%29">Her Majesty</a>". The Beatles' penultimate song, "<a href="Free%20as%20a%20Bird">Free as a Bird</a>", ends with a slight <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> including a strummed ukulele by Harrison and the voice of <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> <a href="backmasking">played backwards</a>, saying "Turned out nice again".

As of 2014 there are two public statues of Formby. The first, by the <a href="Manx%20people">Manx</a> artist Amanda Barton, is in <a href="Douglas%2C%20Isle%20of%20Man">Douglas</a>, Isle of Man, and shows him leaning on a lamp-post and dressed in the motorcycle leathers of a TT racer. Barton was also commissioned to provide a second statue for the Lancashire town of Wigan, which was unveiled in September 2007 in the town's <a href="Grand%20Arcade%20%28Wigan%29">Grand Arcade</a> shopping centre.

Formby has been the subject of five biographies as of 2014. In the late 1960s Harry Scott published his reminiscences of Formby, "The Fabulous Formby", in 14 issues of "The Vellum", the magazine of the George Formby Society; John Fisher published "George Formby" in 1975 before Alan Randall and Ray Seaton published their book in 1974 and David Bret produced "George Formby: A Troubled Genius" in 1999. The last of the five to be published was by Sue Smart and Richard Bothway Howard in 2011, "It's Turned Out Nice Again!". There have also been two documentaries on British television, an edition of "The South Bank Show" in 1992, and "Frank Skinner on George Formby" in 2011.

In 2004 Formby was inducted into the Ukulele Hall of Fame, a non-profit organisation for the preservation of ukulele history. His citation reads, in part: "He won such love and respect for his charismatic stage presence, technical skill and playful lyrics that he remains popular forty years after his death." In June 2012 a Blackpool Boat Car tram, number 604, was repainted and returned to service with sponsorship from the George Formby Society. The tram was named "George Formby OBE" and images of him are affixed within the trolley.

Learned Hand

Billings Learned Hand (; January 27, 1872 – August 18, 1961) was an American <a href="judge">judge</a> and <a href="Legal%20philosophy">judicial philosopher</a>. He served on the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a> and later the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Second%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a>. Hand has been quoted more often by legal scholars and by the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court of the United States</a> than any other lower-court judge.

Born and raised in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, Hand majored in <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> at <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a> and graduated with honors from <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a>. After a short career as a lawyer in Albany and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, he was appointed at the age of 37 as a Federal District Judge in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> in 1909. The profession suited his detached and open-minded temperament, and his decisions soon won him a reputation for craftsmanship and authority. Between 1909 and 1914, under the influence of <a href="Herbert%20Croly">Herbert Croly</a>'s social theories, Hand supported <a href="New%20Nationalism%20%28Theodore%20Roosevelt%29">New Nationalism</a>. He ran unsuccessfully as the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">Progressive Party</a>'s candidate for <a href="Chief%20Judge">Chief Judge</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals">New York Court of Appeals</a> in 1913, but withdrew from active politics shortly afterwards. In 1924, President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> promoted Hand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which he went on to lead as the Senior Circuit Judge (later retitled Chief Judge) from 1939 until his semi-retirement in 1951. Scholars have recognized the Second Circuit under Hand as one of the finest appeals courts in the country's history. Friends and admirers often lobbied for Hand's promotion to the Supreme Court, but circumstances and his political past conspired against his appointment.

Hand possessed a gift for the English language, and his writings are admired as legal literature. He rose to fame outside the legal profession in 1944 during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> after giving a short address in <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a> that struck a popular chord in its appeal for tolerance. During a period when a hysterical fear of <a href="Subversion%20%28politics%29">subversion</a> divided the nation, Hand was viewed as a liberal defender of <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a>. A collection of Hand's papers and addresses, published in 1952 as "The Spirit of Liberty", sold well and won him new admirers. Even after he criticized the civil-rights <a href="judicial%20activism">activism</a> of the 1950s <a href="Warren%20Court">Warren Court</a>, Hand retained his popularity.

Hand is also remembered as a pioneer of modern approaches to <a href="statute">statutory</a> interpretation. His decisions in specialist fields, such as <a href="United%20States%20patent%20law">patents</a>, <a href="torts">torts</a>, <a href="admiralty%20law">admiralty law</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20antitrust%20law">antitrust law</a>, set lasting standards for craftsmanship and clarity. On constitutional matters, he was both a political <a href="Progressivism%20in%20the%20United%20States">progressive</a> and an advocate of <a href="judicial%20restraint">judicial restraint</a>. He believed in the protection of <a href="free%20speech">free speech</a> and in bold legislation to address social and economic problems. He argued, however, that the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> does not empower courts to overrule the legislation of elected bodies, except in extreme circumstances. Instead, he advocated the "combination of toleration and imagination that to me is the epitome of all good government".

Billings Learned Hand was born on January 27, 1872, in <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, the second and last child of <a href="Samuel%20Hand">Samuel Hand</a> (1833–86) and Lydia Hand (née Learned). His mother's family traditionally used surnames as given names; and Hand was named for a maternal uncle and a grandfather, both named Billings Peck Learned. The Hands were a prominent family with a tradition of activism in the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>. Hand grew up in comfortable circumstances. The family had an "almost hereditary" attachment to the legal profession and has been described as "the most distinguished legal family in northern New York".

Samuel Hand was an <a href="appeal">appellate</a> lawyer, who had risen rapidly through the ranks of an Albany-based law firm in the 1860s and, by age 32, was the firm's leading lawyer. In 1878, he became the leader of the appellate bar and argued cases before the <a href="New%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals">New York Court of Appeals</a> in "greater number and importance than those argued by any other lawyer in New York during the same period". Samuel Hand was a distant, intimidating figure to his son; Learned Hand later described his relations with his father as "not really intimate". Samuel Hand died from cancer when Learned was 14. Learned's mother thereafter promoted an idealized memory of her husband's professional success, intellectual abilities, and parental perfection, placing considerable pressure on her son.

Lydia Hand was an involved and protective mother, who had been influenced by a <a href="Calvinism">Calvinist</a> aunt as a child; and she passed on a strong sense of duty and guilt to her only son. Learned Hand eventually came to understand the influences of his parents as formative. After his father's death, he looked to religion to help him cope, writing to his cousin <a href="Augustus%20Noble%20Hand">Augustus Noble Hand</a>: "If you could imagine one half the comfort my religion has given to me in this terrible loss, you would see that Christ never forsakes those who cling to him." The depth of Hand's early religious convictions was in sharp contrast to his later <a href="agnosticism">agnosticism</a>.

Hand was beset by anxieties and self-doubt throughout his life, including <a href="night%20terror">night terror</a>s as a child. He later admitted he was "very undecided, always have been—a very insecure person, very fearful; morbidly fearful". Especially after his father's death, he grew up surrounded by doting women—his mother, his aunt, and his sister Lydia (Lily), eight years his elder. Hand struggled with his name during his childhood and adulthood, worried that "Billings" and "Learned" were not sufficiently masculine. While working as a lawyer in 1899, he ceased using the name "Billings"—calling it "pompous"—and ultimately took on the nickname "B".

Hand started at Harvard College in 1889, initially focusing on classical studies and mathematics as advised by his late father. At the end of his sophomore year, however, he changed direction. He embarked on courses in <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> and <a href="economics">economics</a>, studying under the eminent and inspirational philosophers <a href="William%20James">William James</a>, <a href="Josiah%20Royce">Josiah Royce</a> and <a href="George%20Santayana">George Santayana</a>.

At first, Hand found Harvard a difficult social environment. He was not selected for any of the social clubs that dominated campus life, and he felt this exclusion keenly. He was equally unsuccessful with the <a href="Harvard%20Glee%20Club">Glee Club</a> and the football team; for a time he rowed as a substitute for the rowing club. He later described himself as a "serious boy", a hard worker who did not smoke, drink, or consort with prostitutes. He mixed more in his <a href="Sophomore%20year">sophomore</a> and senior years. He became a member of the <a href="Hasty%20Pudding%20Club">Hasty Pudding Club</a> and appeared as a blond-wigged chorus girl in the 1892 student musical. He was also elected president of "<a href="The%20Harvard%20Advocate">The Harvard Advocate</a>", a student literary magazine.

Hand's studious ways resulted in his election to <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa%20Society">Phi Beta Kappa</a>, an elite society of scholarly students. He graduated with highest honors, was awarded an <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Artium Magister</a> degree as well as an <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Artium Baccalaureus</a> degree, and was chosen by his classmates to deliver the Class Day oration at the 1893 commencement. Family tradition and expectation suggested that he would study law after graduation. For a while, he seriously considered post-graduate work in philosophy, but he received no encouragement from his family or philosophy professors. Doubting himself, he "drifted" toward law.

Hand's three years at <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> were intellectually and socially stimulating. In his second year, he moved into a boarding house with a group of fellow law students who were to become close friends. They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales. Hand's learned reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate. He was elected to the Pow-Wow Club, in which law students practiced their skills in <a href="moot%20court">moot court</a>s. He was also chosen as an editor of the "<a href="Harvard%20Law%20Review">Harvard Law Review</a>", although he resigned in 1894 because it took too much time from his studies.

During the 1890s, Harvard Law School was pioneering the <a href="casebook%20method">casebook method</a> of teaching introduced by Dean <a href="Christopher%20Langdell">Christopher Langdell</a>. Apart from Langdell, Hand's professors included <a href="Samuel%20Williston">Samuel Williston</a>, <a href="John%20Chipman%20Gray">John Chipman Gray</a>, and <a href="James%20Barr%20Ames">James Barr Ames</a>. Hand preferred those teachers who valued common sense and fairness, and ventured beyond casebook study into the philosophy of law. His favorite professor was <a href="James%20Bradley%20Thayer">James Bradley Thayer</a>, who taught him <a href="evidence%20%28law%29">evidence</a> in his second year and <a href="constitutional%20law">constitutional law</a> in his third. A man of broad interests, Thayer became a major influence on Hand's jurisprudence. He emphasized the law's historical and human dimensions rather than its certainties and extremes. He stressed the need for courts to exercise <a href="judicial%20restraint">judicial restraint</a> in deciding social issues.

Hand graduated from Harvard Law School with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> in 1896 at the age of 24. He returned to Albany to live with his mother and aunt, and started work for the <a href="law%20firm">law firm</a> in which an uncle, Matthew Hale, was a <a href="partner%20%28business%20rank%29">partner</a>. Hale's unexpected death a few months later obliged Hand to move to a new firm, but by 1899, he had become a partner. He had difficulty attracting his own clients, however, and found the work trivial and dull. Much of his time was spent researching and writing briefs, with few opportunities for the appellate work he preferred. His early courtroom appearances, when they came, were frequently difficult, sapping his fragile self-confidence. He began to fear that he lacked the ability to think on his feet in court.

For two years, Hand tried to succeed as a lawyer by force of will, giving all his time to the practice. By 1900, he was deeply dissatisfied with his progress. For intellectual stimulation, he increasingly looked outside his daily work. He wrote scholarly articles, taught part-time at <a href="Albany%20Law%20School">Albany Law School</a>, and joined a lawyers' discussion group in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. He also developed an interest in politics.

Hand came from a line of loyal <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a>, but in 1898 he voted for <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> as <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20New%20York">governor of New York</a>. Though he deplored Roosevelt's role in the "militant imperialism" of the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a>, he approved of the "amorphous mixture of socialism and laisser faire " in Roosevelt's campaign speeches. Hand caused further family controversy by registering as a Republican for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201900">presidential election of 1900</a>. Life and work in Albany no longer fulfilled him; he began applying for jobs in New York City, despite family pressure against moving.

After reaching the age of 30 without developing a serious interest in a woman, Hand thought he was destined for bachelorhood. But, during a 1901 summer holiday in the <a href="Qu%C3%A9bec">Québec</a> resort of <a href="La%20Malbaie%2C%20Quebec">La Malbaie</a>, he met 25-year-old Frances Fincke, a graduate of <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a>. Though indecisive in most matters, he waited only a few weeks before proposing. The more cautious Fincke postponed her answer for almost a year, while Hand wrote to and occasionally saw her. He also began to look more seriously for work in New York City. The next summer, both Hand and Fincke returned to La Malbaie, and at the end of August 1902, they became engaged and kissed for the first time. They married on December 6, 1902, shortly after Hand had accepted a post with the <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> law firm of Zabriskie, Burrill & Murray. The couple had three daughters: Mary Deshon (born 1905), Frances (born 1907), and Constance (born 1909). Hand proved an anxious husband and father. He corresponded regularly with his doctor brother-in-law about initial difficulties in conceiving and about his children's illnesses. He survived <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> in February 1905, taking months to recover.

The family at first spent summers in <a href="Mount%20Kisco">Mount Kisco</a>, with Hand <a href="commuting">commuting</a> on the weekends. After 1910, they rented summer homes in <a href="Cornish%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Cornish, New Hampshire</a>, a <a href="Cornish%20Art%20Colony">writers' and artists' colony</a> with a stimulating social scene. The Hands bought a house there in 1919, which they called "Low Court". As Cornish was a nine-hour train journey from New York, the couple were separated for long periods. Hand could join the family only for vacations. The Hands became friends of the noted artist <a href="Maxfield%20Parrish">Maxfield Parrish</a>, who lived in nearby <a href="Plainfield%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Plainfield</a>. The Misses Hand posed for some of his paintings.

The Hands also became close friends of Cornish resident Louis Dow, a <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a> professor. Frances Hand spent increasing amounts of time with Dow while her husband was in New York, and tension crept into the marriage. Despite speculation, however, there is no evidence that she and Dow were lovers. Hand regretted Frances' long absences and urged her to spend more time with him, but he maintained an enduring friendship with Dow. He blamed himself for a lack of insight into his wife's needs in the early years of the marriage, confessing his "blindness and insensibility to what you wanted and to your right to your own ways when they differed from mine". Fearing he might otherwise lose her altogether, Hand came to accept Frances' desire to spend time in the country with another man.

While staying in Cornish in 1908, Hand began a close friendship with the political commentator and philosopher <a href="Herbert%20Croly">Herbert Croly</a>. At the time, Croly was writing his influential book "<a href="The%20Promise%20of%20American%20Life">The Promise of American Life</a>", in which he advocated a program of democratic and <a href="egalitarian">egalitarian</a> reform under a national government with increased powers. When the book was published in November 1909, Hand sent copies to friends and acquaintances, including former president <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>. Croly's ideas had a powerful effect on Roosevelt's politics, influencing his advocacy of <a href="New%20Nationalism%20%28Theodore%20Roosevelt%29">New Nationalism</a> and the development of <a href="Progressivism">Progressivism</a>.

Hand continued to be disappointed in his progress at work. A move to the firm of Gould & Wilkie in January 1904 brought neither the challenges nor the financial rewards for which he had hoped. "I was never any good as a lawyer," he later admitted. "I didn't have any success, any at all." In 1907, deciding that at the age of 35 success as a Wall Street lawyer was out of reach, he lobbied for a potential new federal judgeship in the <a href="United%20States%20District%20Court%20for%20the%20Southern%20District%20of%20New%20York">United States District Court for the Southern District of New York</a>, the federal court headquartered in Manhattan. He became involved briefly in local Republican politics to strengthen his political base. In the event, Congress did not create the new judgeship in 1907; but, when the post was finally created in 1909, Hand renewed his candidacy. With the help of the influential <a href="Charles%20C.%20Burlingham">Charles C. Burlingham</a>, a senior New York lawyer and close friend, he gained the backing of <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> <a href="George%20W.%20Wickersham">George W. Wickersham</a>, who urged <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="William%20Howard%20Taft">William Howard Taft</a> to appoint Hand. One of the youngest federal judges ever appointed, Hand took his judicial oath at age 37 in April 1909.

Hand served as a <a href="United%20States%20federal%20judge">United States District Judge</a> in the Southern District of New York from 1909 to 1924. He dealt with fields of <a href="common%20law">common law</a>, including <a href="tort">tort</a>s, <a href="contract">contract</a>s, and <a href="copyright">copyright</a>, and <a href="admiralty%20law">admiralty law</a>. His initial unfamiliarity with some of these specialties, along with his limited courtroom experience, caused him anxiety at first. Most of Hand's early cases concerned <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a> issues, which he found tiresome, and <a href="patent">patent</a> law, which fascinated him.

Hand made some important decisions in the area of <a href="free%20speech">free speech</a>. A frequently cited 1913 decision is "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Kennerley">United States v. Kennerley</a>", an <a href="obscenity">obscenity</a> case concerning <a href="Daniel%20Carson%20Goodman">Daniel Carson Goodman</a>'s "Hagar Revelly", a <a href="Social%20hygiene%20movement">social-hygiene</a> novel about the "wiles of vice," which had caught the attention of the <a href="New%20York%20Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">New York Society for the Suppression of Vice</a>. Hand allowed the case to go forward on the basis of the <a href="Hicklin%20test">Hicklin test</a>, which stemmed back to a seminal English decision of 1868, "<a href="Regina%20v.%20Hicklin">Regina v. Hicklin</a>". In his opinion, Hand recommended updating the law, arguing that the obscenity rule should not simply protect the most susceptible readers but should reflect <a href="community%20standards">community standards</a>:

It seems hardly likely that we are even to-day so lukewarm in our interest in letters or serious discussion as to be content to reduce our treatment of sex to the standard of a child's library in the supposed interest of a salacious few, or that shame will for long prevent us from adequate portrayal of some of the most serious and beautiful sides of human nature.

Following his appointment as a judge, Hand became politically active in the cause of <a href="New%20Nationalism%20%28Theodore%20Roosevelt%29">New Nationalism</a>. With reservations, in 1911 he supported <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s return to national politics. He approved of the former president's plans to legislate on behalf of the underprivileged and to control corporations, as well as of his campaign against the abuse of judicial power. Hand sought to influence Roosevelt's views on these subjects, both in person and in print, and wrote articles for Roosevelt's magazine, "The Outlook". His hopes of swaying Roosevelt were often dashed. Roosevelt's poor grasp of legal issues particularly exasperated Hand.

Despite overwhelming support for Roosevelt in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20primary">primaries</a> and polls, the Republicans renominated the incumbent President Taft. A furious Roosevelt bolted from the party to form the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">Progressive Party</a>, nicknamed the "Bull Moose" movement. Most Republican progressives followed him, including Hand. The splitting of the Republican vote, however, harmed both Roosevelt's and Taft's chances of winning the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201912">November 1912 presidential election</a>. As Hand expected, Roosevelt lost to the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party's</a> <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, though he polled more votes than Taft.

Hand took the defeat in his stride. He considered the election merely as a first step in a reform campaign for "real national democracy". Though he had limited his public involvement in the election campaign, he now took part in planning a party structure. He also accepted the Progressive nomination for chief judge of <a href="New%20York%20Court%20of%20Appeals">New York Court of Appeals</a>, then an elective position, in September 1913. He refused to campaign, however, and later admitted that "the thought of harassing the electorate was more than I could bear". His vow of silence affected his showing, and he received only 13% of the votes. Hand came to regret his candidacy: "I ought to have lain off, as I now view it; I was a judge and a judge has no business to mess into such things."

By 1916, Hand realized that the Progressive Party had no future, as the liberal policies of the Democratic government were making much of its program redundant. Roosevelt's decision not to stand in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201916">1916 presidential election</a> dealt the party its death blow. Hand had already turned to an alternative political outlet in Herbert Croly's "<a href="The%20New%20Republic">The New Republic</a>", a liberal magazine which he had helped launch in 1914. Hand wrote a series of unsigned articles for the magazine on issues of social reform and judicial power; his only signed article was "The Hope of the Minimum Wage", published in November 1916, which called for laws to protect the underprivileged. Often attending staff dinners and meetings, Hand became a close friend of the gifted young editor <a href="Walter%20Lippmann">Walter Lippmann</a>. The outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20I">war in Europe</a> in 1914 had coincided with the founding of the magazine, whose pages often debated the events in Europe. "The New Republic" adopted a cautiously sympathetic stance towards the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a>, which Hand supported wholeheartedly. After the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> entered the war in 1917, Hand considered leaving the bench to assist the war effort. Several possible war-related positions were suggested to him. Nothing came of them, aside from his chairing a committee on intellectual property law that suggested treaty amendments for the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference</a>.

Hand made his most memorable decision of the war in 1917 in "<a href="Masses%20Publishing%20Co.%20v.%20Patten">Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten</a>". After the country joined the war, <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> had enacted an <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act</a> that made it a <a href="federal%20crime">federal crime</a> to hinder the war effort. The first test of the new law came two weeks later when the postmaster of New York City refused to deliver the August issue of "<a href="The%20Masses">The Masses</a>", a self-described "revolutionary journal". The edition contained drawings, cartoons, and articles criticizing the government's decision to go to war.

The publishing company sought an <a href="injunction">injunction</a> to prevent the ban, and the case came before Judge Hand. In July 1917, he ruled that the journal should not be barred from distribution through the mail. Though "The Masses" supported those who refused to serve in the forces, its text did not, in Hand's view, tell readers that they "must" violate the law. Hand argued that suspect material should be judged on what he called an "incitement test": only if its language directly urged readers to violate the law was it seditious—otherwise freedom of speech should be protected. This focus on the words themselves, rather than on their effect, was novel and daring; but Hand's decision was promptly stayed, and later overturned on appeal. He always maintained that his ruling had been correct. Between 1918 and 1919, he attempted to convince Supreme Court Justice <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</a>, a man he greatly admired, of his argument. His efforts at first appeared fruitless, but Holmes' dissenting opinion in "<a href="Abrams%20v.%20United%20States">Abrams v. United States</a>" in November 1919 urged greater protection of political speech. Scholars have credited the critiques of Hand, <a href="Ernst%20Freund">Ernst Freund</a>, <a href="Louis%20Brandeis">Louis Brandeis</a>, and <a href="Zechariah%20Chafee">Zechariah Chafee</a> for the change in Holmes's views. In the long-term, Hand's decision proved a landmark in the history of free speech in the country. In "<a href="Brandenburg%20v.%20Ohio">Brandenburg v. Ohio</a>" (1969), the Supreme Court announced a standard for protecting free speech that in effect recognized his "Masses" opinion as law.

Hand had known that ruling against the government might harm his prospects of promotion. By the time of the case, he was already the most senior judge of his district. The <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Appeals%20for%20the%20Second%20Circuit">United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit</a> often summoned him to sit with that court to hear appeals, a task he found stimulating. In 1917, he lobbied for promotion to the Second Circuit, but the unpopularity of his "Masses" decision and his reputation as a liberal stood against him. He was passed over in favor of <a href="Martin%20T.%20Manton">Martin T. Manton</a>.

In the final months of the war, Hand increasingly supported President Woodrow Wilson's post-war foreign policy objectives. He believed the United States should endorse the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> and the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>, despite their flaws. This position estranged him from Croly and others at "The New Republic", who vehemently rejected both. Alienated from his old circle on the magazine and by the reactionary and isolationist mood of the country, Hand found himself politically homeless.

The next Second Circuit vacancy arose in 1921, but with the conservative <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> administration in power, Hand did not put himself forward. Nonetheless Hand's reputation was such that by 1923, Justice Holmes wanted him on the Supreme Court, and in 1924 Harding's successor, <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>, appointed Hand to the Second Circuit. It was a sign of Hand's increased stature that figures such as Coolidge and Chief Justice William Howard Taft now endorsed him. Coolidge sought to add new blood to a senior judiciary that was seen as corrupt and inefficient. In 1926 and 1927, the Second Circuit was strengthened by the appointments of <a href="Thomas%20Walter%20Swan">Thomas Walter Swan</a> and Hand's cousin <a href="Augustus%20Noble%20Hand">Augustus Noble Hand</a>.

After the demise of the Progressive Party, Hand had withdrawn from party politics. He committed himself to public impartiality, despite his strong views on political issues. He remained, however, a strong supporter of freedom of speech, and any sign of the "merry sport of Red-baiting" troubled him. In 1920, for example, he wrote in support of New York Governor <a href="Al%20Smith">Al Smith</a>'s veto of the anti-sedition <a href="Lusk%20Committee">Lusk Bills</a>. The <a href="New%20York%20Assembly">New York Assembly</a> had approved these bills in a move to bar five elected <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Party</a> legislators from taking their seats. In 1922, Hand privately objected to a proposed limit on the number of Jewish students admitted to Harvard College. "If we are to have in this country racial divisions like those in Europe," he wrote, "let us close up shop now".

In public, Hand discussed issues of democracy, free speech, and toleration only in general terms. This discretion, plus a series of impressive speaking engagements, won him the respect of legal scholars and journalists, and by 1930 he was viewed as a serious candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court. His friend <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a>, then a Harvard Law School professor, was among those lobbying hard for Hand's appointment. President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> chose to bypass him, possibly for political reasons, and appointed <a href="Charles%20Evans%20Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a>, who had previously served on the Court for six years before resigning to become the Republican nominee for President in 1916, as <a href="Chief%20Justice">Chief Justice</a>. With Hughes and another New Yorker, <a href="Harlan%20Fiske%20Stone">Harlan Fiske Stone</a>, on the Court, the promotion of a third New Yorker was then seen as impossible.

Hand had voted for Hoover in 1928, and he did so again in 1932; but in 1936, he voted for the Democrats and <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, as a reaction to the economic and social turmoil that followed the <a href="Wall%20Street%20Crash">Wall Street Crash</a> of 1929. With the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> setting in, Hand favored a policy of <a href="Interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionist</a> central government. He came to accept Frankfurter's view that redistribution of wealth was essential for economic recovery. Hoover resisted this approach, favoring individualism and free enterprise. Roosevelt, on the other hand, promised the voters a <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>. They elected him on a platform of strong executive leadership and radical economic reform. Hand voted for Roosevelt again in 1940 and 1944, but he remained vigilant on the constitutional dangers of big government. Like others, including <a href="Walter%20Lippmann">Walter Lippmann</a>, he sensed the dictatorial potential of New Deal policies. He had no hesitation in condemning Roosevelt's <a href="Judiciary%20Reorganization%20Bill%20of%201937">1937 bill to expand the Supreme Court</a> and pack it with New Dealers.

Hand was increasingly called upon to judge cases arising from the flood of New Deal legislation. The line between central government authority and local legislation particularly tested his powers of judgment. In 1935, the case of "<a href="Schechter%20Poultry%20Corp.%20v.%20United%20States">United States v. Schechter</a>" came before the Second Circuit. Hand and his two colleagues had to judge whether a New York poultry firm had contravened New Deal legislation on unfair trade practices. They ruled that the <a href="National%20Industrial%20Recovery%20Act">National Industrial Recovery Act</a> did not apply to the Schechter Poultry Corporation, which traded solely within the state. "The line is no doubt in the end arbitrary," Hand wrote in a memorandum, "but we have got to draw it, because without it Congress can take over all the government." The Supreme Court later affirmed Hand's decision.

Hand became an acknowledged expert on New Deal statutes. He relished the challenge of interpreting such legislation, calling it "an act of creative imagination". In a 1933 broadcast, he explained the balancing act required of a judge in interpreting statutes:

On the one hand he must not enforce whatever he thinks best; he must leave that to the common will expressed by the government. On the other, he must try as best he can to put into concrete form what that will is, not by slavishly following the words, but by trying honestly to say what was the underlying purpose expressed.

When war broke out in Europe in 1939, Learned Hand adopted an anti-isolationist stance. He rarely spoke out publicly, not only because of his position but because he thought bellicosity unseemly in an old man. In February 1939, he became his court's senior circuit leader (in effect, <a href="chief%20judge">chief judge</a>, although the title was not created until 1948). In this post, Hand succeeded <a href="Martin%20Manton">Martin Manton</a>, who had resigned after corruption allegations that later led to Manton's criminal conviction for <a href="bribery">bribery</a>. Not an admirer of Manton, Hand nonetheless testified at his trial that he had never noticed any corrupt behavior in his predecessor. Having sat in two cases in which Manton accepted bribes, Hand worried for years afterward that he should have detected his colleague's corruption.

Hand still regarded his main job as judging. As circuit leader, he sought to free himself and his judges from too great an administrative burden. He concentrated on maintaining good relations with his fellow judges and on cleansing the court of patronage appointments. Despite the Manton case and constant friction between two of the court's judges, <a href="Charles%20Edward%20Clark">Charles Edward Clark</a> and <a href="Jerome%20Frank%20%28lawyer%29">Jerome Frank</a>, the Second Circuit under Hand earned a reputation as one of the best <a href="appellate%20courts">appeal courts</a> in the country's history.

In 1942, Hand's friends once again lobbied for him to fill a Supreme Court vacancy, but Roosevelt did not appoint him. The president gave age as the reason, but philosophical differences with Hand may also have played a part. Another explanation lies in one of Justice <a href="William%20O.%20Douglas">William O. Douglas</a>'s autobiographies, where Douglas states that, despite Roosevelt's belief that Hand was the best person for the job, Roosevelt had been offended by the pressure Justice <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a> placed on the president during a vigorous letter-writing campaign on Hand's behalf. D.C. Circuit Judge <a href="Wiley%20Blount%20Rutledge">Wiley Blount Rutledge</a>, whom Roosevelt appointed, died in 1949, while Hand lived until 1961. In a February 1944 correspondence with Frankfurter, Hand expressed a low opinion of Roosevelt's new appointees, referring to Justice <a href="Hugo%20Black">Hugo Black</a>, Justice Douglas, and Justice <a href="Frank%20Murphy">Frank Murphy</a> as "Hillbilly Hugo, Good Old Bill, and Jesus lover of my Soul". Deeply disappointed at the time, Hand later regretted his ambition: "It was the importance, the power, the trappings of the God damn thing that really drew me on."

Hand was relieved when the United States entered the war in December 1941. He felt free to participate in organizations and initiatives connected with the war effort, and was particularly committed to programs in support of Greece and Russia. He backed Roosevelt for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201944">1944 election</a>, partly because he feared a return to isolationism and the prolonging of the wartime erosion of civil liberties. In 1943, the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> or "Dies Committee", for example, had aroused his fears with an investigation into "subversive activities" by government workers. Hand's contemporary at Harvard College, <a href="Robert%20Morss%20Lovett">Robert Morss Lovett</a>, was one of those accused, and Hand spoke out on his behalf. As the end of the war approached, there was much talk of international peace organizations and courts to prevent future conflict, but Hand was skeptical. He also condemned the <a href="Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg war-crimes trials</a>, which he saw as motivated by vengeance; he did not believe that "aggressive war" could be construed as a crime. "The difference between vengeance and justice," he wrote later, "is that justice must apply to all."

Hand had never been well known to the general public, but a short speech he made in 1944 won him fame and a national reputation for learnedness that lasted until the end of his life. On May 21, 1944, he addressed almost one and a half million people in <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>, New York, at the annual "<a href="I%20Am%20an%20American%20Day">I Am an American Day</a>" event, where newly naturalized citizens swore the <a href="Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20%28United%20States%29">Pledge of Allegiance</a>. He stated that all Americans were immigrants who had come to America in search of liberty. Liberty, he said, was not located in America's constitutions, laws, and courts, but in the hearts of the people. In what would become the speech's most quoted passage, Hand asked:

What then is the spirit of liberty? I cannot define it; I can only tell you my own faith. The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to understand the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind that lesson it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; that there may be a kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.

Extracts of the speech appeared in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" on June 10. Several weeks later, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" printed the whole text. "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine and "<a href="Reader%27s%20Digest">Reader's Digest</a>" followed soon after. Hand's message that liberty is safeguarded by everyday Americans struck a popular chord, and he suddenly found himself a <a href="folk%20hero">folk hero</a>. Though he enjoyed the acclaim, he thought it unmerited. His biographer Gerald Gunther, noting the paradox of the <a href="agnostic">agnostic</a> Hand's use of religious overtones, suggests that the most challenging aspect of the speech was that the spirit of liberty must entertain doubt.

Learned Hand's 75th birthday in 1947 was much celebrated in the press and in legal circles. C. C. Burlingham, Hand's former sponsor, for example, called him "now unquestionably the first among American judges". Hand remained modest in the face of such acclaim. He continued to work as before, combining his role as presiding judge of the Second Circuit with his engagement in political issues. In 1947, he voiced his opposition to a proposed "group libel" statute that would have banned <a href="defamation">defamation</a> of racial or minority groups. He argued that such a law would imply that intolerance could base itself upon evidence. The effect of the proposed prosecutions, he said, would be "rather to exacerbate than to assuage the feelings which lie behind the defamation of groups".

In the postwar period, Hand shared the dismay of his compatriots about <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a> and the onset of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. At the same time, he was sensitive to the domestic problems created by what he saw as a hysterical fear of international <a href="Communism">Communism</a>. Already in 1947, he noted that "the frantic witch hunters are given free rein to set up a sort of Inquisition, detecting heresy wherever non-conformity appears". Hand was distressed by the crusade against domestic <a href="Subversion%20%28politics%29">subversion</a> that became part of American public life after the war. He particularly despised the anti-Communist campaign of Senator <a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">Joseph McCarthy</a> that began in 1950 and which became known as <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>. Though Hand expressed his horror of McCarthyism privately, he hesitated to do so publicly because cases arising from it were likely to come before his court.

During this period, Hand took part in three notable cases that posed a particular challenge to his impartiality on Cold War issues: "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Coplon">United States v. Coplon</a>", "<a href="Dennis%20v.%20United%20States">United States v. Dennis</a>", and "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Remington">United States v. Remington</a>".

<a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a> worker <a href="Judith%20Coplon">Judith Coplon</a> had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for stealing and attempting to pass on <a href="Defense%20%28military%29">defense</a> information. In 1950, her <a href="appeal">appeal</a> came before a Second Circuit panel that included Learned Hand. It rested on her claim that her rights under the <a href="Fourth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourth Amendment</a> had been infringed by a <a href="search%20warrant">warrantless search</a>, and that details of illegal <a href="wiretaps">wiretaps</a> had not been fully disclosed at her trial. Hand made it clear that Coplon was guilty of the charges. However, he rejected the trial judge's conclusion that a warrantless arrest had been justified. He ruled therefore that papers seized during the arrest had been inadmissible as evidence. The trial judge's failure to disclose all the wiretap records, Hand concluded, made a reversal of Coplon's conviction necessary. In his written <a href="Legal%20opinion">opinion</a>, Hand stated that "[F]ew weapons in the arsenal of freedom are more useful than the power to compel a government to disclose the evidence on which it seeks to forfeit the liberty of its citizens." Hand received <a href="hate%20mail">hate mail</a> after this decision.

By contrast, in the 1950 case "<a href="Dennis%20v.%20United%20States">Dennis v. United States</a>", Hand affirmed the convictions under the 1940 <a href="Smith%20Act">Smith Act</a> of eleven leaders of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20United%20States">Communist Party of the United States</a> for subversion. He ruled that calls for the violent overthrow of the American government posed enough of a "probable danger" to justify the invasion of free speech. After the case, he was attacked from the opposite political direction for appearing to side with McCarthyism.

In 1953, Hand wrote a scathing dissent from a Second Circuit decision to affirm the <a href="perjury">perjury</a> conviction of <a href="William%20Remington">William Remington</a>, a government economist accused of Communist sympathies and activities. In 1951, the same panel had overturned Remington's previous conviction for perjury, but in the appeal of the later case Hand was outvoted two to one. The prosecution produced stronger evidence against Remington this time, much of it obtained from his wife. Sentenced to three years imprisonment, Remington was murdered in November 1954 by three fellow inmates, who beat him over the head with a brick wrapped in a sock. According to Hand's biographer Gunther, "The image of Remington being bludgeoned to death in prison haunted Hand for the rest of his life."

Only after stepping down as a full-time judge in 1951 did Hand join the public debate on McCarthyism. Shortly after his semi-retirement, he gave an unscripted speech that was published in "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", an anti-McCarthy newspaper.

[M]y friends, will you not agree that any society which begins to be doubtful of itself; in which one man looks at another and says: "He may be a traitor," in which that spirit has disappeared which says: "I will not accept that, I will not believe that—I will demand proof. I will not say of my brother that he may be a traitor," but I will say, "Produce what you have. I will judge it fairly, and if he is, he shall pay the penalties; but I will not take it on rumor. I will not take it on hearsay. I will remember that what has brought us up from savagery is a loyalty to truth, and truth cannot emerge unless it is subjected to the utmost scrutiny"—will you not agree that a society which has lost sight of that, cannot survive?

Hand followed this up with an address to the <a href="Board%20of%20Governors">Board of Regents</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20the%20State%20of%20New%20York">University of the State of New York</a> the next year. Once again, his attack on McCarthyism won approval from many liberals. Asked to send a copy of his views to McCarthy, Hand replied that he had <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> in mind as well. Despite his concerns about Nixon as <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a>, Hand voted for <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201952">1952 election</a>, later crediting Eisenhower with bringing about McCarthy's downfall in 1954.

In 1951, Hand retired from "regular active service" as a federal judge. He assumed <a href="senior%20status">senior status</a>, a form of semi-retirement, and continued to sit on the bench, with a considerable workload. The following year, he published "The Spirit of Liberty", a collection of papers and addresses that neither he nor publisher <a href="Alfred%20A.%20Knopf">Alfred A. Knopf</a> expected to make a profit. In fact, the book earned admiring reviews, sold well, and made Hand more widely known. A 1958 paperback edition sold even better, though Hand always refused royalties from material he never intended for publication.

Louis Dow had died in 1944, with Frances Hand at his side. The Hands' marriage then entered its final, happiest phase, in which they rediscovered their first love. Former <a href="law%20clerks">law clerks</a> have provided intimate details of Hand's character during the last decade of his life. Legal philosopher <a href="Ronald%20Dworkin">Ronald Dworkin</a> recalls that Hand, scrupulous about public economy, used to turn out the lights in all the offices at the end of each day. For the same reason, he refused Dworkin the customary month's paid vacation at the end of his service. Shortly afterward, to Dworkin's surprise, Hand wrote him a personal check for an extra month's pay as a wedding present. Hand was known for his explosive temper. Gunther remembers him throwing a paperweight in his direction which narrowly missed. Hand had a habit of turning his seat 180° on lawyers whose arguments annoyed him, and he could be bitingly sarcastic. In a typical memo, he wrote, "This is the most miserable of cases, but we must dispose of it as though it had been presented by actual lawyers." Despite such outbursts, Hand was deeply insecure throughout his life, as he fully recognized. In his 80s, he still fretted about his rejection by the elite social clubs at Harvard College. He was convinced that his wife had rescued him from a life as a "melancholic, a failure [because] I should have thought myself so, and probably single and hopelessly hypochondriac".

Learned Hand remained in good physical and mental condition for most of the last decade of his life. In 1958, he gave the Holmes Lectures at <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a>. These lectures proved to be Hand's last major critique of <a href="judicial%20activism">judicial activism</a>, a position he had first taken up in 1908 with his attack on the <a href="Lochner%20v.%20New%20York">"Lochner" ruling</a>. They included a controversial attack on the <a href="Warren%20Court">Warren Court</a>'s 1954 decision in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>", which in Hand's opinion had exceeded its powers by overruling <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow segregation laws</a>. His views were widely criticized as reactionary and unfortunate, with most deploring the fact that they might encourage segregationists who opposed libertarian judicial rulings. Published as "The Bill of Rights", the lectures nevertheless became a national bestseller.

"<a href="Catcher%20in%20the%20Rye">Catcher in the Rye</a>" author <a href="J.%20D.%20Salinger">J. D. Salinger</a> became a neighbor in <a href="Cornish%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Cornish, New Hampshire</a> in 1953, and Hand became Salinger's best and almost only friend as Salinger become more and more reclusive.

By 1958, Hand was suffering from intense pain in his back and faced difficulty in walking. "I can just manage, with not infrequent pauses, to walk about a third of a mile," he wrote to <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a>. "My feet get very numb and my back painful. The truth is that 86 is too long." Soon, he was obliged to use crutches, but he remained mentally sharp and continued to hear cases. In 1960, he worked briefly on <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">President Dwight Eisenhower</a>'s "Commission on National Goals", but he resigned because "it involved more work than in the present state of my health I care to add to the judicial work that I am still trying to do".

By June 1961, Hand was in a wheelchair. He joked that he felt idle because he had taken part in no more than about 25 cases that year, and that he would start another job if he could find one. The following month, he suffered a heart attack at <a href="Cornish%2C%20New%20Hampshire">Cornish</a>. He was taken to <a href="St.%20Luke%27s-Roosevelt%20Hospital%20Center">St Luke's Hospital</a> in New York City, where he died peacefully on August 18, 1961. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" ran a front-page obituary. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" of London wrote: "There are many who will feel that with the death of Learned Hand the golden age of the American judiciary has come to an end."

He was buried next to his wife in the family plot at <a href="Albany%20Rural%20Cemetery">Albany Rural Cemetery</a> near <a href="Menands%2C%20New%20York">Menands</a>, New York.

His grandson was actor <a href="Richard%20Jordan">Richard Jordan</a>.

Hand's study of <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> at Harvard left a lasting imprint on his thought. As a student, he lost his faith in God, and from that point on he became a <a href="skepticism">skeptic</a>. Hand's view of the world has been identified as <a href="moral%20relativism">relativistic</a>; in the words of scholar Kathryn Griffith, "[i]t was his devotion to a concept of relative values that prompted him to question opinions of the Supreme Court which appeared to place one value absolutely above the others, whether the value was that of individual freedom or equality or the protection of young people from obscene literature." Hand instead sought objective standards in constitutional law, most famously in <a href="obscenity">obscenity</a> and <a href="civil%20liberties">civil liberties</a> cases. He saw the Constitution and the law as compromises to resolve conflicting interests, possessing no moral force of their own. This denial that any divine or <a href="natural%20rights">natural rights</a> are embodied in the Constitution led Hand to a <a href="legal%20positivism">positivistic</a> view of the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a>. In this approach, provisions of the Constitution, such as freedom of press, freedom of speech, and equal protection, should be interpreted through their wording and in the light of historical analysis rather than as "guides on concrete occasions". For Hand, moral values were a product of their times and a matter of taste.

Hand's civil instincts were at odds with the duty of a judge to stay aloof from politics. As a judge he respected even bad laws; as a member of society he felt free to question the decisions behind legislation. In his opinion, members of a democratic society should be involved in legislative decision-making. He therefore regarded toleration as a prerequisite of civil liberty. In practice, this even meant that those who wish to promote ideas repugnant to the majority should be free to do so, within broad limits.

Hand's skepticism extended to his <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a>: he once described himself as "a conservative among liberals, and a liberal among conservatives". As early as 1898, he rejected his family's Jeffersonian <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic tradition</a>. His thoughts on <a href="liberty">liberty</a>, collected in "The Spirit of Liberty" (1952), began by recalling the political philosophies of <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>. Jefferson believed that each individual has a <a href="natural%20right">right</a> to freedom, and that government, though necessary, threatens that freedom. In contrast, Hamilton argued that freedom depends on government: too much freedom leads to <a href="anarchy">anarchy</a> and the <a href="Ochlocracy">tyranny of the mob</a>. Hand, who believed, following <a href="Thomas%20Hobbes">Thomas Hobbes</a>, that the <a href="rule%20of%20law">rule of law</a> is the only alternative to the rule of brutality, leaned towards Hamilton. Since the freedom granted to the <a href="American%20pioneer">American pioneer</a>s was no longer feasible, he accepted that individual liberty should be moderated by society's norms. He nevertheless saw the liberty to create and to choose as vital to peoples' humanity and entitled to legal protection. He assumed the goal of human beings to be the "good life", defined as each individual chooses.

Between 1910 and 1916, Hand tried to translate his political philosophy into political action. Having read Croly's "<a href="The%20Promise%20of%20American%20Life">The Promise of American Life</a>" and its anti-Jeffersonian plea for government <a href="economic%20intervention">intervention</a> in economic and social issues, he joined the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">Progressive Party</a>. However, he discovered that party politicking was incompatible not only with his role as a judge but with his philosophical objectivity. The <a href="pragmatism">pragmatic</a> philosophy Hand had imbibed from <a href="William%20James">William James</a> at Harvard required each issue to be individually judged on its merits, without partiality. In contrast, political action required partisanship and a choice between values. After 1916, Hand preferred to retreat from party politics into a detached skepticism. His belief in <a href="planned%20economy">central planning</a> resurfaced during the 1930s in his growing approval of <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>, as he once again—though this time as an observer—endorsed a program of government intervention. Hand was also an <a href="interventionism%20%28politics%29">interventionist</a> on foreign policy, supporting U.S. involvement in both <a href="world%20war">world war</a>s, and disdained <a href="non-interventionism">isolationism</a>.

Hand has been called one of the United States' most significant judicial philosophers. A leading advocate of <a href="judicial%20restraint">judicial restraint</a>, he took seriously <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>'s formulation that "the judiciary ... may truly be said to have neither "force" nor "will", but merely judgement." Any judicial ruling that had the effect of legislating from the bench troubled Hand. In 1908, in his article "Due Process of Law and the Eight-Hour Day", he attacked the 1905 Supreme Court ruling in "<a href="Lochner%20v.%20New%20York">Lochner v. New York</a>", which had struck down a law prohibiting bakery staff from working more than ten hours a day. The Supreme Court went on to strike down a series of similar worker-protective laws on the grounds that they restricted <a href="freedom%20of%20contract">freedom of contract</a>. Hand regarded this principle as undemocratic. "For the state to intervene", he argued, "to make more just and equal the relative strategic advantages of the two parties to the contract, of whom one is under the pressure of absolute want, while the other is not, is as proper a legislative function as that it should neutralize the relative advantages arising from fraudulent cunning or from superior force."

The issue concerned Hand again during the New Deal period, when the Supreme Court repeatedly overturned or blocked Franklin D. Roosevelt's legislation. As an instinctive democrat, Hand was appalled that an elected government should have its laws struck down in this way. He viewed it as a judicial "<a href="usurper">usurpation</a>" for the Supreme Court to assume the role of a third chamber in these cases. As far as he was concerned, the Constitution already provided a full set of checks and balances on legislation. Nevertheless, Hand did not hesitate to condemn Roosevelt's frustrated attempt to <a href="Judiciary%20Reorganization%20Bill%20of%201937">pack the Supreme Court in 1937</a>, which led commentators to warn of <a href="totalitarianism">totalitarianism</a>. The answer, for Hand, lay in the <a href="separation%20of%20powers">separation of powers</a>: courts should be independent and act on the legislation of elected governments.

Hand's democratic respect for legislation meant that he hardly ever struck down a law. Whenever his decisions went against the government, he based them only on the boundaries of law in particular cases. He adhered to the doctrine of presumptive validity, which assumes that legislators know what they are doing when they pass a law. Even when a law was uncongenial to him, or when it seemed contradictory, Hand set himself to interpret the <a href="legislative%20intent">legislative intent</a>. Sometimes, however, he was obliged to draw the line between federal and state laws, as in "United States v. Schechter Poultry". In this important case, he ruled that a <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> law on working conditions did not apply to a New York poultry firm that conducted its business only within the state. Hand wrote in his opinion: "It is always a serious thing to declare any act of Congress unconstitutional, and especially in a case where it is part of a comprehensive plan for the rehabilitation of the nation as a whole. With the wisdom of that plan we have nothing whatever to do ..."
Hand also occasionally went against the government in the area of free speech. He believed that courts should protect the right to free speech even against the majority will. In Hand's view, judges must remain detached at times when public opinion is hostile to minorities and governments issue laws to repress those minorities. Hand was the first judge to rule on a case arising from the <a href="Espionage%20Act%20of%201917">Espionage Act of 1917</a>, which sought to silence opposition to the war effort. In his decision on "<a href="Masses%20Publishing%20Co.%20v.%20Patten">Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten</a>", he defined his position on political incitement:

Detestation of existing policies is easily transformed into forcible resistance of the authority which puts them in execution, and it would be folly to disregard the causal relation between the two. Yet to assimilate agitation, legitimate as such, with direct incitement to violent resistance, is to disregard the tolerance of all methods of political agitation which in normal times is a safeguard for free government. The distinction is not scholastic subterfuge, but a hard-bought acquisition in the fight for freedom.

In the case of "<a href="Dennis%20v.%20United%20States">United States v. Dennis</a>" in 1950, Hand made a ruling that appeared to contradict his "<a href="Masses%20Publishing%20Co.%20v.%20Patten">Masses</a>" decision. By then, a series of precedents had intervened, often based on Oliver Wendell Holmes's "<a href="clear%20and%20present%20danger">clear and present danger</a>" test, leaving him less room for maneuver. Hand felt he had "no choice" but to agree that threats against the government by a group of <a href="Communists">Communists</a> were illegal under the repressive <a href="Smith%20Act">Smith Act</a> of 1940. In order to do so, he interpreted the "clear and present danger" in a new way. "In each case," he wrote, "[courts] must ask whether the gravity of the 'evil', discounted by its improbability, justifies such invasion of free speech as is necessary to avoid the danger." This formula allowed more scope for curbing free speech in cases where, as the government believed with Communism, the danger was grave, whether it was immediate or not. Critics and disappointed liberals accused Hand of placing his concern for judicial restraint ahead of freedom of speech. Hand confided to a friend that, if it had been up to him, he would "never have prosecuted those birds".

In the opinion of Kathryn Griffith, "The importance of Learned Hand's philosophy in terms of practical application to the courts lies generally in his view of the <a href="pragmaticism">pragmatic</a> origin of all law, but most specifically in his unique interpretation of the Bill of Rights." Hand proposed that the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a> was not law at all but a set of "admonitory" principles to ensure the fair exercise of constitutional powers. He therefore opposed the use of its "due process of law" clauses as a pretext for national intervention in state legislation. He even advocated the removal of those clauses from the Constitution. In Hand's analysis, "due process" is no more than a stock phrase to cover a long tradition of <a href="common%20law">common law</a> procedure. He contended that the term had inflated in scope beyond the meaning intended in the Bill of Rights. The result was the misuse of due process to invade rights that the Constitution was designed to protect. For Hand, a law passed by an elected body should be presumed to meet the test of due process. A court that decides otherwise and strikes down such a law is acting undemocratically. Hand maintained this stance even when the Supreme Court struck down anti-liberal laws that he detested. His reasoning has never been widely accepted. Critics of his position included his colleague on the Second Circuit, <a href="Jerome%20Frank%20%28lawyer%29">Jerome Frank</a>, who wrote: "[I]t seems to me that here, most uncharacteristically, Judge Hand indulges in a judgement far too sweeping, one which rests on a too-sharp either-or, all or nothing, dichotomy. ... Obviously the courts cannot do the whole job. But just as obviously, they can sometimes help to arrest evil popular trends at their inception."

<a href="Richard%20Posner">Richard Posner</a>, an influential appellate judge reviewing a biography of Hand, asserts that Hand "displayed a positive antipathy toward constitutional law. To exaggerate only a little, he didn't think judges should have anything to do with it." Posner suggests that although Hand is remembered today as one of the three greatest judges in American history, his status as a truly "great judge" was not based on his "slight" contributions to First Amendment jurisprudence or other fields of constitutional law, but rather on his decisions in other areas such as antitrust, intellectual property, and tort law.

Learned Hand wrote approximately four thousand judicial opinions during his career. Admired for their clarity and analytic precision, they have been quoted more often in Supreme Court opinions and by legal scholars than those of any other lower-court judge. Both Hand's dissent in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Kennerley">United States v. Kennerley</a>" and his ruling in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Levine">United States v. Levine</a>" have often been cited in obscenity cases. Hand's view that literary works should be judged as a whole and in relation to their intended readership is now accepted in American law. His use of historical data to gauge <a href="legislative%20intent">legislative intent</a> has become a widespread practice. According to <a href="Archibald%20Cox">Archibald Cox</a>: "The opinions of Judge Hand have had significant influence both in breaking down the restrictions imposed by the dry literalism of conservative tradition and in showing how to use with sympathetic understanding the information afforded by the legislative and administrative processes." Hand's decision in the 1917 "Masses" case influenced <a href="Zechariah%20Chafee">Zechariah Chafee</a>'s widely read book, "Freedom of Speech" (1920). In his dedication, Chafee wrote, "[Hand] during the turmoil of war courageously maintained the traditions of English-speaking freedom and gave it new clearness and strength for the wiser years to come."

Learned Hand played a key role in the interpretation of new <a href="federal%20crime">federal crime</a> laws in the period following the passing of the U.S. Criminal Code in 1909. In a series of judicial opinions and speeches, he opposed excessive concern for criminal defendants, and wrote "Our dangers do not lie in too little tenderness to the accused. Our procedure has always been haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted. ... What we need to fear is the archaic formalism and watery sentiment that obstructs, delays and defeats the prosecution of crime." He insisted that <a href="Harmless%20error">harmless trial errors</a> should not automatically lead to a reversal on appeal. Hand balanced these views with important decisions to protect a defendant's constitutional rights concerning unreasonable searches, forced confessions and cumulative sentences.

His opinions have also proved lasting in fields of <a href="commercial%20law">commercial law</a>. Law students studying <a href="torts">torts</a> often encounter Hand's 1947 decision for "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Carroll%20Towing%20Co.">United States v. Carroll Towing Co.</a>", which gave a formula for determining liability in cases of <a href="negligence">negligence</a>. Hand's interpretations of complex <a href="Internal%20Revenue%20Code">Internal Revenue Code</a>s, which he called "a thicket of verbiage", have been used as guides in the gray area between individual and <a href="corporate%20tax">corporate tax</a>es. In an opinion sometimes seen as condoning tax avoidance, Hand stated in 1947 that "there is nothing sinister in so arranging one's affairs as to keep taxes as low as possible". He was referring to reporting of individual income through corporate <a href="Tax%20forms%20in%20the%20United%20States">tax forms</a> for legitimate business reasons. In tax decisions, as in all statutory cases, Hand studied the intent of the original legislation. His opinions became a valuable guide to tax administrators. Hand's landmark decision in "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Aluminum%20Company%20of%20America">United States v. Aluminum Company of America</a>" in 1945 influenced the development of <a href="Competition%20law">antitrust law</a>. His decisions in <a href="patent">patent</a>, <a href="copyright">copyright</a>, and <a href="admiralty%20law">admiralty</a> cases have contributed to the development of law in those fields.

Hand was also a founding member of the <a href="American%20Law%20Institute">American Law Institute</a>, where he helped develop the influential <a href="Restatements%20of%20the%20Law">Restatements of the Law</a> serving as models for refining and improving state codes in various fields. One American Law Institute recommendation was to decriminalize sexual conduct such as adultery and homosexuality, for which reason the July–August 1955 issue of the <a href="Mattachine%20Society">Mattachine Society Review</a>, the magazine of the country's first nationwide homosexual organization, published a salute to Judge Hand featuring his photograph on the cover.

After Hand's lectures and publications became widely known, his influence reached courts throughout the country. On the occasion of his 75th birthday on January 27, 1947, "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" reported: "He has won recognition as a judges' judge. His opinions command respect wherever our law extends, not because of his standing in the judicial hierarchy, but because of the clarity of thought and the cogency of reasoning that shape them."

To the wider public, who knew little of his legal work, Hand was by then a folk hero. <a href="Social%20scientist">Social scientist</a> Marvin Schick has pointed out that this mythic status is a <a href="paradox">paradox</a>. Because Hand never served on the Supreme Court, the majority of his cases were routine and his judgments rooted in precedent. On Hand's retirement in 1951, <a href="Felix%20Frankfurter">Felix Frankfurter</a> predicted that his "actual decisions will be all deader than the Dodo before long, as at least many of them are already". Working for a lower court, however, saved Hand from the taint of political influence that often hung over the Supreme Court. Hand's eloquence as a writer played a larger part in the spread of his influence than the substance of his decisions; and Schick believes that the Hand myth brushes over contradictions in his legal philosophy. Hand's reputation as a libertarian obscures the fact that he was cautious as a judge. Though a liberal, he argued for judicial restraint in interpreting the Constitution, and regarded the advancement of civil liberties as a task for the legislature, not the courts. In his 1958 Holmes Lectures, for example, he voiced doubts about the constitutionality of the <a href="Warren%20Court">Warren Court</a>'s <a href="civil%20rights">civil rights</a> rulings. This philosophy of judicial restraint failed to influence the decisions of the Supreme Court during Hand's lifetime and afterwards.

Finally, in an essay called "Origin of a Hero" discussing his novel the "Rector of Justin", author <a href="Louis%20Auchincloss">Louis Auchincloss</a> says the main character was not based on a headmaster; certainly not as was often speculated <a href="Groton%20School">Groton's</a> famous <a href="Endicott%20Peabody%20%28educator%29">Endicott Peabody</a>. "If you want to disguise a real life character," Auchincloss advised fellow novelists, "just change his profession." His actual model for the Rector of Justin was "the greatest man it has been my good luck to know" – Judge Learned Hand.

Neal Dow

Neal Dow (March 20, 1804 – October 2, 1897) was an American <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a> advocate and politician. Nicknamed the "Napoleon of <a href="Temperance%20movement">Temperance</a>" and the "Father of Prohibition", Dow was born to a <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> family in <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>. From a young age, he believed <a href="alcoholic%20drink">alcohol</a> to be the cause of many of society's problems and sought to ban it through legislation. In 1850, Dow was elected president of the Maine Temperance Union, and the next year he was elected <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Portland%2C%20Maine">mayor of Portland</a>. Soon after, largely due to Dow's efforts, the <a href="Maine%20State%20Legislature">state legislature</a> banned the sale and production of alcohol in what became known as the <a href="Maine%20law">Maine law</a>. Serving twice as mayor of Portland, Dow enforced the law with vigor and called for increasingly harsh penalties for violators. In 1855, <a href="Portland%20Rum%20Riot">his opponents rioted</a> and he ordered the state militia to fire on the crowd. One man was killed and several wounded, and when public reaction to the violence turned against Dow, he chose not to seek reelection.

Dow was later elected to two terms in the <a href="Maine%20House%20of%20Representatives">Maine House of Representatives</a>, but retired after a financial scandal. He joined the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> shortly after the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> in 1861, eventually attaining the rank of <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>. He was wounded at the <a href="siege%20of%20Port%20Hudson">siege of Port Hudson</a> and later captured. After being <a href="prisoner%20exchange">exchanged</a> for another officer in 1864, Dow resigned from the military and devoted himself once more to prohibition. He spoke across the United States, <a href="Prohibition%20in%20Canada">Canada</a>, and Great Britain in support of the cause. In <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">1880</a>, Dow headed the <a href="Prohibition%20Party">Prohibition Party</a> ticket for President of the United States. After losing the election, he continued to write and speak on behalf of the prohibition movement for the rest of his life until his death in Portland at the age of 93.

Dow was born in Portland, Maine on March 20, 1804, the son of Josiah Dow and his wife, Dorcas Allen Dow. Josiah Dow was a member of the <a href="Quakers">Society of Friends</a> (commonly known as Quakers) and a farmer originally from <a href="New%20Hampshire">New Hampshire</a>. Dorcas Allen was also a Quaker, and a member of a prosperous Maine family headed by her prominent grandfather, Hate-Evil Hall. They had three children, of whom Neal was the middle child and only son. After his marriage, Dow's father opened a <a href="tanning%20%28leather%29">tannery</a> in Portland, which soon became a successful business. After attending a Friends school in <a href="New%20Bedford%2C%20Massachusetts">New Bedford, Massachusetts</a>, and further schooling at <a href="Edward%20Payson">Edward Payson</a>'s Portland Academy, Dow followed his father into the tanning trade in 1826. He embraced technology, becoming one of the first in the city to incorporate <a href="steam%20engine">steam power</a> in the tanning process.

Dow struggled to conform to the tenets of his parents' Quaker faith; he was hot-tempered and enjoyed brawling from a young age. As he became wealthy later in life, he enjoyed wearing fine clothes, contrary to the Quakers' preference for plain dress. Some of his family's other virtues, such as thrift and abstinence from alcohol and tobacco, he adopted early in life. When he turned eighteen, Dow sought to avoid the required <a href="Militia%20%28United%20States%29">militia</a> musters, more out of distaste for the drunkenness that they often involved than out of Quaker belief in pacifism. Instead, he joined the <a href="volunteer%20fire%20department">volunteer fire department</a>, whose members were exempted from the muster. In 1827, Dow lobbied the <a href="Maine%20legislature">Maine legislature</a> to reform the fire companies to increase their efficiency. That same year, he argued against his fire company serving alcohol at its anniversary celebration; the members compromised, and served only wine, not <a href="distilled%20beverage">hard liquor</a>. At times Dow let his politics interfere with his duties; after being promoted to fire chief, he allowed a liquor store to burn to the ground.

The next year, Dow met his future wife, Maria Cornelia Maynard, the daughter of a Massachusetts merchant. They married on January 20, 1830. Over the next twenty years, they had nine children, five of whom (two sons and three daughters) survived infancy. Maria Cornelia was a <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalist</a>, and Dow attended services with her at <a href="Second%20Parish%20Church%20%28Portland%2C%20Maine%29">Second Parish Church</a> regularly, although he never became a member. Their home, built at 714 Congress Street in Portland in 1829, still stands and is now a museum memorializing Dow's life and administered by the local chapter of the <a href="Women%27s%20Christian%20Temperance%20Union">Women's Christian Temperance Union</a>.

In the 19th century, a typical American male consumed on average more than three times the alcohol of his modern-day counterpart. In his memoirs, Dow noted that in Portland a significant portion of a working man's pay was in the form of daily <a href="rum">rum</a> rations: "it was ... the rule to quit work at eleven in the forenoon and four in the afternoon to drink ... In every grocer's shop were casks [of] ... rum punch constantly prepared in a tub, sometimes on the sidewalk, just as lemonade is to be seen now on the Fourth of July." He saw alcohol as responsible for the downfall of individuals, families, and fortunes, often pointing out ramshackle homes or businesses to his family and saying "Rum did that." His quest to reform people by reforming their environment grew out of the religious movements of the <a href="Second%20Great%20Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a> and, as historian Judith N. McArthur later wrote, "temperance reformers urged their listeners to cast Demon Rum out of their lives just as evangelical ministers exhorted them to cast the Devil out of their hearts."

Many of Portland's middle- and upper-class citizens, including Dow, believed drunkenness was a great threat to the city's moral and financial well-being. In 1827, he became a founding member of the Maine Temperance Society. The group initially focused its efforts on the evils of distilled beverages, but by 1829, Dow declared he would abstain from all alcoholic beverages. At the same time, he associated himself with <a href="Anti-Masonic%20Party">anti-Masonic</a> and <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-slavery</a> causes, and became more involved with politics generally. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">1832 presidential election</a>, unsatisfied with both <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> and <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, Dow backed <a href="William%20Wirt%20%28Attorney%20General%29">William Wirt</a>, a minor-party candidate.

In 1837, the Maine Temperance Society split over whether they should seek to ban wine as well as spirits; Dow sided with the anti-wine forces, who formed their own organization, the Maine Temperance Union. That year <a href="James%20Appleton">James Appleton</a>, a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a> representative in the state legislature, proposed a <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a> law, and Dow spoke often and forcefully in favor of the effort, which was unsuccessful. Appleton proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839, but despite his and Dow's best efforts, he continued to be defeated.
Dow worked fervently on behalf of Whig candidates and came to detest <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Democratic%20Party">Democrats</a> as the tools of the alcohol industry. Maine's Whig governor, <a href="Edward%20Kent">Edward Kent</a>, granted Dow a <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">colonel</a>'s commission in the state militia in 1841 as a reward for his efforts, despite his lack of military experience. Nevertheless, Dow did not consider himself "a party man in the politician's understanding of the term," and had no qualms about encouraging his supporters to vote against any Whig whom he considered insufficiently anti-alcohol.

Dow spent the early 1840s attending to his tanning business, but also found time to encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require <a href="Liquor%20license%23United%20States">licenses</a> for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; a referendum on the question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow kept up his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.

In 1846, Dow spoke before the legislature in favor of statewide prohibition. The bill passed, but lacked the enforcement mechanisms necessary to give it effect. The following year, he ran for the state legislature in a special election, but was narrowly defeated. In 1850, now a member of the new <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil Party</a>, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it <a href="veto">veto</a>ed by Democratic governor <a href="John%20W.%20Dana">John W. Dana</a>. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.

In 1850, Dow was elected president of the Maine Temperance Union. The next year, he ran for mayor of Portland on the Whig ticket, and was elected by a vote of 1332 to 986. Within a month of taking office, he lobbied the state legislature to pass a statewide prohibition law. It did so, and Dow met with the new Governor, <a href="John%20Hubbard%20%28Maine%20politician%29">John Hubbard</a>, who signed the bill into law on June 2. Maine was the first state to ban alcohol, and statewide prohibition became known around the country as "the Maine law". The law's passage propelled Dow to national fame. He was called the "Napoleon of Temperance", and was the featured speaker in August at a National Temperance Convention in New York City.

After the Maine law came into force, Dow allowed liquor dealers a two-week grace period to sell their stock out of state, then began confiscations. His enforcement efforts quickly drove respectable drinking establishments out of business, but less fancy saloons, especially those frequented by Portland's poor and immigrant residents, simply moved their operations to <a href="speakeasy">secret locations</a>. Even so, Dow proclaimed in an address to the city council that he had eliminated all but a "few secret grog-shops", whose persistence he blamed on "foreigners".

Despite his growing national fame, Dow continued to face opposition at home. Both Dow and his opponents engaged in anonymous newspaper campaigns against the other, often making personal attacks alongside political arguments. For the 1852 municipal election, the Democrats nominated <a href="Albion%20Parris">Albion Parris</a>, a former governor and United States Senator, to run against Dow. While the Democrats rallied behind their candidate, Dow's vigorous enforcement of prohibition divided his party, and in two wards the Whigs ran an anti-Dow ticket instead. On election day, Dow slightly increased his vote total from the year before, with 1496, but Parris outpolled him, bringing in 1900 votes. Although the Whigs controlled voter registration at the time, Dow blamed his loss on illegal voting by <a href="Irish%20Americans">Irish immigrants</a>.

After his defeat, Dow continued to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified to see it spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin <a href="John%20Neal%20%28writer%29">John Neal</a>) that the Maine law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to break apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the <a href="Know%20Nothing">Know Nothing</a>s, a <a href="nativism%20%28politics%29">nativist</a> party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a>. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.

Two months into his term, Dow inadvertently ran afoul of his own prohibition laws. After setting up a committee to dispense alcohol for medicinal and industrial use (the only uses permitted), Dow ordered $1600 worth of alcohol and stored it at City Hall. Dow neglected to appoint an official agent to hold it there; because the invoice was in his name, this placed Dow in technical violation of the law. Dow's enemies seized on the mistake and demanded that the police search the municipal building for illegal liquor. Because the recent additions to the Maine law had removed judicial discretion, the judge had no choice but to issue the warrant. Police seized the alcohol, but did not arrest Dow.

That evening, June 2, a crowd of anti-prohibitionists gathered to demand that the law be enforced, shouting threats to spill "Neal Dow's liquor". Dow ordered the state militia to block the protesters and had the sheriff read the crowd the <a href="Riot%20Act">Riot Act</a>. As darkness fell, Dow ordered the crowd to disperse; when they refused, he ordered the militia to fire. One man was killed and seven were wounded, and the crowd fled. On learning of the fatality, Dow maintained that the shooting was justified and asked if the dead man was Irish (he was not).

The violence turned public opinion against Dow, and he was denounced in newspapers across the nation. He was tried for violation of the prohibition law; the prosecutor was former U.S. Attorney General <a href="Nathan%20Clifford">Nathan Clifford</a>, a longtime Dow opponent, and the defense attorney was a fellow founder of the Maine Temperance Society, future senator <a href="William%20P.%20Fessenden">William P. Fessenden</a>. Dow was acquitted, but his opponents convinced the <a href="coroner">coroner</a> to impanel a <a href="coroner%27s%20jury">jury</a> that pronounced the protester's death a homicide. He was ultimately acquitted of that charge, but his popularity had suffered and he declined to run for re-election as mayor.

Republicans lost the governorship that fall, and in 1856 the Democrats combined with the remaining Whigs in the state legislature to repeal the Maine law entirely. Some of the other states that had passed Maine laws followed suit as they learned that the promised benefits were not forthcoming and enforcement was difficult, if not impossible. Dow continued to travel the country (and the United Kingdom) speaking in support of prohibition, but to little legislative effect. Maine passed a new, much milder Maine law in 1858, which Dow disliked but defended as better than nothing.

In 1858, Dow won a <a href="special%20election">special election</a> to the <a href="Maine%20House%20of%20Representatives">Maine House of Representatives</a> as a Republican when one of the members elected declined to serve. He won reelection to a full term in 1859, and continued to agitate for stricter prohibition laws, but was unsuccessful. He also became entangled in scandal when the State Treasurer, Benjamin D. Peck, lent out state funds to private citizens (including Dow) contravening state law. Peck lent large sums to himself, which were lost when his business ventures failed. Dow had guaranteed some of Peck's borrowing, and faced ruin as it became clear that Peck could not repay the state treasury. Dow was able to settle the debts and conceal much of his role in the affair, but enough of the scandal became known that some of his many enemies attacked him in local newspapers. Even some of his prohibitionist allies became less openly supportive of him. In September 1860, he did not run for re-election.

Dow continued to promote prohibition after leaving office, but also added his voice to the growing chorus advocating the <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolition of slavery</a>. Several slaveholding states <a href="Ordinance%20of%20Secession">seceded</a> after the election of Republican presidential candidate <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, and formed the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>; even before the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>, Dow called for the rebellion to be crushed and slavery abolished. He was 57 years old at the outbreak of the war, and determined to stay home and tend to his business and care for his aging father. After the Confederate <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">attack on Fort Sumter</a>, however, Dow felt compelled to join the Union cause. Governor <a href="Israel%20Washburn">Israel Washburn</a> appointed him <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> of the <a href="13th%20Maine%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">13th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a> on November 23, 1861. Many of the officers Dow recruited to the cause were his associates from the prohibition movement.

After a winter of training in Maine, Dow and the 13th Maine were dispatched to the <a href="Lower%20Seaboard%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Gulf of Mexico</a> in February 1862. Even before departing, Dow quarreled with his superiors when he learned his unit would be placed under the command of Major General <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin F. Butler</a>, a Democrat whom Dow regarded as soft on slavery and "pro-rum". Dow's protests were ineffective, but they earned Butler's enmity. After joining Butler at <a href="Fort%20Monroe">Fort Monroe</a>, Virginia, the regiment sailed south and was forced to land in North Carolina after a storm; Dow's performance in the emergency won Butler's praise, but the two still cordially loathed each other. After the damaged ships were repaired, Butler's army continued south to <a href="Ship%20Island%20%28Mississippi%29">Ship Island</a>, Mississippi.

Butler's army, aided by Flag Officer <a href="David%20Farragut">David Farragut</a>'s fleet, <a href="Capture%20of%20New%20Orleans">captured New Orleans</a> on April 29, 1862. Dow and the 13th Maine did not join in the attack, remaining behind to guard Ship Island. A day earlier, Congress had approved Dow's promotion to <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a>. He blamed Butler for excluding him from the battle, believing that Butler was threatened by his promotion and calling him a "bully and a beast". He spent much of the time quarreling with his second-in-command, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Francis%20S.%20Hesseltine">Francis S. Hesseltine</a>, while the regiment occupied forts around New Orleans. While there, Dow encouraged black slaves to run away from captivity and take shelter with the Union Army. He also confiscated property from nearby planters, including those who supported the Union, and tried unsuccessfully to claim personal salvage rights over Confederate military property abandoned in the river.

In October 1862, Dow was given command over the District of <a href="Pensacola">Pensacola</a>, and moved to join other units there. He immediately earned the troops' disfavor by placing Pensacola under prohibition. He also (without authorization from Washington) began to recruit <a href="United%20States%20Colored%20Troops">black troops</a> from the local slave population while continuing his confiscation of rebel property. Butler soon countermanded the confiscation order, which Dow believed was done in revenge for his banning of alcohol.

In December 1862, <a href="Nathaniel%20P.%20Banks">Nathaniel P. Banks</a> replaced Butler in command at New Orleans. Banks, a Massachusetts Republican with prohibitionist sympathies, had known Dow before the war, but he initially displeased Dow by refusing to repeal Butler's order against confiscation of rebel property. He did, however, allow Dow to return to New Orleans to take part in the planned <a href="Vicksburg%20Campaign">spring offensive</a>. As the Union armies looked to complete their control over the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>, only <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a> and <a href="Port%20Hudson%2C%20Louisiana">Port Hudson, Louisiana</a> held out against federal control. Major General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a> moved on Vicksburg from the north while Banks advanced to Port Hudson from the south. By May 21, the town was surrounded.

Banks was determined to break the siege by a direct assault on the Confederate lines. Dow believed the attack to be a mistake, and delayed his units' participation until later in the day. In the assault, which was unsuccessful, Dow was wounded in the right arm and left thigh and sent to a nearby plantation to convalesce. While in the hospital, he lobbied for a transfer to a theater where his chances of promotion would be greater. On June 30, having healed enough to mount a horse again, Dow visited his troops. As he returned to the hospital after dark, he was captured by Confederate cavalry operating behind Union lines.

Dow was taken by wagon and train to <a href="Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Jackson, Mississippi</a>, then to <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>, before finally being confined to <a href="Libby%20Prison">Libby Prison</a> in Richmond, Virginia, the Confederacy's capital. In August, he was transferred to Mobile, Alabama, where Confederate officials investigated whether Dow had armed slaves to fight against the rebels, which the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate Congress</a> had made a capital offense. Dow had done so, but his prosecutors could find no evidence of such an action after the law was passed, so the charges were dropped and Dow was returned to Libby Prison in October. He remained there until February 1864, when he was exchanged for captive Confederate General <a href="William%20Henry%20Fitzhugh%20Lee">William Henry Fitzhugh Lee</a>, son of General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>. His health was damaged by his prison experience, and after spending several months convalescing in Portland, he resigned from the Army in November 1864.

After the war, Dow returned to his leadership of the prohibition movement, co-founding the <a href="National%20Temperance%20Society%20and%20Publishing%20House">National Temperance Society and Publishing House</a> with <a href="James%20Black%20%28prohibitionist%29">James Black</a> in 1865. He spent the rest of the 1860s and 1870s giving speeches in support of temperance across the United States, Canada, and Great Britain. His efforts produced little success, as the public turned against prohibition and the alcohol industry was better organized to resist. Dow expended a great deal of effort organizing and giving speeches in support of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> before the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201874">British elections of 1874</a>, as their leader, <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Ewart Gladstone</a>, was sympathetic to prohibition; the Liberals lost decisively, a result Gladstone and Dow blamed on liquor interests. Dow continued to promote prohibition in Britain until May 1875 when, exhausted, he returned home.

Against calls for personal temperance instead of government restraint, Dow remained steadfast, saying that the only way to fight drunkenness was "more jail for the rascals." In 1876, he supported the election of <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, a Republican and <a href="teetotaler">teetotaler</a>. The following year, Dow saw some success for prohibition as Maine's legislature strengthened the weak prohibition law there by banning <a href="distilled%20beverage">distilling</a> in the state. Despite that minor victory, Dow began to sour on the Republican party, believing them insufficiently committed to his cause and disappointed at their failure to protect the rights of Southern blacks as <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> came to an end. Other temperance advocates felt the same way, and some had organized a new Prohibition Party in 1869. The Prohibitionists focused their efforts on banning alcohol to the exclusion of all other issues. Most party members came from <a href="Pietism">pietist</a> churches, and most, like Dow, were former Republicans. They had won very few votes in the 1872 and 1876 presidential elections, but as temperance advocates grew disenchanted with the Republican Party, they hoped to win converts in 1880.

In 1880, Maine Republicans refused to pass more anti-alcohol legislation, and Dow quit the party to join the Prohibitionists; he instantly became the party's most prominent member. His friend and ally James Black requested that Dow's name be placed in nomination for the presidency at the 1880 convention, to which Dow agreed. The convention that met in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a> that June welcomed delegates from twelve states, but attracted almost no attention from the press. Dow himself did not attend, staying home with his ailing wife (candidates for a party's nomination often did not attend conventions in person at that time). He was nominated, heading a ticket with vice-presidential nominee <a href="Henry%20Adams%20Thompson">Henry Adams Thompson</a> of Ohio.

Dow mostly ignored the national contest that summer, focusing on campaigning for pro-temperance candidates in local Maine elections. Republicans pressured Dow to withdraw, fearing that he would claim enough votes to cost their nominee, <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a>, the election. Dow declined to do so, but his vote totals were too small to harm Garfield in any case. The Prohibition ticket polled just 10,305 votes, 0.1% of the total. Garfield narrowly won the popular vote over Democrat <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>, but in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">electoral college</a>, he carried a clear majority. Dow was not displeased with the result, happy that the Republicans had triumphed over the "ex-slavedriving rebel element".

After the election, Dow began to work with Republicans again in Maine to advance prohibition issues, and in 1884 he endorsed fellow Mainer and Republican candidate for president <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a>. Blaine narrowly lost <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201884">the election</a>, the first Republican loss in 28 years, and many Republicans blamed the Prohibition Party, whose votes would have <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%20in%20New%20York%2C%201884">tipped New York</a> (and with it the electoral college majority) to Blaine. Resentful Republicans in Maine refused to advance any more prohibition laws, and as a result Dow made his final break with the Republican Party in 1885. In the <a href="Maine%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201886">1886 state election</a>, he spoke fervently against his former party and in support of the Prohibitionist candidate for governor. In 1888, at the age of 84, Dow accepted the Prohibition Party nomination for mayor of Portland, an office he had held more than thirty years earlier. The Democrats were unable to decide on a candidate, so they endorsed their former enemy, Dow, in an effort to unseat the Republican incumbent. Many regular Democrats refused to support the fusion ticket, and Dow lost the election by 1934 votes to 3504. Later that year, Dow attended the <a href="1888%20Prohibition%20Party%20National%20Convention">1888 Prohibition Party National Convention</a> in <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>. In a break from his erstwhile contempt for the former Confederacy, Dow called for sectional unity and "no more <a href="Waving%20the%20bloody%20shirt">waving of the bloody shirt</a>". He also spoke against the political expediency of the party backing <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">women's suffrage</a>, although he personally endorsed the idea.

Cornelia Dow had died in 1883, but Dow's unmarried daughter, also named Cornelia, lived with him and assisted in temperance causes. In 1891, his son Frederick and his family moved in as well. Frederick remained active in his father's former Republican Party and was the editor of the "<a href="Evening%20Express%20%28Portland%29">Portland Evening Express</a>". Despite a fall from a horse in 1890, Dow continued in good health, reading and writing about his signature issue, but travelling less. On his ninetieth birthday in 1894, a large crowd gathered to celebrate him and his life's work. In 1895, he gave his final public speech, criticizing the city government for not enforcing the prohibition laws. He began to write his memoirs, "The Reminiscences of Neal Dow: Recollections of Eighty Years", but died on October 2, 1897, before completing the book. Dow's body lay in state at the Second Parish Church in Portland before being buried in that city's <a href="Evergreen%20Cemetery%20%28Portland%2C%20Maine%29">Evergreen Cemetery</a>. He had seen the rise of the prohibition movement and, as biographer Frank L. Byrne notes, proselytized the cause "more than any man of the 19th century".

Mourning dove

The mourning dove ("Zenaida macroura") is a member of the <a href="dove">dove</a> <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, <a href="Columbidae">Columbidae</a>. The bird is also known as the American mourning dove or the rain dove, and erroneously as the turtle dove, and was once known as the Carolina pigeon or Carolina turtledove. It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American birds. It is also a leading gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70 million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six <a href="Offspring">broods</a> of two young each in a single year. The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of <a href="sonation">sonation</a>. The bird is a strong <a href="Bird%20flight">flier</a>, capable of speeds up to .It is the <a href="national%20bird">national bird</a> of the <a href="British%20Virgin%20Islands">British Virgin Islands</a>.

Mourning doves are light grey and brown and generally muted in color. Males and females are similar in appearance. The species is generally <a href="monogamous">monogamous</a>, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate and care for the young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed <a href="crop%20milk">crop milk</a> by their parents.

The mourning dove is closely related to the <a href="eared%20dove">eared dove</a> ("Zenaida auriculata") and the <a href="Socorro%20dove">Socorro dove</a> ("Zenaida graysoni"). Some authorities describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus "Zenaidura", but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus "<a href="Zenaida%20doves">Zenaida</a>". In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with the mourning dove, although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of "Zenaida", using a separate genus would interfere with the <a href="monophyly">monophyly</a> of "Zenaida" by making it <a href="Paraphyly">paraphyletic</a>.

There are five <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> of mourning dove:


The ranges of most of the subspecies overlap a little, with three in the United States or Canada. The West Indian subspecies is found throughout the <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>. It has recently invaded the <a href="Florida%20Keys">Florida Keys</a>. The eastern subspecies is found mainly in eastern North America, as well as <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> and the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>. The western subspecies is found in western North America, including parts of Mexico. The Panamanian subspecies is located in <a href="Central%20America">Central America</a>. The Clarion Island subspecies is found only on <a href="Clarion%20Island">Clarion Island</a>, just off the Pacific coast of Mexico.

The mourning dove is sometimes called the "American mourning dove" to distinguish it from the distantly related <a href="mourning%20collared%20dove">mourning collared dove</a> ("Streptopelia decipiens") of Africa. It was also formerly known as the "Carolina turtledove" and the "Carolina pigeon". The genus name was bestowed in 1838 by French zoologist <a href="Charles%20Lucien%20Bonaparte">Charles L. Bonaparte</a> in honor of his wife, <a href="Z%C3%A9na%C3%AFde%20Laetitia%20Julie%20Bonaparte">Princess Zénaide</a>, and "macroura" is from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "makros", "long" and "oura", "tail". The "mourning" part of its <a href="common%20name">common name</a> comes from its call.

The mourning dove was thought to be the <a href="passenger%20pigeon">passenger pigeon</a>'s closest living relative based on morphological grounds until genetic analysis showed "<a href="Patagioenas">Patagioenas</a>" pigeons to be more closely related. The mourning dove was even suggested to belong to the same genus, "Ectopistes", and was listed by some authors as "E. carolinensis".

The mourning dove has a large <a href="Range%20%28biology%29">range</a> of nearly . The species is resident throughout the <a href="Greater%20Antilles">Greater Antilles</a>, most of <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>, the <a href="Continental%20United%20States">Continental United States</a>, southern <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, and the Atlantic archipelago of <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. Much of the Canadian prairie sees these birds in summer only, and southern Central America sees them in winter only. The species is a <a href="Vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> in northern Canada, Alaska, and South America. It has been spotted as an accidental at least seven times in the <a href="Western%20Palaearctic">Western Palearctic</a> with records from the British Isles (5), the Azores (1) and Iceland (1). In 1963, the mourning dove was <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> to <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>, and in 1998 there was still a small population in <a href="Kona%2C%20Hawaii">North Kona</a>. The mourning dove also appeared on <a href="Socorro%20Island">Socorro Island</a>, off the western coast of Mexico, in 1988, sixteen years after the Socorro dove was <a href="Local%20extinction">extirpated</a> from that island.

The mourning dove is a medium-sized, slender dove approximately in length. Mourning doves weigh , usually closer to . The <a href="Bird%20flight">elliptical wings</a> are broad, and the head is rounded. Its tail is long and tapered ("macroura" comes from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> words for "large" and "tail"). Mourning doves have perching feet, with three toes forward and one reversed. The legs are short and reddish colored. The <a href="beak">beak</a> is short and dark, usually a brown-black hue.

The <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is generally light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, and the outer tail <a href="feather">feather</a>s are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are dark, with light skin surrounding them. The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, but with more brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent, but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.

All five subspecies of the mourning dove look similar and are not easily distinguishable. The nominate subspecies possesses shorter wings, and is darker and more buff-colored than the "average" mourning dove. "Z. m. carolinensis" has longer wings and toes, a shorter beak, and is darker in color. The western subspecies has longer wings, a longer beak, shorter toes, and is more muted and lighter in color. The Panama mourning dove has shorter wings and legs, a longer beak, and is grayer in color. The Clarion Island subspecies possesses larger feet, a larger beak, and is darker brown in color.

The mourning dove occupies a wide variety of open and semi-open habitats, such as urban areas, farms, prairie, grassland, and lightly wooded areas. It avoids <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s and thick <a href="forest">forest</a>. The species has adapted well to areas altered by humans. They commonly nest in trees in cities or near farmsteads.
Most mourning doves <a href="Bird%20migration">migrate</a> along <a href="flyway">flyway</a>s over land. On rare occasions, mourning doves have been seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this appears to be exceptional. Spring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males. Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes. However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained by the presence of <a href="bird%20feeder">bird feeder</a>s.

This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, uttered by males to attract females, and may be mistaken for the call of an <a href="owl">owl</a> at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard preceding the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call ("cooOOoo") by paired males to attract their mates to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft "ork") by males upon rejoining their mates, and an alarm call (a short "roo-oo") by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound that is hard to hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.

<a href="Courtship%23Courtship%20in%20the%20animal%20kingdom">Courtship</a> begins with a noisy flight by the male, followed by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down. After landing, the male will approach the female with a puffed-out breast, bobbing head, and loud calls. Mated pairs will often <a href="preening%20%28bird%29">preen</a> each other's feathers.

The male then leads the female to potential nest sites, and the female will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, and bring it to her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, <a href="Pinophyta%23Foliage">conifer needles</a>, or <a href="Poaceae%23Structure%20and%20growth">grass blades</a>, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s.

Most nests are in <a href="trees">trees</a>, both deciduous and coniferous. Sometimes, they can be found in <a href="shrub">shrub</a>s, <a href="vine">vine</a>s, or on artificial constructs like <a href="buildings">buildings</a>, or hanging flower pots. When there is no suitable elevated object, mourning doves will nest on the ground.

The clutch size is almost always two <a href="Egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>. Occasionally, however, a female will lay her eggs in the nest of another pair, leading to three or four eggs in the nest. The eggs are white, , long, wide, at laying (5–6% of female body mass). Both sexes incubate, the male from morning to afternoon, and the female the rest of the day and at night. Mourning doves are devoted parents; nests are very rarely left unattended by the adults. When flushed from the nest, an incubating parent may perform a nest-distraction display, or a <a href="Distraction%20display">broken-wing display</a>, fluttering on the ground as if injured, then flying away when the predator approaches it.

<a href="Avian%20incubation">Incubation</a> takes two weeks. The hatched young, called squabs, are strongly <a href="altricial">altricial</a>, being helpless at hatching and covered with <a href="Down%20feather">down</a>. Both parents feed the squabs <a href="Crop%20milk">pigeon's milk</a> (dove's milk) for the first 3–4 days of life. Thereafter, the crop milk is gradually augmented by seeds. <a href="Fledging">Fledging</a> takes place in about 11–15 days, before the squabs are fully grown but after they are capable of digesting adult food. They stay nearby to be fed by their father for up to two weeks after fledging.

Mourning doves are prolific breeders. In warmer areas, these birds may raise up to six broods in a season. This fast breeding is essential because mortality is high. Each year, mortality can reach 58% a year for adults and 69% for the young.

The mourning dove is monogamous and forms strong pair bonds. Pairs typically reconvene in the same area the following breeding season, and sometimes may remain together throughout the winter. However, lone doves will find new partners if necessary.

Mourning doves eat almost exclusively <a href="seed">seed</a>s, which make up more than 99% of their diet. Rarely, they will eat <a href="snail">snail</a>s or <a href="insect">insect</a>s. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their <a href="Crop%20%28anatomy%29">crops</a> and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine <a href="gravel">gravel</a> or <a href="sand">sand</a> to assist with <a href="digestion">digestion</a>. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping. At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for <a href="canola">canola</a> (rape seed), corn, <a href="millet">millet</a>, <a href="safflower">safflower</a>, and <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a> seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible. They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.

Mourning doves show a preference for the seeds of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include <a href="pine">pine</a> nuts, <a href="Liquidambar">sweetgum</a> seeds, and the seeds of <a href="pokeberry">pokeberry</a>, <a href="amaranth">amaranth</a>, <a href="canary%20grass">canary grass</a>, <a href="Maize">corn</a>, <a href="Sesame%20seed">sesame</a>, and <a href="wheat">wheat</a>. When their favorite foods are absent, mourning doves will eat the seeds of other plants, including <a href="buckwheat">buckwheat</a>, <a href="rye">rye</a>, <a href="goosegrass">goosegrass</a> and <a href="smartweed">smartweed</a>.

Mourning doves can be afflicted with several different <a href="parasite">parasite</a>s and <a href="Animal%20diseases">diseases</a>, including <a href="tapeworm">tapeworm</a>s, <a href="nematode">nematode</a>s, <a href="mite">mite</a>s, and <a href="Bird%20louse">lice</a>. The mouth-dwelling parasite "<a href="Trichomonas%20gallinae">Trichomonas gallinae</a>" is particularly severe. While a mourning dove will sometimes host it without symptoms, it will often cause yellowish growth in the mouth and esophagus that will eventually <a href="Starvation">starve</a> the host to death. <a href="Avian%20pox">Avian pox</a> is a common, insect-<a href="Vector%20%28epidemiology%29">vectored</a> disease.

The primary predators of this species are diurnal <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, such as <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s and <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s. During nesting, <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s, <a href="grackle">grackle</a>s, <a href="housecat">housecat</a>s, or <a href="rat%20snake">rat snake</a>s will prey on their eggs. <a href="Cowbird">Cowbird</a>s rarely <a href="Brood%20parasitism">parasitize</a> mourning dove nests. Mourning doves reject slightly under a third of cowbird eggs in such nests, and the mourning dove's vegetarian diet is unsuitable for cowbirds.

Like other columbids, the mourning dove drinks by suction, without lifting or tilting its head. It often gathers at drinking spots around dawn and dusk.

Mourning doves sunbathe or rainbathe by lying on the ground or on a flat tree limb, leaning over, stretching one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. <a href="Dust%20bath">Dustbathing</a> is common as well.
Outside the breeding season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, close to the body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers as in many other species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.

The number of individual mourning doves is estimated to be approximately 475 million. The large population and its vast range explain why the mourning dove is considered to be of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a>, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk. As a <a href="Game%20%28food%29">gamebird</a>, the mourning dove is well-managed, with more than 20 million (and up to 40–70 million) shot by hunters each year. However, more recent reporting cautions that mourning doves are in decline in the western United States, and susceptible everywhere in the country due to lead poisoning as they eat spent shot left over in hunting fields. In some cases the fields are specifically planted with a favored seed plant to lure them to those sites.

The eastern mourning dove ("Z. m. carolinensis") is <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>'s official <a href="symbol">symbol</a> of peace. The bird is also <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>'s state bird of peace.

The mourning dove appears as the Carolina turtle-dove on plate 286 of <a href="John%20James%20Audubon">Audubon</a>'s "<a href="Birds%20of%20America%20%28book%29">Birds of America</a>".

References to mourning doves appear frequently in Native American literature. Mourning dove imagery also turns up in contemporary American and Canadian poetry in the work of poets as diverse as <a href="Robert%20Bly">Robert Bly</a>, <a href="Jared%20Carter">Jared Carter</a>, <a href="Lorine%20Niedecker">Lorine Niedecker</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Wright%20%28poet%29">Charles Wright</a>.

The mourning dove is a related species to the <a href="passenger%20pigeon">passenger pigeon</a> ("Ectopistes migratorius"), which was hunted to <a href="extinction">extinction</a> in the early 1900s. For this reason, the possibility of using mourning doves for <a href="De-extinction">cloning</a> the passenger pigeon has been discussed.

Paul Kagame

Paul Kagame (; born 23 October 1957) is a Rwandan politician and former military leader. He is currently the <a href="President%20of%20Rwanda">President of Rwanda</a>, having taken office in 2000 when his predecessor, <a href="Pasteur%20Bizimungu">Pasteur Bizimungu</a>, resigned. Kagame previously commanded the rebel force that ended the 1994 <a href="Rwandan%20genocide">Rwandan genocide</a>. He was considered Rwanda's "de facto" leader when he served as <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Rwanda">Vice President</a> and <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Rwanda%29">Minister of Defence</a> from 1994 to 2000. He was re-elected in August 2017 with an official result of nearly 99% in an election criticized for numerous irregularities. He has been described as the "most impressive" and "among the most repressive" African leaders. 

Kagame was born to a <a href="Tutsi">Tutsi</a> family in southern Rwanda. When he was two years old, the <a href="Rwandan%20Revolution">Rwandan Revolution</a> ended centuries of Tutsi political dominance; his family fled to <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, where he spent the rest of his childhood. In the 1980s, Kagame fought in <a href="Yoweri%20Museveni">Yoweri Museveni</a>'s rebel army, becoming a senior Ugandan army officer after Museveni's military victories carried him to the <a href="President%20of%20Uganda">Ugandan presidency</a>. Kagame joined the <a href="Rwandan%20Patriotic%20Front">Rwandan Patriotic Front</a> (RPF), which <a href="Rwandan%20Civil%20War">invaded Rwanda</a> in 1990. RPF leader <a href="Fred%20Rwigyema">Fred Rwigyema</a> died early in the war and Kagame took control. By 1993, the RPF controlled significant territory in Rwanda and <a href="Arusha%20Accords%20%28Rwanda%29">a ceasefire</a> was negotiated. The <a href="Assassination%20of%20Juv%C3%A9nal%20Habyarimana%20and%20Cyprien%20Ntaryamira">assassination</a> of Rwandan President <a href="Juv%C3%A9nal%20Habyarimana">Juvénal Habyarimana</a> set off the genocide, in which <a href="Hutu">Hutu</a> extremists killed an estimated 500,000 to 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu. Kagame resumed the civil war, and ended the genocide with a military victory.

During his vice presidency, Kagame controlled the national army and maintained law and order, while other officials began rebuilding the country. Many RPF soldiers carried out retribution killings. Kagame said he did not support these killings but failed to stop them. A small number of these soldiers were later put on trial. Hutu refugee camps formed in <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a> and other countries. These camps were given food and medical aid by several western governments and aid agencies. The RPF attacked the camps in 1996, forcing many refugees to return home, but insurgents continued to attack Rwanda. The attack on the refugee camps killed an estimated 200,000 people. As part of the invasion, Kagame sponsored two controversial rebel wars in Zaire. The Rwandan- and Ugandan-backed rebels won the <a href="First%20Congo%20War">first war</a> (1996–97), installing <a href="Laurent-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Kabila">Laurent-Désiré Kabila</a> as <a href="List%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">president</a> in place of dictator <a href="Mobutu%20Sese%20Seko">Mobutu</a> and renaming the country as the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC). The <a href="Second%20Congo%20War">second war</a> was launched in 1998 against Kabila, and later his son <a href="Joseph%20Kabila">Joseph</a>, following the DRC government's expulsion of Rwandan and Ugandan military forces from the country. The war escalated into a conflict that lasted until a 2003 peace deal and ceasefire.

As president, Kagame has prioritized national development, launching <a href="Vision%202020%20%28Rwanda%29">a programme</a> to develop Rwanda as a <a href="middle%20income%20country">middle income country</a> by 2020 (Vision 2020). As of 2013, the country is developing strongly on key indicators, including health care and education; annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged per year. Kagame has had mostly good relations with the <a href="East%20African%20Community">East African Community</a> and the United States; his relations with France were poor until 2009. Relations with the DRC remain tense despite the 2003 ceasefire; human rights groups and a leaked United Nations report allege Rwandan support for two insurgencies in the country, a charge Kagame denies. Several countries suspended aid payments in 2012 following these allegations. Kagame is popular in Rwanda and with some foreign observers; human rights groups accuse him of political repression. He won <a href="Rwandan%20presidential%20election%2C%202003">an election</a> in 2003, under a <a href="Rwandan%20Constitution">new constitution</a> adopted that year, and was <a href="Rwandan%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">elected for a second term</a> in 2010. Kagame was <a href="Rwandan%20presidential%20election%2C%202017">elected again</a> in 2017, and due to yet another change in the constitution, he could potentially be President until 2034. His role in the assassination of exiled political opponents has been controversial.

Kagame was born on 23 October 1957, the youngest of six children, in <a href="Tambwe">Tambwe</a>, <a href="Ruanda-Urundi">Ruanda-Urundi</a>, a village located in what is now the <a href="Southern%20Province%2C%20Rwanda">Southern Province</a> of Rwanda. His father, Deogratias, was a member of the <a href="Tutsi">Tutsi</a> ethnic group, from which the royal family had been derived since the eighteenth century or earlier. Deogratias had family ties to King <a href="Mutara%20III%20of%20Rwanda">Mutara III</a>, but he pursued an independent business career rather than maintain a close connection to the royal court. Kagame's mother, Asteria Rutagambwa, descended from the family of the last Rwandan queen, <a href="Rosalie%20Gicanda">Rosalie Gicanda</a>. At the time of Kagame's birth, Rwanda was a <a href="United%20Nations%20Trust%20Territories">United Nations Trust Territory</a>; long-time colonial power <a href="Belgian%20colonial%20empire">Belgium</a> still ruled the territory, but with a mandate to oversee <a href="Decolonization%20of%20Africa">independence</a>. Rwandans were made up of three distinct groups: the minority Tutsi were the traditional ruling class, and the Belgians had long promoted their supremacy, while the majority <a href="Hutu">Hutu</a> were agriculturalists. The third group, the <a href="Twa">Twa</a>, were a forest-dwelling <a href="Pygmy%20peoples">pygmy people</a> descended from Rwanda's earliest inhabitants, who formed less than of the population.

Tension between Tutsi and Hutu had been escalating during the 1950s, and culminated in the 1959 <a href="Rwandan%20Revolution">Rwandan Revolution</a>. Hutu activists began killing Tutsi, forcing more than 100,000 to seek refuge in neighboring countries. Kagame's family abandoned their home and lived for two years in the far northeast of Rwanda and eventually crossing the border into <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>. They moved gradually north, and settled in the Nshungerezi refugee camp in the <a href="Toro%20sub-region">Toro sub-region</a> in 1962. It was around this time that, as young boys, Kagame and his future comrade, <a href="Fred%20Rwigyema">Fred Rwigyema</a>, first met one another.

Kagame began his primary education in a school near the refugee camp, where he and other Rwandan refugees learned English and began to integrate into Ugandan culture. At the age of nine he moved to the respected Rwengoro Primary School, around 16 kilometres (10 mi) away, graduating with the best grades in the district. He subsequently attended <a href="Ntare%20School">Ntare School</a>, one of the best schools in Uganda. It is also the alma mater of future Ugandan President <a href="Yoweri%20Museveni">Yoweri Museveni</a>. The death of Kagame's father in the early 1970s, and the departure of Rwigyema to an unknown location, led to a decline in his academic performance and an increased tendency to fight those who belittled the Rwandan population. He was eventually suspended from Ntare and completed his studies without distinction at Old Kampala Secondary School.

After finishing his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted by family members of his former classmates, but upon arrival in <a href="Kigali">Kigali</a> he made contact with members of his own family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest. On his second visit he entered the country through <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a> rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.

In 1978, Fred Rwigyema returned to western Uganda and reunited with Kagame. During his absence, Rwigyema had joined the rebel army of <a href="Yoweri%20Museveni">Yoweri Museveni</a>. Based in <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, it aimed to overthrow the Ugandan government of <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a>. Rwigyema returned to Tanzania and fought in <a href="Uganda%E2%80%93Tanzania%20War">the 1979 war</a> during which Museveni's army, allied with the Tanzanian army and other Ugandan exiles, defeated Amin. After Amin's defeat, inspired by Rwigyema, Kagame and other Rwandan refugees pledged allegiance to Museveni, a cabinet member in the transition government. Kagame trained under <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College">United States Army Command and General Staff College</a>, <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a> in <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>.

Former incumbent <a href="Milton%20Obote">Milton Obote</a> won the <a href="Ugandan%20general%20election%2C%201980">1980 Ugandan general election</a>. Museveni disputed the result, and he and his followers withdrew from the new government in protest. In 1981, Museveni formed the rebel <a href="National%20Resistance%20Army">National Resistance Army</a> (NRA); Kagame and Rwigyema joined as founding soldiers, along with thirty-eight Ugandans. The army's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the Ugandan Bush War.

Kagame and Rwigyema joined the NRA primarily to ease conditions for Rwandan refugees persecuted by Obote. They also had a long-term goal of returning with other Tutsi refugees to Rwanda; military experience would enable them to fight the Hutu-dominated Rwandan army. In the NRA, Kagame specialized in intelligence-gathering, and he rose to a position close to Museveni's. The NRA, based in the <a href="Luwero%20Triangle">Luwero Triangle</a>, fought the Ugandan army for the next five years, even after Obote was deposed in <a href="1985%20Ugandan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">a 1985 coup d'état</a> and the start of <a href="Nairobi%20Agreement%2C%201985">peace talks</a>.

In 1986, the NRA captured Kampala with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni's inauguration as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army; Kagame was the head of military intelligence. In addition to their army duties, Kagame and Rwigyema began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for an attack on Rwanda. In 1989 Rwanda's President <a href="Juv%C3%A9nal%20Habyarimana">Habyarimana</a> and many Ugandans in the army began to criticise Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions, and he demoted Kagame and Rwigyema.

Kagame and Rwigyema remained "de facto" senior officers, but the change caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. They joined an organisation called the <a href="Rwandan%20Patriotic%20Front">Rwandan Patriotic Front</a> (RPF), a refugee association which had been operating under various names since 1979. Rwigyema became the RPF leader shortly after joining and, while still working for the Ugandan army, he and Kagame completed their invasion plans.

In October 1990, Rwigyema led a force of over 4,000 RPF rebels into Rwanda at the <a href="Kagitumba">Kagitumba</a> border post, advancing south to the town of <a href="Gabiro">Gabiro</a>. Kagame was not present at the initial raids, as he was in the United States, attending the Command and General Staff College in Fort Leavenworth. Rwigyema was killed on the third day of the attack, throwing the RPF into confusion. France and Zaire deployed forces in support of the Rwandan army, and by the end of October, the RPF had been pushed back into the far north east corner of the country.

Kagame returned to Africa and took command of the RPF forces, which had been reduced to fewer than 2,000 troops. Kagame and his soldiers moved west, through Uganda, to the <a href="Virunga%20Mountains">Virunga Mountains</a>, a rugged high-altitude area where the terrain worked in their favor. From there he re-armed and reorganized the army, and carried out fundraising and recruitment from the Tutsi diaspora. Kagame restarted combat in January 1991, with an attack on the northern town of <a href="Ruhengeri">Ruhengeri</a>. Benefiting from the element of surprise, the RPF captured the town and held it for a day before retreating back into the forests.

For the next year, the RPF waged a classic hit-and-run <a href="guerrilla%20war">guerrilla war</a>, capturing some border areas but not making significant gains against the Rwandan army. Following the June 1992 formation of a multi-party coalition government in Kigali, Kagame announced a ceasefire and initiated negotiations with the Rwandan government in <a href="Arusha">Arusha</a>, Tanzania. In early 1993 groups of extremist Hutu formed and began campaigns of large-scale violence against the Tutsi. Kagame responded by suspending peace talks temporarily and launching a major attack, gaining a large swathe of land across the north of the country.

Peace negotiations resumed in Arusha, and the resulting set of agreements, known as the <a href="Arusha%20Accords%20%28Rwanda%29">Arusha Accords</a>, were signed in August 1993. The RPF were given positions in a broad-based transitional government (BBTG) and in the national army. The <a href="United%20Nations%20Assistance%20Mission%20for%20Rwanda">United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda</a> (<a href="UNAMIR">UNAMIR</a>), a peacekeeping force, arrived and the RPF were given a base in the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Rwanda">national parliament</a> building in Kigali to use during the establishment of the BBTG.

On 6 April 1994, Rwandan President Habyarimana's plane <a href="Assassination%20of%20Juv%C3%A9nal%20Habyarimana%20and%20Cyprien%20Ntaryamira">was shot down</a> near <a href="Kigali%20Airport">Kigali Airport</a>, killing both Habyarimana and the <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Burundi">President of Burundi</a>, <a href="Cyprien%20Ntaryamira">Cyprien Ntaryamira</a>, as well as their entourage and three French crew members. The attackers remain unknown. Historian <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Prunier">Gérard Prunier</a>, in a book written shortly after the incident, concluded that it was most likely a coup d'état carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government, and was a planned part of the genocide. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge <a href="Jean-Louis%20Brugui%C3%A8re">Jean-Louis Bruguière</a>, and in 2008 by Spanish judge <a href="Fernando%20Andreu">Fernando Andreu</a>. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible.

Following Habyarimana's death, a military committee led by Colonel <a href="Th%C3%A9oneste%20Bagosora">Théoneste Bagosora</a> took immediate control of the country. Under the committee's direction, the Hutu militia <a href="Interahamwe">Interahamwe</a> and the Presidential Guard began to kill Hutu and Tutsi opposition politicians and other prominent Tutsi figures; within 24 hours they had killed all moderate leaders, including Prime Minister <a href="Agathe%20Uwilingiyimana">Agathe Uwilingiyimana</a>. The killers then began targeting the entire Tutsi population, as well as moderate Hutu, beginning the <a href="Rwandan%20genocide">Rwandan genocide</a>. Over the course of approximately 100 days, between 500,000 and 1 million Tutsi and politically moderate Hutu were killed in well-planned attacks.

On 7 April, Kagame warned the committee and UNAMIR that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day, the Rwandan government forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions, but the RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back; Kagame began an attack from the north on three fronts, seeking to link up quickly with the troops isolated in Kigali. An interim government was set up but Kagame refused to talk to it, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule. Over the next few days, the RPF advanced steadily south, capturing Gabiro and large areas of countryside to the north and east of Kigali. They avoided attacking Kigali or <a href="Byumba">Byumba</a> at this stage, but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF-controlled areas.

Throughout April there were numerous attempts by UNAMIR to establish a ceasefire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April, the RPF secured the whole of the Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance, except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May, they had cut the road between Kigali and <a href="Gitarama">Gitarama</a>, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June, they had taken Gitarama, following an unsuccessful attempt by the Rwandan government forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to <a href="Gisenyi">Gisenyi</a> in the far north west. As well as fighting the war, Kagame was recruiting heavily to expand the army. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and refugees from <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a>, but were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.

Having completed the encirclement of Kigali, Kagame spent the latter half of June fighting to take the city. The government forces had superior manpower and weapons, but the RPF steadily gained territory, as well as conducting raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines. According to <a href="Rom%C3%A9o%20Dallaire">Roméo Dallaire</a>, the force commander of UNAMIR, this success was due to Kagame being a "master of psychological warfare"; he exploited the fact that the government forces were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali, and capitalised on the government's loss of morale as it lost territory. The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan government forces in Kigali on 4 July, and on 18 July took Gisenyi and the rest of the north west, forcing the interim government into Zaire and ending the genocide. At the end of July 1994, Kagame's forces held the whole of Rwanda except for a zone in the south west, which had been occupied by a French-led United Nations force as part of "<a href="Op%C3%A9ration%20Turquoise">Opération Turquoise</a>".

On 10 June 1989 in Uganda, Kagame married <a href="Jeannette%20Nyiramongi">Jeannette Nyiramongi</a>, a Tutsi exile living in <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a>, Kenya. Kagame had asked his relatives to suggest a suitable marriage and they recommended Nyiramongi. Kagame travelled to Nairobi and introduced himself, persuading her to visit him in Uganda. Nyiramongi was familiar with the RPF, and its goal of returning refugees to Rwanda. She held Kagame in high regard. The couple have four children. Their first child, a son they named Ivan Cyomoro Kagame, was born in 1990. Since then, a daughter, <a href="Ange%20Kagame">Ange Kagame</a>, and sons Ian and Brian have been born.

The post-genocide Rwandan government took office in Kigali in July 1994. It was based loosely on the Arusha Accords, but Habyarimana's party, MRND was outlawed. The positions it had been assigned were taken over by the RPF. The military wing of the RPF was renamed as the <a href="Rwandan%20Patriotic%20Army">Rwandan Patriotic Army</a> (RPA), and became the national army. Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Rwanda">Vice President of Rwanda</a> and <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Rwanda%29">Minister of Defence</a> while <a href="Pasteur%20Bizimungu">Pasteur Bizimungu</a>, a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF, was appointed president. Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs, but Kagame remained commander-in-chief of the army and was the "de facto" ruler of the country.

The infrastructure and economy of the country had suffered greatly during the genocide. Many buildings were uninhabitable, and the former regime had carried with them all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country. Human resources were also severely depleted, with over of the population having been killed or fled. Many of the remainder were traumatised: most had lost relatives, witnessed killings or participated in the genocide. The army, controlled by Kagame, maintained law and order while the government began the work of rebuilding the country's structures.

<a href="Non-governmental%20organization">Non-governmental organisations</a> began to move back into the country, but the <a href="international%20community">international community</a> did not provide significant assistance to the new regime, and most <a href="Aid">international aid</a> was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi-dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards, and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.

During the genocide and in the months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting the genocide. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda who had lost family or friends and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings. In an interview with journalist <a href="Stephen%20Kinzer">Stephen Kinzer</a>, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The RPF killings gained international attention with the 1995 <a href="Kibeho%20massacre">Kibeho massacre</a>, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for <a href="internally%20displaced%20persons">internally displaced persons</a> in <a href="Butare%20Province">Butare Province</a>. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed, while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338.

Shortly after taking power, the Rwandan government began prosecuting crimes committed during the genocide. The <a href="International%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20Rwanda">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a>, operating under a United Nations mandate, was set up in Arusha to judge the most senior leaders responsible for the genocide. In addition, the Rwandan government determined to prosecute all suspected perpetrators, including the many ordinary citizens who had taken part in the killings, in order to end the "culture of impunity" that it blamed for the genocide. Between 1994 and 2000, 120,000 suspects were arrested. The prisons were overcrowded and the courts could not process all the cases. By 2006 only 10,000 of those arrested had been tried. The government introduced "<a href="Gacaca%20court">Gacaca</a>", a village court system based on traditional Rwandan justice. The Gacaca process allowed for faster processing of cases, but lacked many safeguards and principles of international criminal law.

The unity government suffered a partial collapse in 1995. The continuing violence, along with appointing of local government officials who were almost exclusively RPF Tutsi, caused serious disagreement between Kagame and senior Hutu government members, including prime minister <a href="Faustin%20Twagiramungu">Faustin Twagiramungu</a> and interior minister <a href="Seth%20Sendashonga">Seth Sendashonga</a>. Twagiramungu resigned in August, and Kagame fired Sendashonga and three others the next day. Pasteur Bizimungu remained president but the makeup of the new government was predominantly RPF Tutsi loyal to Kagame. Twagiramungu and Sendashonga moved abroad to form a new opposition party shortly after leaving the government.

Following the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighboring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were set up by the <a href="United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR), but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide. This regime was determined to return to power in Rwanda and began rearming, killing Tutsi residing in Zaire, and launching cross-border incursions in conjunction with the "Interahamwe" paramilitary group. By late 1996, the Hutu militants represented a serious threat to the new Rwandan regime, and Kagame launched a counteroffensive.

Kagame first provided troops and military training to aid a rebellion against Zaire by the <a href="Banyamulenge">Banyamulenge</a>, a Tutsi group living near <a href="Bukavu">Bukavu</a> in the Zairian <a href="South%20Kivu">South Kivu</a> province. With Rwandan army support, the Banyamulenge defeated local security forces and began attacking the Hutu refugee camps in the area. At the same time, Kagame's forces joined with Zairian Tutsi around <a href="Goma">Goma</a> to attack two of the camps there. Most refugees from the attacked camps moved to the large Mugunga camp. In November 1996 the Rwandan army attacked Mugunga, causing an estimated 800,000 refugees to flee. Many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF; others ventured further west into Zaire.

Despite the disbanding of the camps, the defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign into Rwanda from <a href="North%20Kivu">North Kivu</a>. The insurgents maintained a presence in Rwanda's north western provinces and were supported by the predominantly Hutu population, many of whom had lived in the refugee camps before they were attacked. In addition to supporting the wars in the Congo, Kagame began a propaganda campaign to bring the Hutu to his side. He integrated former soldiers of the deposed genocidal regime's military into the RPF-dominated <a href="Rwandan%20Defence%20Forces">national army</a> and appointed senior Hutu to key local government positions in the areas hit by insurgency. These tactics were eventually successful; by 1999, the population in the north west had stopped supporting the insurgency and the insurgents were mostly defeated.

Although his primary reason for military action in Zaire was the dismantling of the refugee camps, Kagame also began planning a war to remove long-time dictator President <a href="Mobutu%20Sese%20Seko">Mobutu Sese Seko</a> from power. Mobutu had supported the "genocidaires" based in the camps, and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. Together with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Kagame supported the newly created <a href="Alliance%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Congo">Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo</a> (ADFL), an alliance of four rebel groups headed by <a href="Laurent-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Kabila">Laurent-Désiré Kabila</a>, which began waging the <a href="First%20Congo%20War">First Congo War</a>. The ADFL, helped by Rwandan and Ugandan troops, took control of North and South Kivu provinces in November 1996 and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. By May 1997, they controlled almost the whole of Zaire except for the capital <a href="Kinshasa">Kinshasa</a>; Mobutu fled and the ADFL took the capital without fighting. The country was renamed as the <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC) and Kabila became the new president. The <a href="Rwandan%20Defence%20Forces">Rwandan Defence Forces</a> and the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Congo">ADFL</a> were accused of carrying out mass atrocities during the First Congo War, with as many as 222,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees declared missing.

Kagame and the Rwandan government retained strong influence over Kabila following his inauguration, and the RPA maintained a heavy presence in Kinshasa. Congolese in the capital resented this, as did many in the eastern Kivu provinces, where ethnic clashes increased sharply. In July 1998, Kabila fired his Rwandan chief-of-staff, <a href="James%20Kabarebe">James Kabarebe</a>, and ordered all RPA troops to leave the country. Kagame accused Kabila of supporting the ongoing insurgency against Rwanda from North Kivu, the same accusation he had made about Mobutu. He responded to the expulsion of his soldiers by backing a new rebel group, the <a href="Rally%20for%20Congolese%20Democracy">Rally for Congolese Democracy</a> (RCD), and launching the <a href="Second%20Congo%20War">Second Congo War</a>. The first action of the war was a <a href="blitzkrieg">blitzkrieg</a> by the RCD and RPA, led by Kabarebe. These forces made quick gains, advancing in twelve days from the Kivu provinces west to within of Kinshasa. The capital was saved by the intervention of <a href="Angola">Angola</a>, Namibia and <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> on Kabila's side. Following the failure of the blitzkrieg, the conflict developed into a long-term conventional war, which lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and massive damage. According to a report by the <a href="International%20Rescue%20Committee">International Rescue Committee</a> (IRC), this conflict led to the loss of between 3 million and 7.6 million lives, many through starvation and disease accompanying the social disruption of the war.

Although Kagame's primary reason for the two wars in the Congo was Rwanda's security, he was alleged to gain economic benefit by exploiting the <a href="Mining%20industry%20of%20the%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">mineral wealth</a> of the eastern Congo. The 2001 United Nations "Report of the Panel of Experts on the Illegal Exploitation of Natural Resources and Other Forms of Wealth of the Democratic Republic of the Congo" alleged that Kagame, along with Ugandan President Museveni, were "on the verge of becoming the godfathers of the illegal exploitation of natural resources and the continuation of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo". The report also claimed that the Rwandan Ministry of Defence contained a "Congo Desk" dedicated to collecting taxes from companies licensed to mine minerals around <a href="Kisangani">Kisangani</a>, and that substantial quantities of <a href="coltan">coltan</a> and diamonds passed through Kigali before being resold on the international market by staff on the Congo Desk. International NGO <a href="Global%20Witness">Global Witness</a> also conducted field studies in early 2013. It concluded that minerals from North and South Kivu are exported illegally to Rwanda and then marketed as Rwandan. Kagame dismissed these allegations as unsubstantiated and politically motivated; in a 2002 interview with newsletter "<a href="Africa%20Confidential">Africa Confidential</a>," Kagame said that if solid evidence against Rwandan officers was presented, it would be dealt with very seriously. In 2010, the United Nations released a report accusing the Rwandan army of committing wide scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity in the Democratic Republic of the Congo during the <a href="First%20Congo%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Congo%20War">Second Congo War</a>s, charges denied by the Rwandan government.

In the late 1990s, Kagame began to disagree publicly with Bizimungu and the Hutu-led government in Rwanda. Kagame accused Bizimungu of corruption and poor management, while Bizimungu felt that he had no power over appointments to the cabinet and that the National Assembly was acting purely as a puppet for Kagame. Bizimungu resigned from the presidency in March 2000. Historians do not agree on the precise circumstances of Bizimungu's departure; American author <a href="Stephen%20Kinzer">Stephen Kinzer</a> contends that "one of the president's friends called Kagame with the startling news that the president was preparing to resign" while Prunier states that Bizimungu was forced to resign, having denounced the National Assembly and attempted to sow discord within the RPF. Following Bizimungu's resignation, the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Rwanda">Supreme Court</a> ruled that Kagame should become acting president until a permanent successor was chosen.

Kagame had been "de facto" leader since 1994, but had focused more on military, foreign affairs and the country's security than day-to-day governance. By 2000, the threat posed by cross-border rebels was much reduced and when Bizimungu resigned, Kagame decided to seek the presidency himself. The transitional constitution was still in effect, which meant the president was elected by government ministers and the national assembly rather than by a <a href="direct%20election">direct election</a>.

The RPF selected two candidates, Kagame and RPF secretary general <a href="Charles%20Murigande">Charles Murigande</a>; the ministers and parliament elected Kagame by eighty-one votes to three. Kagame was sworn in as president in April 2000. Several Hutu politicians, including the prime minister <a href="Pierre-C%C3%A9lestin%20Rwigema">Pierre-Célestin Rwigema</a>, left the government at around the same time as Bizimungu, leaving a cabinet dominated by those close to Kagame. Bizimungu started his own party following his resignation, but this was quickly banned for "destabilising the country". He was subsequently arrested and convicted of corruption and inciting ethnic violence. He was imprisoned until 2007, when he was <a href="Prerogative%20of%20mercy%20%28Rwanda%29">pardoned</a> by Kagame.

Between 1994 and 2003, Rwanda was governed by a set of documents combining President Habyarimana's 1991 constitution, the Arusha Accords, and some additional protocols introduced by the transitional government. As required by the accords, Kagame set up a constitutional commission to draft a new permanent constitution. The constitution was required to adhere to a set of fundamental principles including equitable power sharing and democracy. The commission sought to ensure that the draft constitution was "home-grown", relevant to Rwanda's specific needs, and reflected the views of the entire population; they sent questionnaires to civil groups across the country and rejected offers of help from the international community, except for financial assistance.

The draft constitution was released in 2003; it was approved by the parliament, and was then put to a referendum in May of that year. The referendum was widely promoted by the government; ultimately, of eligible adults registered to vote and the turnout on voting day was . The constitution was overwhelmingly accepted, with voting in favour. The constitution provided for a two-house parliament, an elected president serving seven-year terms, and multi-party politics. The constitution also sought to prevent Hutu or Tutsi hegemony over political power. Article 54 states that "political organizations are prohibited from basing themselves on race, ethnic group, tribe, clan, region, sex, religion or any other division which may give rise to discrimination". According to Human Rights Watch, this clause, along with later laws enacted by the parliament, effectively make Rwanda a <a href="one-party%20state">one-party state</a>, as "under the guise of preventing another genocide, the government displays a marked intolerance of the most basic forms of dissent".

Following the adoption of the new constitution in May 2003, the government set dates for the first elections to be held under the new law. The presidential poll was set for 25 August 2003. In May, the parliament voted to ban the <a href="Republican%20Democratic%20Movement">Republican Democratic Movement</a> (MDR), following a parliamentary commission report accusing the MDR of "divisive" ideology. The MDR had been one of the coalition parties in the transitional government of national unity, and was the second largest party in the country after the RPF. <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> criticised this move, claiming that "the unfounded allegations against the individuals mentioned in the report appear to be part of a government-orchestrated crackdown on the political opposition".
The RPF selected Kagame as its presidential candidate, to run for his first full term following his three-year transitional presidency. His main challenger was Faustin Twagiramungu, who had been prime minister from 1994 to 1995, when he resigned and moved to <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> after a disagreement with Kagame. Twagiramungu had intended to run as the candidate for the MDR, but instead sought the presidency as an independent following the party's banishment. Twagiramungu returned to the country in June 2003 and began campaigning in August. Two other candidates also ran: Alvera Mukabaramba, a medical doctor and former MDR member running for the newly formed <a href="Party%20for%20Progress%20and%20Concord">Party for Progress and Concord</a> (PPC), and Jean Nepomuscene Nayinzira, an independent and former member of parliament who cited belief in God as a central part of his campaign. Mukabaramba pulled out one day before the election, accusing Twagiramungu of ethnic propaganda and advising her supporters to vote for Kagame. The election went ahead on 25 August with Kagame, Twagiramungu and Nayinzira as candidates.

Kagame declared victory in the election on 26 August, after partial results showed he had an almost insurmountable lead, and his win was later confirmed by the National Electoral Commission. The final results showed that Kagame received of the vote, Twagiramungu , and Nayinzira ; the voter turnout was . The campaign, election day, and aftermath were largely peaceful, although an observer from the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> (EU) raised concerns that opposition supporters may have been intimidated by the RPF. Twagiramungu rejected the result of the election and also questioned the margin of victory, saying "Almost 100 per cent? That's not possible". Twagiramungu filed a petition at the Supreme Court to nullify the result, but was unsuccessful. The EU observer also questioned the result, citing "numerous irregularities", but praised the election overall, describing it as a "positive step". Kagame himself, in an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, acknowledged that the opposition had been weak, but he believed the result was genuine. He told Kinzer "they wanted security first of all. Even people who didn't know the RPF program in detail saw us as the party that would guarantee that". Kagame was sworn in on 12 September to begin his seven-year term.

Kagame's first term expired and new elections were held in 2010. Having served one term as elected president, Kagame was entitled to serve for one further term. The election campaign began publicly in January 2010 when <a href="Victoire%20Ingabire">Victoire Ingabire</a>, a Hutu who had been living abroad for some years, returned to Rwanda and announced her candidacy for the presidency. This failed as she was arrested and accused of threatening state security. Ingabire caused some controversy in the country following her arrival, with comments relating to the genocide. The government accused her of breaking the country's strict laws regarding <a href="genocide%20denial">genocide denial</a>, and she was arrested in April 2010. She was released on bail, but was prohibited from running in the election. In October 2012 she was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment by the High Court of Kigali, which is heavily criticized by Amnesty International.

In May, Kagame was officially endorsed as the RPF's candidate for the election at the party's national congress. Kagame then became the first candidate to be accepted when he presented his electoral papers in July. Three other candidates registered successfully for the election; they were <a href="Jean%20Damascene%20Ntawukuriryayo">Jean Damascene Ntawukuriryayo</a> of the <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Rwanda%29">Social Democratic Party</a>, <a href="Prosper%20Higiro">Prosper Higiro</a> of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28Rwanda%29">Liberal Party</a>, and Alvera Mukabaramba of the Party for Progress and Concord. Two other contenders failed to get official documents through and did not get accepted into the race. Human Rights Watch described Kagame's three opponents as "broadly supportive of the RPF", and claimed that most Rwandans would not describe them as "real" opposition, while those who criticised the RPF were barred from the election.

In the run-up to the election, there was some violence and several incidents involving prominent opposition and media figures. In February, there was a grenade attack in Kigali which killed two people. Rwandan prosecutors blamed <a href="Kayumba%20Nyamwasa">Kayumba Nyamwasa</a>, a dissident General who had become a critic of Kagame. Nywamwasa fled to <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>, South Africa, and in June he survived a shooting in the city. Nyamwasa alleged that it was an assassination attempt, a charge Rwanda denied. Days later, journalist <a href="Jean-L%C3%A9onard%20Rugambage">Jean-Léonard Rugambage</a>, who claimed to have uncovered the regime's responsibility in the attempted murder, was shot dead. In July, the vice president of the <a href="Democratic%20Green%20Party%20of%20Rwanda">Democratic Green Party</a>, <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Kagwa%20Rwisereka">André Kagwa Rwisereka</a>, was beheaded in Butare. There is no concrete evidence linking Kagame with the attacks, but it was sufficient for the United Nations to demand an investigation.

Kagame was declared the winner of the election, according to results released by the National Electoral Commission on . Kagame received of the vote, with second placed Ntawukuriryayo polling . The turnout was of registered voters. Opposition and human rights groups later said that the election was tainted by repression, murder, and lack of credible competition. Kagame responded by saying "I see no problems, but there are some people who choose to see problems where there are not." The election was largely peaceful, although there was a further grenade attack in Kigali hours after the election commission announced Kagame's victory, injuring about 20 people. Media reports indicated the attack may have been politically motivated and connected to earlier attacks in the same area.

As Kagame's second term progressed, he began to hint that he might seek to rewrite the term-limit clause of the Rwandan constitution, to allow him to run for a third term in the 2017 elections. Earlier in his presidency he had ruled it out, but in a 2014 speech at <a href="Tufts%20University">Tufts University</a> in the United States, Kagame said that he did not know when he would leave office, and that it was up to the Rwandan people to decide. He told delegates "...let's wait and see what happens as we go. Whatever will happen, we'll have an explanation." The following year a protest occurred outside <a href="Parliament%20of%20Rwanda">parliament</a>, and a petition signed by 3.7 million people—more than half of the electorate—was presented to lawmakers asking for Kagame to be allowed to stay in office. The parliament responded by passing an amendment to the constitution in November 2015, with both the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Rwanda">Chamber of Deputies</a> and the <a href="Senate%20of%20Rwanda">Senate</a> voting unanimously in favour. The motion passed kept the two-term limit in place, and also reduced the length of terms from 7 years to 5 years, but it made an explicit exception for Kagame, who would be permitted to run for a third 7-year term followed by two further 5-year terms, if he so desired. After the amendment was passed in parliament, a referendum was required for it to come into effect.

The referendum took place in 18 December 2015, with Rwandans overseas voting on 17 December. The amendment was approved by the electorate, with 6.16 million voters saying yes, approximately 98% of the votes. The electoral commission stated that the vote had been peaceful and orderly. The <a href="Democratic%20Green%20Party%20of%20Rwanda">Democratic Green Party</a>, the most prominent domestic group opposing the change, protested that it had not been permitted to campaign openly against the amendment. <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> executive director <a href="Ken%20Roth">Ken Roth</a> announced on <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> that he did not believe the election to be free and fair, saying there was "no suspense in Rwanda referendum when so many dissidents silenced, civil society stifled." The amendment itself was criticised by the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> and also the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, which released a statement saying that Kagame should respect the previous term limits and "foster a new generation of leaders in Rwanda". Kagame responded that it was not his own decision to seek a third term, but that the parliament and the people had demanded it.

In accordance with the constitutional change, a presidential election was held on 4 August 2017, in which Kagame was re-elected to a third term with 98.79% of the vote. Kagame was sworn in for another seven-year term on 18 August.

In the late 1990s, Kagame began actively planning methods to achieve national development. He launched a national consultation process and also sought the advice of experts from emerging nations including China, Singapore and <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. Following these consultations, and shortly after assuming the presidency, Kagame launched an ambitious programme of national development called <a href="Vision%202020%20%28Rwanda%29">Vision 2020</a>. The major purposes of the programme were to unite the Rwandan people and to transform Rwanda from a highly impoverished into a <a href="middle%20income%20country">middle income country</a>. The programme consists of a list of goals which the government aims to achieve before the year 2020. These include reconstruction, infrastructure and transport improvements, good governance, improving agriculture production, private sector development, and health and education improvements.

In 2011, the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Finance%20and%20Economic%20Planning%20%28Rwanda%29">Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning</a> issued a report indicating the progress of the Vision 2020 goals. The report examined the stated goals of the programme and rated each one with a status of "on-track", "on-watch" or "off-track". Of 44 goals, it found that were on-track, were on-watch, and were off-track. The major areas identified as off-track were population, poverty and the environment. An independent review of Vision 2020, carried out in 2012 by academics based in Belgium, rated progress as "quite encouraging", mentioning development in the education and health sectors, as well as Kagame's fostering of a favourable business environment. The review also raised concerns about the policy of "maximum growth at any cost", suggesting that this was leading to a situation in which the rich prospered while the rural poor saw little benefit.

In November 2013, Kagame told <a href="This%20Is%20Africa">This Is Africa</a> "Our thinking is based on people. In national budgets, we focus on education, health, we look at technology, skills, innovation, creativity. We are always thinking about people, people, people."

Rwanda's economy has grown rapidly under Kagame's presidency, with per-capita gross domestic product (<a href="purchasing%20power%20parity">purchasing power parity</a>) estimated at <a href="Geary-Khamis%20dollar">$</a>1,592 in 2013, compared with $567 in 2000. Annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged per year. Kagame's economic policy is based on <a href="Economic%20liberalism">liberalising</a> the economy, <a href="Privatisation">privatising</a> state owned industries, reducing <a href="red%20tape">red tape</a> for businesses, and transforming the country from an agricultural to a <a href="knowledge-based%20economy">knowledge-based economy</a>. Kagame has stated that he believes Rwanda can emulate the <a href="Economy%20of%20Singapore">economic development of Singapore</a> since 1960, and achieving middle income country status is one of the central goals of the Vision 2020 programme. Kagame's economic policy has been praised by many foreign donors and investors, including <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> and <a href="Starbucks">Starbucks</a> chairman <a href="Howard%20Schultz">Howard Schultz</a>. The DRC government and human rights groups have accused Rwanda of illegally exploiting Congolese minerals, which the London "<a href="Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>" describes as an "important part" in the success of Rwanda's economy.

Rwanda is a country of few natural resources, and the economy is heavily dependent on <a href="subsistence%20agriculture">subsistence agriculture</a>, with an estimated of the working population engaged in farming. Under Kagame's presidency, the <a href="service%20sector">service sector</a> has grown strongly. In 2010, it became the country's largest sector by economic output, contributing of the country's GDP. Key tertiary contributors include banking and finance, wholesale and retail trade, hotels and restaurants, transport, storage, communication, insurance, real estate, business services, and public administration, including education and health. <a href="Information%20and%20communications%20technology">Information and communications technology</a> (ICT) is a Vision 2020 priority, with a goal of transforming Rwanda into an ICT hub for Africa. To this end, the government has completed a <a href="fibre%20optic">fibre-optic</a> telecommunications network, intended to provide broadband services and facilitate electronic commerce. <a href="Tourism%20in%20Rwanda">Tourism</a> is one of the fastest-growing economic resources and became the country's leading <a href="Foreign-exchange%20reserves">foreign exchange</a> earner in 2011. In spite of the genocide's legacy, Kagame's achievement of peace and security means the country is increasingly perceived internationally as a safe destination; in the first half of 2011, of foreign visitors arrived from outside Africa. The country's <a href="mountain%20gorilla">mountain gorilla</a>s attract thousands of visitors per year, who are prepared to pay high prices for permits.

Rwanda ranks highly in several categories of the World Bank's <a href="ease%20of%20doing%20business%20index">ease of doing business index</a>. In 2005, after the country was ranked 158th on the Ease of Doing Business Index, Kagame set up a special unit to analyze the economy and provide solutions to easing business. As a result, the country topped the list of reformers in 2009. In 2012, the country's overall ease of doing business index ranking was 52nd out of 185 countries worldwide, and third out of 46 in <a href="Sub-Saharan%20Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>. It was eighth on the 2012 rankings for ease of starting a business; the <a href="Rwanda%20Development%20Board">Rwanda Development Board</a> asserts that a business can be authorised and registered in 24 hours. The business environment and economy also benefit from relatively low corruption in the country; in 2010, <a href="Transparency%20International">Transparency International</a> ranked Rwanda as the eighth cleanest out of 47 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and sixty-sixth cleanest out of 178 in the world.

Kagame has made education for <a href="youth%20in%20Rwanda">youth in Rwanda</a> a high priority for his administration, allocating of the annual budget to the sector. The Rwandan government provides free education in state-run schools for twelve years: six years in primary and six in secondary school. The final three years of free education were introduced in 2012 following a pledge by Kagame during his 2010 re-election campaign. Kagame credits his government with improvements in the tertiary education sector; the number of universities has risen from 1 in 1994 to 29 in 2010, and the tertiary <a href="gross%20enrollment%20ratio">gross enrollment ratio</a> increased from in 2008 to in 2011. From 1994 until 2009, secondary education was offered in either French or English; since 2009, due to the country's increasing ties with the <a href="East%20African%20Community">East African Community</a> and the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth of Nations</a>, English has been the sole language of instruction in public schools from primary school grade 4 onward. The country's <a href="literacy">literacy</a> rate, defined as those aged 15 or over who can read and write, was in 2009, up from in 1978 and in 1991.

Rwanda's health profile is dominated by communicable diseases, including <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, and <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>. Prevalence and mortality rates have sharply declined in the past decade but the short supply or unavailability of certain medicines continues to challenge disease management. Kagame's government is seeking to improve this situation as one of the Vision 2020 priorities. It has increased funding, with the health budget up from of national expenditure in 1996 to in 2008. It also set up training institutes, including the <a href="Kigali%20Health%20Institute">Kigali Health Institute</a> (KHI), and in 2008 effected laws making health insurance mandatory for all individuals; by 2010, over of the population was covered. These policies have contributed to a steady increase in quality of healthcare and improvement in key indicators during Kagame's presidency. In 2010, 91 children died before their fifth birthday for every 1000 live births, down from 163 under five deaths for every 1000 live births in 1990. Prevalence of some diseases is declining, including the elimination of maternal and neonatal <a href="tetanus">tetanus</a> and a sharp reduction in malaria <a href="morbidity">morbidity</a>, <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a>, and specific <a href="lethality">lethality</a>. In response to shortages in qualified medical personnel, in 2011 the Rwandan government launched an eight-year US$151.8 million initiative to train medical professionals.

The Second Congo War, which began in 1998, was still raging when Kagame assumed the presidency in 2000. <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a>, Angola, Zimbabwe, and <a href="Chad">Chad</a> had committed troops to the Congolese government side, while Rwanda, Uganda, and Burundi were supporting rebel groups. The rebel group Rally for Congolese Democracy (RCD) had split in 1999 into two factions: the <a href="Rally%20for%20Congolese%20Democracy%E2%80%93Goma">RCD-Goma</a>, supported by Rwanda, and the <a href="RCD-Kisangani">RCD-Kisangani</a>, which was allied to Uganda. Uganda also supported the <a href="Movement%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20the%20Congo">Movement for the Liberation of the Congo</a> (MLC), a rebel group from the north. All these rebel groups were at war with Kabila's government in Kinshasa, but were also increasingly hostile to each other. Various peace meetings had been held, culminating in the July 1999 <a href="Lusaka%20Ceasefire%20Agreement">Lusaka Ceasefire Agreement</a> which was signed by Kabila, Kagame and all the other foreign governments. The rebel groups were not party to the agreement, and fighting continued. The RPA continued to be heavily involved in the Congo War during 2000, fighting battles against the Ugandan army in Kisangani and against Kabila's army in <a href="Kasai%20region">Kasai</a> and <a href="Katanga%20Province">Katanga</a>.

In January 2001, Kabila was shot dead inside his palace. The Congolese government claimed Kabila had been killed by a rogue bodyguard, who was himself killed at the scene. According to a report published in French newspaper "<a href="Le%20Monde">Le Monde</a>", Kabila was killed by the "kadogo", an army of <a href="Military%20use%20of%20children">child soldiers</a> he was known to have assembled during the First Congo War. The "kadogo" had suffered badly during the battles in Kasai and Katanga, were poorly paid, and had become alienated by Kabila. Kabila's son <a href="Joseph%20Kabila">Joseph</a> was appointed president and immediately began asserting his authority by dismissing his father's cabinet and senior army commanders, assembling a new government, and engaging with the international community. The new government provided impetus for renewed peace negotiations, and in July 2002 a peace agreement was reached between Rwanda, Congo, and the other major participants, in which all foreign troops would withdraw and RCD-Goma would enter a power-sharing transitional government with Joseph Kabila as interim president until elections could be held. By the end of 2002, all uniformed Rwandan troops had left Congolese territory.

Despite the agreement and subsequent ceasefire, relations between Kagame and the Congolese government have remained tense. A 2003 United Nations report alleged that Rwanda was using demobilised soldiers to continue its illegal exploitation of Congolese minerals. Meanwhile, Kagame blamed Kabila for failing to suppress Hutu rebels in North and South Kivu provinces. Two major insurgencies have occurred in the eastern provinces: the first, from 2005 to 2009, was led by Congolese Tutsi <a href="Laurent%20Nkunda">Laurent Nkunda</a>, while <a href="M23%20rebellion">the second</a>, carried out by the <a href="March%2023%20Movement">March 23 Movement</a> (M23) under leader <a href="Bosco%20Ntaganda">Bosco Ntaganda</a>, began in 2012; Ntaganda gave himself up to the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Court">International Criminal Court</a> in early 2013, and peace talks have taken place, but as of May 2013 the conflict is at risk of resuming. Human Rights Watch alleges that both insurgencies were supported by Rwanda, a charge Kagame denies. A leaked United Nations report in 2012 also alleges Rwandan support for M23; this report cites Kagame's defence minister James Kabarebe as being effectively the commander of the movement.

Kagame spent most of his childhood and young adult years living in Uganda, and has a personal relationship with President Yoweri Museveni dating back to the late 1970s; they fought together in the Ugandan Bush War, and Kagame was appointed head of military intelligence in Museveni's national army following the NRA victory in 1986. When the RPF soldiers abandoned the Ugandan army and invaded Rwanda in 1990, Museveni did not explicitly support them, but according to Prunier it is likely that he had prior knowledge of the plan. Museveni also allowed the RPF safe passage through Ugandan territory to the Virunga mountains after their early defeats in the war, and revealed in a 1998 heads of state meeting that Uganda had helped the RPF materially during the <a href="Rwandan%20Civil%20War">Rwandan Civil War</a>. Following the RPF victory, the two countries enjoyed a close political and trade relationship.

Rwanda and Uganda were allies during the First Congo War against Zaire, with both countries being instrumental in the setting up of the AFDL and committing troops to the war. The two nations joined forces again at the beginning of the Second Congo War, but relations soured in late 1998 as Museveni and Kagame had very different priorities in fighting the war. In early 1999, the RCD rebel group split into two, with Rwanda and Uganda supporting opposing factions, and in August the Rwandan and Ugandan armies battled each other with heavy artillery in the Congolese city of Kisangani. The two sides <a href="Six%20Day%20War%20%28Kisangani%29">fought again in Kisangani</a> in May and June 2000, causing the deaths of 120 soldiers and around 640 Congolese civilians. Relations slowly thawed in the 2000s, and by 2011 the two countries enjoyed a close friendship once more.

In 2007, Rwanda joined the East African Community, an intergovernmental organisation for the East Africa region comprising Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Burundi, and Rwanda. The country's accession required the signing of various agreements with the other members, including a defence intelligence sharing pact, a <a href="customs%20union">customs union</a>, and measures to combat drug trafficking. The countries of the Community established a <a href="common%20market">common market</a> in 2011, and plan further integration, including moves toward political federation and a possible single currency.

France maintained close ties with President Habyarimana during his years in power, as part of its "<a href="Fran%C3%A7afrique">Françafrique</a>" policy. When the RPF launched the Rwandan Civil War in 1990, Habyarimana was immediately granted assistance from the President of France, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a>. France sent 600 paratroopers, who effectively ran the government's response to the invasion and were instrumental in regaining almost all territory the RPF had gained in the first days of the war. France maintained this military presence throughout the war, engaging Kagame's RPF forces again in February 1993 during the offensive that doubled RPF territory. In the later stages of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, France launched "Opération Turquoise", a United Nations mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for protection of <a href="displaced%20person">displaced person</a>s, <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s, and civilians in danger; many Rwandans interpreted it as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF, and their presence temporarily stalled Kagame's advance in south western Rwanda.

France continued to shun the new RPF government following the end of the genocide and the withdrawal of "Opération Turquoise". Diplomatic relations were finally reestablished in January 1995, but remained tense as Rwanda accused France of aiding the "genocidaires", while France defended its interventions. In 2006, French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière released a report on the assassination of President Habyarimana which concluded that Kagame had ordered the shooting of the plane. Bruguière subsequently issued arrest warrants for nine of Kagame's close aides. Kagame denied the charges and immediately broke off diplomatic relations with France. Relations began to thaw in 2008, and diplomacy was resumed in late 2009. In 2010, <a href="Nicolas%20Sarkozy">Nicolas Sarkozy</a> became the first French president to visit Rwanda since the genocide, admitting for the first time that France made "grave errors of judgment". Kagame reciprocated with an official visit to Paris in 2011.

While speaking on the <a href="French%20presidential%20election%2C%202017">2017 presidential elections in France</a>, Kagame said in an interview to ‘’<a href="Jeune%20Afrique">Jeune Afrique</a>’’ that the possible election of candidate <a href="Alain%20Jupp%C3%A9">Alain Juppé</a> , then French Foreign Affairs minister during the genocide and failed to win the election, would likely end all possible relations between France and Rwanda. 

Since the end of the Rwandan genocide in 1994, Rwanda has enjoyed a close relationship with the English speaking world, in particular the United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK). The two countries have been highly supportive of the RPF programme of stabilisation and rebuilding, with the UK donating large sums each year in <a href="budget%20support">budget support</a>, and the US providing military aid as well as supporting development projects. As president, Kagame has been critical of the West's lack of response to the genocide, and the UK and US have responded by admitting guilt over the issue: Bill Clinton, who was President of the United States during the genocide, has described his failure to act against the killings as a "personal failure". During the 2000s, Clinton and UK prime minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> praised the country's progress under Kagame, citing it as a model recipient for international development funds, and Clinton referred to Kagame as "one of the greatest leaders of our time". Both Clinton and Blair have maintained support for the country beyond the end of their terms of office, Clinton via the <a href="Clinton%20Global%20Initiative">Clinton Global Initiative</a> and Blair through his role as an unpaid advisor to the Rwandan government.

As part of his policy of maintaining close relations with English speaking countries, Kagame sought membership of the Commonwealth of Nations, which was granted in 2009. Rwanda was only the second country, after <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, to join the Commonwealth having never had colonial links to the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>. Kagame attended the subsequent <a href="Commonwealth%20Heads%20of%20Government%20Meeting">Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting</a> in Perth, Australia, addressing the Business Forum. Rwanda also successfully applied for a rotating seat on the <a href="United%20Nations%20Security%20Council">United Nations Security Council</a> in 2012, taking over the presidency of that organisation in April 2013.

Kagame's relations with the US and UK have come under strain in the early 2010s, following allegations that Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebel movement in Eastern Congo. The UK suspended its budgetary aid programme in 2012, freezing a <a href="Pound%20Sterling">£</a>21 million donation. The US has also frozen some of its military aid programme for Rwanda, although it stopped short of suspending aid altogether.

China has been investing in Rwandan infrastructure since 1971, with early projects including hospitals in <a href="Kibungo">Kibungo</a> and <a href="Masaka%20%28Rwanda%29">Masaka</a>. Under Kagame's presidency, trade between the two countries has grown rapidly. The volume of trade increased five-fold between 2005 and 2009, and it doubled again in the following three years, being worth US$160 million in 2012. Projects completed include the renovation of the Kigali road network, funded using a Chinese government loan and undertaken by <a href="Road%20and%20Bridge%20Construction">China Road and Bridge Corporation</a>; the <a href="Kigali%20City%20Tower">Kigali City Tower</a>, which was built by <a href="China%20Civil%20Engineering%20Construction">China Civil Engineering Construction</a>; and a pay television service operated by <a href="Star%20Media">Star Media</a>.

Kagame has been vocal in his praise of China and its model for relations with Africa, saying in a 2009 interview that "the Chinese bring what Africa needs: investment and money for governments and companies." This is in contrast to Western countries, whom Kagame accuses of focussing too heavily on giving aid to the continent rather than building a trading relationship; he also believes that they keep African products out of the world marketplace by the use of high <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s. China does not involve itself in the domestic affairs of the countries with which it trades, hence has not followed the West in criticising Kagame's alleged involvement in the war in the Congo.

Kagame's ultimate goal in international relations is to shift Rwanda from a country dependent on donor aid and loans towards self-sufficiency, trading with other countries on an equal footing. In a 2009 article, Kagame wrote that "the primary purpose of aid should ultimately be to work itself out", and should therefore focus on self-sufficiency and building private sector development. Kagame cited an example of donor countries providing free fertilisers to farmers; he believes this to be wrong because it undercuts local fertiliser businesses, preventing them from growing and becoming competitive. In 2012, Kagame launched the <a href="Agaciro%20Development%20Fund">Agaciro Development Fund</a>, following proposals made at a national dialogue session in 2011. Agaciro is a solidarity fund whose goal is to provide development finance sourced within Rwanda, supplementing aid already received from overseas. The fund invites contributions from Rwandan citizens, within the country and in the diaspora, as well as private companies and "friends of Rwanda". The fund will allocate its funds based on consultations with the populace, as well as financing projects contributing to the Vision 2020 programme.

Former Rwandan officials have alleged that President Kagame has ordered the murder and disappearance of political opponents. In a 2014 report titled "Repression Across Borders," Human Rights Watch documented at least 10 cases involving attacks or threats against critics outside Rwanda since the late 1990s. The organization asserts the victims were likely targeted due to criticisms of the Rwandan government, the RPF or President Paul Kagame. After the murder of former intelligence chief <a href="Patrick%20Karegeya">Patrick Karegeya</a> in South Africa on 31 December 2013, President Kagame made remarks condoning his killing: "Whoever betrays the country will pay the price. I assure you." In 2015, a former Rwandan military officer testified before the U.S. Congress that the Rwandan government had offered him $1 million to assassinate Karegeya as well as Kagame critic General Kayumba Nyamwasa. After his testimony, this officer himself faced threats in Belgium as did a Canadian journalist. In December 2017, a South African court found that the Rwandan government continued to plot the assassination of its critics overseas.

Kagame served as <a href="Chairperson%20of%20the%20African%20Union">Chairperson of the African Union</a> from January 28, 2018 to February 10, 2019. As Chair, Kagame promoted the <a href="Single%20African%20Air%20Transport%20Market">Single African Air Transport Market</a> (SAATM) and the African <a href="Continental%20Free%20Trade%20Area">Continental Free Trade Area</a>. The proposed Continental Free Trade Area was signed on March 21, 2018 by 44 of the 55 AU nations. By the time he left office in February 2019, the Continental Free Trade had already been ratified by 19 of the 22 nations needed for it to officially go into effect.

Most observers describe Kagame's personality as one of seriousness and intelligence. Richard Grant, writing in London's "<a href="Daily%20Telegraph">Daily Telegraph</a>", described Kagame as radiating "a quality of intense seriousness that is both impressive and intimidating". <a href="Rom%C3%A9o%20Dallaire">Roméo Dallaire</a>, commander of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda during the Rwandan genocide, described Kagame as having a "studious air that didn't quite disguise his hawk-like intensity". Kagame has a highly dominant personality, which he uses to enforce his rule and to ensure that his vision for the country is followed. American journalist <a href="Stephen%20Kinzer">Stephen Kinzer</a>, who wrote the biography "A Thousand Hills" in collaboration with Kagame himself, describes him as "one of the most intriguing leaders in Africa". Kinzer credits Kagame with leadership skills that have fostered Rwanda's rebirth following the genocide, but also cites a personality of "chronic impatience, barely suppressed anger, and impulsive scorn for critics". In his interview with Grant, Kagame claimed he sleeps for only four hours per night, devoting the remainder of his day to work, exercise, family, and reading academic texts and foreign newspapers.

In Rwanda, Kagame's RPF is seen as a Tutsi-dominated party, and in the years following the 1994 genocide, it was deeply unpopular with the Hutu, who constitute of the population. Approximately two million Hutu lived as refugees in neighbouring countries until 1996, when Kagame forced them to return home. Many Hutu also supported the late 1990s cross-border insurgency against Kagame by defeated forces of the former regime. By 1999, when the RPF had weakened the insurgents and the north west became peaceful, the Hutu population became broadly supportive of Kagame. Since becoming president in 2000, Kagame has won three disputed presidential elections with over of the vote each time. Despite criticisms over opposition repression during these elections, and accusations that the figures were inflated, Kagame does receive genuine support from the population, who credit him with ensuring continued peace, stability, and economic growth.

Kagame's image amongst international observers is varied. Human rights organisations, including <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a> and <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a>, claim that Kagame hamstrings his opposition by restricting candidacies in elections to government-friendly parties, suppressing demonstrations, and arresting opposition leaders and journalists. <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> and <a href="Freedom%20House">Freedom House</a> have accused Kagame of using strict laws criminalizing "divisionism" (ethnic hatred) and genocide ideology to silence his critics, to the point that Rwanda is a "de facto" one-party state. It has praised some aspects of Kagame's rule, such as the progress made in the delivery of justice and the abolition of the death penalty. Other progressive initiatives include supporting a UN declaration on <a href="LGBT">LGBT</a> rights, as well as the world's highest representation of women in parliament. Kagame's image amongst foreign leaders was very positive until the late 2000s. He was credited with ending the genocide, bringing peace and security to Rwanda, and achieving development. Since 2010, the international community has increasingly criticized Kagame following a leaked United Nations report alleging Rwanda's support for the rebel M23 movement in Congo. In 2012, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and several other countries suspended programmes of budget support to Rwanda, with many redirecting their aid to project-based assistance.

Kagame promotes the Internet as a means of communication between leadership and ordinary people. In addition to his personal website, which contains a personal blog, he has accounts on <a href="Flickr">Flickr</a>, <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>, <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> and <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a>. In 2011, he argued with British journalist Ian Birrell on Twitter following a tweet by Birrell about media freedom in Rwanda.

Kagame has received <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20honours%20bestowed%20upon%20Paul%20Kagame">many honours and accolades</a> during his presidency. These include honorary degrees from the American <a href="University%20of%20the%20Pacific%20%28United%20States%29">University of the Pacific</a>, <a href="Oklahoma%20Christian%20University">Oklahoma Christian University</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Glasgow">University of Glasgow</a>, the <a href="Andrew%20Young">Andrew Young</a> Medal for Capitalism and Social Progress by <a href="Georgia%20State%20University">Georgia State University</a>, and a <a href="Clinton%20Global%20Citizen%20Award">Clinton Global Citizen Award</a>. Kagame has also received the highest awards bestowed by the countries of <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a> and <a href="Benin">Benin</a>, the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Pioneers%20of%20Liberia">Distinction of the Grand Cordon in the Most Venerable Order of the Knighthood of Pioneers</a>, and the <a href="National%20Order%20of%20Benin">Grand Cross of the National Order of Merit</a> respectively. In September 2010, the British political magazine "<a href="New%20Statesman">New Statesman</a>" named Kagame one of its 50 most influential figures for that year, placing him in 49th place. The <a href="Council%20for%20East%20and%20Central%20Africa%20Football%20Associations">Council for East and Central Africa Football Associations</a> football tournament has been named the <a href="Kagame%20Interclub%20Cup">Kagame Interclub Cup</a> since 2002, due to Kagame's sponsorship of the event.

David Lewis (politician)

David Lewis (born David Losz; June 23, or October 1909 – May 23, 1981) was a Canadian labour lawyer and <a href="social%20democracy">social democratic</a> politician. He was national secretary of the <a href="Co-operative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Co-operative Commonwealth Federation</a> (CCF) from 1936 to 1950, and one of the key architects of the <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Canada%29">New Democratic Party</a> (NDP) in 1961. In 1962, he was elected as the <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> (MP), in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons of Canada</a>, for the <a href="York%20South">York South</a> electoral district. While an MP, he was elected the NDP's national leader, and served from 1971 until 1975. After his defeat in the 1974 federal election, he stepped down as leader and retired from politics. He spent his last years as a university professor at <a href="Carleton%20University">Carleton University</a>, and as a travel correspondent for the "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>". In retirement, he was named to the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a> for his political service. After suffering from <a href="cancer">cancer</a> for a long time, he died in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> in 1981.

Lewis' politics were heavily influenced by the <a href="General%20Jewish%20Labour%20Bund%20in%20Lithuania%2C%20Poland%20and%20Russia">Jewish Labour Bund</a>, which contributed to his support of <a href="parliamentary%20democracy">parliamentary democracy</a>. He was an avowed <a href="anti-communist">anti-communist</a>, and while a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholar</a> prevented communist domination of the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Labour%20Club">Oxford University Labour Club</a>. In Canada, he played a major role in removing communist influence from the <a href="labour%20movement">labour movement</a>.

In the CCF, he took the role of disciplinarian and dealt with internal organizational problems. He helped draft the <a href="Winnipeg%20Declaration">Winnipeg Declaration</a>, which moderated the CCF's economic policies to include acceptance of capitalism, albeit subject to stringent government regulation. As the <a href="United%20Steelworkers%20of%20America">United Steelworkers of America</a> (USW)'s legal counsel in Canada, he helped them take over the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Mine%2C%20Mill%2C%20and%20Smelter%20Workers">International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers</a> (Mine-Mill). His involvement with the USW also led to a central role in the creation of the <a href="Canadian%20Labour%20Congress">Canadian Labour Congress</a> in 1956.

The Lewis family has been active in socialist politics since the turn of the twentieth century, starting with David Lewis' father's involvement in the Bund in Russia, continuing with David, and followed by his eldest son, <a href="Stephen%20Lewis">Stephen Lewis</a>, who led the Ontario NDP from 1970 until 1978. When David was elected the NDP's national leader in 1971, he and Stephen became one of the first father-and-son-teams to simultaneously head Canadian political parties.

David Losz was born in Russia sometime after <a href="Svisloch">Svisloch</a>'s first snowfall in October 1909 to <a href="Moshe%20Lewis">Moishe Losz</a> and his wife Rose (née Lazarovitch). His official birth date of June 23 was the one he gave the immigration officer when he arrived in Canada. Lewis's political activism began in the "<a href="shtetl">shtetl</a>" he lived in from 1909 until 1921. Svisloch was located in the <a href="Pale%20of%20Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a>, the western-most region of the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a>, in what is now <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>. After World War I it became a Polish border town, occasionally occupied by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> during the <a href="Polish-Soviet%20War">Polish-Soviet War</a> of the early 1920s. Jewish people were in the majority, numbering 3,500 out of Svisloch's 4,500 residents. Unlike many of the other shtetls in the Pale, it had an industrial economy based on <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanning</a>. Its semi-urban industrial population was receptive to <a href="social%20democratic">social democratic</a> politics and the <a href="labour%20movement">labour movement</a>, as embodied by the <a href="Jewish%20Labour%20Bund">Jewish Labour Bund</a>.
Moishe (or Moshe) Losz was Svisloch's Bund Chairman. The Bund was an outlawed socialist party that called for overthrowing the <a href="Tsar">Tsar</a>, equality for all, and national rights for the Jewish community; it functioned as both political party and labour movement. Lewis spent his formative years immersed in its culture and philosophy. The Bund's membership, although mostly ethnically Jewish, was <a href="secular%20humanist">secular humanist</a> in practice.

Moishe and David were influenced by the Bund's political pragmatism, embodied in its maxim that "It is better to go along with the masses in a not totally correct direction than to separate oneself from them and remain a purist." David would bring this philosophy to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and New Democratic Party (NDP); in clashes between the parties' "ideological missionaries and the power pragmatists when internal debates raged about policy or action", he was in the latter camp.

When the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">Russian Civil War</a> and the <a href="Polish-Soviet%20War%20in%201920">Polish-Soviet War</a> were at their fiercest, in the summer of 1920, Poland invaded, and the Red Russian <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> army counter-attacked. The Bolsheviks reached the Svisloch border in July 1920. Moishe Losz openly opposed the Bolsheviks and would later be jailed by them for his opposition. When the Polish army recaptured Svisloch on August 25, 1920, they executed five Jewish citizens as "spies". Unsafe under either regime and with his family's future prospects bleak, Moishe left for Canada in May 1921, to work in his brother-in-law's <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> clothing factory. By August, he saved enough money to send for his family, including David and his siblings, Charlie and Doris.

David Lewis was a secular Jew, as was Moishe. However, his maternal grandfather, Usher Lazarovitch, was religious and, in the brief period between May and August 1921 before David emigrated, gave his grandson the only real religious training he would ever receive. David did not actively take part in a religious service again until his granddaughter Ilana's <a href="Bat%20Mitzvah">Bat Mitzvah</a> in the late 1970s. In practice, the Lewis family, including David, his wife Sophie, and their children Janet, Nina, Stephen, and Michael, were atheists.

The family came to Canada by boat and landed in <a href="City%20of%20Halifax">Halifax</a>, <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a> in Autumn 1921. They then went by rail to Montreal to meet Moishe Lewis. David Lewis was a native Yiddish speaker and understood very little English. He learned it by buying a copy of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' novel "<a href="The%20Old%20Curiosity%20Shop">The Old Curiosity Shop</a>" and a <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>-English dictionary. A <a href="Wales">Welsh</a> teacher at Fairmount Public School, where Lewis was a student, helped him learn English but also passed on his Welsh accent.

Lewis entered <a href="Baron%20Byng%20High%20School">Baron Byng High School</a> in September 1924. He soon became friends with <a href="A.M.%20Klein">A.M. (Abe) Klein</a>, who became one of Canada's leading poets. He also met <a href="Irving%20Layton">Irving Layton</a>, another future prominent Canadian writer, to whom he acted as political mentor. Baron Byng High School was predominantly Jewish because it was in the heart of Montreal's non-affluent Jewish community, and was ghetto-like because Jews were forbidden from attending many high schools.

Besides poets, at high school Lewis met Sophie Carson, who eventually became his wife. Klein, their mutual friend, introduced them. Carson came from a religious Jewish family. Her father did not approve of Lewis, because he was a recent immigrant to Canada, and in Carson's father's opinion had little to no possibility of success.

After high school, Lewis spent five years at <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a> in Montreal: four in arts, and one in law. While there, he helped found the Montreal branch of the <a href="Young%20People%27s%20Socialist%20League">Young People's Socialist League</a>. He gave lectures sponsored by this anti-communist socialist club, and was its nominal leader. One of his favourite professors was Canadian humorist, and noted Conservative party proponent, <a href="Stephen%20Leacock">Stephen Leacock</a>, whom Lewis liked more for his personality than for his discipline, economics.

In his third year, Lewis founded "The McGilliad" campus magazine. It published many of his anti-communist views, though the December 1930 issue included an article he wrote expressing his approval of the Russian Revolution and calling for a greater understanding of the Soviet Union; throughout his career, he would attack communism, but would always have a sympathy for the 1917 revolutionaries. Also at McGill, Lewis met and worked with prominent Canadian socialists like <a href="F.%20R.%20Scott">F. R. Scott</a>, <a href="Eugene%20Forsey">Eugene Forsey</a>, <a href="J.%20King%20Gordon">J. King Gordon</a>, and <a href="Frank%20Underhill">Frank Underhill</a>. He would work with all of them again in the 1940s and 50s in the CCF.

With Scott's encouragement, Lewis applied for a <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholarship</a> during his first year at law school. The interviews for the Quebec representative were conducted in Montreal. The examining board included the then-president of the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (CPR), <a href="Edward%20Wentworth%20Beatty">Sir Edward Beatty</a>. In response to a question about what he would do if he became prime minister, Lewis stated that he would <a href="nationalize">nationalize</a> the CPR. Despite this answer and his socialist views in general, his responses to the board's cross-examination satisfied them that he was not a communist, and they awarded him the scholarship.

When David Lewis entered <a href="Lincoln%20College%2C%20Oxford">Lincoln College</a>, <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford</a>, in 1932, he immediately took a leadership role in the university's socialist-labour circles. <a href="Michael%20Foot">Michael Foot</a>, the future leader of the British Labour Party, mentioned in an interview that Lewis was, 

When Lewis came to Oxford, the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Labour%20Club">Labour Club</a> was a tame organization adhering to <a href="Social%20Gospel">Christian activism</a>, or genteel socialist theories like those expressed by <a href="R.H.%20Tawney">R.H. Tawney</a> in his book "The Acquisitive Society". Lewis' modified <a href="Bundism">Bundist</a> interpretation of Marxism, which Smith labels "Parliamentary Marxism", ignited renewed interest in the club after the disappointment of <a href="Ramsay%20MacDonald%23Second%20Labour%20government%20%281929%E2%80%931931%29">Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government</a>.

The Oxford newspaper "<a href="Isis%20magazine">Isis</a>" noted Lewis' leadership ability at this early stage in his career. In its February 7, 1934, issue, while Lewis was president, they wrote of the club: "The energy of these University Socialists is almost unbelievable. If the Socialist movement as a whole is anything like as active as they are, then a socialist victory at the next election is inevitable."

In February 1934, British fascist <a href="William%20Joyce">William Joyce</a> (<a href="Lord%20Haw%20Haw">Lord Haw Haw</a>) visited Oxford. Lewis and future <a href="Ontario%20New%20Democratic%20Party">Ontario CCF</a> leader <a href="Ted%20Jolliffe">Ted Jolliffe</a> organized a noisy protest by planting Labour Club members in the dance hall where Joyce was speaking and having groups of two and three of them leave at a time, making much noise on the creaking wooden floors. They were successful in drowning out Joyce, and he did not complete his speech. Afterwards, a street fight erupted between Joyce's <a href="Blackshirt">Blackshirt</a> supporters and members of the Labour Club, including Lewis.

Lewis prevented the communists from making inroads at Oxford. Ted Jolliffe stated "there was a difference between his speeches at the Union and his speeches at the Labour Club. His speeches at the Union had more humour in them; the atmosphere was entirely different. But his speeches at the Labour Club were deadly serious ... His influence at the Labour Club, more than anyone else's, I think, explains the failure of the Communists to make headway there. There were so many naive people around who could have been taken in." He increased the Labour Club's membership by three quarters by the time he left.

In accordance with Bundism, Lewis rejected violent revolution and the <a href="dictatorship%20of%20the%20proletariat">dictatorship of the proletariat</a>. The Bund insisted that the revolution should be through democratic means, as <a href="Karl%20Marx">Marx</a> had judged possible in the late 1860s, and that democracy should prevail afterwards. Influenced by <a href="Fabianism">Fabianism</a>, Lewis became an <a href="Incrementalism">incrementalist</a> in his approach to replacing non-socialist governments. As Lewis biographer Cameron Smith points out:

Lewis was a prominent figure in the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">British Labour Party</a>, which, in emphasizing parliamentary action and organizational prowess, took an approach similar to the Bund's. Upon his 1935 graduation, the party offered him a candidacy in a <a href="safe%20seat">safe seat</a> in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">British House of Commons</a>. This left Lewis with a difficult decision: whether to stay in England or go home to Canada. If he had stayed in England, he likely would have been a partner in a prominent London law firm associated with <a href="Stafford%20Cripps">Stafford Cripps</a> and become a cabinet minister the next time Labour formed a government. Cripps, then a prominent barrister and Labour Party official, was grooming Lewis to be <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>. Lewis' other choice was to return to Montreal and help build the fledgling Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), with no guarantee of success. A personal note from <a href="J.%20S.%20Woodsworth">J. S. Woodsworth</a>, dated June 19, 1935, asked Lewis to take this latter option; in the end, he did.

Besides his political involvement, Lewis was active with the <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a>, probably the most prestigious and important debating club in the English-speaking world. His first debate, in January 1933, was on the resolution "That the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> is a menace to International good will"; Lewis was one of the participants for the "Aye" side. They lost.

The February 9, 1933, debate brought Lewis some level of early prominence. The resolution was "<a href="The%20King%20and%20Country%20debate">That this House will under no circumstances fight for its King or Country</a>" and was so controversial that it was news around the British Empire and beyond. Lewis again spoke for the "Aye" side. They won overwhelmingly and caused a newspaper uproar throughout the Empire. "The Times" of London entered the fray by pooh-poohing those who took the Union and their motion seriously.

Lewis became a member of the Union's Library Committee on March 9, 1933, and its treasurer in March 1934. After two failed attempts, he was narrowly elected president in late November 1934. He was president during the <a href="Hilary%20term">Hilary term</a>, from the beginning of January until the end of April 1935. "The Isis" commented that "... David Lewis ... will be, beyond question, the least Oxonian person ever to the lead the Society. In appearance, background, and intellectual outlook he is a grim antithesis to all the suave, slightly delicate young men who for generations have sat on the Union rostrum ..."

Sophie Carson had accompanied Lewis to Oxford, and they wed August 15, 1935, shortly after their return. The wedding took place in his parents' home; though a rabbi officiated, most traditional Jewish practices were not observed.

In 1935 David Lewis became the National Secretary of the CCF. As Smith puts it:

Into this political whirlwind stepped David. A centralist in a nation that was decentralizing. A socialist in a country that voted solidly capitalist. A campaigner for a party with no money, facing two parties each of which was big, powerful, and affluent. A professional, in a party of amateurs who mostly thought of themselves as a movement, not a party. An anti-Communist at a time when Canadian Communists were about to enter their heyday. A publicist seeking a unified voice for a party riven with dissent. An organizer whose leader, J.S. Woodsworth, really didn't believe in organization, thinking that the CCF should remain a loosely knit, co-operative association and believed this so implicitly that when it came time to appoint Lewis full-time to the job of national secretary [in 1938] he resisted, fearing the CCF would lose its spontaneity.

That Lewis not only survived, but prevailed is a testament to his skill and perseverance.
Most of the founders of the CCF – including Woodsworth, <a href="Tommy%20Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a>, <a href="Major%20James%20Coldwell">M. J. Coldwell</a>, and <a href="Stanley%20Knowles">Stanley Knowles</a>, – were informed by the <a href="Social%20Gospel">Social Gospel</a>, to which Lewis, with his Marxist socialism balanced by the Bund's democratic principles, felt an affinity. Both the Bund and the Social Gospel were focused on the material present rather than the afterlife. Both called on people to change their environment for the better rather than hoping that God might do it for them. Social justice, the brotherhood of man, and moral self-improvement were common to both.

It became obvious after the October <a href="Ontario%20general%20election%2C%201937">1937 Ontario election</a> that the CCF needed an image change; it was seen by the electorate as too far left. F. R. Scott pointed this out to Lewis in a letter, recommended moderating some of the party's policies, and advised that "... in the political arena we must find our friends among the near right."

In August 1938, Lewis quit his job at the Ottawa law firm of Smart and Biggar to work full-time as the CCF National Secretary. His starting salary was $1,200 per year, a low sum of money, even at that time, for a job with so much responsibility.

As National Secretary, Lewis emphasized organization over ideology and forging links to <a href="Trade%20unions">unions</a>. He worked to moderate the party's image and downplay the <a href="Regina%20Manifesto">Regina Manifesto</a>'s more radical language, which seemed to scare off moderate voters. The offending language included "No CCF government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning". Lewis, federal leader M.J. Coldwell, and <a href="Clarence%20Gillis">Clarie Gillis</a> would spend the next 19 years trying to modify this declaration, finally succeeding with the 1956 <a href="Winnipeg%20Declaration">Winnipeg Declaration</a>.

At the 1944 CCF convention, Lewis won a concession "that even large business could have a place in the party – if they behave." Rather than opposing all private enterprise, Lewis was concerned with preventing monopoly capitalism. He passed a resolution reading "The socialization of large-scale enterprise, however, does not mean taking over every private business. Where private business shows no signs of becoming a monopoly, operates efficiently under decent working conditions, and does not operate to the detriment of the Canadian people, it will be given every opportunity to function, to provide a fair rate of return and to make its contribution to the nation's wealth." This resolution allowed for a mixed-economy that left most jobs in the private sphere.

Lewis did not share the desire of some members to keep the CCF "ideologically pure", and adhered to the Bundist belief that "it was better to go along with the masses in a not totally correct direction than to separate oneself from them and remain 'purist'." However, the CCF was as much a movement as it was a political party, and its own members frequently undermined it with radical proclamations. Lewis criticized the <a href="British%20Columbia%20New%20Democratic%20Party">British Columbia CCF</a> for such comments, saying "... what we say and do must be measured by the effect which it will have on our purpose of mobilizing people for action. If what we say and do will blunt or harm our purpose ... then we are saying and doing a false thing even if, in the abstract, it is true ... When, in heaven's name are we going to learn that working-class politics and the struggle for power are not a Sunday-school class where purity of godliness and the infallibility of the Bible must be held up without fear of consequences."

David Lewis was the party's "heavy", which did not help his popularity among CCF members, but after witnessing what he considered to be the European left's self-destruction in the 1930s, he was quick to end self-immolating tactics or policies. He would tolerate some criticism of the party by its members, but when he believed that it rose to self-mutilation, he suppressed it ruthlessly. This was most apparent when Lewis attacked and discredited Frank Underhill and his handling of Woodsworth House. Early in Lewis' career, Underhill was one of his mentors; this did not matter when Woodsworth House was stricken with financial difficulties in the late 1940s. Lewis was quick to blame and then discharged Underhill and the rest of the Woodsworth executive of their responsibilities. It was an unfortunate event that cost the CCF in the academic and intelligentsia world. To sum up Lewis' reign, discipline and solidarity were paramount. There had to be limits to discussion and tolerance of dissenting views.

In 1943, Lewis co-wrote "Make this Your Canada" with F. R. Scott, then the CCF's National Chairman. The book's main argument was that <a href="Planned%20economy">national economic planning</a> had proven itself during wartime with the King government's imposition of <a href="wage%20and%20price%20controls">wage and price controls</a> through the <a href="Wartime%20Prices%20and%20Trade%20Board">Wartime Prices and Trade Board</a>. Lewis and Scott further argued that its wartime success could translate to peacetime, and that Canada should adopt a <a href="mixed%20economy">mixed economy</a>. They also called for public ownership of key economic sectors, and for the burden to be placed on private companies to demonstrate that they could manage an industry more effectively in the private sector than the government could in the public sector. The book also outlined the history of the CCF up to that time and explained the party's decision-making process. By Canadian standards, the book was popular, and sold over 25,000 copies in its first year of publication.

Lewis first ran for the CCF in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201940">1940 federal election</a> in <a href="York%20West">York West</a>. He placed a distant third, receiving 8,330 fewer votes than the second-place Liberal candidate, Chris J. Bennett. Despite his poor showing in his first election, the party asked Lewis to run in the 1943 by-election in the Montreal, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, federal <a href="Cartier%20%28electoral%20district%29">riding of Cartier</a>, made vacant by the death of <a href="Peter%20Bercovitch">Peter Bercovitch</a>. Lewis' opponents included <a href="Fred%20Rose%20%28politician%29">Fred Rose</a> of the communist <a href="Labor%E2%80%93Progressive%20Party">Labor–Progressive Party</a>. It was a vicious campaign, immortalized by A.M. Klein in an uncompleted novel called "Come the Revolution". The novel was broadcast in the 1980s on <a href="Lister%20Sinclair">Lister Sinclair</a>'s <a href="Ideas%20%28radio%20show%29">"Ideas"</a> programme on <a href="CBC%20Radio%20One">CBC Radio One</a>. If the Communist rhetoric could be believed, "Lewis was a Fascist done up in brown."

Rose won and became the only (as of 2013) Communist to sit in the House of Commons. Lewis placed fourth. The sizable Jewish vote mostly went to Rose. The leftist "common front" punished Lewis by supporting Rose, who was seen to be of the community; Lewis lived in Ottawa at the time. It took Lewis many years to recover from this campaign, and its reverberation coloured Lewis' decision on where to run.

The <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201945">Canadian federal</a> and the <a href="Ontario%20general%20election%2C%201945">Ontario elections of 1945</a> were possibly the most crucial to Canada in the 20th century. They took place at the beginning of the <a href="welfare%20state">welfare state</a>, and the elections would set the course of political thought to the end of the century and beyond. The year was a disaster for the CCF, both nationally and in Ontario. It never fully recovered, and in 1961 would dissolve and become the New Democratic Party. As NDP strategist and historian <a href="Gerald%20Caplan">Gerald Caplan</a> put it: "June 4, and June 11, 1945, proved to be black days in CCF annals: socialism was effectively removed from the Canadian political agenda."

The anti-socialist crusade by the <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Party%20of%20Ontario">Ontario Conservative Party</a>, mostly credited to the <a href="Ontario%20Provincial%20Police">Ontario Provincial Police</a> (OPP) special investigative branch's agent D-208 (Captain William J. Osborne-Dempster) and the Conservative propagandists Gladstone Murray and Montague A. Sanderson, diminished the CCF's initially favourable position: the September 1943 <a href="Gallup%20poll">Gallup poll</a> showed the CCF leading nationally with 29 percent support, with the Liberals and Conservatives tied for second place at 28 percent. By April 1945, the CCF was down to 20 percent nationally, and on election day it received only 16 percent.

Another factor in the CCF's defeat was the unofficial coalition between the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a> and the communist <a href="Labor-Progressive%20Party">Labor-Progressive Party</a>. It guaranteed a split in the left-of-centre vote.

Lewis ran in <a href="Hamilton%20West%20%28electoral%20district%29">Hamilton West</a> instead of the CCF-friendly <a href="Winnipeg%20North">Winnipeg North</a> riding that had elected CCF and Labour Party candidates since the 1920s and had a substantial Jewish population. Historians and activists disagree on Lewis' reasons for doing so, but Caplan suggests that the shock of the Cartier election probably made him reluctant to fight another intense campaign against a Jewish Communist candidate. Whatever his reasons, he was soundly defeated. In the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201949">1949 federal election</a>, Lewis ran again in the <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton</a> area, in the riding of <a href="Wentworth%20%28electoral%20district%29">Wentworth</a>. He lost again, placing a relatively distant third.

The 1945 defeats were partially the result of an alliance between the Liberals and the communist <a href="Labor%E2%80%93Progressive%20Party">Labor–Progressive Party</a> (LPP). The LPP focused in on CCF-held seats, deliberately splitting the vote, and declared a "Liberal–Labour" coalition on May 29, 1944. They declared open warfare on the CCF in 1944, with spokesman John Weir stating in the LPP's "Canadian Tribune" newspaper that "a resounding defeat of the CCF at the polls must be [their] main objective."

The <a href="Canadian%20Congress%20of%20Labour">Canadian Congress of Labour</a> (CCL) supported the CCF, but the <a href="Trades%20and%20Labour%20Congress%20of%20Canada">Trades and Labour Congress</a> (TLC) refused to officially endorse them. This lack of unity between the two main Canadian umbrella labour organizations hurt the CCF, and was part of the Liberal–Communist alliance: TLC president Percey Berough was a Liberal, and vice-president Pat Sullivan was a Communist.

In the Ontario provincial election, the communists urged trade union members to vote for the right-wing <a href="Ontario%20Progressive%20Conservative%20Party">Conservative</a> <a href="George%20A.%20Drew">George Drew</a> rather than the CCF.

Lewis and <a href="Charles%20Millard">Charles Millard</a>, of the Canadian Congress of Labour, decided to purge organized labour's decision-making bodies of communists. Their first target was the <a href="Greater%20Sudbury">Sudbury</a>, Ontario, CCF riding association and its affiliated <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Mine%2C%20Mill%2C%20and%20Smelter%20Workers">International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers</a> (Mine-Mill) Local 598. However, Local 598 was not under Communist control: out of 11,000 dues-paying members, fewer than 100 were communists. Over the next twenty years, a fierce and ultimately successful battle was waged by Millard's <a href="United%20Steel%20Workers%20of%20America">United Steel Workers of America</a> (USW) to take over Local 598.

The attacks on the Sudbury CCF were even more costly, at least in terms of voter support. Sudbury's <a href="Robert%20Carlin">Bob Carlin</a> was one of the few CCF <a href="Member%20of%20Provincial%20Parliament%20%28Ontario%29">Members of Provincial Parliament</a> (MPPs) to survive the Drew government's 1945 landslide victory. Carlin had been part of Ted Jolliffe's team that had orchestrated the CCF's 1943 breakthrough, but was first and foremost a union man. He was a long-time labour organizer, going back to 1916 and the predecessor to the Mine-MIll: the <a href="Western%20Federation%20of%20Miners">Western Federation of Miners</a>. Carlin was loyal to his union, in whose service he had spent ten years, and to the men and woman who helped build it, regardless of their political affiliation; this made him unpopular with the CCF establishment in both Toronto and Ottawa.

Millard, Jolliffe, and Lewis did not directly accuse Carlin of being a communist. Instead, they attacked him for not dealing with communists in Local 598, which was built by both communists and CCFers (with the latter firmly in control of the executive). Lewis and Jolliffe made the case to expel him from the Ontario CCF caucus at a Toronto special meeting of the CCF executive and the legislative caucus on April 13, 1948. In essence, Carlin became a casualty of Steel's plans to raid Mine-Mill. The CCF lost the seat in the <a href="Ontario%20general%20election%2C%201948">1948 Ontario election</a>, placing fourth. The Conservatives won the seat and Carlin, as an independent, finished a close second. It was not until the CCF became the New Democratic Party (NDP) and the Mine-Mill versus USW war was over, in 1967, that another social democrat – <a href="Elie%20Martel">Elie Martel</a> in <a href="Sudbury%20East">Sudbury East</a> – was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from the city.

Lewis and Millard's crusade to limit communist influence received an unexpected boost from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, in <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a>'s 1956 denunciation of <a href="Stalinism">Stalinism</a>. In his "Secret Speech", "<a href="On%20the%20Personality%20Cult%20and%20its%20Consequences">On the Personality Cult and its Consequences</a>", delivered to a closed session of the <a href="20th%20Congress%20of%20the%20Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">20th Party Congress</a> of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Communist Party of the Soviet Union</a>, Khrushchev denounced Stalin for his cult of personality, and his regime for "violation of Leninist norms of legality". When the excesses of <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>'s regime were exposed, it caused a split in the communist movement in Canada and permanently weakened it. By the end of 1956, the LPP's influence in the trade union movement and politics was spent.

Lewis resigned as national secretary in 1950 and moved to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> to practise law in partnership with Ted Jolliffe. He became the chief legal advisor to the USW's Canadian division, and assisted them in their organizing efforts and battles with the Mine-Mill union. Lewis focused on his law practice for the next five years. In his first year, he paid more in income tax than he had earned annually as CCF National Secretary.

He bought his first house, in the <a href="Bathurst%20Street%2C%20Toronto">Bathurst Street</a> – <a href="St.%20Clair%20Avenue">St. Clair Avenue</a> West area of Toronto, during this period. After his father Moishe died in 1951, his mother Rose moved into the 95 Burnside Drive Lewis home from Montreal. This is the home where his son Stephen Lewis would spend his teenage years, and the other three children would grow up.

Although he gave-up day-to-day running of the party's organization, he stayed on the national executive as the English-speaking vice-president from 1950 to 1954. After four years of comparatively limited involvement with CCF internal politics, Lewis became the party's national chairman, by winning the election to replace <a href="Percy%20Wright">Percy Wright</a>. He, along with Lorne Ingle, the person that replaced him as national secretary in 1950, became the main drafters of the "1956 Winnipeg Declaration", which replaced the "Regina Manifesto". The lead-up to the August 1956 CCF convention had Lewis working full-time in his labour practice, including work on the merger of the Canadian Congress of Labour and the Trades and Labour Congress to form the Canadian Labour Congress (CLC), and putting in long hours organizing the committee that wrote the "Declaration". He collapsed in his office in May 1956; after administering several tests for a possible cardiac condition, the doctors concluded that Lewis collapsed of exhaustion. He stayed in bed for a week and recovered enough to help the "Declaration" pass ten weeks later. The Winnipeg convention was the CCF's <a href="swan%20song">swan song</a>. Even with the "Declaration"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s modified tone, which removed state planning and nationalization of industry as central tenets of the party's platform, the CCF suffered a crippling defeat in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201958">1958 federal election</a>, which became known as the "<a href="John%20Diefenbaker">Diefenbaker</a> sweep". It was obvious to Lewis, Coldwell and the rest of the CCF executive that the CCF could not continue as it was, and, with the co-operation of the CLC, they started exploring how to broaden its appeal.

In 1958, Lewis worked closely with the CLC's president, <a href="Claude%20Jodoin">Claude Jodoin</a>, and the CLC's executive vice-president Stanley Knowles to merge the labour and social democratic movements into a new party. Coldwell did not want to continue as the party's national leader, because he lost his <a href="Constituency">parliamentary seat</a> in the election. Lewis persuaded him to stay on until the new party was formed. Lewis was elected party president at the July 1958 convention in Montreal, which also endorsed a motion for the executive and National Council to "enter into discussions with Canadian Labour Congress" and other like-minded groups to lay the groundwork for a new party.

By 1960, progress was being made in creating a new party, but Lewis had to again act as disciplinarian. Since Coldwell lost his seat, he was constantly considering resignation, but was repeatedly dissuaded by the party. With Coldwell lacking a seat, the CCF caucus chose <a href="Hazen%20Argue">Hazen Argue</a> as its leader in the House of Commons. During the lead-up to the 1960 CCF convention, Argue was pressing Coldwell to step down. This leadership challenge jeopardized plans for an orderly transition to the new party. Lewis and the rest of the new party's organizers opposed Argue's manoeuvres, and wanted <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> premier <a href="Tommy%20Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a> to be the new party's first leader. To prevent their plans from derailing, David Lewis attempted to persuade Argue not to force a vote at the convention on the question of the party's leadership. He was unsuccessful. There was a split between the <a href="Caucus%23In%20Commonwealth%20nations">parliamentary caucus</a> and the party executive on the convention floor. Coldwell quit and Argue replaced him as leader.

In July 1961, the CCF became the New Democratic Party (NDP). They elected Tommy Douglas as their leader by a convincing 1391 to 380 margin over Argue. Six months later, Argue quit the party and crossed the floor to join the Liberals.

In the mid-1970s, David Lewis reflected on this incident and he concluded that he had not handled the leadership transition well:

Two days after the end of the NDP's 1961 founding convention, Tommy Douglas wrote a letter to Sophie Lewis, David's wife, telling her that David must run in the next election. Lewis decided to run in his home riding of <a href="York%20South">York South</a>, which was concurrently held provincially, in the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario">Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a>, by the NDP's Ontario leader, <a href="Donald%20C.%20MacDonald">Donald C. MacDonald</a>.

Diefenbaker's government had to call an election sometime in 1962, so there was time to plan Lewis' campaign. He had two campaign managers: his son Stephen and Gerry Caplan. One of their main strategies was to gain votes in the riding's affluent Jewish enclave in the Village of <a href="Forest%20Hill%2C%20Toronto">Forest Hill</a>. Lewis, however, was perceived by the Jewish community as an outsider because he did not take part in community events or belong to a synagogue. His opposition to the creation of the state of Israel, a result of his Bundist politics, also did not sit well with the mostly <a href="Zionist">Zionist</a> community. It took extra effort on Stephen's and Caplan's parts to convince community members that David was a legitimate Jewish voice and that he would not harm their businesses. Besides resistance from the Jewish community, in his role as party national vice-president David Lewis had to tackle the impending doctors' strike in Saskatchewan, the result of the CCF government's implementation of <a href="Medicare%20%28Canada%29">Medicare</a>. He called the province's doctors "blackmailers" for suggesting such a strike. Lewis also appeared on one of the NDP's few national television spots. He appeared on the national <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV Television Network</a> with <a href="Walter%20Pitman">Walter Pitman</a> to present the NDP's platform on a planned economy, in a conversation-style election broadcast. On June 18, 1962, Lewis was elected in York South, and finally became an MP. Since Tommy Douglas lost in his seat, Lewis was considered the front-runner to become house leader until Douglas entered the house in an October by-election.

Lewis' first term as MP was a short one, as Diefenbaker's minority government was defeated in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201963">April 8, 1963, general election</a>. Lewis lost in Forest Hill, as his support among its Jewish community evaporated and returned to the Liberals, who were seen as best able to contain the <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Canada">Social Credit Party</a>, which was perceived to be anti-Semitic. This was only a temporary set-back. With Diefenbaker in opposition (and unlikely to resurrect the coalition in Quebec that gave him his majority in 1958) and Social Credit a diminished force, Lewis returned to the House of Commons in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201965">1965 general election</a>. He was re-elected in the 1968 election, and became the NDP leader in the House of Commons after Douglas lost his seat. At the 1969 Winnipeg National Convention, Douglas announced that he intended to step-down as leader by 1971, which meant that Lewis became the "de facto" leader in the interim.

The <a href="October%20Crisis">October 1970 Quebec FLQ Crisis</a> put Lewis in the spotlight, as he was the only NDP MP with any roots in Quebec. He and Douglas were opposed to the October 16 implementation of the <a href="War%20Measures%20Act">War Measures Act</a>. The Act, enacted previously only for wartime purposes, imposed extreme limitations on civil liberties, and gave the police and military vastly expanded powers for arresting and detaining suspects, usually with little to no evidence required. Although it was only meant to be used in Quebec, since it was federal legislation, it was in-force throughout Canada. Some police services, from outside of Quebec, took advantage of it for their own purposes, which mostly had nothing even remotely related to the Quebec situation, as Lewis and Douglas suspected. Sixteen of the 20 members of the NDP parliamentary caucus voted against the implementation of the War Measures Act in the House of Commons. They took much grief for being the only parliamentarians to vote against it. Lewis stated at a press scrum that day: "The information we do have, showed a situation of criminal acts and criminal conspiracy in Quebec. But, there is no information that there was unintended, or apprehended, or planned insurrection, which alone, would justify invoking the War Measures Act." About five years later, many of the MPs who voted to implement it regretted doing so, and belatedly honoured Douglas and Lewis for their stand against it. Progressive Conservative leader <a href="Robert%20Stanfield">Robert Stanfield</a> went so far as to say that, "Quite frankly, I've admired Tommy Douglas and David Lewis, and those fellows in the NDP for having the courage to vote against that, although they took a lot of abuse at the time...I don't brood about it. I'm not proud of it."

Stephen Lewis was coming into his own during this period. In 1963, at the age of 26, he was elected to the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Ontario">Legislative Assembly of Ontario</a>. Following the engineered 1970 resignation of Donald C. MacDonald, Stephen was elected leader of the <a href="Ontario%20New%20Democratic%20Party">Ontario New Democratic Party</a>. During the early-to-mid-1970s, the father-and-son-team led the two largest sections of the NDP.

In February 1968, Stephen Lewis, as a supposed representative of the Ontario NDP legislative caucus, asked the 63-year-old Tommy Douglas to step down as leader so that a younger person could take over. Donald C. MacDonald stated that Lewis was not representing the caucus, but acting on his own. Though Douglas was taken aback by the suggestion, his defeat in the ensuing election bolstered Stephen's case and on October 28, 1969, Douglas announced that he would step down as leader before the NDP's 1971 convention.

David Lewis ran to succeed Douglas as national leader. The <a href="New%20Democratic%20Party%20leadership%20election%2C%201971">1971 leadership convention</a> was a tumultuous affair. A new generation of NDP activists known as <a href="The%20Waffle">The Waffle</a> proposed many controversial resolutions, including nationalization of all natural resource industries and support for Quebec Sovereignty. It took the combined efforts of the NDP establishment — and the sizable trade union delegation — to vote down these resolutions, which caused many bitter debates and sharply divided the convention. Lewis, as the leading establishment figure, won the party's leadership on April 24 in a surprisingly close race that required four ballots before he could claim victory over the Waffle's <a href="James%20Laxer">James Laxer</a>. Laxer had been prominently featured in media coverage leading up to and during the convention. Lewis' perceived heavy-handedness in dealing with The Waffle at this and previous conventions made him many enemies, as had his involvement in most of the CCF and NDP's internal conflicts during the previous 36 years. Many members who had felt his wrath as party disciplinarian plotted their revenge against him. At his first press conference after winning the leadership, Lewis stated that he was not beholden to the Waffle, as they were soundly defeated at the convention, and that he made no promises to them. He also warned the party's Quebec wing that they could continue to theorize about possible self-determination resolutions, but that come election time they must pledge themselves to the party's newly confirmed federalist policy. He did not purge the Waffle from the NDP, but left it to his son Stephen to do in June 1972, when the party's Ontario wing resolved to disband the Waffle or kick its members out of the party if they did not comply with the disbanding order.

David Lewis led the NDP through the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201972">1972 federal election</a>, during which he uttered his best known quotation, calling Canadian corporations "<a href="corporate%20welfare">corporate welfare</a> bums", a term also used in the title of his 1972 book "Louder Voices: The Corporate Welfare Bums". This election campaign also employed the first dedicated plane for the NDP leader's tour, dubbed "Bum Air" by reporters, because it was a slow, twin engine, turbo-prop driven <a href="Handley%20Page%20Dart%20Herald">Handley Page Dart Herald</a>. In previous campaigns, the party's leader, Tommy Douglas, had to use commercial Air Canada flights to get around during the election, with few people in his entourage.

The 1972 election returned a Liberal <a href="minority%20government">minority government</a> and elected the greatest number of NDP MPs until the 1980 election, and left the NDP holding the balance of power until 1974. The NDP propped up <a href="Pierre%20Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a>'s Liberal government in exchange for the implementation of NDP proposals such as the creation of <a href="Petro-Canada">Petro-Canada</a> as a <a href="crown%20corporation">crown corporation</a>. Lewis wanted to topple the government in a vote of no-confidence as early as possible, because he saw no strategic advantage to supporting the Trudeau government: he believed that Trudeau would get the credit if a program was well-received, and that the NDP would be vilified if it was unpopular.

In hindsight, Lewis' no-win evaluation of the situation appears correct: the party would not be rewarded for its efforts by the electorate. In the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201974">1974 election</a>, the NDP were reduced to 16 seats. Lewis lost his seat, leading him to resign as party leader in 1975. It was revealed immediately after the election that he had been battling <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> for about two years; he had reportedly kept everyone, including his family, unaware of his condition.

Marquee Moon

Marquee Moon is the debut <a href="album">album</a> by American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Television%20%28band%29">Television</a>. It was released on February 8, 1977, by <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>.

In the years leading up to the album, Television had become a prominent act on the <a href="Music%20of%20New%20York%20City">New York music scene</a> and generated interest from a number of record labels, eventually signing a record deal with Elektra. The group rehearsed extensively in preparation for "Marquee Moon" before recording it at <a href="A%20%26amp%3B%20R%20Recording">A & R Recording</a> in September 1976. It was produced by the band's frontman <a href="Tom%20Verlaine">Tom Verlaine</a> and sound engineer <a href="Andy%20Johns">Andy Johns</a>.

For "Marquee Moon", Verlaine and fellow guitarist <a href="Richard%20Lloyd%20%28guitarist%29">Richard Lloyd</a> abandoned contemporary <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>'s power chords in favor of rock and <a href="jazz">jazz</a>-inspired interplay, melodic lines, and <a href="Counter-melody">counter-melodies</a>. Verlaine's lyrics combined urban and <a href="Pastoral%20literature">pastoral</a> imagery, references to <a href="Lower%20Manhattan">Lower Manhattan</a>, themes of adolescence, and influences from <a href="French%20poetry">French poetry</a>. He also used puns and double entendres to give his songs an impressionistic quality in describing his perception of an experience.

"Marquee Moon" was met with widespread acclaim and was hailed by critics as an original musical development in rock music. The critical recognition helped the album achieve unexpected commercial success in the United Kingdom, but it sold poorly in the United States. The record has since been viewed by critics as one of the greatest albums of all time and a foundational record of <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>. Television's innovative <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a> instrumentation on "Marquee Moon" strongly influenced the <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a> and <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> movements of the 1980s.

By the mid-1970s, <a href="Television%20%28band%29">Television</a> had become a leading act in the <a href="Music%20of%20New%20York%20City">New York music scene</a>. They first developed a following from their residency at the <a href="Lower%20Manhattan">Lower Manhattan</a> club <a href="CBGB">CBGB</a>, where they helped persuade club manager <a href="Hilly%20Kristal">Hilly Kristal</a> to feature more unconventional musical groups. The band had received interest from labels by late 1974, but chose to wait for an appropriate record deal. They turned down a number of major labels, including <a href="Island%20Records">Island Records</a>, for whom they had recorded demos with producer <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a>. Eno had produced demos of the songs "Prove It", "Friction", "Venus", and "<a href="Marquee%20Moon%20%28song%29">Marquee Moon</a>" in December 1974, but Television frontman <a href="Tom%20Verlaine">Tom Verlaine</a> did not approve of Eno's sound: "He recorded us very cold and brittle, no resonance. We're oriented towards really strong guitar music ... sort of <a href="Expressionist%20music">expressionistic</a>."

After founding bassist <a href="Richard%20Hell">Richard Hell</a> left in 1975, Television enlisted <a href="Fred%20Smith%20%28bassist%29">Fred Smith</a>, whom they found more reliable and rhythmically adept. The band quickly developed a rapport and a musical style that reflected their individual influences: Smith and guitarist <a href="Richard%20Lloyd%20%28guitarist%29">Richard Lloyd</a> had a <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> background, drummer <a href="Billy%20Ficca">Billy Ficca</a> was a <a href="jazz">jazz</a> enthusiast, and Verlaine's tastes varied from the rock group <a href="13th%20Floor%20Elevators">13th Floor Elevators</a> to jazz saxophonist <a href="Albert%20Ayler">Albert Ayler</a>. That same year, Television shared a residency at CBGB with singer and poet <a href="Patti%20Smith">Patti Smith</a>, who had recommended the band to <a href="Arista%20Records">Arista Records</a> president <a href="Clive%20Davis">Clive Davis</a>. Although he had seen them perform, Davis was hesitant to sign them at first. He was persuaded by Smith's then boyfriend <a href="Allen%20Lanier">Allen Lanier</a> to let them record demos, which Verlaine said resulted in "a much warmer sound than Eno got". However, Verlaine still wanted to find a label that would allow him to produce Television's debut album himself, even though he had little recording experience.

In August 1976, Television signed a recording deal with <a href="Elektra%20Records">Elektra Records</a>, who promised Verlaine he could produce the band's first album with the condition that he would be assisted by a well-known recording engineer. Verlaine, who did not want to be guided in the studio by a famous producer, enlisted engineer <a href="Andy%20Johns">Andy Johns</a> based on his work for <a href="the%20Rolling%20Stones">the Rolling Stones</a>' 1973 album "<a href="Goats%20Head%20Soup">Goats Head Soup</a>". Lloyd was also impressed by Johns, who he said had produced "some of the great guitar sounds in rock". Johns was credited as the co-producer on "Marquee Moon". Elektra did not query Television's studio budget for the recording.

Television recorded "Marquee Moon" in September 1976 at <a href="A%20%26amp%3B%20R%20Recording">A & R Recording</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. In preparation for the album's recording, Television had rehearsed for four to six hours a day and six to seven days a week. Lloyd said they were "both really roughshod musicians on one hand and desperadoes on the other, with the will to become good". During preparations, the band rejected most of the material they had written over the course of three years. Once they were in the studio, they recorded two new songs for the album—"Guiding Light" and "Torn Curtain"—and older songs such as "Friction", "Venus", and the title track, which had become a standard at their live shows. Verlaine said that, because he had predetermined the structure of the album, only those eight songs and a few others were attempted during the recording sessions. 

For most of "Marquee Moon", Johns recorded Television as they performed live in the studio. A few songs were recorded in one <a href="take">take</a>, including the title track, which Ficca assumed was a rehearsal. Johns suggested the group record another take of the song, but Verlaine told him to "forget it". Verlaine and Lloyd's guitars were recorded and <a href="Multitrack%20recording">multi-tracked</a> to left and right <a href="Audio%20channel">channels</a>, and the final recordings were left <a href="Dynamic%20range%20compression">uncompressed</a> and unadorned with studio effects.

According to "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", "Marquee Moon" is a <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a> album, while Jason Heller from "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" described it as "elegantly jagged" <a href="art%20punk">art punk</a>. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> regarded it as more of a rock record because of Television's formal and technical abilities as musicians: "It wasn't punk. Its intensity wasn't manic; it didn't come in spurts." Both sides of the album begin with three shorter, <a href="hook%20%28music%29">hook</a>-driven songs, which "<a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a>"s Evan Chakroff said veer between <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> and post-punk styles. The title track and "Torn Curtain" are longer and more <a href="Jam%20session">jam</a>-oriented. "As peculiar as it sounds, I've always thought that we were a pop band", Verlaine later told "<a href="Select%20%28magazine%29">Select</a>". "You know, I always thought "Marquee Moon" was a bunch of cool singles. And then I'd realise, Christ, [the title track] is ten minutes long. With two guitar solos." As <a href="Tom%20Moon">Tom Moon</a> observed, Verlaine's singing avoids the "cursory punk snarl" while the band's music demonstrates "extended instrumental sections, impenetrable moods" (as on "Torn Curtain") and historical rock influences like <a href="Chuck%20Berry">Chuck Berry</a> and the early music of <a href="the%20Rolling%20Stones">the Rolling Stones</a> (as on "Friction").

Verlaine and Lloyd's guitar parts on the album are interplayed around the rhythm section's drum hits and basslines. Their dual playing draws on 1960s rock and <a href="avant-garde%20jazz">avant-garde jazz</a> styles, abandoning the layered <a href="power%20chord">power chord</a>s of contemporary punk rock in favor of melodic lines and <a href="Counter-melody">counter-melodies</a>. Verlaine's guitar establishes the song's rhythmic <a href="phrase%20%28music%29">phrase</a>, against which Lloyd is heard playing <a href="Consonance%20and%20dissonance">dissonant</a> melodies. Lloyd had learned to <a href="Musical%20notation">notate</a> his solos by the time they recorded "Marquee Moon", allowing him to <a href="musical%20development">develop</a> his solo for a song from <a href="Introduction%20%28music%29">introduction</a> to <a href="Variation%20%28music%29">variation</a> and <a href="Resolution%20%28music%29">resolution</a>. Some songs have the two guitarists trading rhythmic and melodic lines several times while producing <a href="tension%20%28music%29">tension</a>. "There weren't many bands where the two guitars played rhythm and melody back and forth, like a <a href="jigsaw%20puzzle">jigsaw puzzle</a>", Lloyd said. Most of the solos on "Marquee Moon" follow a pattern wherein Verlaine runs up a <a href="major%20scale">major scale</a> but regresses slightly after each <a href="Steps%20and%20skips">step</a>. On "See No Evil", he solos through a full <a href="octave">octave</a> before playing a <a href="blues">blues</a>-influenced <a href="riff%20%28music%29">riff</a>, and on the title track, he is heard playing in a <a href="Mixolydian%20mode">Mixolydian mode</a> and lowering the <a href="major%20seventh">seventh</a> by half a step. "Friction" opens with Lloyd playing octaves before Verlaine's ringing <a href="guitar%20harmonic">harmonics</a> and series of descending <a href="scale%20%28music%29">scales</a>.

Verlaine's lyrics on "Marquee Moon" combine urban and <a href="pastoral%20literature">pastoral</a> imagery. Although it is not a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>, many of its songs make geographical references to Lower Manhattan. According to Bryan Waterman, author of the <a href="33%E2%85%93">33⅓</a> book on the record, it celebrates stern adolescence in the urban pastoral <a href="Mode%20%28literature%29">mode</a>. Its urban <a href="nocturne">nocturne</a> theme is derived from poetic works about <a href="Bohemianism">Bohemian</a> decadence. According to "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>", the album is about <a href="urban%20mythology">urban mythology</a>; Verlaine brought "a sentimental romanticism to the <a href="Bowery">Bowery</a>, making legends out of the mundane". The lyrics also incorporate maritime imagery, including the paradoxical "nice little boat made out of ocean" in "See No Evil", the waterfront setting in "Elevation", sea metaphors in "Guiding Light", and references to docks, caves, and waves in "Prove It".

Although Verlaine was against drug use after Television formed, he once had a short-lived phase using <a href="psychedelic%20drug">psychedelic drug</a>s, to which he makes reference in <a href="simile">simile</a>s on songs like "Venus". Its <a href="Vignette%20%28literature%29">vignette</a>-like lyrics follow an ostensibly drug-induced, revelatory experience: "You know it's all like some new kind of drug / my senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves / Broadway looks so medieval, it seems to flap like little pages / I fell sideways laughing, with a friend from many stages." According to Waterman, while <a href="psychedelic%20experience">psychedelic trips</a> informed the experiences of many artists in Lower Manhattan at the time, "Venus" contributed to the impression of "Marquee Moon" as a <a href="transcendentalism">transcendental</a> work in the vein of 19th-century <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a>. "Verlaine is into perception", Waterman said, "and sometimes the perception he represents is as intense as a mind-altering substance." Christgau said the lyric about <a href="Broadway%20%28Manhattan%29">Broadway</a> lent the album its association among critics to the <a href="East%20Village%2C%20Manhattan">East Village</a>, as it "situates this philosophical action in the downtown night".

The songs on "Marquee Moon" inspired interpretations from a variety of sources, but Verlaine conceded he did not understand the meaning behind much of his lyrics. He drew on influences from <a href="French%20poetry">French poetry</a> and wanted to narrate the consciousness or confusion of an experience rather than its specific details. He compared the songs to "a little moment of discovery or releasing something or being in a certain time or place and having a certain understanding of something". Verlaine also used puns and double-entendres when writing his lyrics, which he said are atmospheric and convey the meaning of a song implicitly. "See No Evil" opens with the narrator's <a href="wikt%3Aflight%20of%20fancy">flights of fancy</a> and closes with an imperative about limitless possibilities: "Runnin' wild with the one I love / Pull down the future with the one you love". In the <a href="refrain">refrain</a> to "Venus", the narrator falls into "the arms of <a href="Venus%20de%20Milo">Venus de Milo</a>". Verlaine explained his reference to the armless statue as "a term for a state of feeling. They're loving [ubiquitous] arms".

"Marquee Moon"s title was interpreted by Waterman as an encapsulation of the urban and bucolic imagery in the songs, "suggesting the kind of night sky only visible above the neon glare of city-dwellers' assault on the dark". In his mind, the <a href="Marquee%20%28sign%29">marquee</a> rather than the moon in the concept sets the record's mood. He added, "sensory experience will be of prime importance to these eight songs. What can we see by the light of a marquee moon? What will be revealed on "Marquee Moon"s <a href="gramophone%20record">grooves</a>?"

The album's packaging was designed by art director <a href="Tony%20Lane">Tony Lane</a>. The front cover photo was shot by photographer <a href="Robert%20Mapplethorpe">Robert Mapplethorpe</a>, who had previously shot the cover for Patti Smith's 1975 album "<a href="Horses%20%28album%29">Horses</a>". His photo situated Verlaine a step in front of the rest of the band, who were captured in a tensed, serious pose. Verlaine held his left hand across his body and extended his slightly clenched right hand forward. When Mapplethorpe gave Television the <a href="contact%20print">contact print</a>s, Lloyd took the band's favorite shot to a print shop in <a href="Times%20Square">Times Square</a> and asked for color <a href="photocopies">photocopies</a> for the group members to mull over. Although the first few copies were oddly colored, Lloyd asked the copy worker to print more "while turning the knobs with his eyes closed". He likened the process to <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>'s <a href="Screen%20printing">screen prints</a>. After he showed it to the group, they chose the altered copy over Mapplethorpe's original photo, which Fred Smith subsequently had framed and kept for himself.

"Marquee Moon" was released on February 8, 1977, in the United States and on March 4 in the United Kingdom, where it was an unexpected success and reached number 28 on <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">the country's albums chart</a>. The record's two <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a>—the title track and "Prove It"—both <a href="record%20chart">charted</a> on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Top 30</a>. Its commercial success in the UK was partly fueled by <a href="Nick%20Kent">Nick Kent</a>'s rave two-page review of the album for "<a href="NME">NME</a>".

While holidaying in London after "Marquee Moon"s completion, Verlaine saw that Television had been put on "NME"s front cover and notified Elektra's <a href="press%20service">press department</a>, who encouraged the band to capitalize on their success there with a tour of the UK. However, the label had already organized for the band to perform on <a href="Peter%20Gabriel">Peter Gabriel</a>'s American tour as a supporting act. Television played small theatres and some larger club venues, and received more mainstream exposure, but were not well received by Gabriel's <a href="Middle%20America%20%28United%20States%29">middle-American</a> progressive rock audiences, and found the tour unnerving. 

In May, Television embarked on a highly successful theatre tour of the UK with <a href="Blondie%20%28band%29">Blondie</a> as their supporting act. They were enthusiastically received by audiences there, and Verlaine said it was refreshing to perform at large theatres after playing smaller clubs for four years. He nonetheless felt that Blondie did not suit their show because they were too different artistically, even though both groups had emerged from the music scene at CBGB. Blondie guitarist <a href="Chris%20Stein">Chris Stein</a> said that Television were "so competitive" and unaccommodating on the tour, and that they did not treat it like a joint effort. He recalled one show where "all our equipment was shoved up at the <a href="The%20Apollo%20%28Glasgow%29">[Glasgow] Apollo</a> and we had like three feet of room so that [Verlaine] could stand still in this vast space."

By the time of Television's return to the US, Elektra had given up on promoting "Marquee Moon", which they dismissed as a commercial failure. "Marquee Moon" sold fewer than 80,000 copies in the US and failed to chart on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. The group was dispirited by their inability to meet commercial expectations, which contributed to their disbandment in 1978.
"Marquee Moon" received acclaim from contemporary critics. According to <a href="Tony%20Fletcher">Tony Fletcher</a>, the album was difficult to categorize in 1977 and was hailed as "something entirely original, a new dawn in rock music". In "NME", Kent wrote that Television had proven to be ambitious and skilled enough to achieve "new dimensions of sonic overdrive" with an "inspired work of pure genius, a record finely in tune and sublimely arranged with a whole new slant on <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamics</a>". He deemed the album's music vigorous, sophisticated, and innovative at a time when rock is wholly conservative. In a five-star review for "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>", <a href="Vivien%20Goldman">Vivien Goldman</a> hailed "Marquee Moon" as "an obvious, unabashed, instant classic", while Peter Gammond of "<a href="Hi-Fi%20News%20%26amp%3B%20Record%20Review">Hi-Fi News & Record Review</a>" gave it an "A+" and called it one of the most exciting releases in music, highlighted by Verlaine's steely, <a href="G%C3%A1bor%20Szab%C3%B3">Gábor Szabó</a>-like guitar and authentic rock music. In "<a href="Audio%20%28magazine%29">Audio</a>", <a href="Jon%20Tiven">Jon Tiven</a> wrote that although the vocals and production could have been more amplified, Verlaine's lyrics and guitar "manage to viscerally and intellectually grab the listener". Joan Downs from "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" felt the band's sound was distinguished more by the bold playing of Lloyd, who she said had the potential to become a major figure in rock guitar. Christgau gave "Marquee Moon" an "A+" in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" and believed Verlaine's "<a href="wikt%3Ademotic%23Adjective">demotic</a>-philosophical" lyrics could have sustained the album alone, as would the guitar playing, which he said was as penetrating and expressive as <a href="Eric%20Clapton">Eric Clapton</a> or <a href="Jerry%20Garcia">Jerry Garcia</a> "but totally unlike either".

Some reviewers expressed reservations. In "Rolling Stone", <a href="Ken%20Tucker">Ken Tucker</a> said the lyrics generally amounted to <a href="non%20sequitur%20%28literary%20device%29">non sequiturs</a>, meaningless phrases, and pretentious aphorisms, but were ultimately secondary to the music. Although he found Verlaine's solos potentially formless and boring, Tucker credited him for structuring his songs around chilling riffs and "a new commercial impulse that gives his music its catchy, if slashing, hook". "<a href="High%20Fidelity%20%28magazine%29">High Fidelity</a>" felt the music's "scaring amalgam of rich, brightly colored textures" compensated for Verlaine's nearly unintelligible lyrics. Noel Coppage from "<a href="Stereo%20Review">Stereo Review</a>" was more critical of the singing and songwriting, likening "Marquee Moon" to a stale version of <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>. Nigel Hunter wrote in "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" that Verlaine's lyrics and guitar playing were vague and that listeners would need a "strong commitment to this type of music to get much out of it".

At the end of 1977, "Marquee Moon" was voted the third-best album of the year in the <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a>, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published in "The Village Voice". Christgau, the poll's creator and supervisor, ranked it number one on his own list. "Sounds" also named it the year's best album, while "NME" ranked it fifth on its year-end list. Verlaine later said of the overwhelmingly positive response from critics: "There was a certain magic happening, an inexplicable certainty of something, like the momentum of a freight train. That's not egoism but, if you cast a spell, you don't get flummoxed by the results of your spell."

Since the album's original release, "Marquee Moon" has been cited by rock critics as one of the greatest records of the American <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> movement, with Mark Weingarten of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" calling it the masterpiece of the 1970s <a href="Punk%20rock%23New%20York%20City">New York punk rock</a> scene. According to English writer <a href="Clinton%20Heylin">Clinton Heylin</a>, "Marquee Moon" marked the end of the New York scene's peak period, while "Spin" said it was the CBGB era's "best and most enduring record" and ranked it as the sixth-greatest album of all time in its April 1989 issue. "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" included it in the magazine's 2002 list of the 100 greatest punk records, while writer <a href="Colin%20Larkin%20%28writer%29">Colin Larkin</a> ranked it ninth and "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" ranked it 35th on similar lists. The album has often been voted high in critics polls of the greatest debuts and has also been named one of the greatest records of the 1970s by "NME", who ranked it tenth, and "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>", who ranked it third. 

"Marquee Moon" has frequently appeared on rankings of the greatest albums of all time. According to <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, it is the 23rd most prominently ranked album on critics' all-time lists. "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" and "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" ranked it 33rd and 25th, respectively, on lists published at the turn of the 21st century. On September 23, 2003, the album was reissued by <a href="Rhino%20Entertainment">Rhino Entertainment</a> with several bonus tracks, including the first <a href="Compact%20Disc">CD</a> appearance of Television's 1975 debut single "Little Johnny Jewel (Parts 1 & 2)". That same year, it was named the fourth-greatest album of all time by "NME", while "Rolling Stone" placed it at number 128 on its list of <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">the 500 greatest albums of all time</a>. It has been viewed as one of the greatest rock albums ever by English radio DJs <a href="Marc%20Riley">Marc Riley</a>, who said that "there's been nothing like it before or since", and <a href="Mark%20Radcliffe%20%28radio%20broadcaster%29">Mark Radcliffe</a>, who called it "the nearest rock record to a <a href="string%20quartet">string quartet</a>—everybody's got a part, and it works brilliantly."

"Marquee Moon" was one of the most influential records from the 1970s and has been cited by critics as a cornerstone of <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>. It heavily influenced the <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> movement of the 1980s, while post-punk acts appropriated the album's uncluttered production, introspective tone, and meticulously performed instrumentation. Hunter Felt from "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" attributed "Marquee Moon"s influence on post-punk and <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a> acts to the precisely <a href="syncopation">syncopated</a> rhythm section of Fred Smith and Billy Ficca. He recommended 2003's "definitive" reissue of the album to listeners of <a href="Post-punk%20revival">garage rock revival</a> bands, who he said had modeled themselves after Verlaine's <a href="Romantic%20poetry">Romantic poetry</a>-inspired lyrics and the "jaded yet somehow impassioned cynicism" of his vocals. According to <a href="Sputnikmusic">Sputnikmusic</a>'s Adam Downer, Television introduced an unprecedented style of rock and roll on "Marquee Moon" that inaugurated post-punk music, while "The Guardian" said it scaled "amazing new heights of sophistication and intensity" as a "gorgeous, ringing beacon of post-punk" despite being released several months before the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>' "<a href="Never%20Mind%20the%20Bollocks%2C%20Here%27s%20the%20Sex%20Pistols">Never Mind the Bollocks</a>" (1977). <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> editor <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> believed the record was innovative for abandoning previous New York punk albums' <a href="Swing%20%28jazz%20performance%20style%29">swing</a> and <a href="groove%20%28music%29">groove</a> sensibilities in favor of an intellectually stimulating scope that Television achieved instrumentally rather than lyrically. He claimed "it's impossible to imagine post-punk soundscapes" without "Marquee Moon". Fletcher argued that the songs' lack of <a href="Dynamic%20range%20compression">compression</a>, groove, and extra effects provided "a blueprint for a form of chromatic, rather than rhythmic, music that would later come to be called angular".

In Erlewine's opinion, "Marquee Moon" was radical and groundbreaking primarily as "a guitar rock album unlike any other". Verlaine and Lloyd's dual playing on the record strongly influenced alternative rock groups such as the <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>, <a href="noise%20rock">noise rock</a> acts such as <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>, and big arena bands like <a href="U2">U2</a>. <a href="Greg%20Kot">Greg Kot</a> from the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" wrote that Television "created a new template for guitar rock" because of how Verlaine's improvised playing was weaved together with Lloyd's precisely notated solos, particularly on the title track. As a member of U2, Irish guitarist <a href="The%20Edge">The Edge</a> simulated Television's guitar sound with an <a href="effects%20unit">effects pedal</a>. He later said he had wanted to "sound like them" and that "Marquee Moon"s title track had changed his "way of thinking about the guitar". Verlaine's jagged, expressive sound on the album made a great impression on American guitarist <a href="John%20Frusciante">John Frusciante</a> when he started developing as a guitarist in his early 20s, as it reminded him that "none of those things that are happening in the physical dimension mean anything, whether it's what kind of guitar you play or how your amp's set up. It's just ideas, you know, emotion." In "Rolling Stone", <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> called "Marquee Moon" "one of the all-time classic guitar albums" whose tremulous guitar twang was an inspiration behind bands such as <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a> and <a href="Joy%20Division">Joy Division</a>. Joy Division's <a href="Stephen%20Morris%20%28musician%29">Stephen Morris</a> cited it as one of his favorite albums, while R.E.M.'s <a href="Michael%20Stipe">Michael Stipe</a> said his love of "Marquee Moon" was "second only to [Patti Smith's] "Horses"". English guitarist <a href="Will%20Sergeant">Will Sergeant</a> said it was also one of his favorite records, and that Verlaine and Lloyd's guitar playing was a major influence on his band <a href="Echo%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Bunnymen">Echo & the Bunnymen</a>.

All songs were written by <a href="Tom%20Verlaine">Tom Verlaine</a>, except where noted.

The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)

The Lord of the Rings is a 1978 <a href="Animated%20film">animated</a> <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> film directed by <a href="Ralph%20Bakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a>. It is an adaptation of <a href="J.%20R.%20R.%20Tolkien">J. R. R. Tolkien</a>'s high fantasy epic "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>", comprising "<a href="The%20Fellowship%20of%20the%20Ring">The Fellowship of the Ring</a>" and the first half of "<a href="The%20Two%20Towers">The Two Towers</a>". Set in <a href="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, the film follows a group of <a href="hobbit">hobbit</a>s, <a href="Elf%20%28Middle-earth%29">elves</a>, <a href="Man%20%28Middle-earth%29">men</a>, <a href="Dwarf%20%28Middle-earth%29">dwarves</a>, and <a href="Wizard%20%28Middle-earth%29">wizards</a> who form a <a href="Fellowship%20of%20the%20Ring%20%28characters%29">fellowship</a>. They embark on a quest to destroy the <a href="One%20Ring">One Ring</a> made by the Dark Lord <a href="Sauron">Sauron</a>, and ensure his destruction.

Ralph Bakshi encountered Tolkien's writing early in his career, and had made several attempts to produce "The Lord of the Rings" as an animated film before being given funding by producer <a href="Saul%20Zaentz">Saul Zaentz</a> and distributor <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a>. The film is notable for its extensive use of <a href="rotoscoping">rotoscoping</a>, a technique in which scenes are first shot in live-action, then traced onto animation <a href="cel">cel</a>s. It uses a hybrid of traditional cel animation and rotoscoped live action footage. The film features the voices of <a href="William%20Squire">William Squire</a>, <a href="John%20Hurt">John Hurt</a>, <a href="Michael%20Graham%20Cox">Michael Graham Cox</a>, and <a href="Anthony%20Daniels">Anthony Daniels</a>, and was one of the first animated films to be presented theatrically in the <a href="Dolby%20Stereo">Dolby Stereo</a> sound system. The screenplay was written by <a href="Peter%20S.%20Beagle">Peter S. Beagle</a>, based on an earlier draft by <a href="Chris%20Conkling">Chris Conkling</a>.

Although Bakshi's "The Lord of the Rings" was a financial success, it received mixed reactions from critics, and there was no official sequel to cover the remainder of the story. Nonetheless, the film became a <a href="cult%20classic">cult classic</a> that continued to run as a matinee and a midnight movie for nearly two decades, and was an influence on <a href="Peter%20Jackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%28film%20series%29">trilogy</a>, as detailed in the DVD extras of "".

Early in the <a href="Second%20Age">Second Age</a> of <a href="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, <a href="Elf%20%28Middle-earth%29">elven</a> smiths forge nine <a href="Rings%20of%20Power">Rings of Power</a> for mortal <a href="Man%20%28Middle-earth%29">men</a>, seven for the <a href="Dwarf%20%28Middle-earth%29">Dwarf-Lords</a>, and three for the Elf-Kings. Soon after, the Dark Lord <a href="Sauron">Sauron</a> makes the <a href="One%20Ring">One Ring</a>, and uses it to attempt to conquer Middle-earth. Following the <a href="Last%20Alliance%20of%20Elves%20and%20Men">Last Alliance of Elves and Men</a>'s fall, the Ring is seized by Prince <a href="Isildur">Isildur</a>; and after Isildur was killed by <a href="Orc%20%28Middle-earth%29">orcs</a>, the Ring lies at the bottom of the river <a href="Anduin">Anduin</a> for over 2,500 years. Over time, Sauron captures the Nine Rings and transforms their owners into the <a href="Nazg%C3%BBl">Ringwraiths</a>. The One Ring is discovered by <a href="D%C3%A9agol">Déagol</a>, whose cousin, Sméagol, kills him and takes the Ring for himself. The Ring twists his body and mind, and he becomes the creature <a href="Gollum">Gollum</a> (<a href="Peter%20Woodthorpe">Peter Woodthorpe</a>). Hundreds of years later, <a href="Bilbo%20Baggins">Bilbo Baggins</a> (<a href="Norman%20Bird">Norman Bird</a>) finds the Ring in Gollum's cave and takes it back to the <a href="Shire%20%28Middle-earth%29">Shire</a>.

Decades later, during Bilbo's birthday celebration, the wizard <a href="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> (<a href="William%20Squire">William Squire</a>) tells him to leave the Ring for his relative <a href="Frodo%20Baggins">Frodo</a> (<a href="Christopher%20Guard">Christopher Guard</a>). Bilbo reluctantly agrees, and leaves the Shire. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets with Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses; and Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He is accompanied by three hobbit friends, <a href="Peregrin%20Took">Pippin</a> (<a href="Dominic%20Guard">Dominic Guard</a>), <a href="Meriadoc%20Brandybuck">Merry</a> (<a href="Simon%20Chandler">Simon Chandler</a>), and <a href="Samwise%20Gamgee">Sam</a> (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths, the hobbits eventually come to <a href="Bree%20%28Middle-earth%29">Bree</a>, from which <a href="Aragorn">Aragorn</a> (<a href="John%20Hurt">John Hurt</a>) leads them to <a href="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>. Frodo is stabbed atop <a href="Weathertop">Weathertop</a> mountain by the <a href="Witch-king%20of%20Angmar">chief of the Ringwraiths</a>, and becomes sickened as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the elf <a href="Legolas">Legolas</a> (<a href="Anthony%20Daniels">Anthony Daniels</a>); and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the river.

At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by <a href="Elrond">Elrond</a> (<a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Morell">André Morell</a>). He meets Gandalf again, after the latter escapes <a href="Saruman">Saruman</a> (Fraser Kerr), who plans to ally with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. At a council, Bilbo, Gandalf, and others debate the One Ring, and Frodo volunteers to go to <a href="Mordor">Mordor</a>, where the Ring can be destroyed. Thereafter Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; <a href="Boromir">Boromir</a> (<a href="Michael%20Graham%20Cox">Michael Graham Cox</a>), son of the <a href="Stewards%20of%20Gondor">Steward</a> of <a href="Gondor">Gondor</a>; Legolas; <a href="Gimli%20%28Middle-earth%29">Gimli</a> (<a href="David%20Buck">David Buck</a>) the dwarf; and Frodo's three hobbit companions.

Their attempt to cross the <a href="Misty%20Mountains">Misty Mountains</a> is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced into <a href="Moria%20%28Middle-earth%29">Moria</a>. There, they are attacked by orcs, and Gandalf falls into an <a href="wikt%3Aabyss">abyss</a> while battling a <a href="balrog">balrog</a>. The remaining Fellowship continue through the elf-haven <a href="Lothl%C3%B3rien">Lothlórien</a>, where they meet the elf queen <a href="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> (<a href="Annette%20Crosbie">Annette Crosbie</a>). Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, and Frodo decides to continue his quest alone; but Sam insists on accompanying him. Boromir is killed by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. They are captured by the orcs, who intend to take them to <a href="Isengard">Isengard</a> through the land of <a href="Rohan%20%28Middle-earth%29">Rohan</a>. The hobbits escape and flee into <a href="Fangorn%20Forest">Fangorn Forest</a>, where they meet <a href="Treebeard">Treebeard</a> (<a href="John%20Westbrook%20%28actor%29">John Westbrook</a>). Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track Merry and Pippin into the forest, where they are re-united with Gandalf, who was reborn after destroying the balrog.

The four then ride to Rohan's capital, <a href="Edoras">Edoras</a>, where Gandalf persuades King <a href="Th%C3%A9oden">Théoden</a> (<a href="Philip%20Stone">Philip Stone</a>) that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas then travel to the <a href="Helm%27s%20Deep">Helm's Deep</a>. Frodo and Sam discover Gollum stalking them in an attempt to reclaim the ring, and capture him; but spare his life in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum eventually begins plotting against them, and wonders if "<a href="Shelob">she</a>" might help. At Helm's Deep, Théoden's forces resist the orcs sent by Saruman, until Gandalf arrives with the absent Riders of Rohan, destroying the orc army.

Director <a href="Ralph%20Bakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a> was introduced to "The Lord of the Rings" during the mid-1950s while working as an animator for <a href="Terrytoons">Terrytoons</a>. In 1957, the young animator started trying to convince people that the story could be told in animation. In 1969, the rights were passed to <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a>, where filmmakers <a href="Stanley%20Kubrick">Stanley Kubrick</a> and <a href="John%20Boorman">John Boorman</a> each tried to adapt the story. (Contrary to an <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a>, Disney never owned the rights to "The Lord of the Rings".)

In the mid-1970s, Bakshi, who had since achieved box office success producing adult-oriented animated films such as "<a href="Fritz%20the%20Cat%20%28film%29">Fritz the Cat</a>", learned of UA and Boorman's attempts to adapt the story. He was told that Boorman had planned to produce all three parts of "The Lord of the Rings" as a single film, and commented, "I thought that was madness, certainly a lack of character on Boorman's part. Why would you want to tamper with anything Tolkien did?" When Boorman's <a href="Middle-earth%20in%20film%23Early%20attempts">proposed adaptation</a> fell apart, Bakshi approached the studio and proposed that he direct a three-part animated film adaptation of the book:

The <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> office was located in the same building, and Bakshi spoke to then-president <a href="Dan%20Melnick">Dan Melnick</a>. "I thought he would understand what "The Rings" meant, because UA did not." Bakshi and Melnick made a deal with Mike Medavoy at United Artists to buy the Boorman script. "The Boorman script cost $3 million, so Boorman was happy by the pool, screaming and laughing and drinking, 'cause he got $3 million for his script to be thrown out." However, after Melnick was fired from MGM, the deal fell through. Bakshi then contacted Saul Zaentz (who had helped finance "Fritz the Cat") to ask him to produce "The Lord of the Rings", and Zaentz agreed. Before the production started, the original three-part adaptation was negotiated down to two parts at United Artists, and Bakshi met with Tolkien's daughter Priscilla to discuss how the film would be made. She showed him the room where her father did his writing and drawing. Bakshi says, "My promise to Tolkien's daughter was to be pure to the book. I wasn't going to say, 'Hey, throw out Gollum and change these two characters.' My job was to say, 'This is what the genius said.'"

Bakshi said that one of the problems with the production was that the film was an <a href="epic%20film">epic</a>, because "epics tend to drag. The biggest challenge was to be true to the book." When asked what he was trying to accomplish with the film, Bakshi stated "The goal was to bring as much quality as possible to the work. I wanted real illustration as opposed to cartoons." Bakshi said that descriptions of the characters were not included because they are seen in the film:

Bakshi's major artistic influences on the film were classical illustrators such as <a href="Howard%20Pyle">Howard Pyle</a> and <a href="N.%20C.%20Wyeth">N. C. Wyeth</a>; he stated that no contemporary illustrators were an influence on the style of the film.

An early draft of the screenplay was written by <a href="Chris%20Conkling">Chris Conkling</a>, who told the bulk of the story in flashback, from Merry Brandybuck's point of view. After Bakshi and Zaentz saw Conkling's first draft, fantasy author <a href="Peter%20S.%20Beagle">Peter S. Beagle</a> was called in for a rewrite. According to the website of publisher <a href="Conlan%20Press">Conlan Press</a>, Beagle wrote multiple drafts of the script for only $5,000, on the strength of promises from Saul Zaentz to hire him for other, better-paying projects afterward. Zaentz later reneged on these promises.

The film makes some deviations from the book, but overall follows Tolkien's narrative quite closely. Of the adaptation process, Bakshi stated that elements of the story "had to be left out but nothing in the story was really altered." The film greatly condenses Frodo's journey from Bag End to Bree. Stop-overs at <a href="Farmer%20Maggot">Farmer Maggot</a>'s house, Frodo's home in Buckland, and the house of the mysterious <a href="Tom%20Bombadil">Tom Bombadil</a> deep in the <a href="Old%20Forest">Old Forest</a> are omitted. Maggot and his family and Bombadil and his wife <a href="Goldberry">Goldberry</a> are thus all omitted, along with <a href="Fredegar%20Bolger">Fatty Bolger</a>, a hobbit who accompanied Frodo at the beginning. According to Bakshi, the character of Tom Bombadil was "dropped" because "he didn't move the story along." Additionally, the character <a href="Glorfindel">Glorfindel</a> is amalgamated with <a href="Legolas">Legolas</a>.

Publicity for the film announced that Bakshi had created "the first movie painting" by utilizing "an entirely new technique in filmmaking." Much of the film used live-action footage which was then <a href="Rotoscoping">rotoscope</a>d to produce an animated look. This saved production costs and gave the animated characters a more realistic look. In animation historian <a href="Jerry%20Beck">Jerry Beck</a>'s "The Animated Movie Guide", reviewer Marea Boylan writes that "up to that point, animated films had not depicted extensive battle scenes with hundreds of characters. By using the rotoscope, Bakshi could trace highly complex scenes from live-action footage and transform them into animation, thereby taking advantage of the complexity live-action film can capture without incurring the exorbitant costs of producing a live-action film."

For the live-action portion of the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the rotoscope models acted out their parts in costume. During the middle of a large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi secretly shot footage of actors in <a href="Orc%20%28Middle-earth%29">Orc</a> costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by <a href="Billy%20Barty">Billy Barty</a>, while <a href="Sharon%20Baird">Sharon Baird</a> served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins. Other performers used on the rotoscoping session included John A. Neris as Gandalf, Walt Robles as Aragorn, <a href="Felix%20Silla">Felix Silla</a> as Gollum, <a href="Jere%20Rae%20Mansfield">Jeri Lea Ray</a> as Galadriel and Aesop Aquarian as Gimli. Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film, very little of it appears in the final film. Most of the film's crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is <a href="Solarisation">solarized</a> (per an interview with the film's cinematographer, Timothy Galfas, in the documentary "Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings") to produce a more three-dimensional look. In a few shots the two techniques are combined.

Bakshi claimed he "didn't start thinking about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start to work so well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved back and forth on the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again."

Following the live-action shoot, each frame of the live footage was printed out, and placed behind an animation cel. The details of each frame were copied and painted onto the cel. Both the live-action and animated sequences were storyboarded. Of the production, Bakshi is quoted as saying,
Although he continued to use rotoscoping in "<a href="American%20Pop">American Pop</a>", "<a href="Hey%20Good%20Lookin%27%20%28film%29">Hey Good Lookin'</a>", and "<a href="Fire%20and%20Ice%20%281983%20film%29">Fire and Ice</a>", Bakshi later regretted his use of rotoscoping, stating that he felt that it was a mistake to trace the source footage rather than using it as a guide.

<a href="Mike%20Ploog">Mike Ploog</a> (co-creator of <a href="Werewolf%20by%20Night">Werewolf by Night</a>) was one of numerous staff taking a role in animation on this film. Ploog also was involved in other <a href="Ralph%20Bakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a> animations, notably <a href="Wizards%20%28film%29">"Wizards"</a> and <a href="Hey%20Good%20Lookin%27%20%28film%29">"Hey Good Lookin"'</a>.

The <a href="film%20score">film score</a> was composed by <a href="Leonard%20Rosenman">Leonard Rosenman</a>. Bakshi wanted to include music by <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> but producer Saul Zaentz insisted upon an orchestral score because he would not be able to release the band's music on his <a href="Fantasy%20Records">Fantasy Records</a> label. Bakshi later stated that he hated Rosenman's score, which he found to be too cliché. In "Lord of the Rings: Popular Culture in Global Context", Ernest Mathijs writes that Rosenman's score "is a middle ground between his more sonorous but dissonant earlier scores and his more traditional (and less challenging) sounding music [...] In the final analysis, Rosenman's score has little that marks it out as distinctively about Middle Earth, relying on traditions of music (including film music) more than any specific attempt to paint a musical picture of the different lands and peoples of Tolkien's imagination." The film's score was issued as a <a href="Double%20album">double-LP</a> soundtrack album in 1978. A limited collector edition was created by Fantasy Records as a <a href="Picture%20disc%23Picture%20discs">picture disc</a> double LP featuring four scenes: The Hobbits leaving Hobbiton, The Ringwraiths at Bree, Gandalf and the Balrog, Journey with the Orcs. In 2001, the album was reissued on compact disc, with bonus tracks.

The film was originally intended to be distributed as "The Lord of the Rings Part I". According to Bakshi, when he completed the film, United Artists executives told him that they were planning to release the film without indicating that a sequel would follow, because they felt that audiences would not pay to see half of a film:

"The Film Book of J.R.R. Tolkien's the Lord of the Rings", published by <a href="Ballantine%20Books">Ballantine Books</a> on October 12, 1978, still referred to the sequel in the book's inside cover jacket. Bakshi states that he would never have made the film if he had known what would happen during the production. He is quoted as saying that the reason he made the film was "to save it for Tolkien, because I loved the "Rings" very much."

Bakshi also stated that he felt that the film "took more out of me than I got back."
Eventually, the <a href="Rankin-Bass">Rankin-Bass</a> studio, the company behind the 1977 animated adaptation of "<a href="The%20Hobbit%20%281977%20film%29">The Hobbit</a>", released "<a href="The%20Return%20of%20the%20King%20%281980%20film%29">The Return of the King</a>" in 1980 as a sequel to "The Hobbit", but also completing the story begun in Bakshi's film by adapting the final novel, though the Rankin-Bass production offers no stylistic continuation from the earlier film.

"The Lord of the Rings" was a financial success. The film grossed $30.5 million at the box office, based on a $4 million budget.

The film was nominated for both the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo</a> and <a href="The%20Saturn%20Awards">Saturn</a> Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation and Best Fantasy Film, respectively. Leonard Rosenman's score was nominated for a <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a> for Best Original Motion Picture Score, and Bakshi won a Golden Gryphon award for the film at the Giffoni Film Festival.

Critics were generally mixed in their responses to the film, but generally considered it to be a "flawed but inspired interpretation". Review aggregation website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gives the film a score of 50% based on reviews from 30 critics.

Frank Barrow of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" wrote that the film was "daring and unusual in concept." Joseph Gelmis of "<a href="Newsday">Newsday</a>" wrote that "the film's principal reward is a visual experience unlike anything that other animated features are doing at the moment." <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> called Bakshi's effort a "mixed blessing" and "an entirely respectable, occasionally impressive job ... [which] still falls far short of the charm and sweep of the original story." <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called the film "both numbing and impressive."

<a href="David%20Denby%20%28film%20critic%29">David Denby</a> of "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine felt that the film would not make sense to viewers who had not previously read the book. Denby wrote that the film was too dark and lacked humor, concluding that "The lurid, meaningless violence of this movie left me exhausted and sickened by the end." <a href="Michael%20Barrier%20%28historian%29">Michael Barrier</a>, an animation historian, described "The Lord of The Rings" as one of two films that demonstrated "that Bakshi was utterly lacking in the artistic self-discipline that might have permitted him to outgrow his limitations."

The film has been cited as an influence on director <a href="Peter%20Jackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s <a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%28film%20series%29">"The Lord of the Rings" film trilogy</a>. After initially denying having seen Bakshi's film, Jackson admitted to having first encountered "The Lord of the Rings" via Bakshi's film, stating that the film was a "brave and ambitious attempt." In another interview, Jackson stated that he "enjoyed [the film] and wanted to know more." Bakshi is quoted as saying "Peter Jackson did say that the first film inspired him to go on and do the series, but that happened after I was bitching and moaning to a lot of interviewers that he said at the beginning that he never saw the movie. I thought that was kind of fucked up." On the <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> for the DVD release of "", Jackson acknowledges one shot, a low angle of a hobbit at Bilbo's birthday party shouting "Proudfeet!", as an intentional homage to Bakshi's film.

Bakshi is quoted as saying that he had "mixed feeling[s]" about Jackson's adaptations, although he had not seen the films. "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, thanked me, or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] [Nor] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget."

Brill railway station

Brill railway station was the terminus of a small railway line in <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, England, known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Brill Tramway</a>. Built and owned by the <a href="Richard%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">3rd Duke of Buckingham</a>, it was later operated by London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a>, and in 1933 briefly became one of the two north-western termini of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a>, despite being and over two hours' travelling time from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>.

Approximately of a mile (1.2 km) north of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a>, the station was opened in March 1872 as the result of lobbying from local residents and businesses. As the line was cheaply built and <a href="grading%20%28engineering%29">ungraded</a> and the <a href="locomotive">locomotive</a>s were of poor quality, services were very slow, initially taking 1 hour 45 minutes to traverse the six miles (10 km) from Brill to the <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> with <a href="Main%20line%20%28railway%29">main line</a> services at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>. Although serving a lightly populated area and little-used by passengers, the station was a significant point for freight traffic, particularly as a carrier of milk from the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire to <a href="Aylesbury">Aylesbury</a> and London. A <a href="brickworks">brickworks</a> was also attached to the station, but it proved unable to compete with nearby rivals and closed within a few years of opening.

During the 1890s, plans were made to extend the tramway to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, but the scheme was abandoned. Instead, the operation of the line was taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1899, and the line became one of the railway's two north-western termini. It was upgraded and better-quality locomotives were introduced making the journey time three times faster.

In 1933 the Metropolitan Railway was taken into public ownership and became the <a href="Metropolitan%20line">Metropolitan line</a> of <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Transport</a>. The management of London Transport aimed to reduce goods services, and it was felt that there was little chance of the more distant parts of the former Metropolitan Railway ever becoming viable passenger routes. The line was closed on 30 November 1935, and all buildings and infrastructure at Brill associated with the line were sold at auction. Most of the infrastructure was subsequently demolished, though three station cottages survive.

On 23 September 1868 the small <a href="Aylesbury%20and%20Buckingham%20Railway">Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway</a> (A&BR) opened, linking the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>'s station at <a href="Aylesbury%20railway%20station">Aylesbury</a> to the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a>'s <a href="Varsity%20Line">Oxford to Bletchley line</a> at <a href="Verney%20Junction%20railway%20station">Verney Junction</a>. On 1 September 1894, London's <a href="Metropolitan%20Railway">Metropolitan Railway</a> (MR) reached Aylesbury, and shortly afterwards connected to the A&BR line, with local MR services running to Verney Junction from 1 April 1894. Through trains from the MR's London terminus at <a href="Baker%20Street%20tube%20station">Baker Street</a> began on 1 January 1897.

<a href="Richard%20Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Buckingham%20and%20Chandos">Richard Temple-Nugent-Brydges-Chandos-Grenville, 3rd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos</a>, had long had an interest in railways, and had served as chairman of the London and North Western Railway from 1852 until 1861. In the early 1870s he decided to build a <a href="light%20railway">light railway</a> to transport freight from his estates in Buckinghamshire to the A&BR's line at <a href="Quainton%20Road%20railway%20station">Quainton Road</a>.
The first stage of the route, known as the <a href="Brill%20Tramway">Wotton Tramway</a>, was a line from Quainton Road via <a href="Wotton%20%28Metropolitan%20Railway%29%20railway%20station">Wotton</a> to a coal siding at <a href="Kingswood%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Kingswood</a>, and opened on 1 April 1871. Intended for use by <a href="Horsecar">horse trams</a>, the line was built with <a href="Baulk%20road">longitudinal sleepers</a>, to avoid horses tripping.

Lobbying from the nearby town of <a href="Brill%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Brill</a> for the introduction of passenger services on the line led to an extension from Wotton to a new terminus at the foot of <a href="Brill%20Hill">Brill Hill</a>, north of the hilltop town of Brill itself, in March 1872. Two <a href="mixed%20train">mixed train</a>s each day ran in each direction. With the extension to Brill opened the line was renamed the Brill Tramway. The Duke bought two <a href="Aveling%20and%20Porter">Aveling and Porter</a> <a href="traction%20engine">traction engine</a>s modified to work as locomotives, each with a top speed of , although a speed limit of was enforced.

The Duke died in 1889. In 1894, the <a href="trustee">trustee</a>s of his <a href="estate%20%28law%29">estate</a> set up the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company (O&ATC) with the intention of extending the line from Brill to <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, but the extension beyond Brill was never built. The MR leased the Brill Tramway from 1 December 1899, although the line continued to be owned by the O&ATC.

Brill was a small town of 1,400 people when the line opened, and owing to the town's hilltop setting the station was of a mile (1.2 km) from Brill itself. Brill railway station was small, with a single low platform. At its opening there was one station building, which served as the freight depot, passenger terminal, and ticket office. Next to it was a <a href="Siding%20%28rail%29">siding</a> that led to a <a href="cattle%20pen">cattle pen</a>. Two cottages for station staff were built near the station in 1871. A third cottage across the road from the station was built in 1885, possibly to serve as an office. After the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the MR introduced a single <a href="Brown%2C%20Marshalls%20and%20Co.%20Ltd.">Brown Marshall</a> passenger carriage on the line; at this time, a small wooden hut was added to the station to serve as a ticket office and waiting room and a short section of platform was raised to conventional height to allow access to the higher doors on the new carriage.

From 1872 to 1894 the station was served by two passenger trains per day, and from 1895 to 1899 the number was increased to three per day. Following the 1899 transfer of services to the Metropolitan Railway, the station was served by four trains per day until its closure in 1935. Limited by poor-quality locomotives and <a href="grading%20%28engineering%29">ungraded</a>, cheaply laid track which followed the contours of the hills, and with five intermediate stops to pick up and set down goods, passengers and livestock, trains ran very slowly; in 1887 trains needed 1 hour 45 minutes to travel the six miles from Brill to the <a href="junction%20station">junction station</a> at Quainton Road. Improvements to the line carried out at the time of the transfer to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad, and the use of the MR's better-quality rolling stock, reduced the journey time from Brill to Quainton Road to between 32 and 36 minutes.

Serving a lightly populated area, and with trains travelling only marginally quicker than walking pace, Brill station saw relatively little use by passengers; in 1932, the last year of private operation, Brill station (and the nearby halt at <a href="Wood%20Siding%20railway%20station">Wood Siding</a>) saw only 3,272 passenger journeys and raised only £191 (about £ in 2019) in passenger receipts.

Although little-used by passengers, Brill station was valuable as a relatively rapid link between the dairy farms of Buckinghamshire and the markets of Aylesbury and London; around 30 carts per day would deliver milk to Brill station for the first train each morning. There was also a small amount of coal traffic to the station; Brill coal dealer George Green received three coal wagons per month. In addition, a storehouse at the station held beer supplied by the breweries of <a href="Brackley">Brackley</a> and Aylesbury. Bricks and tiles from the brick and tile factories of Brill were used in the construction of <a href="Waddesdon%20Manor">Waddesdon Manor</a>, near the eastern end of the Brill Tramway, between 1874 and 1889.

In 1885 the Duke of Buckingham opened a modern brickworks near Brill station, with a dedicated siding, and in 1895 his heir <a href="William%20Temple-Gore-Langton%2C%204th%20Earl%20Temple%20of%20Stowe">William Temple-Gore-Langton, 4th Earl Temple of Stowe</a>, expanded the brickworks, which became the Brill Brick & Tile Works, using the Brill Tramway to deliver bricks to the main line at Quainton Road. With the connection to Oxford and the upgrading of the rail line abandoned, Brill Brick & Tile Works was unable to compete with the nearby brickworks at <a href="Calvert%2C%20Buckinghamshire">Calvert</a>, and soon closed. The building was taken over by the Fenemore workshop, making <a href="Loader%20%28equipment%29">hay loaders</a>, before being converted into a <a href="Lumber%20yard">timber yard</a> in the 1920s.

On 1 July 1933 the Metropolitan Railway, along with London's other underground railways except for the small <a href="Waterloo%20%26amp%3B%20City%20Railway">Waterloo & City Railway</a>, was taken into public ownership as part of the newly formed <a href="London%20Passenger%20Transport%20Board">London Passenger Transport Board</a> (LPTB). Thus, despite it being and over two hours' travel from the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>, Brill station became a terminus of the <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> network. <a href="Frank%20Pick">Frank Pick</a>, Managing Director of the <a href="Underground%20Electric%20Railways%20Company%20of%20London">Underground Group</a> from 1928 and the Chief Executive of the LPTB, aimed to move the network away from freight services, and saw the lines beyond Aylesbury via Quainton Road to Brill and Verney Junction as having little future as financially viable passenger routes, concluding that over £2,000 (about £ in 2019) would be saved by closing the Brill Tramway. As a consequence, the LPTB decided to withdraw all passenger services beyond Aylesbury. The Brill Tramway was closed on 1 December 1935; the last services ran on 30 November.
Upon the withdrawal of London Transport services the lease expired, and the railway and stations reverted to the Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company. With no funds and no rolling stock of its own, the O&ATC was unable to operate the line, and on 2 April 1936 the entire infrastructure of the line was sold at auction. The former <a href="goods%20shed">goods shed</a> at Brill sold for £7 10s (about £ in 2019), and a railway-owned house attached to Brill station fetched £350 (about £ in 2019). All buildings in Brill associated with the railway station have been demolished, with the exception of the station cottages, one of which is now called "Sleepers". The station site is now largely open fields, and the site of the brickworks is a light <a href="industrial%20park">industrial park</a> known as the "Tramway Business Park".

Night (book)

Night (1960) is a work by <a href="Elie%20Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a> about his experience with his father in the <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi German</a> concentration camps at <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a> and <a href="Buchenwald%20concentration%20camp">Buchenwald</a> in 1944–1945, at the height of the <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> toward the end of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. In just over 100 pages of sparse and fragmented narrative, Wiesel writes about the <a href="death%20of%20God">death of God</a> and his own increasing disgust with humanity, reflected in the inversion of the parent–child relationship, as his father declines to a helpless state and Wiesel becomes his resentful teenage caregiver. "If only I could get rid of this dead weight ... Immediately I felt ashamed of myself, ashamed forever." In "Night" everything is inverted, every value destroyed. "Here there are no fathers, no brothers, no friends", a <a href="Kapo%20%28concentration%20camp%29">kapo</a> tells him. "Everyone lives and dies for himself alone."

Wiesel was 16 when Buchenwald was liberated by the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> in April 1945, too late for his father, who died after a beating while Wiesel lay silently on the bunk above for fear of being beaten too. He moved to Paris after the war and in 1954 completed an 862-page manuscript in <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a> about his experiences, published in Argentina as the 245-page "Un di velt hot geshvign" ("And the World Remained Silent"). The novelist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mauriac">François Mauriac</a> helped him find a French publisher. <a href="Les%20%C3%89ditions%20de%20Minuit">Les Éditions de Minuit</a> published 178 pages as "La Nuit" in 1958, and in 1960 <a href="Hill%20%26amp%3B%20Wang">Hill & Wang</a> in New York published a 116-page translation as "Night".

Fifty years later the book had been translated into 30 languages, and now ranks as one of the bedrocks of . It remains unclear how much of "Night" is memoir. Wiesel called it his deposition, but scholars have had difficulty approaching it as an unvarnished account. The literary critic Ruth Franklin writes that the pruning of the text from Yiddish to French transformed an angry historical account into a work of art.

"Night" is the first in a trilogy—"Night", "<a href="Dawn%20%28Wiesel%20novel%29">Dawn</a>", "<a href="Day%20%28Wiesel%20novel%29">Day</a>"—marking Wiesel's transition during and after the Holocaust from darkness to light, according to the Jewish tradition of beginning a new day at nightfall. "In "Night"," he said, "I wanted to show the end, the finality of the event. Everything came to an end—man, history, literature, religion, God. There was nothing left. And yet we begin again with night."

<a href="Elie%20Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a> was born on 30 September 1928 in <a href="Sighetu%20Marma%C8%9Biei">Sighet</a>, a town in the <a href="Carpathian%20Mountains">Carpathian mountains</a> of <a href="northern%20Transylvania">northern Transylvania</a>, to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, née Feig. The family lived in a community of 10,000–20,000 mostly <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox Jews</a>. Northern Transylvania had been <a href="Second%20Vienna%20Award">annexed</a> by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews were already in place, but the period Wiesel discusses at the beginning of the book, 1941–1943, was a relatively calm one for the Jewish population.

That changed at midnight on Sunday, 18 March 1944, with the <a href="Operation%20Margarethe">invasion of Hungary</a> by Nazi Germany, and the arrival in Budapest of SS-Obersturmbannführer <a href="Adolf%20Eichmann">Adolf Eichmann</a> to oversee the deportation of the country's Jews. From 5 April Jews over the age of six had to wear a 10 x 10 cm (3.8 x 3.8 in) <a href="yellow%20badge">yellow badge</a> on the upper-left side of their coats or jackets. Jews had to declare the value of their property, and were forbidden from moving home, travelling, owning cars or radios, listening to foreign radio stations, or using the telephone. Jewish authors could no longer be published, their books were removed from libraries, and Jewish civil servants, journalists and lawyers were sacked.

As the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a> prepared for the <a href="Operation%20Overlord">liberation of Europe</a>, the mass deportations began at a rate of four trains a day from Hungary to the <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz concentration camp</a> in <a href="Occupation%20of%20Poland%20%281939%E2%80%9345%29">German-occupied Poland</a>, each train carrying around 3,000 people. Between 15 May and 8 July 1944, 437,402 Hungarian Jews are recorded as having been sent there on 147 trains, most gassed on arrival. The transports comprised most of the Jewish population outside Budapest, the Hungarian capital.

Between 16 May and 27 June, 131,641 Jews were deported from northern Transylvania. Wiesel, his parents and sisters—older sisters Hilda and Beatrice and seven-year-old Tzipora—were among them. On arrival Jews were "selected" for the death or forced labour; to be sent to the left meant work, to the right, the gas chamber. Sarah and Tzipora were sent to the gas chamber. Hilda and Beatrice survived, separated from the rest of the family. Wiesel and Chlomo managed to stay together, surviving forced labour and a <a href="Death%20marches%20%28Holocaust%29">death march</a> to another concentration camp, <a href="Buchenwald%20concentration%20camp">Buchenwald</a>, near <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>. Chlomo died there in January 1945, three months before the <a href="6th%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">6th Armored Division</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> arrived to liberate the camp.

"Night" opens in Sighet in 1941. The book's narrator is Eliezer, an Orthodox Jewish teenager who studies the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> by day, and by night "weep[s] over the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%28AD%2070%29">destruction of the Temple</a>". To the disapproval of his father, Eliezer spends time discussing the <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> with Moshe the <a href="Beadle">Beadle</a>, caretaker of the <a href="Hasidic%20Judaism">Hasidic</a> <a href="shtiebel">shtiebel</a> (house of prayer).

In June 1941 the Hungarian government expelled Jews unable to prove their citizenship. Moshe is crammed onto a cattle train and taken to Poland. He manages to escape, saved by God, he believes, so that he might save the Jews of Sighet. He returns to the village to tell what he calls the "story of his own death", running from one house to the next: ""Jews, listen to me! It's all I ask of you. No money. No pity. Just listen to me!""

When the train crossed into Poland, he tells them, it was taken over by the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>, the German secret police. The Jews were transferred to trucks, then driven to a forest in <a href="Galicia%20%28Central%20Europe%29">Galicia</a>, near Kolomaye, where they were forced to dig pits. When they had finished, each prisoner had to approach the hole, present his neck, and was shot. Babies were thrown into the air and used as targets by machine gunners. He tells them about Malka, the young girl who took three days to die, and Tobias, the tailor who begged to be killed before his sons; and how he, Moshe, was shot in the leg and taken for dead. But the Jews of Sighet would not listen, making Moshe "Night's" first <a href="Cassandra%20%28metaphor%29">unheeded witness</a>.

The Germans arrived in Sighet around 21 March 1944, and shortly after <a href="Passover">Passover</a> (8–14 April that year) arrested the community leaders. Jews had to hand over their valuables, were not allowed to visit restaurants or leave home after six in the evening, and had to wear the <a href="Yellow%20badge%23Used%20by%20the%20Nazis">yellow star</a> at all times. Eliezer's father makes light of it:

The <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> transfer the Jews to one of two ghettos, each with its own council or "<a href="Judenrat">Judenrat</a>", which appoints Jewish police; there is also an office for social assistance, a labor committee, and a hygiene department. Eliezer's house on a corner of Serpent Street is in the larger ghetto in the town centre, so his family can stay in their home, although the windows on the non-ghetto side have to be boarded up. He is happy at first: "We should no longer have before our eyes those hostile faces, those hate-laden stares. ... The general opinion was that we were going to remain in the ghetto until the end of the war, until the arrival of the Red Army. Then everything would be as before. It was neither German nor Jew who ruled the ghetto—it was illusion."

In May 1944 the "Judenrat" is told the ghettos will be closed with immediate effect and the residents deported. Eliezer's family is moved at first to the smaller ghetto, but they are not told their final destination, only that they may each take a few personal belongings. The Hungarian police, wielding truncheons and rifle butts, march Eliezer's neighbours through the streets. "It was from that moment that I began to hate them, and my hate is still the only link between us today."

Eliezer and his family are crammed into a closed cattle wagon with 80 others. On the third night one woman, Madame Schächter—"Night's" second unheeded witness—becomes hysterical, screaming that she can see flames, until the others beat her. Men and women are separated on arrival at <a href="Auschwitz-Birkenau">Auschwitz-Birkenau</a>, the extermination camp within the Auschwitz complex. Eliezer and his father are "selected" to go to the left, which meant forced labour; his mother, Hilda, Beatrice and Tzipora to the right, the gas chamber. Hilda and Beatrice managed to survive.

The remainder of "Night" describes Eliezer's efforts not to be parted from his father, not even to lose sight of him; his grief and shame at witnessing his father's decline into helplessness; and as their relationship changes and the young man becomes the older man's caregiver, his resentment and guilt, because his father's existence threatens his own. The stronger Eliezer's need to survive, the weaker the bonds that tie him to other people.

His loss of faith in human relationships is mirrored in his loss of faith in God. During the first night, as he and his father wait in line, he watches a lorry deliver its load of children into the fire. While his father recites the <a href="Kaddish">Kaddish</a>, the Jewish prayer for the dead—Wiesel writes that in the long history of the Jews, he does not know whether people have ever recited the prayer for the dead for themselves—Eliezer considers throwing himself against the electric fence. At that moment he and his father are ordered to go to their barracks. But Eliezer is already destroyed. "[T]he student of the Talmud, the child that I was, had been consumed in the flames. There remained only a shape that looked like me." There follows a passage that Ellen Fine writes contains the main themes of "Night"—the death of God and innocence, and the "défaite du moi", or dissolution of the self, a recurring "motif" in Holocaust literature:

With the loss of self goes Eliezer's sense of time: "I glanced at my father. How he had changed! ... So much had happened within such a few hours that I had lost all sense of time. When had we left our houses? And the ghetto? And the train? Was it only a week? One night – "one single night"?"

In or around August 1944 Eliezer and his father are transferred from Birkenau to the work camp at Monowitz (also known as Buna and Auschwitz III), their lives reduced to the avoidance of violence and the search for food. Their only joy is when the Americans bomb the camp. God is not lost to Eliezer entirely. During the hanging of a child, which the camp is forced to watch, he hears someone ask: "Where is God? Where is he?" Not heavy enough for the weight of his body to break his neck, the boy dies slowly. Wiesel files past him, sees his tongue still pink and his eyes clear.

Fine writes that this is the central event in "Night", a religious sacrifice—the <a href="binding%20of%20Isaac">binding of Isaac</a> and <a href="crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucifixion of Jesus</a>—described by <a href="Alfred%20Kazin">Alfred Kazin</a> as the literal death of God. Afterwards the inmates celebrate <a href="Rosh%20Hashanah">Rosh Hashanah</a>, the Jewish new year, but Eliezer cannot take part: "Blessed be God's name? Why, but why would I bless Him? Every fiber in me rebelled."

In January 1945, with the Soviet army approaching, the Germans decide to flee, taking 60,000 inmates on a death march to concentration camps in Germany. Eliezer and his father are marched to <a href="Gliwice">Gleiwitz</a> to be put on a freight train to Buchenwald, a camp near <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>, 350 miles (563 km) from Auschwitz.

Resting in a shed after marching , Rabbi Eliahou asks if anyone has seen his son. They had stuck together for three years, "always near each other, for suffering, for blows, for the ration of bread, for prayer", but the rabbi had lost sight of him in the crowd and was now scratching through the snow looking for his son's corpse. ""I hadn't any strength left for running. And my son didn't notice. That's all I know"." Eliezer does not tell the man that his son had indeed noticed his father limping, and had run faster, letting the distance between them grow: "And, in spite of myself, a prayer rose in my heart, to that God in whom I no longer believed. My God, Lord of the Universe, give me strength never to do what Rabbi Eliahou's son has done."</div>

The inmates spend two days and nights in Gleiwitz locked inside cramped barracks without food, water or heat, sleeping on top of one another, so that each morning the living wake with the dead underneath them. There is more marching to the train station and onto a cattle wagon with no roof. They travel for ten days and nights, with only the snow falling on them for water. Of the 100 in Eliezer's wagon, 12 survive the journey. The living make space by throwing the dead onto the tracks:

The Germans are waiting with megaphones and orders to head for a hot bath. Wiesel is desperate for the heat of the water, but his father sinks into the snow. "I could have wept with rage ... I showed him the corpses all around him; they too had wanted to rest here ... I yelled against the wind ... I felt I was not arguing with him, but with death itself, with the death he had already chosen." An alert sounds, the camp lights go out, and Eliezer, exhausted, follows the crowd to the barracks, leaving his father behind. He wakes at dawn on a wooden bunk, remembering that he has a father, and goes in search of him.

His father is in another block, sick with dysentery. The other men in his bunk, a Frenchman and a Pole, attack him because he can no longer go outside to relieve himself. Eliezer is unable to protect him. "Another wound to the heart, another hate, another reason for living lost." Begging for water one night from his bunk, where he has lain for a week, Chlomo is beaten on the head with a truncheon by an SS officer for making too much noise. Eliezer lies in the bunk above and does nothing for fear of being beaten too. He hears his father make a rattling noise, "Eliezer". In the morning, 29 January 1945, he finds another man in his father's place. The Kapos had come before dawn and taken Chlomo to the crematorium.

Chlomo missed his freedom by three months. The Soviets had liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were making their way towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is transferred to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and they are to be moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a <a href="Buchenwald%20Resistance">resistance movement</a> inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives at the gates, and behind it the <a href="6th%20Armored%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">Sixth Armored Division</a> of the United States Third Army.

Wiesel wanted to move to <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a> after his release, but because of British immigration restrictions was sent instead by the "Oeuvre au Secours aux Enfants" (Children's Rescue Service) to Belgium, then Normandy. In Normandy he learned that his two older sisters, Hilda and Beatrice, had survived. From 1947 to 1950 he studied the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>, philosophy and literature at the <a href="University%20of%20Paris">Sorbonne</a>, where he was influenced by the <a href="Existentialism">existentialists</a>, attending lectures by <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> and <a href="Martin%20Buber">Martin Buber</a>. He also taught <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, and worked as a translator for the Yiddish weekly "Zion in Kamf". In 1948, when he was 19, he was sent to Israel as a war correspondent by the French newspaper "L'arche", and after the Sorbonne became chief foreign correspondent of the Tel Aviv newspaper "<a href="Yedioth%20Ahronoth">Yedioth Ahronoth</a>".

Wiesel wrote in 1979 that he kept his story to himself for ten years. In 1954 he wanted to interview the French prime minister, <a href="Pierre%20Mend%C3%A8s-France">Pierre Mendès-France</a>, and approached the novelist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mauriac">François Mauriac</a>, a friend of Mendès-France, for an introduction. Wiesel wrote that Mauriac kept mentioning Jesus: "Whatever I would ask – Jesus. Finally, I said, 'What about Mendès-France?' He said that Mendès-France, like Jesus, was suffering ..."

Wiesel started writing on board a ship to Brazil, where he had been assigned to cover Christian missionaries within Jewish communities, and by the end of the journey had completed an 862-page manuscript. He was introduced on the ship to Yehudit Moretzka, a Yiddish singer travelling with Mark Turkov, a publisher of Yiddish texts. Turkov asked if he could read Wiesel's manuscript. It is unclear who edited the text for publication. Wiesel wrote in "All Rivers Run to the Sea" (1995) that he handed Turkov his only copy and that it was never returned, but also that he (Wiesel) "cut down the original manuscript from 862 pages to the 245 of the published Yiddish edition."

Turkov's "Tzentral Varband für Polishe Yidn in Argentina" (Central Union of Polish Jews in Argentina) published the book in 1956 in Buenos Aires as the 245-page "Un di velt hot geshvign" ("And the World Remained Silent"). It was the 117th book in a 176-volume series of Yiddish memoirs of Poland and the war, "Dos poylishe yidntum" ("Polish Jewry", 1946–1966). <a href="Ruth%20Wisse">Ruth Wisse</a> writes that "Un di Velt Hot Geshvign" stood out from the rest of the series, which survivors wrote as memorials to their dead, as a "highly selective and isolating literary narrative."

Wiesel translated "Un di Velt Hot Geshvign" into French and in 1955 sent it to Mauriac. Even with Mauriac's help they had difficulty finding a publisher; Wiesel said they found it too morbid. of <a href="Les%20%C3%89ditions%20de%20Minuit">Les Éditions de Minuit</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>'s publisher, agreed to handle it. Lindon edited the text down to 178 pages. Published as "La Nuit", a title chosen by Lindon, it had a preface by Mauriac and was dedicated to Chlomo, Sarah and Tzipora.

Wiesel's New York agent, <a href="Georges%20Borchardt">Georges Borchardt</a>, encountered the same difficulty finding a publisher in the United States. In 1960 Arthur Wang of <a href="Hill%20%26amp%3B%20Wang">Hill & Wang</a> in New York—who Wiesel writes "believed in literature as others believe in God"—paid a $100 pro-forma advance and published that year a 116-page English translation by Stella Rodway as "Night". The first 18 months saw 1,046 copies sell at $3 each, and it took three years to sell the first print run of 3,000 copies, but the book attracted interest from reviewers, leading to television interviews and meetings with literary figures like <a href="Saul%20Bellow">Saul Bellow</a>.

By 1997 "Night" was selling 300,000 copies a year in the United States. By 2011 it had sold six million copies in that country, and was available in 30 languages. Sales increased in January 2006 when it was chosen for <a href="Oprah%27s%20Book%20Club">Oprah's Book Club</a>. Republished with a new translation by Marion Wiesel, Wiesel's wife, and a new preface by Wiesel, it sat at no. 1 in "The New York Times" bestseller list for paperback non-fiction for 18 months from 13 February 2006, until the newspaper decided to remove it. It became the club's third bestseller to date, with over two million sales of the Book Club edition by May 2011.

Reviewers have had difficulty reading "Night" as an eyewitness account. It has been categorized as a novel, autobiography, <a href="autobiographical%20novel">autobiographical novel</a>, non-fictional novel, semi-fictional memoir, fictional-autobiographical novel, fictionalized autobiographical memoir and memoir-novel. Ellen Fine described it as "témoignage" (testimony). Wiesel called it his deposition.

Literary critic Ruth Franklin writes that "Night"s impact stems from its minimalist construction. The 1956 Yiddish version, at 865 pages, was a long and angry historical work. In preparation for the French edition, Wiesel's editors pruned without mercy. Franklin argues that the power of the narrative was achieved at the cost of literal truth, and that to insist that the work is purely factual is to ignore its literary sophistication. Holocaust scholar Lawrence Langer argues similarly that Wiesel evokes, rather than describes: "Wiesel's account is ballasted with the freight of fiction: scenic organization, characterization through dialogue, periodic climaxes, elimination of superfluous or repetitive episodes, and especially an ability to arouse the empathy of his readers, which is an elusive ideal of the writer bound by fidelity to fact."

Franklin writes that "Night" is the account of the 15-year-old Eliezer, a "semi-fictional construct", told by the 25-year-old Elie Wiesel. This allows the 15-year-old to tell his story from "the post-Holocaust vantage point" of "Night's" readers. In a comparative analysis of the Yiddish and French texts, Naomi Seidman, professor of Jewish culture, concludes that there are two survivors in Wiesel's writing, a Yiddish and French. In re-writing rather than simply translating "Un di Velt Hot Geshvign", Wiesel replaced an angry survivor who regards "testimony as a refutation of what the Nazis did to the Jews," with one "haunted by death, whose primary complaint is directed against God ..." "Night" transformed the Holocaust into a religious event.

Seidman argues that the Yiddish version was for Jewish readers, who wanted to hear about revenge, but the anger was removed for the largely Christian readership of the French translation. In the Yiddish edition, for example, when Buchenwald was liberated: "Early the next day Jewish boys ran off to Weimar to steal clothing and potatoes. And to rape German "<a href="shiksa">shiksa</a>s" ["un tsu fargvaldikn daytshe shikses"]." In the 1958 French and 1960 English editions, this became: "On the following morning, some of the young men went to Weimar to get some potatoes and clothes—and to sleep with girls ["coucher avec des filles"]. But of revenge, not a sign."

Oprah Winfrey's promotion of "Night" came at a difficult time for the genre of memoir, Franklin writes, after a previous book-club author, <a href="James%20Frey">James Frey</a>, was found to have fabricated parts of his autobiography, "<a href="A%20Million%20Little%20Pieces">A Million Little Pieces</a>" (2003). She argues that Winfrey's choice of "Night" may have been intended to restore the book club's credibility.

Wiesel wrote in 1967 about a visit to a <a href="Rebbe">Rebbe</a>, a <a href="Hasidic%20Judaism">Hasidic</a> rabbi, he had not seen for 20 years. The Rebbe is upset to learn that Wiesel has become a writer, and wants to know what he writes. "Stories," Wiesel tells him, " ... true stories":

Russell T Davies

Stephen Russell Davies (born 27 April 1963), better known as Russell T Davies, is a Welsh screenwriter and television producer whose works include "<a href="Queer%20as%20Folk%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Queer as Folk</a>", "<a href="Bob%20%26amp%3B%20Rose">Bob & Rose</a>", "<a href="The%20Second%20Coming%20%28TV%20serial%29">The Second Coming</a>", "<a href="Casanova%20%282005%20TV%20serial%29">Casanova</a>", the 2005 revival of the classic British science fiction series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>", and the trilogy "<a href="Cucumber%20%28TV%20series%29">Cucumber</a>", "<a href="Tofu%20%28web%20series%29">Tofu</a>", and "<a href="Banana%20%28TV%20series%29">Banana</a>".

Born in <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a>, Davies aspired to work as a <a href="comic%20artist">comic artist</a> in his adult life, until a careers advisor at <a href="Olchfa%20School">Olchfa School</a> suggested that he study English literature; he consequently focused on a career of play- and screen-writing. After he graduated from Oxford University, Davies joined the <a href="CBBC">BBC's children's department</a> in 1985 on a part-time basis and worked in varying positions, including writing and producing two series, "<a href="Dark%20Season">Dark Season</a>" and "<a href="Century%20Falls">Century Falls</a>". He left the BBC in the early 1990s to work for <a href="Granada%20Television">Granada Television</a> and later became a freelance writer.

Davies moved into writing adult television dramas in 1994. His early scripts generally explored concepts of religion and sexuality among various backdrops: "<a href="Revelations%20%281994%20TV%20series%29">Revelations</a>" was a soap opera about organised religion and featured a lesbian vicar; "<a href="Springhill%20%28TV%20series%29">Springhill</a>" was a soap drama about a Catholic family in contemporary <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>; "<a href="The%20Grand%20%28TV%20series%29">The Grand</a>" explored society's opinion of subjects such as prostitution, abortion and homosexuality during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>; and "Queer as Folk", his first prolific series, recreated his experiences in the <a href="Canal%20Street%20%28Manchester%29">Manchester gay scene</a>. Following this, his adult series in the 2000s include "Bob & Rose", which portrayed a gay man who fell in love with a woman; "The Second Coming", which focused on the <a href="Second%20Coming%20of%20Christ">second coming</a> and <a href="deicide">deicide</a> of <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> from a mostly non-religious point of view; "<a href="Mine%20All%20Mine">Mine All Mine</a>", a comedy about a family who discover they own the entire city of Swansea; and "Casanova", an adaptation of <a href="Histoire%20de%20ma%20vie">the complete memoirs</a> of Venetian adventurer <a href="Giacomo%20Casanova">Giacomo Casanova</a>.

He revived and ran "Doctor Who" after a sixteen-year hiatus, with <a href="Christopher%20Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>, and later <a href="David%20Tennant">David Tennant</a>, in the title role. Davies' tenure as <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> of the show oversaw a surge in popularity that led to the production of two <a href="spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-off</a> series, "<a href="Torchwood">Torchwood</a>" and "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>", and the revival of the Saturday prime-time dramas as a profitable venture for production companies. Davies was appointed an OBE in 2008 for services to drama, which coincided with his announcement that he would step down from "Doctor Who" as the show's executive producer with his final script, "<a href="The%20End%20of%20Time%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The End of Time</a>" (2009–10). Davies moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a> in 2009, where he oversaw production of "" and the fifth and final series of "The Sarah Jane Adventures".

After his partner developed cancer in late 2011, Davies returned to the UK, and co-created the <a href="CBBC">CBBC</a> drama, "<a href="Wizards%20vs%20Aliens">Wizards vs Aliens</a>", which aired from 2012 to 2014. He created "Cucumber", a <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> series about middle-aged gay men in the Manchester gay scene; "Banana", an <a href="E4%20%28TV%20channel%29">E4</a> series about young LGBT people in the "Cucumber" universe; and "Tofu", an online documentary series available on <a href="All%204">All 4</a> discussing issues which have arisen in the sister series, modern sex and sexuality with the cast and public. All three shows aired in 2015 for a single series.

Stephen Russell Davies was born on 27 April 1963 at Mount Pleasant Hospital in <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a>. His father, Vivian Davies (1925–2015), and his mother, Barbara (1929–1999), were teachers. Davies was the youngest of three children and their only son. Because he was born by <a href="caesarean%20section">C-section</a>, his mother was placed on a morphine drip and was institutionalised after an overdose resulted in a <a href="psychotic%20episode">psychotic episode</a>. He described his mother's experience as "literally ... like science fiction" and an early inspiration for his writing career. As a child, Davies was almost always referred to by his middle name. He grew up in a household that "never switched the TV off" until after <a href="sign-off%23United%20Kingdom">closedown</a>, and he subsequently became immersed in dramas such as "<a href="I%2C%20Claudius">I, Claudius</a>" and "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". One of his first memories, at the age of three, was the 1966 "Doctor Who" serial "<a href="The%20Tenth%20Planet">The Tenth Planet</a>". He was also an avid cartoonist and comics enthusiast, and purchased series such as "<a href="Asterix">Asterix</a>" and "<a href="Peanuts">Peanuts</a>".

Davies attended the local Tycoch Primary School in <a href="Sketty">Sketty</a> and enrolled at <a href="Olchfa%20School">Olchfa Comprehensive School</a> aged 11. In his first year, the main school buildings were closed off for renovation after inspectors discovered that the cement used in construction had caused other public buildings to collapse. Lessons were instead held in portable buildings, which influenced Davies' imagination to create mystery, science-fiction, and conspiracy thriller stories about the main building. He also immersed himself in books such as "<a href="Sons%20and%20Lovers">Sons and Lovers</a>" by <a href="D.%20H.%20Lawrence">D. H. Lawrence</a> and "The Crystal Mouse" by Babs H Deal; the latter influenced him so much he could "see it echoing in anything" he wrote. At age 14, he auditioned for and joined the newly formed <a href="West%20Glamorgan">West Glamorgan</a> Youth Theatre Company (WGYTC). The group's founder and director, Godfrey Evans, considered him to be "a total all-rounder" who was talented and popular with the other students. Working with the group allowed him to define his sexual identity, and he embarked on a several-month relationship with fellow youth actor Rhian Morgan. He later <a href="coming%20out">came out</a> as homosexual in his teenage years.

In 1979, Davies completed his <a href="O-Levels">O-Levels</a> and stayed at Olchfa with the ambition to study English literature at the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>; he abandoned his aspirations of becoming a comic artist after a careers advisor convinced him that his <a href="colour-blindness">colour-blindness</a> would make that path unlikely. During his studies, he participated in the WGYTC's assignments to create <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh-language</a> drama to be performed at the <a href="National%20Eisteddfod%20of%20Wales">National Eisteddfod of Wales</a>, including "Pair Dadeni", a play based on the <a href="Mabinogion">Mabinogion</a> myth cycle, and "Perthyn", a drama about community belonging and identity in early-1980s West Glamorgan. In 1981, he was accepted by <a href="Worcester%20College%2C%20Oxford">Worcester College, Oxford</a> to study English literature. At Oxford, he realised that he was enamoured with the narrative aspect of fiction, especially <a href="History%20of%20modern%20literature%2319th%20century">19th-century literature</a> such as <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>.

Davies continued to submit scripts to the WGYT during his studies at Oxford, including "Box", a play about the influence of television that Evans noted contained Davies' penchants for misdirecting the audience and mixing comedy and drama; "In Her Element", which centred on the animation of still objects; and "Hothouse", an <a href="Alan%20Bennett">Alan Bennett</a>-inspired piece about internal politics in an advertising office. In 1984, he made his final performance for the WGYT and signed up for a course in Theatre Studies at <a href="Cardiff%20University">Cardiff University</a> after graduating from Oxford. He worked sporadically for the <a href="Sherman%20Theatre">Sherman Theatre</a>'s publicity department and claimed <a href="Jobseeker%27s%20Allowance">unemployment benefit</a> in the interim. In 1985, Davies began his professional television career after a friend suggested that he should talk to a television producer who was seeking a temporary graphic artist for the children's show "<a href="Why%20Don%27t%20You%3F">Why Don't You?</a>"

Davies was taken on as a member of the <a href="BBC%20Wales">BBC Wales</a> <a href="CBBC">children's</a> department in 1985 and given one-day contracts and commissions, such as illustrating for "Why Don't You?" As he was only given three days of work per month by the BBC, he continued to freelance and volunteer for the Sherman Theatre. In 1986, he was approached by the "<a href="Sunday%20Sport">Sunday Sport</a>" before its launch to provide a <a href="football%20%28soccer%29">football</a>-themed daily strip; he declined because he was concerned about the pornographic content of the newspaper. He submitted a script for "<a href="Crossroads%20%28soap%20opera%29">Crossroads</a>" in response to an appeal for new writers; it was not used because the show was cancelled in 1987. He ultimately abandoned his graphic art career entirely when he realised in his early twenties that he enjoyed writing the dialogue of a comic more than creating the art.

On 1 June 1987, Davies made his first and only appearance as a television presenter on "<a href="Play%20School%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Play School</a>" alongside regular presenter <a href="Chloe%20Ashcroft">Chloë Ashcroft</a>. "Why Don't You?" line producer Peter Charlton suggested that he would "be good on camera" and advised him to take his career public. Davies was granted the opportunity for sporadic appearances over a period of six months; he hosted only one episode as a storytelling illustrator before he walked off the set and commented he was "not doing that again". The appearance remains an in-joke in the industry, and the recordings were invariably requested for <a href="wrap%20%28filmmaking%29">wrap parties</a> Davies attended.

On "Why Don't You?", Davies took on varying jobs, including researcher, director, illustrator, assistant floor manager and unofficial publicist for fan-mail. He was offered his first professional scriptwriting job in 1986 by show producer Dave Evans; he had entered Evans's office to collect his wages and was offered an extra £100 to write a replacement script. Davies' script was positively reviewed in the department and led to increasingly larger roles that culminated in a six-month contract to write for the show after it relocated to Manchester in 1988. He worked for the show for two more years and eventually became the show's producer. He oversaw an increase in drama which tripled its audience—despite the fact BBC Manchester was not permitted by the corporation to create children's dramas—which reached its climax with his last episode: a drama where the "Why Don't You?" protagonists, led by the show's longest running presenter <a href="Ben%20Slade">Ben Slade</a>, were trapped in a café by a supercomputer that tried to kill them.

While producing "Why Don't You?", Davies branched out within the children's department at <a href="BBC%20North%20West">BBC Manchester</a>: he attended directors' courses; wrote for older audiences with his contributions to "<a href="DEF%20II">DEF II</a>" and "<a href="On%20the%20Waterfront%20%28TV%20series%29">On the Waterfront</a>"; and accompanied <a href="Keith%20Chegwin">Keith Chegwin</a> to Norway to assist in the production of a children's documentary about politics. The head of the children's department, Ed Pugh, offered him the chance to produce "<a href="Breakfast%20Serials">Breakfast Serials</a>", a new series scheduled for an 8:00 am slot. "Breakfast Serials" incorporated elements of <a href="Non%20sequitur%20%28literary%20device%29">non-sequitur</a> comedy and popular culture references aimed at older pupils, such as a parody of "<a href="Land%20of%20the%20Giants">Land of the Giants</a>". He decided to leave the children's department and the BBC during the production of "Breakfast Serials": a friend called him after the first episode was transmitted and observed that he had "broadcast a joke about the juvenilia of <a href="Emily%20Bront%C3%AB">Emily Brontë</a> at eight o'clock in the morning"; the conversation caused him to reflect that he was writing for the wrong audience. Davies produced three more children's series while he pursued an adult drama career: "<a href="Dark%20Season">Dark Season</a>", "<a href="Century%20Falls">Century Falls</a>", and "<a href="Children%27s%20Ward">Children's Ward</a>".

During his tenure on "Why Don't You?", Davies oversaw the production of a story that took place in <a href="Loch%20Ness">Loch Ness</a>. The story was the precursor for his first freelance children's project: "<a href="Dark%20Season">Dark Season</a>". The show, originally called "The Adventuresome Three", would feature the "Why Don't You?" characters in a purely dramatic setting that was influenced by his childhood. He submitted the script to the head of the BBC's Children's department, <a href="Anna%20Home">Anna Home</a>, and <a href="ITV%20Granada">Granada Television</a>. Both companies were interested in producing the show with minor changes: Granada wished to produce it as one six-part serial, as opposed to Davies' plan of two three-part serials; and Home was interested in accepting the show on the condition it included a new cast of characters. He accepted Home's offer, and the show was allocated the budget and timeslot of "<a href="Maid%20Marian%20and%20her%20Merry%20Men">Maid Marian and her Merry Men</a>", which had been put on hiatus the year before.

The first three episodes of "Dark Season" feature three young teenagers in a contemporary secondary school, Reet (<a href="Kate%20Winslet">Kate Winslet</a>), Marcie (Victoria Lambert), and Tom (Ben Chandler), who discover a plot by the villain Mr Eldritch (Grant Parsons) to take over the world using school computers. Eldritch is eventually defeated by Marcie and the computer expert Professor Polzinsky (<a href="Rosalie%20Crutchley">Rosalie Crutchley</a>). The next three episodes focus on a new villain: the archaeologist Miss Pendragon (<a href="Jacqueline%20Pearce">Jacqueline Pearce</a>), later described by Davies as a "<a href="devil%20worship">devil worship</a>ping <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> lesbian", who becomes a part of the ancient supercomputer Behemoth. The two distinct plot elements converge at the end of the fifth episode, when Pendragon crashes through the school stage as Eldritch walks into the auditorium.

"Dark Season" uses concepts seen in his tenure as executive producer of "Doctor Who": "<a href="School%20Reunion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">School Reunion</a>", written by <a href="Toby%20Whithouse">Toby Whithouse</a>, shares its concept of the antagonist using computers in a <a href="comprehensive%20school">comprehensive school</a> to take over the world; "<a href="Army%20of%20Ghosts">Army of Ghosts</a>" unexpectedly brings together the series' two major villains for the final episode; and the characters of Marcie and her friends are similar, albeit unintentionally, to the structure of the <a href="Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doctor</a> and his <a href="companion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">companion</a>s. "Dark Season" was the first series that he was credited as "Russell T Davies"—the initial arbitrarily chosen to distinguish himself from <a href="Russell%20Davies">the BBC Radio 4 presenter</a>—and the first series that he was commissioned to write a novelisation: it features a more ambiguous climax and foreshadows a sequel set in an arcade similar to the one featured in "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>" serial, "<a href="Warriors%20of%20Kudlak">Warriors of Kudlak</a>".

Davies started planning a second series for "Dark Season" that followed a similar structure. The first half of the series would take part in the arcade mentioned in the novelisation, and the second would feature the appearance of psychic twins and the re-emergence of the villain Eldritch. The concepts were transferred to its spiritual successor, "<a href="Century%20Falls">Century Falls</a>", which was produced in 1993 at the request of "Dark Season" director <a href="Colin%20Cant">Colin Cant</a>. The series primarily used the "psychic twins" concept and was set in an isolated village based on those in the <a href="Yorkshire%20Dales">Yorkshire Dales</a> and the <a href="North%20York%20Moors">North York Moors</a>.

The plot of "Century Falls" is driven by a legend that no children had been born in the eponymous village for more than forty years. The lead protagonist, Tess Hunter (Catherine Sanderson), is an overweight teenager who moves to the village with her mother at the beginning of the serial. She quickly befriends the psychic Ben Naismith (<a href="Simon%20Fenton">Simon Fenton</a>) and his twin sister Carey (Emma Jane Lavin). The three teenagers examine the waterfall that gave Ben his powers and the disaster that caused the legendary infertility. The serial climaxes in a confrontation between Tess and the deity Century, who is attempting to fuse with Tess's unborn sister.

"Century Falls" is conceptually much darker than its predecessor "Dark Season" and his later work, which Davies attributed to a trend that inexperienced writers "get off on the dark stuff": in a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> interview with Davies, Home recalled that she "very nearly got into trouble because it did actually push at the boundaries which some of the powers-that-be would rather not have been pushed"; and a "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" review of the series considered the show's themes of arson, black magic, and communal fear as being "on a scale normally reserved for peak-time adult viewing". The series offered a sense of realism in its protagonist, who is not heroic and aspirational, has poor social skills, and is bluntly described by Ben as a "fat girl", a practice that the "Daily Mail" praised as "something that defies the <a href="Thought%20Police">Thought Police</a>". "Century Falls" was the last script he wrote for the BBC's children's department for fourteen years. He had begun to formulate another successor: "The Heat of the Sun", a series set over Christmas 1999 and <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Day">New Year's Day</a> 2000 that would have included the concepts of psychic powers and world domination.

While he was writing "Dark Season" and "Century Falls", Davies sought freelance projects elsewhere, including three scripts for the BBC children's comedy "<a href="ChuckleVision">ChuckleVision</a>". One venture in 1991 led him to <a href="Granada%20Television">Granada Television</a>, where he edited scripts for the ITV children's medical drama "<a href="Children%27s%20Ward">Children's Ward</a>" under the supervision of eventual "<a href="Coronation%20Street">Coronation Street</a>" producer Tony Wood and his former boss Ed Pugh. By 1992, he had been promoted to producer and oversaw an increase in discussion of larger contemporary issues. In 1993, he wrote a script featuring a teenage boy who had been infected with <a href="HIV">HIV</a> via a blood transfusion, which challenged the prevalent assumption that only gay people contracted HIV:

Davies left the role of producer in 1994, but continued to write for the series on occasion. Notably, he was requested to write the 100th episode of the series, by then called "The Ward", which aired in October 1996. Instead of celebrating the milestone, he wrote a script about a recently emerging threat: paedophiles in online chat-rooms. The episode was about an "<a href="The%20X-Files">X-Files</a>" fan who was drawn in by a paedophile's offer of a rare magazine. In the "dénouement" of the episode, the child recounts the tale of his near abduction and describes his attacker as "just a man like any other man". The episode earned Davies his first <a href="BAFTA">BAFTA</a> award: the 1997 Children's BAFTA for Best Drama.

During his production tenure on "Children's Ward", Davies continued to seek other freelance writing jobs, particularly for <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a>s; his intention was to eventually work on the popular and long-running Granada soap "Coronation Street". In pursuit of this career plan, he storylined soaps such as "<a href="Families%20%28TV%20series%29">Families</a>" and wrote scripts for shows such as "<a href="Cluedo%20%28UK%20game%20show%29">Cluedo</a>", a game show based on the <a href="Cluedo">board game of the same name</a>, and "Do the Right Thing", a localised version of the Brazilian panel show "Você Decide" with <a href="Terry%20Wogan">Terry Wogan</a> as presenter and <a href="Frank%20Skinner">Frank Skinner</a> as a regular panellist. One writing job, for "The House of Windsor", a soap opera about footmen in <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a>, was so poorly received that his other scripts for the show would be written under the pseudonym Leo Vaughn.

In 1994, Davies quit all of his producing jobs, and was offered a scriptwriting role on the late-night soap opera "<a href="Revelations%20%281994%20TV%20series%29">Revelations</a>", created by him, <a href="Tony%20Wood%20%28producer%29">Tony Wood</a>, and <a href="Brian%20B.%20Thompson">Brian B. Thompson</a>. The series was a tongue-in-cheek deconstruction of organised religion, and featured his first overtly homosexual character: a lesbian vicar portrayed by <a href="Sue%20Holderness">Sue Holderness</a>, who came out of the closet in a <a href="two-hander">two-hander</a> episode with Carole Nimmons.

Davies attributes the revelation about Holderness's character as a consequence of both the "pressure cooker nature" of the show and the recent <a href="ordination%20of%20women%20in%20the%20Anglican%20Communion">ordination of female vicars in the Church of England</a>. He let his contract with Granada expire and pitched a new early-evening soap opera to <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>, "RU", with its creator Bill Moffat, Sandra Hastie, a producer on Moffat's previous series "<a href="Press%20Gang">Press Gang</a>", and co-writer <a href="Paul%20Cornell">Paul Cornell</a>. Although the slot was eventually taken by "<a href="Hollyoaks">Hollyoaks</a>", he and Cornell mutually benefited from the pitch: Davies introduced Cornell to the "Children's Ward" producers and established contact with Moffat's son <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven</a>, and Cornell introduced Davies to <a href="Virgin%20Publishing">Virgin Publishing</a>. Davies wrote one "Doctor Who <a href="Virgin%20New%20Adventures">Virgin New Adventures</a>" novel, "<a href="Damaged%20Goods%20%28Doctor%20Who%20novel%29">Damaged Goods</a>", in which the <a href="Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doctor</a> tracks a <a href="Class%20A%20drug">Class A drug</a> tainted by <a href="Time%20Lord%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Time Lord</a> technology across several galaxies. The book includes several themes that Davies would intersperse in his later works—including a family called "Tyler" and companion <a href="Chris%20Cwej">Chris Cwej</a> participating in casual homosexual sex— and a subplot formed the inspiration for "The Mother War", a proposed but never produced thriller for Granada about a woman, Eva Jericho, and a <a href="calcification">calcified</a> foetus in her uterus.

Davies continued to propose dramas to Channel 4, including "Springhill", an <a href="apocalyptic%20and%20post-apocalyptic%20fiction">apocalyptic</a> soap-opera, co-created by <a href="Frank%20Cottrell%20Boyce">Frank Cottrell Boyce</a> and <a href="Paul%20Abbott">Paul Abbott</a>, which aired simultaneously on <a href="Sky%20One">Sky One</a> and Channel 4 in 1996–1997. Set in suburban Liverpool, the series focuses on the devoutly <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Catholic</a> Freeman family and their encounter and conflict with Eva Morrigan (Katharine Rogers).

He storylined for the second series, but submitted fewer scripts; Granada had commissioned him to write for their soap "The Grand", temporarily storyline for "Coronation Street", and write the straight-to-video special, "". The second series of "Springhill" continued his penchant for symbolism; in particular, it depicted Marion Freeman (<a href="Judy%20Holt">Judy Holt</a>) and Eva as personifications of good and evil, and climaxed with a finale set in an ultra-liberal dystopian future where premarital sex and homosexuality are embraced by the Church. Boyce later commented that without Davies' input, the show would have been a "dry run" for Abbott's hit show "<a href="Shameless%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Shameless</a>".

Davies' next project was "The Grand", a <a href="period%20drama">period soap drama</a> set in a Manchester hotel during the <a href="interwar%20period">interwar period</a>. It was designed to be a valuable show in a ratings war with the BBC and was scheduled at 9 pm on a Friday night. After the original writer abandoned the series, Granada approached him to write the entire show. His scripts for the first series reflect the pessimism of the period; each episode added its own emotional trauma on the staff, including a soldier's execution for desertion, a destitute maid who threatens to illegally abort her unborn child to survive, and a multi-episode storyline centred on the chambermaid, Monica Jones (<a href="Jane%20Danson">Jane Danson</a>), who kills her rapist in self-defence, is arrested, and eventually hanged for murder. The show was renewed for a second series despite the first's dark tone.

The second series had a lighter tone and greater emphasis on character development, which Davies attributed to his friend Sally, who had previously warned him of the adult humour in "Breakfast Serials"; she told him that his show was too bleak to be compared to real life. He highlighted the sixth and eighth episodes of the second series as a time of maturity as a writer: for the sixth, he utilised then-unconventional narrative devices such as <a href="flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a>s to explore the hotel barman's closeted homosexuality and the societal attitudes towards sexuality in the 1920s; and he highlighted the eighth as when he allowed the series to "take on its own life" by deliberately inserting plot devices such as <a href="MacGuffin">McGuffin</a>s to enhance the comic relief of the series.

Although well received, the series' ratings were not high enough to warrant a third series. After its cancellation in September 1997, Davies had an <a href="existential%20crisis">existential crisis</a> after almost dying from an accidental overdose; the experience persuaded him to detoxify and make a name for himself by producing a series that celebrated his homosexuality.

After his near-death experience, Davies started to develop a series for <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> which reflected the "hedonistic lifestyle" of the gay quarter of Manchester he was leaving behind. Encouraged by ex-Granada executives Catriona MacKenzie and Gub Neil to "go gay", the series focused on a group of friends in Manchester's gay scene, tentatively titled "The Other End of the Ballroom", and later, "Queer as Fuck".

By February 1998, when he completed the first draft for the series première, the series was known under its eventual title "Queer as Folk". The series emulates dramas such as "<a href="Band%20of%20Gold%20%28TV%20series%29">Band of Gold</a>" in presenting realistic discussion on sexuality, as opposed to "one-sided" gay characters in soap operas such as "<a href="EastEnders">EastEnders</a>", and eschews "heavy-handed discussion" of issues such as HIV, instead focusing on the party scene on <a href="Canal%20Street%20%28Manchester%29">Canal Street</a>.

After he wrote the pilot, he approached actors for the main characters. <a href="Christopher%20Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a> was Davies' first choice for the role of Stuart Jones; Eccleston declined because of his age and suggested his friend <a href="Aidan%20Gillen">Aidan Gillen</a> instead. The roles of Vince Tyler and Nathan Maloney were quickly given to <a href="Craig%20Kelly%20%28actor%29">Craig Kelly</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Hunnam">Charlie Hunnam</a>, and the secondary character Alexander Perry, originally written for the television producer <a href="Phil%20Collinson">Phil Collinson</a> during his brief acting career, was portrayed by <a href="Antony%20Cotton">Antony Cotton</a>, who later played the gay character <a href="Sean%20Tully">Sean Tully</a> in "<a href="Coronation%20Street">Coronation Street</a>". The series was allocated a £3,000,000 budget, and was produced by <a href="Red%20Productions">Red Productions</a>, owned by his friend and former colleague <a href="Nicola%20Shindler">Nicola Shindler</a>, and filmed by "<a href="Cracker%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Cracker</a>" and "<a href="Hillsborough%20disaster%23%26quot%3BHillsborough%26quot%3B%20television%20drama">Hillsborough</a>" director <a href="Charles%20McDougall">Charles McDougall</a> and "The Grand" director Sarah Hardin on location in Manchester. The eight 40-minute episodes emulated experiences from his social life and includes an episode where the minor character Phil Delaney (<a href="Jason%20Merrells">Jason Merrells</a>) dies of a cocaine overdose, unnoticed by his social circle.

The series was transmitted in early 1999, when <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> were discussing <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">LGBT equality</a>; the series première aired on the day the House of Lords was discussing the <a href="Sexual%20Offences%20%28Amendment%29%20Act%202000">Sexual Offences Bill 1999</a>, which eventually reduced the <a href="age%20of%20consent">age of consent</a> for homosexual couples to 16. The première was controversial, in particular because it depicted the character Nathan, aged 15, in sexual intercourse with an older man; the broadcasting watchdog <a href="Ofcom">Ofcom</a> received 136 complaints and the series received criticism from Hunnam's parents and from activist <a href="Mary%20Whitehouse">Mary Whitehouse</a>. The controversy was amplified when the sponsor <a href="Beck%27s">Beck's</a> withdrew after several episodes and homosexual activists complained that the series was not representative of gay culture. Nevertheless, the show garnered 3.5 million viewers per episode and a generally positive reaction from fans, and was renewed for a two-episode special due for the following year.

"Queer as Folk 2" was broadcast in 2000 and was driven by the plot element of Vince's half-sister's wedding. The specials place emphasis on Vince and Stuart's relationship, and ends with their departure for another gay scene in a pastiche of "<a href="Grease%20%28film%29">Grease</a>", as Nathan took the role as the leader of the Manchester scene's next generation. The show stopped airing on February 22, 2000. On the heels of the special, Davies pitched the spin-off "Misfits", a late-night soap opera set in a <a href="boarding%20house">boarding house</a> owned by Vince's mother, Hazel, and "The Second Coming", a series that depicted the <a href="Second%20Coming%20of%20Christ">Second Coming of Christ</a> in contemporary Manchester. "Misfits" was rejected in December 2000 and "The Second Coming" was initially approved by Channel 4 but later rejected after a change of executive personnel. Instead of contesting the cancellation of "The Second Coming", he left Channel 4 and vowed to not work with them again.

Shindler continued to pitch "The Second Coming" to other television networks while Davies sought other ventures. His next series was based on a gay friend who married a woman and fathered a child. He saw the relationship as a promising concept for an unconventional love story and asked the couple about their relationship to develop the show. After developing the series around the prejudice that he and his gay friends had shown, he realised he was <a href="straw%20man">creating caricatures for the purpose of exposing them</a>, and instead focused on telling a traditional love story and gave the couple the traditionally British names of Bob Gossage and Rose Cooper.

To simulate a classic love story, the plot required antagonists, in the form of Bob's best friend and fellow teacher Holly Vance and Rose's boyfriend Andy Lewis (<a href="Daniel%20Ryan%20%28actor%29">Daniel Ryan</a>). While Andy, named after Davies' boyfriend Andrew Smith, was a minor character and departed in the third episode, Holly featured throughout the entirety of the series. "Bob & Rose" thus followed a similar format to "Queer as Folk", in particular, the triumvirate of main characters composed of a couple and an outsider who lived in contemporary Manchester, and inverted the traditional "<a href="coming%20out">coming out</a>" story by focusing on Bob's uncharacteristic attraction to Rose; Bob describes his sexual life by simply speaking the line "I fancy men. And her." The series was similar to the <a href="Kevin%20Smith">Kevin Smith</a> film "<a href="Chasing%20Amy">Chasing Amy</a>" (1997), as they both portrayed a romance between a straight character and gay character and the resulting ostracism from the couple's social circles, much like "The Second Coming" shared its concept with Smith's 1999 film "<a href="Dogma%20%28film%29">Dogma</a>".

Like "Queer as Folk", "Bob & Rose" contributed to the contemporary political debate regarding LGBT rights: a subplot involves the fictional pressure group "Parents Against Homphobia" (PAH), led by Bob's mother Monica (<a href="Penelope%20Wilton">Penelope Wilton</a>), an ardent gay rights activist, and their campaign to repeal <a href="Section%2028">Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988</a>, which prohibited local authorities from "intentionally promot[ing]" homosexuality. The subplot climaxes in the fourth episode, when Monica and Bob lead a rally into direct action by handcuffing themselves to a bus run by a company whose management donated millions to keeping the law on the books; the scene directly parallels protests against the transport company <a href="Stagecoach%20Group">Stagecoach</a> due to their founder <a href="Brian%20Souter">Brian Souter</a>'s financial and political support of Section 28—at one point, Davies intended to explicitly name Stagecoach in the script— and is inspired by earlier protests undertaken by the LGBT rights pressure group <a href="OutRage%21">OutRage!</a>.

After successfully pitching the show to <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a>, Red Productions joined Davies in casting the show and initially approached "<a href="Jonathan%20Creek">Jonathan Creek</a>" star <a href="Alan%20Davies">Alan Davies</a> to portray Bob. Although he was not gay, Alan Davies accepted the role and spent several weeks researching first-hand Manchester's gay scene with series director <a href="Joe%20Wright">Joe Wright</a>. His only objection to the role was Bob being a fan of <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United F.C.</a>, the team Shindler had named Red Productions for, because of his prolific support of <a href="Arsenal%20F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</a> The part of Rose was given to <a href="Lesley%20Sharp">Lesley Sharp</a>, her first leading role after her portrayal of secondary characters in past Red shows "<a href="Playing%20the%20Field">Playing the Field</a>" and "<a href="Clocking%20Off">Clocking Off</a>", and <a href="Jessica%20Stevenson">Jessica Stevenson</a> was cast as Holly by ITV Head of Drama Nick Elliott on the basis of her performance in the Channel 4 comedy "<a href="Spaced">Spaced</a>".

The series was filmed in the southern suburbs of Manchester between March and June 2001 and often used Davies' own home as a <a href="green%20room">green room</a>. The series was the only Red–Davies collaboration not to be scored by future "Doctor Who" composer <a href="Murray%20Gold">Murray Gold</a>; the soundtrack was a <a href="Martin%20Phipps">Martin Phipps</a> composition inspired by <a href="Hans%20Zimmer">Hans Zimmer</a>'s work on the 1993 film "<a href="True%20Romance">True Romance</a>". It aired on Monday nights in September and October 2001. Although critically acclaimed, and eventually won two <a href="British%20Comedy%20Awards">British Comedy Awards</a> and a <a href="British%20Academy%20Television%20Award">British Academy Television Award</a> nomination, the series had lower viewing figures than expected and was moved to a later timeslot for the final two episodes. Although the series was not as successful as he hoped, the show helped Davies rekindle his relationship with his mother shortly before her death, just after the transmission of the fourth episode, which he sees as "possibly the best thing [he has] ever written".

Shortly after the transmission of "Bob & Rose", Davies was approached by Abbott to write for his new BBC show "<a href="Linda%20Green">Linda Green</a>". He accepted the offer and wrote an episode where the titular character (portrayed by <a href="Liza%20Tarbuck">Liza Tarbuck</a>) and her friends attend a schoolmate's funeral and become psychologically haunted by the deceased woman's solitary life. His first work for the BBC in eight years prompted them to approach him with additional concepts for period dramas, which he invariably declined as his sole intent was to revive "Doctor Who", which had then been on hiatus for over a decade.

In 2002, he met with the BBC to discuss the revival of the show and producing "The Second Coming"; the BBC were unable to commit to either, and he again declined to work for them. After the BBC rejected "The Second Coming", Shindler proposed that the series should be pitched to ITV. Despite the story's controversial message, the critical success of "Bob & Rose" encouraged the channel to commission the series for broadcast.

"The Second Coming" had been several years in the making and endured many rewrites from the first draft presented to Channel 4 in 2000, but retained its key concept of a depiction of the <a href="Second%20Coming%20of%20Christ">Second Coming of Christ</a> with a humanity-centred deity. A major removal from the script, due to time constraints, was a long sequence titled "Night of the Demons": the main character, a shop assistant, Stephen Baxter, who discovers his divine lineage, takes over a hotel with his disciples and eventually encounters several of the hotel's employees that have been <a href="demonic%20possession">possessed by the Devil</a>. Several similar sequences were removed to create a <a href="thriller%20%28genre%29">thriller</a> set in the days before <a href="Last%20Judgment">Judgement Day</a>.

An experienced actor was required to portray Stephen; Davies approached <a href="Christopher%20Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a>, who had previously been approached for the role of Stuart in "Queer as Folk", based on his performance as Nicky Hutchinson in the drama "<a href="Our%20Friends%20in%20the%20North">Our Friends in the North</a>". Eccleston accepted the role and helped Davies make the character more human after he observed that "Baxter was getting lost amid his loftier pronouncements". The character of Judith, who would represent the fall of God, was given to Lesley Sharp after her performance in "Bob & Rose", and the role of the Devil was given to <a href="Mark%20Benton">Mark Benton</a>.

"The Second Coming" was controversial from its conception. When it was a Channel 4 project, it was the subject of a "<a href="Sunday%20Express">Sunday Express</a>" article a year before its original projected transmission date of late 2001. The series would again receive criticism when it was rumoured it would be broadcast over the Easter weekend of 2003. The series was eventually broadcast over consecutive nights on 9–10 February 2003 to 6.3 million and 5.4 million viewers respectively, and received mixed reactions from the audience: Davies reportedly received death threats for its atheistic message and criticism for its anticlimactic ending, as well as two nominations for Television Awards and one for a <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">Royal Television Society</a> Award.

In the time near his mother's death, Davies returned to Swansea several times and reflected on the role of family. During one visit, he realised that he had not yet written a series set in Wales; hence, he started creating a series about a family who discovers that they own the entire city of Swansea. "The Vivaldi Inheritance", later renamed "Mine All Mine", was based on the tale of the Welsh pirate <a href="Robert%20Edwards%20%28pirate%29">Robert Edwards</a> and his descendants' claim to of real estate in <a href="Lower%20Manhattan">Lower Manhattan</a>, New York City. The series was a departure from his trend of experimental social commentary; it was instead designed to be a mainstream comedy that utilised Welsh actors: Davies and Red Productions even planned a cameo appearance by <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>-winning Swansea-born <a href="Catherine%20Zeta-Jones">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>.

Because the series was centred on an entire family, Red Productions was given the task of casting eleven principal characters: the role of family patriarch Max Vivaldi was given to <a href="Griff%20Rhys%20Jones">Griff Rhys Jones</a>, at the request of ITV for prolific actors; Rhian Morgan, Davies' ex-girlfriend from the WGYT, was cast as Max's wife Val; <a href="Sharon%20Morgan">Sharon Morgan</a> as Max's sister Stella; <a href="Joanna%20Page">Joanna Page</a> as Candy Vivaldi; Matthew Barry and <a href="Siwan%20Morris">Siwan Morris</a> as the Vivaldi siblings Loe and Maria; "<a href="Hi-de-Hi%21">Hi-de-Hi!</a>" actress <a href="Ruth%20Madoc">Ruth Madoc</a> as Val's sister Myrtle Jones; and <a href="Jason%20Hughes%20%28actor%29">Jason Hughes</a> as Maria's boyfriend Gethin. The series, specifically the family's composition of two daughters and a gay son, mirrored his own upbringing to the point where Davies and his boyfriend referred to the show as "The Private Joke".

The series was originally written in six parts, but Davies excised a large portion of the fifth episode because the crew expressed concerns with its pacing. The series was filmed in late 2003 under the direction of <a href="Sheree%20Folkson">Sheree Folkson</a> and Tim Whitby, and utilised many areas of Swansea that Davies was familiar with since his childhood. It aired as four-hour-long episodes and a ninety-minute finale on Thursday nights preceding Christmas 2003. Eventually, "Mine All Mine" would be his least successful series and ended its run with just over two million viewers, which he later blamed on the series' high eccentricity.

Shortly after the transmission of "Mine All Mine", the BBC commissioned Davies to produce the revival of "Doctor Who", which completed his decade-long quest to return the series to the airwaves. At the time, he was developing two scripts: the first, a cinematic adaptation of the <a href="Charles%20Ingram">Charles Ingram</a>-"<a href="Who%20Wants%20to%20Be%20a%20Millionaire%3F">Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</a>" scandal, was cancelled after he accepted the "Doctor Who" job; and the second, a dramatisation of the life of the Venetian adventurer and lover <a href="Giacomo%20Casanova">Giacomo Casanova</a>, was his next show with Red Productions.

Davies' association with "Casanova" began when <a href="London%20Weekend%20Television">London Weekend Television</a> producers <a href="Julie%20Gardner">Julie Gardner</a>, Michele Buck, and <a href="Damien%20Timmer">Damien Timmer</a> approached him to write a 21st-century adaptation of <a href="Histoire%20de%20ma%20vie">Casanova's memoirs</a>. He accepted to script the series because it was "the best subject in the world" and, after reading the memoirs, sought to create a realistic depiction of Casanova instead of further perpetuating the stereotype of a hypersexual lover. The series was originally written for ITV, but was turned down after he could not agree on the length of the serial. Shortly after ITV declined to produce "Casanova", Gardner took up a position as Head of Drama at <a href="BBC%20Wales">BBC Wales</a> and brought the concept with her. The BBC agreed to fund the series, but could only release the money required if a regionally based independent company produced the series. Davies turned to Shindler, who agreed to become the serial's fifth executive producer.

Davies' script takes place in two distinct time frames and required two different actors for the eponymous role: the older Casanova was portrayed by <a href="Peter%20O%27Toole">Peter O'Toole</a>, and the younger Casanova was portrayed by <a href="David%20Tennant">David Tennant</a>. The serial takes place primarily during Casanova's early adulthood and depicts his life among three women: his mother (<a href="Dervla%20Kirwan">Dervla Kirwan</a>), his lover Henriette (<a href="Laura%20Fraser">Laura Fraser</a>), and his consort Bellino (<a href="Nina%20Sosanya">Nina Sosanya</a>). The script takes a different approach to <a href="Casanova%20%281971%20TV%20serial%29">Dennis Potter's 1971 dramatisation</a>; instead of Potter's focus on sex and misogyny, the 2005 serial focuses on Casanova's compassion and respect for women.

"Casanova" was filmed alongside the first few episodes of the new series of "Doctor Who", which meant producers common to both projects, including Davies and Gardner, made daily journeys between the former's production in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> and <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a> and the latter's production in Cardiff. Red Productions also filmed on location overseas in a stately home in <a href="Dubrovnik">Dubrovnik</a>, and alongside production of <a href="Casanova%20%282005%20film%29">the identically titled 2005 Lasse Hallström film</a> in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>. The two production teams shared resources and were given the unofficial names of "Little Casanova" and "Big Casanova" respectively. When it premièred on <a href="BBC%20Three">BBC Three</a> in March 2005, the first episode attracted 940,000 viewers, a record for a first-run drama on the channel, but was overshadowed on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> by the return of "Doctor Who" in the same month.

Since he watched the <a href="First%20Doctor">First Doctor</a>'s (<a href="William%20Hartnell">William Hartnell</a>) <a href="regeneration%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">regeneration</a> into the <a href="Second%20Doctor">Second Doctor</a> (<a href="Patrick%20Troughton">Patrick Troughton</a>) at the end of the 1966 serial "<a href="The%20Tenth%20Planet">The Tenth Planet</a>", Davies had "fallen in love" with the show and, by the mid-1970s, he was regularly writing reviews of broadcast serials in his diary. His favourite writer and childhood hero was <a href="Robert%20Holmes%20%28scriptwriter%29">Robert Holmes</a>; during his career, he has complimented the creative use of BBC studios to create "terror and claustrophobia" for Holmes's 1975 script "<a href="The%20Ark%20in%20Space">The Ark in Space</a>"—his favourite serial from the original series—and has opined that the first episode of "<a href="The%20Talons%20of%20Weng-Chiang">The Talons of Weng-Chiang</a>" (1977) featured "the best dialogue ever written; it's up there with <a href="Dennis%20Potter">Dennis Potter</a>". His screenwriting career also began with a "Doctor Who" submission; in 1987, he submitted a <a href="spec%20script">spec script</a> set on an intergalactic news aggregator and broadcaster, which was rejected by script editor <a href="Andrew%20Cartmel">Andrew Cartmel</a>, who suggested that he should write a more prosaic story about "a man who is worried about his mortgage, his marriage, [and] his dog". The script was eventually retooled and transmitted as "<a href="The%20Long%20Game">The Long Game</a>" in 2005.

During the late 1990s, Davies lobbied the BBC to revive the show from its hiatus and reached the discussion stages in late 1998 and early 2002. His proposals would update the show to be better suited for a 21st-century audience: the series would be recorded on film instead of videotape; the length of each episode would double from twenty-five minutes to fifty; episodes would primarily take place on Earth, in the style of the <a href="Third%20Doctor">Third Doctor</a> (<a href="Jon%20Pertwee">Jon Pertwee</a>) <a href="UNIT">UNIT</a> episodes; and Davies would remove "excess baggage" from the mythology such as <a href="Gallifrey">Gallifrey</a> and the <a href="Time%20Lord">Time Lord</a>s. His pitch competed against three others: <a href="Death%20Comes%20to%20Time">Dan Freedman</a>'s fantasy retelling, <a href="Matthew%20Graham">Matthew Graham</a>'s <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic</a>-styled pitch, and <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>'s reboot, which made the Doctor the <a href="audience%20surrogate">audience surrogate</a> character, instead of his <a href="companion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">companion</a>s. Davies also took cues from American fantasy television series such as "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>" and "<a href="Smallville">Smallville</a>", most notably "Buffy"s concepts of series-long <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a>s and the "<a href="Big%20Bad">Big Bad</a>".

In August 2003, the BBC had resolved legal issues over production rights that had surfaced as a result of the jointly produced <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a>–BBC–<a href="Fox%20Broadcasting%20Company">FOX</a> <a href="Doctor%20Who">1996 "Doctor Who" film</a>, and the Controller of BBC One <a href="Lorraine%20Heggessey">Lorraine Heggessey</a> and Controller of Drama Commissioning <a href="Jane%20Tranter">Jane Tranter</a> approached Gardner and Davies to create a revival of the series to air in a <a href="primetime">primetime</a> slot on Saturday nights, as part of their plan to devolve production to its regional bases. By mid-September, they accepted the deal to produce the series alongside "Casanova".

Davies' <a href="pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitch</a> for "Doctor Who" was the first one he wrote voluntarily; previously, he opted to outline concepts of shows to commissioning executives and offer to write the pilot episode because he felt that a pitch made him "feel like [he's] killing the work". The fifteen-page pitch outlined a <a href="Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doctor</a> who was "your best friend; someone you want to be with all the time", the 19-year-old <a href="Rose%20Tyler">Rose Tyler</a> (<a href="Billie%20Piper">Billie Piper</a>) as a "perfect match" for the new Doctor, avoidance of the 40-year back story "except for the good bits", the retention of the <a href="TARDIS">TARDIS</a>, <a href="sonic%20screwdriver">sonic screwdriver</a>, and <a href="Dalek">Dalek</a>s, removal of the Time Lords, and a greater focus on humanity. His pitch was submitted for the first production meeting in December 2003 and a series of thirteen episodes was obtained by pressure from <a href="BBC%20Worldwide">BBC Worldwide</a> and a workable budget from <a href="Julie%20Gardner">Julie Gardner</a>.

The first new series of "Doctor Who" featured eight scripts by Davies; the remainder were allocated to experienced dramatists and writers for the show's <a href="Doctor%20Who%20spin-offs">ancillary releases</a>: <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a> penned a two-episode story, and <a href="Mark%20Gatiss">Mark Gatiss</a>, <a href="Robert%20Shearman">Robert Shearman</a>, and <a href="Paul%20Cornell">Paul Cornell</a> each wrote one script. Davies also approached his old friend Paul Abbott and "<a href="Harry%20Potter">Harry Potter</a>" author <a href="J.%20K.%20Rowling">J. K. Rowling</a> to write for the series; both declined due to existing commitments. Shortly after he secured writers for the show, Davies stated that he had no intention of approaching writers from the old series; the only writer he would have wished to work with was Holmes, who died in May 1986.

By early 2004, the show had settled into a regular production cycle. Davies, Gardner, and BBC Controller of Continuing Drama Series <a href="Mal%20Young">Mal Young</a> took posts as executive producers, and Phil Collinson, his old colleague from Granada, took the role of producer. Davies' official position as <a href="showrunner">showrunner</a> combined the roles of <a href="head%20writer">head writer</a> and <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> and consisted of laying a skeletal plot for the entire series, holding "tone meetings" to correctly identify the tone of an episode, often described in one word — for example, the "tone word" for Moffat's "<a href="The%20Empty%20Child">The Empty Child</a>" was "romantic" — and overseeing all aspects of production.

The production team was also tasked with finding a suitable actor for the role of the Doctor. Most notably, they approached film actor <a href="Hugh%20Grant">Hugh Grant</a> and comedian <a href="Rowan%20Atkinson">Rowan Atkinson</a> for the role. By the time Young suggested "The Second Coming" and "<a href="Our%20Friends%20in%20the%20North">Our Friends in the North</a>" actor <a href="Christopher%20Eccleston">Christopher Eccleston</a> to Davies, Eccleston was one of three left in the running for the role: the other candidates are rumoured to have been <a href="Alan%20Davies">Alan Davies</a> and <a href="Bill%20Nighy">Bill Nighy</a>. Eccleston created his own characteristics of his rendition of the Doctor based on Davies' life, most notably, his catchphrase "Fantastic!":
Filming for the show started in July 2004 on location in <a href="Cardiff">Cardiff</a> for "<a href="Rose%20%28Doctor%20Who%20episode%29">Rose</a>". The start of filming created stress among the production team because of unseen circumstances: several scenes from the first block had to be re-shot because the original footage was unusable; the <a href="Slitheen">Slitheen</a> prosthetics for "<a href="Aliens%20of%20London">Aliens of London</a>", "<a href="World%20War%20Three%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">World War Three</a>", and "<a href="Boom%20Town%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Boom Town</a>" were noticeably different from their computer-generated counterparts; and the BBC came to a gridlock in negotiations with the <a href="Terry%20Nation">Terry Nation</a> estate to secure the <a href="Dalek">Dalek</a>s for the <a href="Dalek%20%28Doctor%20Who%20episode%29">sixth episode of the series</a>; Davies and episode writer <a href="Rob%20Shearman">Rob Shearman</a> were forced to rework the script to feature another race, until Gardner was able to secure the rights a month later. After the first production block, which he described as "hitting a brick wall", the show's production was markedly eased as the crew familiarised themselves.

The first episode of the revived "Doctor Who", "Rose", aired on 26 March 2005 and received 10.8 million viewers and favourable critical reception. Four days after the transmission of "Rose", Tranter approved a <a href="Christmas%20special">Christmas special</a> and a <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%202%29">second series</a>. The press release was overshadowed by a leaked announcement that Christopher Eccleston would leave the role after one series; in response, David Tennant was announced as Eccleston's replacement.

Tennant had been offered the role when he was watching a pre-transmission copy of "Doctor Who" with Davies and Gardner. Tennant initially believed the offer was a joke, but after he realised they were serious, he accepted the role and made his first appearance in the "dénouement" of "<a href="The%20Parting%20of%20the%20Ways">The Parting of the Ways</a>", the final episode of the first series. "Doctor Who" continued to be one of BBC's flagship programmes throughout Davies' tenure, and resulted in record sales of the show's <a href="Doctor%20Who%20Magazine">official magazine</a>, an increase in <a href="Doctor%20Who%20spin-offs">spin-off novels</a>, and the launch of the children's magazine "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Adventures">Doctor Who Adventures</a>" and toy <a href="sonic%20screwdriver">sonic screwdriver</a>s and Daleks. The show's popularity ultimately led to a resurgence in family-orientated Saturday night drama; the ITV science-fiction series "<a href="Primeval%20%28TV%20series%29">Primeval</a>" and the BBC historical dramas "<a href="Robin%20Hood%20%282006%20TV%20series%29">Robin Hood</a>" and "<a href="Merlin%20%28TV%20series%29">Merlin</a>" were specifically designed for an early Saturday evening timeslot. Davies was also approached by the BBC to produce several spin-off series, eventually creating two: "<a href="Torchwood">Torchwood</a>" and "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>".

In October 2005, BBC Three Controller Stuart Murphy invited Davies to create a post-<a href="watershed%20%28broadcasting%29">watershed</a> "Doctor Who" spin-off in the wake of the parent series' popularity. "<a href="Torchwood">Torchwood</a>"—named after an <a href="anagram">anagram</a>matic <a href="title%20ruse">title ruse</a> used to prevent leaks of "Doctor Who's" first series—incorporated elements from an abandoned Davies project titled "Excalibur" and featured the <a href="pansexual">pansexual</a> 51st century time-traveler <a href="Jack%20Harkness">Jack Harkness</a> (<a href="John%20Barrowman">John Barrowman</a>) and a team of alien hunters in Cardiff. The show began production in April 2006 and was marketed through foreshadowing in the main story arc of "Doctor Who's" second series, which portrayed Torchwood as a covert quasi-governmental organisation that monitors, exploits, and suppresses the existence of extraterrestrial life and technology. Upon its transmission, "Torchwood" was one of BBC Three's most popular shows; however, it received criticism for "adolescent" use of sexual and violent themes. This led the production team to alter the format to be subtler in its portrayal of adult themes.

Concurrently, he was approached to produce a <a href="CBBC">CBBC</a> show which was described as "Young Doctor Who". Davies was reluctant to diminish the mystery of the Doctor's character and instead pitched a show with <a href="Elisabeth%20Sladen">Elisabeth Sladen</a> as the once-popular companion <a href="Sarah%20Jane%20Smith">Sarah Jane Smith</a>: "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>", which follows Sarah Jane and local schoolchildren as they investigate extraterrestrial events in the <a href="London%20Borough%20of%20Ealing">London Borough of Ealing</a>. The show was given a <a href="backdoor%20pilot">backdoor pilot</a> as the "Doctor Who" episode "<a href="School%20Reunion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">School Reunion</a>" and premièred in its own right with "<a href="Invasion%20of%20the%20Bane">Invasion of the Bane</a>" on 1 January 2007. The show was more successful than its 1981 predecessor "<a href="K-9%20and%20Company">K-9 and Company</a>"; it received more favourable reviews than "Torchwood" and a significant periphery demographic that compared the show to 1970s "Doctor Who" episodes.

The workload of managing three separate shows prompted Davies to delegate writing tasks for "Torchwood" and "The Sarah Jane Adventures" to other writers so he could focus on writing "Doctor Who". After <a href="Billie%20Piper">Billie Piper</a>'s departure as Rose Tyler in the second series finale "<a href="Doomsday%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doomsday</a>", he suggested a third spin-off, "Rose Tyler: Earth Defence", a compilation of annual <a href="bank%20holiday">bank holiday</a> specials featuring Rose in a parallel universe version of Torchwood. He later reneged on his idea, as he believed that Rose should stay off screen, and abandoned the idea even though it had been budgeted.

In September 2008, <a href="BBC%20Books">BBC Books</a>, an imprint of <a href="Random%20House%20Publishing">Random House Publishing</a>, published "The Writer's Tale", a collection of emails between Davies and "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" and "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a>" journalist <a href="Benjamin%20Cook%20%28journalist%29">Benjamin Cook</a>. Dubbed the "Great Correspondence" by Davies and Cook, "The Writer's Tale" covers a period between February 2007 and March 2008 and explores his writing processes and the development of his scripts for the <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%204%29">fourth series</a> of "Doctor Who": "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Voyage of the Damned</a>", "<a href="Partners%20in%20Crime%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Partners in Crime</a>", "<a href="Midnight%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Midnight</a>", "<a href="Turn%20Left%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Turn Left</a>", "<a href="The%20Stolen%20Earth">The Stolen Earth</a>", and "<a href="Journey%27s%20End%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Journey's End</a>". The book's first chapter focuses on Cook's "big questions" on Davies' writing style, character development—using the "Doctor Who" character <a href="Donna%20Noble">Donna Noble</a> (<a href="Catherine%20Tate">Catherine Tate</a>) and the "<a href="Skins%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Skins</a>" character <a href="Tony%20Stonem">Tony Stonem</a> (<a href="Nicholas%20Hoult">Nicholas Hoult</a>) as contrasting examples—, how he formulated ideas for stories, and the question "why do you write?". After several weeks, Cook assumes an unofficial advisory role to the scriptwriting and the development of the series. The book's epilogue consists of a short exchange between Davies and Cook: Cook changes from his role as "Invisible Ben" to "Visible Ben" and strongly advises to vastly alter the "denouement" to "Journey's End" from a cliffhanger that led into "<a href="The%20Next%20Doctor">The Next Doctor</a>"—which had occurred in the previous three series finales, "<a href="The%20Parting%20of%20the%20Ways">The Parting of the Ways</a>", "<a href="Doomsday%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doomsday</a>", and "<a href="Last%20of%20the%20Time%20Lords">Last of the Time Lords</a>"—to a melancholy ending that showed the Doctor alone in the TARDIS. After three days of deliberation, Davies accepts Cook's suggestion and thanks him for improving both episodes.

After its release, the pair embarked on a five-stop signing tour to promote the book in October 2008 at <a href="Waterstone%27s">Waterstone's</a> branches in London, <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, Manchester, <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, and Cardiff. The book received positive reviews: Veronica Horwell of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" wrote that Davies was the "<a href="Scheherazade">Scheherazade</a> of <a href="Cardiff%20Bay">Cardiff Bay</a>" and opined that the book should have been twice the published length; Ian Berriman of science fiction magazine "<a href="SFX%20%28magazine%29">SFX</a>" gave the book five stars and commented that it was the only book about "new Who" that a reader needed; television critic <a href="Charlie%20Brooker">Charlie Brooker</a> was inspired by the book to devote an entire episode of his <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> show "<a href="Charlie%20Brooker%27s%20Screenwipe">Screenwipe</a>" to interviewing television writers; and <a href="chat%20show">chat show</a> couple <a href="Richard%20and%20Judy">Richard and Judy</a> selected the book as a recommended Christmas present in the "Serious Non-Fiction" category of <a href="Richard%20%26amp%3B%20Judy%20Book%20Club">their book club</a>. A second edition of the book, "The Writer's Tale: The Final Chapter", was released in January 2010 by BBC Books. The second edition added 350 pages of correspondence—before excising draft scripts included in the first edition—and covered Davies' final months as executive producer of "Doctor Who" as he co-wrote the five-part <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> "<a href="Torchwood">Torchwood</a>" miniseries "", planned <a href="David%20Tennant">David Tennant</a>'s departure and <a href="Matt%20Smith%20%28actor%29">Matt Smith</a>'s arrival as the Doctor, and moved to the United States.

Davies departed from producing the show in 2009 along with Gardner and Collinson, and finished his tenure with four special length episodes. His departure from the show was announced in May 2008, alongside a press release that named <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a> as his successor. His role in late 2008 was split between writing the 2009 specials and preparing for the transition between his and Moffat's production team; one chapter of "The Writer's Tale: The Final Chapter" discusses plans between him, Gardner, and Tennant to announce Tennant's departure live during ITV's <a href="National%20Television%20Awards">National Television Awards</a> in October 2008. His final full script for "Doctor Who" was finished in the early morning of 4 March 2009, and filming of the episode closed on 20 May 2009.

Davies moved with Gardner and <a href="Jane%20Tranter">Jane Tranter</a> to the United States in June 2009, residing in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California. He continued to oversee production of "Torchwood" and "The Sarah Jane Adventures"; he wrote one story for the 2010 series of "The Sarah Jane Adventures", "<a href="Death%20of%20the%20Doctor">Death of the Doctor</a>", which included Matt Smith as the Doctor and <a href="Katy%20Manning">Katy Manning</a> as the Doctor's former companion <a href="Jo%20Grant">Jo Grant</a>, and was the executive producer and author of the premiere ("The New World") and finale ("The Blood Line") of "", the fourth series of "Torchwood". He additionally gave informal assistance to and later served as creative consultant of ex-"Doctor Who" script editor <a href="Helen%20Raynor">Helen Raynor</a>'s and playwright <a href="Gary%20Owen%20%28playwright%29">Gary Owen</a>'s <a href="BBC%20Cymru%20Wales">BBC Cymru Wales</a> drama, "<a href="Baker%20Boys%20%282011%20TV%20series%29">Baker Boys</a>".

At the time of his departure to the United States, Davies planned to return to art by writing a graphic novel, and was approached by <a href="Lucasfilm">Lucasfilm</a> to write for the proposed <a href="Star%20Wars%20live-action%20TV%20series">"Star Wars" live-action television series</a> but refused the commission. Davies' residence in California ended in August 2011 after his boyfriend Andrew Smith was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which prompted Davies to postpone current projects and move back to Manchester with Smith so his partner could undergo treatment closer to their respective families. Davies' move back to the United Kingdom enabled him to develop a replacement series for "The Sarah Jane Adventures" with prolific series writer <a href="Phil%20Ford%20%28writer%29">Phil Ford</a> after the former series ended due to <a href="Elisabeth%20Sladen">Elisabeth Sladen</a>'s death. "<a href="Wizards%20vs%20Aliens">Wizards vs Aliens</a>", a <a href="CBBC">CBBC</a> drama about a teenage wizard and his scientist friend and their conflict with the alien Nekross who wish to destroy Earth, was formed to create a "genre clash" between <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> and <a href="supernatural%20fiction">supernatural</a> fantasy, as opposed to "culture clashes" such as "<a href="Cowboys%20vs.%20Aliens">Cowboys vs. Aliens</a>". Davies additionally made his first contribution to <a href="CBeebies">CBeebies</a>, with two scripts for "<a href="Old%20Jack%27s%20Boat">Old Jack's Boat</a>", which stars "Doctor Who" alumni <a href="Bernard%20Cribbins">Bernard Cribbins</a> and <a href="Freema%20Agyeman">Freema Agyeman</a> as retired fisherman Jack and his neighbour Shelley.

Davies' next project after "Doctor Who", codenamed "More Gay Men", was a <a href="spiritual%20successor">spiritual successor</a> to "Queer as Folk" and would have focused on middle-aged gay men in the Manchester gay scene. The show's genesis dates back from 2001, when his friend Carl Austin asked him "why are gay men so glad when we split up?". The show was due to enter into production in 2006, but was indefinitely postponed due to the success of "Doctor Who". Davies continued to develop ideas for the show, and explained a pivotal scene in the premiere to Cook in 2007:

In 2011, the series had entered into pre-production, with American cable network <a href="Showtime%20%28TV%20network%29">Showtime</a> contracted for transmission and <a href="BBC%20Worldwide">BBC Worldwide</a> for distribution. Showtime had reached the point of casting before Davies moved back to Manchester, at which point the series was picked up by <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> to be produced with <a href="Nicola%20Shindler">Nicola Shindler</a> and the <a href="Red%20Production%20Company">Red Production Company</a>. The commission by Channel 4 marked Davies' first collaboration with the channel since "Queer as Folk" and Shindler and Red since "Casanova". Davies was convinced to return to the channel by Head of Drama and former "Doctor Who" executive producer <a href="Piers%20Wenger">Piers Wenger</a>, who described the show as a "political piece of writing" that creates a "radical approach" to sexuality.

"<a href="Cucumber%20%28TV%20series%29">Cucumber</a>" focuses on the life of the middle-aged Henry Best (<a href="Vincent%20Franklin">Vincent Franklin</a>) and the fallout from a disastrous date with his boyfriend of nine years, and is accompanied with "<a href="Banana%20%28TV%20series%29">Banana</a>", an <a href="E4%20%28channel%29">E4</a> anthology series featuring younger characters across the LGBT spectrum on the periphery of the "Cucumber" narrative, and "<a href="Tofu%20%28web%20series%29">Tofu</a>", an online documentary series available on <a href="All%204">All 4</a> discussing modern sex, sexuality and issues arisen during the show with the cast and public. The three names reference a urological scale categorising the <a href="male%20erection">male erection</a> by hardness from tofu to cucumber, and are used to symbolise differences in sexual attitudes and behaviour between the two generations. Although "Cucumber" was designed as a self-contained serial focusing on the life of one man, Davies envisioned "Banana" as open-ended with the potential to continue after its sister series finished.

After "Cucumber", Davies returned to the BBC in 2016 to produce an adaptation of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s play "<a href="A%20Midsummer%20Night%27s%20Dream">A Midsummer Night's Dream</a>". Davies credits the play as "opening his eyes to drama" after he starred in a school version of the play as <a href="Nick%20Bottom">Bottom</a>. The following year, Davies produced and wrote the screenplay for <a href="A%20Very%20English%20Scandal%20%28TV%20series%29">"A Very English Scandal"</a>, an adaptation of the <a href="A%20Very%20English%20Scandal">book of the same name</a> regarding the <a href="Thorpe%20affair">Thorpe affair</a>, a sex scandal involving former <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> leader <a href="Jeremy%20Thorpe">Jeremy Thorpe</a>, starring <a href="Hugh%20Grant">Hugh Grant</a> as Thorpe and <a href="Ben%20Whishaw">Ben Whishaw</a> as Thorpe's former lover Norman Scott. Davies' screenplay is more compassionate to Thorpe and Scott than previous narratives of the scandal, which he described as "history written by straight men".

Davies' intended future projects include "The Boys", a <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> series about the <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a> crisis during the 1980s. "The Boys" will be a dramatised retrospective of the crisis which focuses on the men "living in the bedsits" during the 1980s as opposed to films such as "<a href="Pride%20%282014%20film%29">Pride</a>" which focus on gay activists; Davies notes that the stories regarding the politics of the crisis and the virus itself has been told, but not those regarding the early victims of the virus itself. Davies describes "The Boys" as a way of "coming to terms" with his own actions during the 1980s, when the shock of the crisis prevented him from properly mourning the deaths of his close friends. After "The Boys", Davies plans to write a series about <a href="sextortion">sextortion</a> that draws inspiration from real-life incidents of blackmail that resulted in suicide. Davies has also expressed interest in adapting <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' "<a href="The%20Old%20Curiosity%20Shop">The Old Curiosity Shop</a>" for television.

Davies is a self-admitted <a href="procrastination">procrastinator</a> and often waits hours or days for concepts to form before he commits them to the script. In "The Writer's Tale", he describes his procrastination by discussing his early career: at the time, his method of dealing with the pressures of delivering a script was to "go out drinking" instead. On one occasion in the mid-1990s, he was at the Manchester gay club <a href="Cruz%20101">Cruz 101</a> when he thought of the climax to the first series of "The Grand". As his career progressed, he instead spent entire nights "just thinking of plot, character, pace, etc" and waited until 2:00 am, "when the clubs used to shut", to overcome the urge of procrastination. Davies described the sense of anxiety he experiences in an email to Cook in April 2007, in response to Cook's question of "how do you know when to start writing?":

He expanded on his email two weeks later in response to Cook's query about the supposed link between <a href="major%20depressive%20disorder">major depressive disorder</a> and creativity. He explained that his anxiety and melancholy during the scriptwriting period still allowed him to keep on top of his work; on the other hand, he thought "Depression with a capital D [didn't provide] any such luxury".

Davies explained in length his writing process to Cook in "The Writer's Tale". When he creates characters, he initially assigns a character a name and fits attributes around it. In the case of Rose Tyler (Billie Piper) in his inaugural series of "Doctor Who", he chose the name because he considered it a "good luck charm" after he used it for Lesley Sharp's character in "Bob & Rose". He presented his desire to make the show "essentially British" as another justification: he considered <a href="Rose%20%28given%20name%29">Rose</a> to be "the most British name in the world" and feminine enough to subvert the then-current trend of female companions and their "boyish" names, such as <a href="Bernice%20Summerfield">Benny</a>, <a href="Charley%20Pollard">Charley</a>, and <a href="Ace%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Ace</a>. While he was writing for "The Grand", the executive producer requested that he change the female lead character's name, a decision that led to the "character never [feeling] right from that moment on". The surname "<a href="Harkness%20%28surname%29">Harkness</a>", most notably given to "Torchwood" lead <a href="Captain%20Jack%20Harkness">Captain Jack Harkness</a>, is a similar charm, first used in 1993 for the Harkness family in "Century Falls", and ultimately derived from the <a href="Marvel%20Universe">Marvel Universe</a> supporting character <a href="Agatha%20Harkness">Agatha Harkness</a>, and the surname "<a href="Tyler">Tyler</a>" is similarly used because of his affection for how the surname is spelled and pronounced.

Davies also attempts to channel his writing by using music that fits the theme of the series as a source of inspiration: "Doctor Who" was typically written while he listened to <a href="action%20film">action</a>-<a href="adventure%20film">adventure film</a> <a href="film%20score">score</a>s; "Queer as Folk" was written to <a href="Hi-NRG">Hi-NRG</a> music "to catch [the] sheer clubland drive"; "Bob & Rose" was written to the <a href="Moby">Moby</a> album "<a href="Play%20%28Moby%20album%29">Play</a>", because the two works shared an "urban, sexy, full of lonely hearts at night" image; and "The Second Coming" shared the concepts of "experimental[ity], anguish, dark[ness], [and] pain" of <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a> albums. More specifically, he wrote the early drafts of the fourth series "Doctor Who" episode "<a href="Partners%20in%20Crime%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Partners in Crime</a>" while he was listening to <a href="Mika%20%28singer%29">Mika</a>'s "<a href="Life%20in%20Cartoon%20Motion">Life in Cartoon Motion</a>", and singled out the song "Any Other World" as a ""Doctor Who" companion song" with lyrics that matched Penny, the planned companion for the fourth series.

When he creates new scripts, Davies considers the "dénouement" of a story to be representative of the work. He often formulates both the scene and its emotional impact early in the process, but writes the scenes last due to his belief that "[later scenes] can't exist if they aren't informed by where they've come from". Davies is a strong advocate for the continued use of the <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a> ending and opposes advertising that sacrifices the impact of storytelling. In pursuit of his quest, he instructs editors to remove scenes from press copies of episodes he writes; cliffhangers were removed from the review copies of the "Doctor Who" episodes "<a href="Army%20of%20Ghosts">Army of Ghosts</a>", "<a href="The%20Stolen%20Earth">The Stolen Earth</a>", and the first part of "<a href="The%20End%20of%20Time%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The End of Time</a>", and Rose Tyler's unadvertised appearance in "<a href="Partners%20in%20Crime%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Partners in Crime</a>" was excised. His most noted cliffhanger was in the script of "The Stolen Earth", which created a public sense of ""Doctor Who" fever" in the week preceding its conclusion. In an interview with BBC News shortly after the episode's transmission, he argued that the success of a popular television series is linked to how well producers can keep secrets and create a "live experience":

Davies attempts to both create imagery and to provide a social commentary in his scripts; for example, he uses camera directions in his scripts more frequently than newer screenwriters to ensure that anyone who reads the script, especially the director, is able to "feel... the pace, the speed, the atmosphere, the mood, the gags, [and] the dread". His stage directions also create an atmosphere by their formatting and avoidance of the first person. Although the basis of several of his scripts derive from previous concepts, he claims that most concepts for storytelling have been already used, and instead tries to tell a relatively new and entertaining plot; for example, the "Doctor Who" episode "<a href="Turn%20Left%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Turn Left</a>" shares its concept most notably with the 1998 film "<a href="Sliding%20Doors">Sliding Doors</a>". Like how "Sliding Doors" examines two timelines based on whether Helen Quilley (<a href="Gwyneth%20Paltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>) catches a <a href="London%20Underground">London Underground</a> train, Davies uses the choice of the Doctor's companion to turn left or right at a road intersection to depict either a world with the Doctor, as seen throughout the rest of the fourth series, or an <a href="parallel%20universe%20%28fiction%29">alternate world</a> without the Doctor, examined in its entirety within the episode. The world without the Doctor creates a dystopia which he uses to provide a commentary on Nazi-esque fascism. Davies generally tries to make his scripts "quite detailed, but very succinct", and eschews the long character and set descriptions; instead, he limits himself to only three adjectives to describe a character and two lines to describe a set to allow the dialogue to describe the story instead.

Davies also uses his scripts to examine and debate on large issues such as sexuality and religion, especially from a homosexual or <a href="atheist">atheist</a> perspective. He refrains from a dependence on "cheap, easy lines" that provide little deeper insight; his mantra during his early adult drama career was "no boring issues". "Queer as Folk" is the primary vehicle for his social commentary of homosexuality and advocation of greater acceptance. He used the series to challenge the "primal ... gut instinct" of homophobia by introducing homosexual imagery in contrast to the heterosexual "fundamental image of life, of family, of childhood, [and] of survival". His next series, "Bob & Rose", examined the issue of a gay man who falls in love with a woman, and the reaction of the couple's respective social circles. "Torchwood", in Davies' own words, is "a very bisexual programme", and demonstrates a fluid approach to both gender and sexuality "almost from its opening moments": for example, the lead character <a href="Captain%20Jack%20Harkness">Captain Jack Harkness</a> nonchalantly mentions he was once pregnant; and later, the other lead characters discuss Jack's sexuality. The gay website <a href="AfterElton">AfterElton</a> opined that "Torchwood"s biggest breakthrough could be "<a href="queer">queer</a> representation" by showing Captain Jack as a character whose bisexuality is explored but not his only character trait.

His most notable commentaries of religion and atheism are "The Second Coming" and his 2007 "Doctor Who" episode "<a href="Gridlock%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Gridlock</a>". "The Second Coming"s depiction of a contemporary and realistic <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a> of <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> eschews the use of religious iconography in favour of a love story underlined by the male lead's "awakening as the Son of God". In contrast, "Gridlock" takes a more pro-active role in debating religion: the episode depicts the unity of the supporting cast in singing the Christian hymns "<a href="Abide%20with%20Me">Abide with Me</a>" and "<a href="The%20Old%20Rugged%20Cross">The Old Rugged Cross</a>" as a positive aspect of faith, but depicts the Doctor as an atheistic hero which shows the faith as misguided because "there is no higher authority". He also includes his commentary as an undertone in other stories; he described the sub-plot of the differing belief systems of the Doctor and <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> in "<a href="Tooth%20and%20Claw%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Tooth and Claw</a>" as a conflict between "Rational Man versus Head of the Church".

Like other scriptwriters during "Doctor Who"s original tenure, several of Davies' scripts are influenced by his personal politics. Marc Edward DiPaolo of <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20University">Oklahoma City University</a> observes that Davies usually espouses a "left-leaning" view through his scripts. Beyond religion and sexuality, Davies most notably satirises the United States under <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> on "Doctor Who": the <a href="Slitheen">Slitheen</a> in "<a href="Aliens%20of%20London">Aliens of London</a>" and "<a href="World%20War%20Three%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">World War Three</a>" and Henry van Statten in "<a href="Dalek%20%28Doctor%20Who%20episode%29">Dalek</a>" were portrayed as sociopathic capitalists; the <a href="Dalek">Dalek</a>s under his tenure echoed contemporary American conservatives in their appearances, from religious fundamentalists in "<a href="The%20Parting%20of%20the%20Ways">The Parting of the Ways</a>" to imperialists in "<a href="Daleks%20in%20Manhattan">Daleks in Manhattan</a>" and "<a href="Evolution%20of%20the%20Daleks">Evolution of the Daleks</a>"; and in "<a href="The%20Sound%20of%20Drums">The Sound of Drums</a>", a parody of Bush is murdered by the <a href="Master%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Master</a> (<a href="John%20Simm">John Simm</a>), who was presented in the story as a <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> reminiscent of <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>. Other targets of satire in his "Doctor Who" scripts include <a href="Fox%20News">Fox News</a>, <a href="News%20Corporation">News Corporation</a>, and the <a href="24-hour%20news%20cycle">24-hour news cycle</a> in "<a href="The%20Long%20Game">The Long Game</a>", plastic surgery and consumer culture in "<a href="The%20End%20of%20the%20World%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The End of the World</a>", obesity and <a href="alternative%20medicine">alternative medicine</a> in "<a href="Partners%20in%20Crime%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Partners in Crime</a>", and racism and paranoia in "<a href="Midnight%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Midnight</a>".

Davies has received recognition for his work since his career as a children's television writer. Davies' first <a href="BAFTA">BAFTA</a> award nominations came in 1993 when he was nominated for the "Best Children's Programme (Fiction)" Television Award for his work on "Children's Ward". "Children's Ward" was nominated for the Children's Drama award in 1996 and won the same award in 1997. His next critically successful series was "Bob & Rose"; it was nominated for a Television Award for Best Drama Serial and won two <a href="British%20Comedy%20Awards">British Comedy Awards</a> for Best Comedy Drama and Writer of the Year. "The Second Coming" was nominated for the same Television Award in 2004. His work on "The Second Coming" earned him a nomination for a <a href="Royal%20Television%20Society">Royal Television Society</a> award.

Most of Davies' recognition came as a result of his work on "Doctor Who". In 2005, "Doctor Who" won two Television Awards—Best Drama Series and the Pioneer Audience Award—and he was awarded the honorary Dennis Potter Award for writing. He also received that year's <a href="BAFTA%20Cymru">BAFTA Cymru</a> <a href="Si%C3%A2n%20Phillips">Siân Phillips Award for Outstanding Contribution to Network Television</a>. At the <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Television%20Festival">Edinburgh International Television Festival</a>, he was awarded the accolade of "Industry Player of the Year" in 2006, and he was announced as recipient of the Outstanding Achievement Award in 2017.

In 2007, Davies was nominated for the "Best Soap/Series" <a href="Writers%27%20Guild%20of%20Great%20Britain">Writers' Guild of Great Britain</a> Award—along with <a href="Chris%20Chibnall">Chris Chibnall</a>, <a href="Paul%20Cornell">Paul Cornell</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Greenhorn">Stephen Greenhorn</a>, <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a>, <a href="Helen%20Raynor">Helen Raynor</a>, and <a href="Gareth%20Roberts%20%28writer%29">Gareth Roberts</a>—for their work on the <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%203%29">third series of "Doctor Who"</a>. He was again nominated for two BAFTA Awards in 2009: a Television Award for his work on "Doctor Who", and the Television Craft Award for Best Writer, for the episode "<a href="Midnight%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Midnight</a>". Under his tenure, "Doctor Who" won five consecutive <a href="National%20Television%20Awards">National Television Awards</a> between 2005 and 2010. He has also been nominated for three <a href="Hugo%20Awards">Hugo Awards</a>, all in the category of "<a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation">Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form</a>": in 2007, the story comprising "<a href="Army%20of%20Ghosts">Army of Ghosts</a>" and "<a href="Doomsday%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doomsday</a>" was defeated by Steven Moffat's "<a href="The%20Girl%20in%20the%20Fireplace">The Girl in the Fireplace</a>"; in 2009, the episode "<a href="Turn%20Left%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Turn Left</a>" was defeated by <a href="Joss%20Whedon">Joss Whedon</a>'s "<a href="Dr.%20Horrible%27s%20Sing-Along%20Blog">Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog</a>"; and in 2010, all three of his scripts which were eligible for the award, "<a href="The%20Next%20Doctor">The Next Doctor</a>", the Davies–<a href="Gareth%20Roberts%20%28writer%29">Roberts</a> collaboration "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Dead">Planet of the Dead</a>", and the Davies–<a href="Phil%20Ford%20%28writer%29">Ford</a> collaboration "<a href="The%20Waters%20of%20Mars">The Waters of Mars</a>", were nominated: the award was won by "The Waters of Mars" and the other episodes took second and third place.

During Davies' tenure as executive producer, only Steven Moffat's "<a href="Silence%20in%20the%20Library">Silence in the Library</a>", which was scheduled against the final of the <a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent%20%28series%202%29">second series of "Britain's Got Talent"</a>, failed to win in its time slot. The show's viewing figures were consistently high enough that the only broadcasts to have consistently rivalled "Doctor Who" for viewers in the <a href="Broadcasters%27%20Audience%20Research%20Board">Broadcasters' Audience Research Board</a>'s weekly charts were "<a href="EastEnders">EastEnders</a>", "<a href="Coronation%20Street">Coronation Street</a>", "<a href="Britain%27s%20Got%20Talent">Britain's Got Talent</a>", and international <a href="football%20%28soccer%29">football</a> matches. Two of his scripts, "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Voyage of the Damned</a>" and "<a href="The%20Stolen%20Earth">The Stolen Earth</a>", broke audience records for the show by being declared the second most viewed broadcasts of their respective weeks, and "<a href="Journey%27s%20End%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Journey's End</a>" became the first episode to be the most viewed broadcast of the week. The show enjoyed consistently high <a href="Appreciation%20Index">Appreciation Index</a> ratings: "<a href="Love%20%26amp%3B%20Monsters">Love & Monsters</a>", regarded by "Doctor Who" fans as his worst script, gained a rating of 76, just short of the 2006 average rating of 77; and the episodes "<a href="The%20Stolen%20Earth">The Stolen Earth</a>" and "<a href="Journey%27s%20End%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Journey's End</a>" share the highest rating "Doctor Who" has received, at 91.

Among "Doctor Who" fans, his contribution to the show ranks as high as the show's co-creator <a href="Verity%20Lambert">Verity Lambert</a>: in a 2009 poll of 6,700 "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a>" readers, he won the "Greatest Contribution" award with 22.62% of the votes against Lambert's 22.49% share, in addition to winning the magazine's 2005, 2006, and 2008 awards for the best writer of each series. Ian Farrington, who commented on the 2009 "Greatest Contribution" poll, attributed Davies' popularity to his range of writing styles, from the epic "<a href="Doomsday%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doomsday</a>" to the minimalistic "Midnight", and his ability to market the show to appeal to a wide audience.

Davies' work on "Doctor Who" has led to accolades out of the television industry. He features in the Pinc List of leading Welsh LGBT figures.
Between 2005 and 2008, he was included in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" "Media 100": in 2005, he was ranked the 14th most influential man in the media; in 2006, the 28th; in 2007, the 15th; and in 2008, the 31st. In 2008 he was ranked the 42nd most influential person in <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British culture</a> by "The Telegraph". "<a href="The%20Independent%20on%20Sunday">The Independent on Sunday</a>" recognised his contributions to the public by including him on seven consecutive <a href="Pink%20List">Pink List</a>s, which chronicle the achievements of gay and lesbian personalities: in 2005, he was ranked the 73rd most influential gay person; in 2006, the 18th; in 2007, the most influential gay person; in 2008, the 2nd; in 2009, the 14th; in 2010, the 64th; in 2011, the 47th; in 2012, the 56th; and in 2013, was listed as a permanent member of the List's "national treasures". Davies was appointed Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> in the <a href="2008%20Birthday%20Honours">2008 Birthday Honours</a> for services to drama, and an honorary fellowship by <a href="Cardiff%20University">Cardiff University</a> in July 2008.

Davies was in a relationship with Andrew Smith, a <a href="customs%20officer">customs officer</a>, between 1999 and Smith's death in 2018. They entered into a <a href="civl%20partnership">civl partnership</a> on 1 December 2012 after Smith was diagnosed with a brain tumour from which he was given only a 3% chance of recovering. Smith died on 29 September 2018.

Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz

Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Seydlitz (3 February 1721 – 8 November 1773) was a <a href="Prussian%20Army">Prussian officer</a>, <a href="generalleutnant">lieutenant general</a>, and among the greatest of the Prussian <a href="cavalry">cavalry</a> <a href="general">general</a>s. He commanded one of the first <a href="Hussar">Hussar</a> squadrons of <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a>'s army and is credited with the development of the Prussian cavalry to its efficient level of performance in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>. His cavalryman father retired and then died while Seydlitz was still young. Subsequently, he was mentored by the <a href="Margrave">Margrave</a> <a href="Margrave%20Frederick%20William%20of%20Brandenburg-Schwedt">of Brandenburg-Schwedt</a>. Seydlitz's superb <a href="horsemanship">horsemanship</a> and his recklessness combined to make him a stand-out <a href="subaltern">subaltern</a>, and he emerged as a redoubtable "<a href="Rittmeister">Rittmeister</a>" (cavalry captain) in the <a href="War%20of%20Austrian%20Succession">War of Austrian Succession</a> (1740–1748) during the <a href="First%20Silesian%20War">First</a> and <a href="Second%20Silesian%20War">Second</a> Silesian Wars.

Seydlitz became legendary throughout the Prussian Army both for his leadership and for his reckless courage. During the Seven Years' War, he came into his own as a cavalry general, known for his "<a href="coup%20d%27%C5%93il">coup d'œil</a>", his ability to assess at a glance the entire battlefield situation and to understand intuitively what needed to be done: he excelled at converting the King's directives into <a href="mission-type%20tactics">flexible</a> tactics. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rossbach">Battle of Rossbach</a>, his cavalry was instrumental in routing the French and <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Empire">Imperial</a> armies. His cavalry subsequently played an important role in crushing the Habsburg and Imperial left flank at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leuthen">Battle of Leuthen</a>. Seydlitz was wounded in battle several times. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kunersdorf">Battle of Kunersdorf</a> in August 1759, he semi-retired to recover from his wounds, charged with the protection of the city of <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. He was not healthy enough to campaign again until 1761.

Frederick rewarded him with <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Eagle">Order of the Black Eagle</a> on the field after the Battle of Rossbach; he had already received the "<a href="Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite">Pour le Mérite</a>" for his action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Kolin">Battle of Kolin</a>. Although estranged from Frederick for several years, the two were reconciled during Seydlitz's final illness. Seydlitz died in 1773, and Frederick's heirs included his <a href="Names%20inscribed%20on%20the%20Equestrian%20statue%20of%20Frederick%20the%20Great">name</a> on the <a href="Equestrian%20statue%20of%20Frederick%20the%20Great">Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great</a> in Berlin, in a place of honor.

Seydlitz was born on 3 February 1721, in <a href="Kalkar">Kalkar</a> in the <a href="Duchy%20of%20Cleves">Duchy of Cleves</a>, where his father, Daniel Florian Seydlitz, was a <a href="major">major</a> of Prussian cavalry with the <a href="Cuirassier">Cuirassier</a> Regiment Markgraf Friedrich Wilhelm of Brandenburg-Schwedt No. 5. In 1726, his father left military service and moved the family to <a href="Schwedt">Schwedt</a>, where he became a forestry master in <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a>; the senior Seydlitz died in 1728, leaving a widow and children in restricted financial circumstances. Limited schooling was available to young Seydlitz; sources differ whether he knew how to speak and write in French, the "<a href="lingua%20franca">lingua franca</a>" of <a href="Frederick%20the%20Great">Frederick the Great</a>'s Court. One biographer, <a href="Bernhard%20von%20Poten">Bernhard von Poten</a>, maintained that his German was good, and if he knew French, he preferred German and wrote it with a "fine, firm hand, unusually correct, in well-formed sentences and with apt expression," and he knew enough Latin to express himself well. His future sovereign, Frederick, always addressed him in German.

By Seydlitz's seventh year, he could ride a horse well, raced with older boys, and he was, by most accounts, a wild and high-spirited child. At the age of fourteen he went as a <a href="Page%20%28servant%29">page</a> to the court of the <a href="Margrave">Margrave</a> <a href="Margrave%20Frederick%20William%20of%20Brandenburg-Schwedt">Frederick Wilhelm</a> of <a href="Brandenburg-Schwedt">Brandenburg-Schwedt</a>, who had been his father's colonel. The Margrave was a grandson of the <a href="Great%20Elector">Great Elector</a>, and a nephew to both <a href="Frederick%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick I of Prussia</a> and <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Prince%20of%20Anhalt-Dessau">Leopold of Anhalt Dessau</a>. Himself a reckless man, the "Mad" Margrave inspired in young Seydlitz a passion for feats of daredevil <a href="horsemanship">horsemanship</a>. Seydlitz did not limit this passion to horses: the Margrave once dared him to ride a wild <a href="stag">stag</a>, which he did. Seydlitz became a skilled horseman, and many stories tell of his feats, the best known of which involved riding between the sails of a <a href="windmill">windmill</a> in full swing. Seydlitz remained in his position as a page to the Margrave until King <a href="Frederick%20William%20I%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William</a> appointed him as <a href="Cornet%20%28rank%29">cornet</a> in the Margrave's Cuirassier Regiment No. 5 (his father's old regiment) on 13 February 1740.

Seydlitz's first months as a cornet were made difficult by the regimental colonel, who considered him a spy for the Margrave, and abused him by sending him on useless errands and generally making it clear that the cornet was no match for the colonel. Within a year of Seydlitz's commission, the old King Frederick William died and his son, <a href="Frederick%20II%20of%20Prussia">Frederick II of Prussia</a>, ascended to the throne. Frederick claimed <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a> from the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg</a>'s <a href="Maria%20Theresa">Maria Theresa</a>, and made a broad appeal to arms. The Margrave's regiment played an important role in the ensuing war, during which Seydlitz came to the notice of the King several times. Once, when Frederick asked the caliber of the artillery shelling the Prussian line, opinions were divided and vague. Seydlitz rode in front of the battery, halting in their line of fire. When he saw a ball hit the ground, he picked it up, wrapped it in his handkerchief and presented it to the King.

In May 1742, while stationed with his regiment in <a href="Kranowitz">Kranowitz</a> during the <a href="Silesian%20Wars%231st%20Silesian%20War%20%281740-1742%29">First Silesian War</a>, the regimental colonel ordered him to take 30 men and hold a village post until infantry came to his assistance; despite heavy fire, the grudging colonel did not send reinforcements. Realizing what had happened, the brigade's general took three squadrons of <a href="heavy%20cavalry">heavy cavalry</a> to relieve Seydlitz, but these were turned back by fire from the Austrian line. Subsequently, Seydlitz was forced to surrender his small unit. He entered into Austrian captivity with several of his closest comrades, including <a href="Charles-Emmanuel%20de%20Warnery">Charles de Warnery</a>.

Frederick exchanged an Austrian captain for Cornet Seydlitz. Upon his return from captivity, Seydlitz had a choice to wait for the first lieutenancy that became available in a <a href="cuirassier">cuirassier</a> regiment, or take the immediate command of a troop of <a href="hussar">hussar</a>s, as a captain. Hussars were the newest form of service in the Prussian army, and not as prestigious an assignment as cuirassiers, but Seydlitz chose the immediate promotion to a lesser unit. In 1743, the King made him a "<a href="Rittmeister">Rittmeister</a>" (captain) in the 4th <a href="Hussars">Hussars</a>. He entirely skipped the rank of <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. With the 4th Hussars, he was stationed in the city of <a href="Trebnitz">Trebnitz</a> and he brought his squadron to a state of conspicuous efficiency.

In August 1744, the King entered <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Bohemia">Bohemia</a>, took Prague, and then moved south. Lieutenant General Count Nassau led the vanguard, and Seydlitz participated with the Natzmer Hussars, commanded by Major <a href="Hans%20Heinrich%20Adam%20Sch%C3%BCtz">Hans Heinrich Adam Schütz</a>, a violent man of whose conduct of warfare Seydlitz disapproved. Seydlitz served through the <a href="Second%20Silesian%20War">Second Silesian War</a>. On 22 May, <a href="Hans%20Karl%20von%20Winterfeldt">Hans Karl von Winterfeldt</a>, trusted by the King as a good judge of character, reported to Frederick: "Certainly, at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hohenfriedberg">Hohenfriedberg</a>, on the 4 June, [Seydlitz] captured the Saxon general [Georg Sigismund] von Schlichting personally, after he had cut the reins from him." Based largely on his conduct at Hohenfriedberg and Winterfeldt's recommendation, Frederick promoted Seydlitz to major on 28 July at the unusually young age of twenty-four. 

Seydlitz led his squadron at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Soor">Battle of Soor</a> on 30 September, scouting the enemy's position before the battle, and then participating in the action. He was also present in the engagement at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hennersdorf">Katholisch-Hennersdorf</a> on 23 November, which proved convincingly to Frederick the benefit of close support during a cavalry charge. At the successful action on 27 November, Seydlitz led 15 squadrons in an attack on the Austrian rear guard. The Austrians were dispersed and nearly destroyed.

After Frederick concluded the peace on 25 December 1748, Seydlitz returned with his squadron to Trebnitz. In the subsequent years of peace, Seydlitz developed <a href="mission-type%20tactics">flexible</a> cavalry tactics. He assembled a plan on tactical form and training for the Prussian cavalry and presented it to the King. Frederick approved the procedures and Seydlitz established a rigorous training program. He would leave his own estate by jumping the gate; he required similar horsemanship from all his men, regardless of whether they were cuirassiers, hussars or <a href="dragoon">dragoon</a>s. They had to be capable of galloping across broken fields, wheeling in formation, and riding in close action. Furthermore, they had to be prepared to support any movement of infantry, or to react to any action from the enemy. Under Seydlitz's direction, Prussian cavalry learned to use only their swords, not the pistols or carbines that could not be fired with accuracy or then had to be reloaded. Frederick set up straw dummies for his troopers to shoot; their shots were woefully inaccurate, but Seydlitz's tactics demonstrated that the troopers could hit their target with a sword every time. Generally, cavalry horses were the sturdy <a href="warm-blood">warm-blood</a> <a href="Trakehner">Trakehner</a>s, from Frederick's <a href="stud%20farm">stud farm</a> in <a href="Yasnaya%20Polyana%2C%20Kaliningrad%20Oblast">Trakenhen</a>, East Prussia.

On 21 September 1752, after a successful review in which the different cavalry forms demonstrated their competencies, the King promoted Seydlitz to <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> and the commander-in-chief of cavalry and, on 13 October of the same year, to the commander of the Dragoon Regiment Württemberg No. 12, whose staff was at <a href="Treptow">Treptow</a>. Frederick was not satisfied with the regiment's performance, and instructed Seydlitz to "put it back into order". In 1753 Frederick appointed Seydlitz to the command of the 8th Cuirassiers. In Seydlitz's hands, this regiment soon became a model for the rest of the Prussian Army's mounted force. In 1755 Frederick promoted him to <a href="colonel">colonel</a>.

By the start of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, Seydlitz's transformed cavalry had become Frederick's pride and joy: it had unrivaled training and an "<a href="esprit%20de%20corps">esprit de corps</a>" bolstered by Frederick's confidence in its members, and by their confidence in Seydlitz. The King had issued orders that no Prussian cavalryman would allow himself to be attacked without a commensurate response, under penalty of being cashiered; consequently, Prussian cavalrymen were active, impetuous and aggressive. For the King, Seydlitz's cavalry became the dynamic factor in the army of the state, and would be the tool by which Frederick could challenge empires. In 1756, Seydlitz's cavalry became Frederick's weapon of choice.

In May 1757, in defiance of the custom of holding the heavy cavalry in reserve, Seydlitz brought his regiment forward to join the advance guard at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Prague%20%281757%29">Battle of Prague</a>. Here he nearly lost his life attempting to ride through a marshy pool; his horse became stuck in quicksand and his troopers pulled him away. At the Prussian loss at <a href="Battle%20of%20Kolin">Kolin</a> in June 1757, he and a cavalry brigade checked the Austrian pursuit by a brilliant charge. Two days later, the King promoted him to <a href="major%20general">major general</a> and awarded him the "<a href="Pour%20le%20M%C3%A9rite">Pour le Mérite</a>". Seydlitz felt he had deserved the promotion for a long time, for he responded to <a href="Hans%20Joachim%20von%20Zieten">Hans Joachim von Zieten</a>'s congratulations by saying, "It was high time, Excellency, if they wanted more work out of me. I am already thirty-six." 

Another example of his leadership and his "<a href="coup%20d%27%C5%93il">coup d'œil</a>", the ability to see at a glance what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the <a href="Siege%20of%20Prague%20%281757%29">siege at Prague</a>. The King's brother, <a href="Prince%20Augustus%20William%20of%20Prussia">Augustus William</a>, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of <a href="Karl%20Christoph%20von%20Schmettau">Karl Christoph von Schmettau</a> in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered <a href="Lusatia">Lusatia</a>, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.

On the morning of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rossbach">Battle of Rossbach</a>, Frederick passed over two senior generals and placed Seydlitz in command of the whole of the cavalry, much to those men's annoyance and to Seydlitz's satisfaction. At Rossbach, Seydlitz's "coup d'œil" and his understanding of the King's objectives led to battlefield success. After positioning the cavalry in two ranked lines, he watched the French army move for several minutes, while puffing on his pipe; his troopers never took their eyes off him. When he threw his pipe away, this was the signal they had waited for: the first line of massed squadrons surged forward, smashing the unprepared French in the flank. Typically, cavalry action in the mid-eighteenth century meant a single cavalry charge; the cavalry would spend the rest of the action pursuing fleeing troops. At Rossbach, though, not content with this single attack, Seydlitz called his second formation of squadrons in another charge; he then withdrew all 38 squadrons into a <a href="Coppicing">copse</a>, where they regrouped under cover of the trees. Without waiting for new orders from the King, Seydlitz deployed the Prussian cavalry a third time; this proved a critical factor in the battle. As trained, Seydlitz's squadrons charged headlong into the French columns: a massive wall of horses <a href="Canter%20and%20gallop">galloping</a> flank to flank, their riders flashing swords and maneuvering at full speed. By the end of the battle, only seven infantry battalions of Frederick's army had fired a shot; the rest of the victory had been the work of Seydlitz's 38 squadrons and <a href="Karl%20Friedrich%20von%20Moller">Karl Friedrich von Moller</a>'s artillery.

That day, the Prussians took as trophies 72 cannons (62 percent of the French/Imperial artillery), seven flags, and 21 standards. With some 3,500 horsemen and 20 cannons, plus a portion of <a href="Prince%20Henry%20of%20Prussia%20%281726-1802%29">Prince Henry's</a> regiment of infantry, the Prussian army had defeated the combined armies of two European powers, France and the Holy Roman Empire. The tactics at Rossbach became a landmark in the history of <a href="Military%20art%20%28military%20science%29">military art</a>. The same night, on the field, the King awarded Seydlitz the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Black%20Eagle">Order of the Black Eagle</a>, and promoted him to <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a>. Seydlitz had been wounded during the melée and he remained out of action for four months, nursed by a lady in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>.

Seydlitz rejoined the King in 1758 and on 25 August, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Zorndorf">Battle of Zorndorf</a>, Seydlitz's cavalry again secured the victory. He led thirty-six squadrons into a mass of Russian cavalry mingled with infantry. This charge broke the Russian right wing and sent them running for the woods. At the Prussian debacle at <a href="Battle%20of%20Hochkirk">Hochkirch</a>, on 14 October 1758, he covered the Prussian retreat with 108 squadrons, and in the disaster of <a href="Battle%20of%20Kunersdorf">Kunersdorf</a>, on 12 August 1759, he received another severe wound in a hopeless attempt to storm a hill held by the Russians; his 8th Cuirassiers was one of the few intact regiments at the end of the battle. While recuperating in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>, he helped organize a defense of the city during the Austro-Russian <a href="Raid%20on%20Berlin">raid</a> (October 1760). Although he was unable to prevent the Russians from briefly occupying the city, Frederick later praised Seydlitz for his conduct.

Seydlitz's health frequently kept him off the battlefield, and he did not reappear at the front until 1761. Then, he received command of a wing of Prince Henry's army, composed of troops of all arms, and many of his fellow officers expressed doubts as to his fitness for this command, as his service had been with the cavalry exclusively. Subsequently, though, at <a href="Battle%20of%20Freiberg">Freiberg</a> on 29 October 1762, his direction of both his infantry and his cavalry in turn decided the outcome of the battle.

After the Seven Years' War concluded with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Hubertusburg">Treaty of Hubertusburg</a> (1763), Seydlitz became <a href="inspector%20general">inspector general</a> of the cavalry in <a href="Province%20of%20Silesia">Silesia</a>, where eleven regiments were permanently stationed and where Frederick sent all his most promising officers to be trained. In 1767, Frederick promoted Seydlitz to general of cavalry.

Seydlitz's later years were marred by domestic unhappiness. During his convalescence in Berlin, on 18 April 1761, he had married Susannah Johanna Albertine Hacke, daughter of <a href="Hans%20Christoph%20Friedrich%20Graf%20von%20Hacke">Hans Christoph Friedrich Graf von Hacke</a>, and she was eventually unfaithful to him, reportedly due to the <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> from which he had suffered for decades. He had at least one daughter, according to an early biographer, Anton König, and two according to another biographer, Robert Lawley. The oldest daughter married first to an official from Breslau, and was divorced. She married second to a Polish count, and divorced soon after. She eventually converted to Catholicism, but died in a madhouse in <a href="Brzeg">Brieg</a>. The youngest lived to old age and died in poverty near <a href="Lausitz">Lausitz</a>.

By the end of the decade, some misunderstanding brought an end to his formerly close friendship with the King. Seydlitz's health had been declining for years and he suffered from recurrent bouts of syphilis; in 1772, after an attack of <a href="apoplexy">apoplexy</a>, he completed a couple of stays at the <a href="Mineral%20spa">spa</a> at <a href="Karlovy%20Vary">Carlsbad</a> to take the mineral waters. While these helped somewhat, his other activities continued without moderation, and to his detriment. A subordinate brought him two healthy <a href="Circassian%20beauties">Circassian beauties</a>, whose company he enjoyed but who undoubtedly stressed his tenuous health. In August 1773, in his last illness, Frederick and Seydlitz met again at Seydlitz's home at Minkovsky near <a href="Ohlau">Ohlau</a> (now <a href="O%C5%82awa">Oława</a>, Poland). The King sat beside his sickbed, horrified at Seydlitz's condition, and even persuaded him to take some of his medications, but Seydlitz would not look at him; the illness had already <a href="Gumma%20%28pathology%29">deformed</a> his face. Eventually paralyzed, whether from another stroke or the underlying tertiary syphilis, Seydlitz died at Ohlau in Silesia in November 1773.

Seydlitz was generally admired for the superb "coup d'œil" that allowed him to utilize the cavalry to its full potential. His 19th-century biographer, <a href="Karl%20August%20Varnhagen%20von%20Ense">K. A. Varnhagen von Ense</a>, related that Seydlitz lived above all for the service, and promoted the training of his hussars before all else. According to <a href="Anton%20Balthasar%20K%C3%B6nig">Anton Balthasar König</a>, who wrote in 1780–1790, Seydlitz performed best at taverns and excelled in practical jokes: one would gather that Seydlitz was a drunkard, a <a href="Rake%20%28character%29">rake</a>, and a savage, but another of his biographers, <a href="Bernhard%20von%20Poten">Bernhard von Poten</a>, cited conflicting descriptions offered by Seydlitz's contemporaries, particularly Warnery, as more accurate. Nevertheless, there is some evidence to support König's assertion, at least of Seydlitz's excesses: Seydlitz was no doubt dependent upon his tobacco and had been since his teenage years, although he smoked a pipe rather than using snuff, as many officers did; he was indeed reckless, as his career testified; he enjoyed the company of women; and Seydlitz indeed suffered from recurring illness.

In 1851, <a href="Frederick%20William%20IV%20of%20Prussia">Frederick William IV</a>, Frederick's great-great nephew, included Seydlitz's <a href="Names%20inscribed%20on%20the%20Equestrian%20statue%20of%20Frederick%20the%20Great">name</a> on the <a href="Equestrian%20statue%20of%20Frederick%20the%20Great">Equestrian statue of Frederick the Great</a> in Berlin, honoring those who had helped to build the Prussian state. Seydlitz holds a position of honor as one of the four full-sized mounted figures, sharing the first tier of the plinth with the King's brother, his cousin, and Hans Joachim von Zieten. A <a href="bronze%20sculpture">bronze sculpture</a> installed at <a href="Zietenplatz">Zietenplatz</a>, in Berlin, was created by Anton Lulvès, a copper worker from Hamburg. , representing the first generation of <a href="battlecruiser">battlecruiser</a>s, was ordered in 1910 and commissioned in May 1913, the fourth such vessel built for the <a href="Imperial%20German%20Navy">Imperial German Navy</a>'s <a href="High%20Seas%20Fleet">High Seas Fleet</a>.

Gyllenhaal was born in Manhattan, the daughter of <a href="Naomi%20Foner%20Gyllenhaal">Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal</a> (née Achs) and <a href="Stephen%20Gyllenhaal">Stephen Gyllenhaal</a>. The first name on Maggie's birth certificate is "Margalit", which she did not discover until 2013, when adopting her husband's surname. "<a href="Margalit%20%28disambiguation%29">Margalit</a>" () is a Hebrew word meaning "pearl"; some news stories have spelled it "Margolit". She has two brothers, actor <a href="Jake%20Gyllenhaal">Jake Gyllenhaal</a> and a half-brother named Luke from her father's second marriage.

Her father is a film director and poet, and her mother is a screenwriter and director. Her father, a member of the <a href="Gyllenhaal%20family">Gyllenhaal family</a>, is of Swedish and English ancestry, and was raised in the <a href="The%20New%20Church">Swedenborgian</a> religion. Her last native Swedish ancestor was her great-great-grandfather Anders Leonard Gyllenhaal, a descendant of <a href="Leonard%20Gyllenhaal">Leonard Gyllenhaal</a>, a leading Swedenborgian who supported the printing and spreading of Swedenborg's writings.

Her mother was born in New York City (growing up in <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a>), and is <a href="Jews">Jewish</a>, from families that emigrated from Russia and Poland. Her mother's first husband was <a href="Eric%20Foner">Eric Foner</a>, a noted historian and history professor at <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>. Gyllenhaal has stated that she "grew up mostly Jewish, culturally", and she identifies as Jewish, though she did not attend <a href="Hebrew%20school">Hebrew school</a>. Her parents married in 1977, and filed for divorce in October 2008.

Gyllenhaal grew up in Los Angeles and studied at the <a href="Harvard-Westlake%20School">Harvard–Westlake</a> prep school. She spent four months as a student at <a href="The%20Mountain%20School">The Mountain School</a>, a semester school for high school juniors in Vermont. In 1995, she graduated from Harvard–Westlake and moved to New York to attend <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, where she studied literature and Eastern religions. She also studied acting for a summer term at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> (RADA) in London, England.

Gyllenhaal's first films—"<a href="A%20Dangerous%20Woman%20%281993%20film%29">A Dangerous Woman</a>" (1993); and "<a href="Homegrown%20%28film%29">Homegrown</a>" (1998)—were directed by her father; which also featured her brother; they had supporting roles as children. Prior to that she also, at the age of 15, made a brief appearance in her father's film, "<a href="Waterland%20%28film%29">Waterland</a>" (1992). With their mother, she and Jake appeared in two episodes of "Molto Mario", an Italian cooking show on the <a href="Food%20Network">Food Network</a>. After graduating from college, she played supporting roles in films like "<a href="Cecil%20B.%20Demented">Cecil B. Demented</a>" (2000) and "<a href="Riding%20in%20Cars%20with%20Boys">Riding in Cars with Boys</a>" (2001). Gyllenhaal later achieved recognition in her own right playing her real brother's on-screen sister in the <a href="independent%20film">indie</a> <a href="cult%20following">cult hit</a> "<a href="Donnie%20Darko">Donnie Darko</a>" (2001).

She made her theatrical debut in the <a href="Berkeley%20Repertory%20Theatre">Berkeley Repertory Theatre</a> production of <a href="Patrick%20Marber">Patrick Marber</a>'s "<a href="Closer%20%28play%29">Closer</a>", for which she received favorable reviews. Production started in May 2000 and ended in mid-July of that year. Gyllenhaal has performed in several other plays, including "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>", "<a href="Antony%20and%20Cleopatra">Antony and Cleopatra</a>", "The Butterfly Project", and "<a href="No%20Exit">No Exit</a>".

Gyllenhaal's break-out role was in the <a href="black%20comedy">black comedy</a>, "<a href="Secretary%20%282002%20film%29">Secretary</a>" (2002), a film about two people who embark on a mutually fulfilling <a href="BDSM">BDSM</a> lifestyle. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" critic Stephen Holden noted: "The role of Lee, which Maggie Gyllenhaal imbues with a restrained comic delicacy and sweetness, should make her a star." <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" wrote: "Maggie Gyllenhaal, as the self-destructive secretary, is enigmatic and, at moments, sympathetic." The film received generally favorable reviews, and Gyllenhaal's performance earned her the Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress award from the <a href="National%20Board%20of%20Review%20of%20Motion%20Pictures">National Board of Review of Motion Pictures</a>, her first <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe</a> nomination, and an <a href="Independent%20Spirit%20Award">Independent Spirit Award</a> nomination. "Secretary" was Gyllenhaal's first film role which featured <a href="nudity%20in%20film">full frontal nudity</a>. Although impressed with the script, she initially had some qualms about doing the film, which she believed could deliver an anti-feminist message. Yet after carefully discussing the script with the film's director, <a href="Steven%20Shainberg">Steven Shainberg</a>, she agreed to join the project. Although insisting Shainberg did not exploit her, Gyllenhaal has said she felt "scared when filming began" and that "in the wrong hands ... even in just slightly less intelligent hands, this movie could say something really weird." Since then, she is guarded about discussing her role in the film, saying only that "despite myself, sometimes the dynamic that you are exploring in your work spills over into your life."

She next played a supporting role in the comedy-drama "<a href="Adaptation%20%28film%29">Adaptation</a>" (2002), a film that tells the story of screenwriter <a href="Charlie%20Kaufman">Charlie Kaufman</a>'s struggle to adapt "<a href="The%20Orchid%20Thief">The Orchid Thief</a>" into a film. She later appeared in the unauthorized biography "<a href="Confessions%20of%20a%20Dangerous%20Mind">Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</a>" (2002), part of an ensemble cast that included <a href="Sam%20Rockwell">Sam Rockwell</a>, <a href="Drew%20Barrymore">Drew Barrymore</a>, <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a>, and <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>. The movie grossed <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>33 million worldwide. That same year, she had a small role in the comedy "<a href="40%20Days%20and%2040%20Nights">40 Days and 40 Nights</a>".

In 2003, she co-starred with Julia Roberts in "<a href="Mona%20Lisa%20Smile">Mona Lisa Smile</a>" in the role of Giselle. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", she revealed the reason for accepting the role was "to play somebody who feels confident in herself as a sexy, beautiful woman". The film generated mostly critical reviews, with <a href="Manohla%20Dargis">Manohla Dargis</a> of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" describing it as "smug and reductive". Her next roles were in smaller independent films: "<a href="Casa%20de%20los%20Babys">Casa de los Babys</a>" (2003), a story about six American women impatiently waiting out their lengthy residency requirements in an unidentified South American country before picking up their adoptive babies, and "<a href="Criminal%20%282004%20film%29">Criminal</a>" (2004), a remake of the Argentinian film "<a href="Nine%20Queens">Nine Queens</a>", with <a href="John%20C.%20Reilly">John C. Reilly</a> and <a href="Diego%20Luna">Diego Luna</a>. Gyllenhaal plays an honest hotel manager forced to help her crooked brother (Reilly) by seducing one of his victims. Gyllenhaal was invited to join the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> in 2004. She starred in the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> film "<a href="Strip%20Search%20%28film%29">Strip Search</a>" (2004), where she portrayed an American student in China suspected of terrorism. For her role, Gyllenhaal had to perform multiple scenes of <a href="Nudity">full-frontal nudity</a> as the film tackled issues of <a href="strip%20search">strip search</a>es.

In 2004, Gyllenhaal returned to theater in a Los Angeles production of <a href="Tony%20Kushner">Tony Kushner</a>'s "Homebody/ Kabul" as Priscilla, the Homebody's daughter, who spends most of the play searching for her elusive mother in <a href="Kabul">Kabul</a>, <a href="Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>. Kushner gave her the role in "Homebody/ Kabul" on the strength of her performance in "Closer". Ben Brantley of "The New York Times" wrote: "Ms. Gyllenhaal provides the essential bridge between the parts of the play's title." John Heilpern of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Observer">The New York Observer</a>" noted that Gyllenhaal's performance was "compelling". Viewed as a sex symbol, she was ranked in the "Hot 100 List" by "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>" magazine in 2004 and 2005.

Gyllenhaal's next film role was in the 2005 comedy-drama "<a href="Happy%20Endings%20%28film%29">Happy Endings</a>", in which she played an adventuress singer who seduces a young gay musician (<a href="Jason%20Ritter">Jason Ritter</a>) as well as his rich father (<a href="Tom%20Arnold%20%28actor%29">Tom Arnold</a>). She recorded songs for the movie's soundtrack, calling the role the "roughest, scariest acting ever" and adding she is more natural when singing on screen than when acting. Lisa Schwarzbaum of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" declared Gyllenhaal's performance "as wonderfully, naturally slouchy-sexy as her character is artificial".

Following "Happy Endings", she starred in the 2006 films "<a href="Trust%20the%20Man">Trust the Man</a>", "<a href="Stranger%20than%20Fiction%20%282006%20film%29">Stranger than Fiction</a>", "<a href="Monster%20House%20%28film%29">Monster House</a>", "<a href="World%20Trade%20Center%20%28film%29">World Trade Center</a>", and "<a href="Sherrybaby">Sherrybaby</a>". In "Trust the Man", featuring <a href="Julianne%20Moore">Julianne Moore</a>, <a href="David%20Duchovny">David Duchovny</a>, and <a href="Billy%20Crudup">Billy Crudup</a>, she played Elaine, who has been dating Tobey, Crudup's character, for seven years and has begun to feel that it is time for her to settle down and start a family. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. Ethan Alter of "<a href="Premiere%20%28magazine%29">Premiere</a>" felt that the performances by Gyllenhaal and Duchovny were "much more at ease" and concluded with "that's probably because they're played these characters many times before". In "Stranger than Fiction", Gyllenhaal played a love interest of Harold Crick, played by <a href="Will%20Ferrell">Will Ferrell</a>. Her performance in the film received favorable reviews; Mike Straka of <a href="Fox%20News%20Channel">Fox News</a> wrote: "Gyllenhaal has never been sexier in any film before and her interplay with Ferrell will propel her to more A-list films, leaving her indie-darling days behind, no doubt." She voiced Elizabeth "Zee" in the <a href="computer%20animation">computer animated</a> <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> "Monster House". Gyllenhaal played Allison Jimeno, the wife of Port Authority officer <a href="Will%20Jimeno">Will Jimeno</a>, in <a href="Oliver%20Stone">Oliver Stone</a>'s "World Trade Center", based on the <a href="September%2011%20attacks">September 11 attacks</a> in New York City. She regarded this as "one of the films she most enjoyed making". The film received favorable reviews and proved to be an international success, earning US$162 million worldwide.

In "Sherrybaby", Gyllenhaal played a young drug-addicted thief trying to put her life in order after prison so she can reconcile with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: "I think she's in such dire straights that all she has are these kind of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And so it was really mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain." Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> wrote, "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly ... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" called her performance "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 <a href="Stockholm%20International%20Film%20Festival">Stockholm International Film Festival</a>.
She appeared in "<a href="The%20Dark%20Knight%20%28film%29">The Dark Knight</a>" (2008), the sequel to "<a href="Batman%20Begins">Batman Begins</a>" (2005), in which she replaced <a href="Katie%20Holmes">Katie Holmes</a> as <a href="Prosecutor">Assistant District Attorney</a>, <a href="Rachel%20Dawes">Rachel Dawes</a>. Gyllenhaal acknowledged her character was a <a href="damsel%20in%20distress">damsel in distress</a> to an extent, but said director <a href="Christopher%20Nolan">Christopher Nolan</a> sought ways to empower her character, so "Rachel's really clear about what's important to her and unwilling to compromise her morals, which made a nice change" from the many conflicted characters she had previously portrayed. "The Dark Knight" was a financial and critical success, setting a new opening weekend box office record for North America. With revenue of US$1 billion worldwide, it became the fourth-highest-grossing film of all time, and remains Gyllenhaal's most commercially successful picture to date. In a "<a href="Salon%20%28website%29">Salon</a>" review of the film, Stephanie Zacharek called Gyllenhaal's character "a tough cookie in a <a href="Barbara%20Stanwyck">Stanwyck</a>-style bias-cut gown" and stated that "the movie feels smarter and more supple when she's on-screen". <a href="IGN">IGN</a> film critic Todd Gilchrist wrote, "Gyllenhaal adds real depth and energy to Rachel Dawes".

Gyllenhaal played Yelena Andreevna in the <a href="Classic%20Stage%20Company">Classic Stage Company</a>'s 2009 <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> production of <a href="Anton%20Chekhov">Anton Chekhov</a>'s "<a href="Uncle%20Vanya">Uncle Vanya</a>" in New York City. The cast also included her husband <a href="Peter%20Sarsgaard">Peter Sarsgaard</a>. The production, directed by <a href="Austin%20Pendleton">Austin Pendleton</a>, began previews on January 17 and ended its limited run on March 1. Joe Dziemianowicz of the <a href="Daily%20News%20%28New%20York%29">"New York Daily News"</a> was less than enthusiastic about her performance, writing: "Gyllenhaal, who was so dynamic as a druggie in the film "Sherrybaby", plays Yelena with a slow-mo saunter and monotonous pasted-on smile that makes it seem as if she's been in Sherry's stash." However, Malcolm Johnson of the "<a href="Hartford%20Courant">Hartford Courant</a>" was complimentary, noting that she "ultimately blossoms" as the character.
Gyllenhaal agreed to appear in the comedy film "<a href="Away%20We%20Go">Away We Go</a>", where she plays a bohemian college professor who is an old friend of <a href="John%20Krasinski">John Krasinski</a>'s character. The film generated broadly mixed reviews, with <a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> of "Entertainment Weekly" describing Gyllenhaal's subplot as "over-the-top". However, <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> of "The New York Times" praised Gyllenhaal and co-star <a href="Allison%20Janney">Allison Janney</a> for their performances, writing that "both [are] quite funny". Scott concluded with, "Ms. Gyllenhaal's line about sex roles in 'the seahorse community' is the screenplay's one clean satirical bull's-eye". Her next role came in the musical-drama "<a href="Crazy%20Heart">Crazy Heart</a>", in which she played journalist Jean Craddock, who falls for musician Bad Blake, played by <a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a>. The movie received favorable reviews, with Gyllenhaal receiving praise from critics. <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> of "Rolling Stone" reported that Gyllenhaal was "funny, touching and vital as Jean" and that her part was "conventionally conceived, but Gyllenhaal plays it with a tough core of intelligence and feeling." Her performance earned her an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nomination for <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>.

In 2010, Gyllenhaal appeared in "<a href="Nanny%20McPhee%20and%20the%20Big%20Bang">Nanny McPhee and the Big Bang</a>", the sequel to the 2005 film "<a href="Nanny%20McPhee">Nanny McPhee</a>". The role required her to speak with an English accent. The feature received mixed reviews, and earned US$93 million worldwide. Away from acting, she served as host of the <a href="PBS">PBS</a> television documentary series "<a href="Independent%20Lens">Independent Lens</a>". Gyllenhaal also appeared in "<a href="Hysteria%20%282011%20film%29">Hysteria</a>", an independent movie focusing on the creation of the <a href="vibrator%20%28sex%20toy%29">vibrator</a>.

In February 2011, Gyllenhaal starred in another Anton Chekhov production as the character Masha in Austin Pendleton's "<a href="Three%20Sisters%20%28play%29">Three Sisters</a>" at the Classic Stage Company. The play focuses on the Prozorov sisters (Gyllenhaal, <a href="Jessica%20Hecht">Jessica Hecht</a>, and <a href="Juliet%20Rylance">Juliet Rylance</a>) "unlucky in love, unhappy in the provinces and longing to return to Moscow", as summarized by <a href="Bloomberg%20L.P.">Bloomberg</a>'s Jeremy Gerard. The off-Broadway production began preview performances on January 12, with a limited engagement through March 6.

In the 2012 film "<a href="Won%27t%20Back%20Down%20%28film%29">Won't Back Down</a>", she played a parent involved in a <a href="parent%20trigger">parent trigger</a> takeover of her child's school. She appeared as a Secret Service agent in the action-thriller "<a href="White%20House%20Down">White House Down</a>" (2013).

In 2014, she played the title role as Baroness Nessa Stein, a British-Israeli businesswoman heiress in the British television <a href="BBC%20Television">BBC Television</a> political spy thriller television miniseries, "<a href="The%20Honourable%20Woman">The Honourable Woman</a>". For her role in it, she won the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Miniseries%20or%20Television%20Film">Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film</a>. Kevin Fallon wrote in the "<a href="Daily%20Beast">Daily Beast</a>": "Gyllenhaal delivers what might be the most towering, complex, best performance of her career in the miniseries." Also in 2014 she played Hathfertiti in <a href="Matthew%20Barney">Matthew Barney</a> and Jonathan Bepler's "<a href="River%20of%20Fundament">River of Fundament</a>".

In August 2016, the <a href="audiobook">audiobook</a> seller and producer <a href="Audible%20Inc.">Audible</a> announced that Gyllenhaal's narration performance of "<a href="Anna%20Karenina">Anna Karenina</a>" by <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> was available for purchase. Gyllenhaal, when interviewed about the experience said, "Making this, doing this, I feel like it's one of the major accomplishments of my work life."

In February 2017, she was a member of the jury for the <a href="2017%20Berlin%20Film%20Festival">2017 Berlin Film Festival</a>. She has been working as a producer and is also acting in the HBO series "<a href="The%20Deuce%20%28TV%20series%29">The Deuce</a>".

Gyllenhaal began a relationship with actor <a href="Peter%20Sarsgaard">Peter Sarsgaard</a>, a close friend of her brother, Jake, in 2002. They announced their engagement in April 2006, and married on May 2, 2009, in a small chapel in <a href="Brindisi">Brindisi</a>, Italy. They have two daughters.

Pat Nixon

Thelma Catherine "Pat" Nixon (née Ryan; March 16, 1912 – June 22, 1993), also commonly known as Patricia Nixon, was an American educator and the wife of <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, the 37th <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. During her more than 30 years in public life, she served as both the <a href="Second%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">Second</a> (1953–1961) and <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady of the United States</a> (1969–1974).

Born in <a href="Ely%2C%20Nevada">Ely, Nevada</a>, she grew up with her two brothers in what is now <a href="Cerritos%2C%20California">Cerritos, California</a>, graduating from high school in 1929. She attended <a href="Fullerton%20Junior%20College">Fullerton Junior College</a> and later the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, radiographer, and retail clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters, <a href="Tricia%20Nixon%20Cox">Tricia</a> and <a href="Julie%20Nixon%20Eisenhower">Julie</a>. Dubbed the "Nixon team," Richard and Pat Nixon campaigned together in his successful <a href="United%20States%20Congress">congressional</a> campaigns of 1946 and 1948. Richard Nixon was elected <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> in 1952 alongside General <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, whereupon Pat became Second Lady. Pat Nixon did much to add substance to the role of the Vice President's wife, insisting on visiting schools, orphanages, hospitals, and village markets as she undertook many missions of goodwill across the world.

As First Lady, Pat Nixon promoted a number of charitable causes, including volunteerism. She oversaw the collection of more than 600 pieces of historic art and furnishings for the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>, an acquisition larger than that of any other administration. She was the most traveled First Lady in U.S. history, a record unsurpassed until twenty-five years later. She accompanied the President as the <a href="Richard%20Nixon%27s%201972%20visit%20to%20China">first First Lady to visit China</a> and the Soviet Union, and was the first President's wife to be officially designated a representative of the United States on her solo trips to <a href="Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="South%20America">South America</a>, which gained her recognition as "Madame Ambassador"; she was also the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. Her tenure ended when, after being re-elected in a <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201972">landslide victory in 1972</a>, President Nixon resigned two years later amid the <a href="Watergate%20scandal">Watergate scandal</a>.

Her public appearances became increasingly rare later in life. She and her husband settled in <a href="San%20Clemente">San Clemente</a>, California, and later moved to <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a>. She suffered two strokes, one in 1976 and another in 1983, then was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1992. She died in 1993, aged 81.

Thelma Catherine Ryan was born in 1912 in the small mining town of <a href="Ely%2C%20Nevada">Ely, Nevada</a>. Her father, William M. Ryan Sr., was a sailor, gold miner, and <a href="market%20gardening">truck farmer</a> of Irish ancestry; her mother, Katherine Halberstadt, was a German immigrant. The nickname "Pat" was given to her by her father, because of her birth on the day before <a href="Saint%20Patrick%27s%20Day">Saint Patrick's Day</a> and her Irish ancestry. Upon enrolling in college in 1931, she stopped using the name Thelma, replacing it with Pat and occasionally spelling it Patricia. The name change was not a legal action, however, merely one of preference.

After her birth, the Ryan family moved to California, and in 1914 settled on a small truck farm in <a href="Artesia%2C%20California">Artesia</a> (present-day <a href="Cerritos%2C%20California">Cerritos</a>). Thelma Ryan's high school yearbook page gives her nickname as "Buddy" and her ambition to run a boarding house.

She worked on the family farm and also at a local bank as a janitor and bookkeeper. Her mother died of cancer in 1924. Pat, who was only 12, assumed all the household duties for her father (who died himself in of <a href="silicosis">silicosis</a> 5 years later) and her two older brothers, William Jr. (1910–1997) and Thomas (1911–1992). She also had a half-sister, Neva Bender (born 1909), and a half-brother, Matthew Bender (born 1907), from her mother's first marriage; her mother's first husband had died during a <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a> in South Dakota.

It has been said that few, if any, First Ladies worked as consistently before marrying as did Pat Nixon. As she told the writer <a href="Gloria%20Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a> during the 1968 presidential campaign, "I never had time to think about things like that—who I wanted to be, or who I admired, or to have ideas. I never had time to dream about being anyone else. I had to work."

After graduating from <a href="Excelsior%20High%20School%20%28Norwalk%2C%20California%29">Excelsior High School</a> in 1929, she attended <a href="Fullerton%20College">Fullerton Junior College</a>. She paid for her education by working odd jobs, including as a driver, a pharmacy manager, a telephone operator, and a typist. She also earned money sweeping the floors of a local bank, and from 1930 until 1932, she lived in New York City, working as a secretary and also as a <a href="Radiographer">radiographer</a>.

Determined "to make something out of myself", she enrolled in 1931 at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a> (USC), where she majored in merchandising. A former professor noted that she "stood out from the empty-headed, overdressed little sorority girls of that era like a good piece of literature on a shelf of cheap paperbacks." She held part-time jobs on campus, worked as a sales clerk in <a href="Bullocks%20Wilshire">Bullock's-Wilshire</a> department store, and taught <a href="touch%20typing">touch typing</a> and <a href="shorthand">shorthand</a> at a high school. She also supplemented her income by working as an <a href="Extra%20%28acting%29">extra</a> and <a href="bit%20player">bit player</a> in the film industry, for which she took several <a href="screen%20test">screen test</a>s. In this capacity she made brief appearances in films such as "<a href="Becky%20Sharp%20%28film%29">Becky Sharp</a>" (1935), "<a href="The%20Great%20Ziegfeld">The Great Ziegfeld</a>" (1936), and "<a href="Small%20Town%20Girl%20%281936%20film%29">Small Town Girl</a>" (1936). In some cases she ended up on the <a href="cutting%20room%20floor">cutting room floor</a>, such as with her spoken lines in "Becky Sharp". She told Hollywood columnist <a href="Erskine%20Johnson">Erskine Johnson</a> in 1959 that her time in films was "too fleeting even for recollections embellished by the years" and that "my choice of a career was teaching school and the many jobs I pursued were merely to help with college expenses."

In 1937, Pat Ryan graduated "<a href="cum%20laude">cum laude</a>" from USC with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> degree in merchandising, together with a certificate to teach at the <a href="high%20school">high school</a> level, which USC deemed equivalent to a <a href="Master%27s%20degree">Master's degree</a>. (She was arguably the best-educated First Lady until <a href="Hillary%20Rodham%20Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> in 1993.) Pat accepted a position as a high school teacher in <a href="Whittier%2C%20California">Whittier, California</a>.

While in Whittier, Pat Ryan met <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, a young lawyer who had recently graduated from the <a href="Duke%20University%20School%20of%20Law">Duke University School of Law</a>. The two became acquainted at a Little Theater group when they were cast together in "<a href="The%20Dark%20Tower%20%28play%29">The Dark Tower</a>". Known as Dick, he asked Pat to marry him the first night they went out. "I thought he was nuts or something!" she recalled. He courted the redhead he called his "wild Irish Gypsy" for two years, even driving her to and from her dates with other men.

They eventually married on June 21, 1940 at the <a href="The%20Mission%20Inn%20Hotel%20%26amp%3B%20Spa">Mission Inn</a> in <a href="Riverside%2C%20California">Riverside, California</a>. She said that she had been attracted to the young Nixon because he "was going places, he was vital and ambitious ... he was always doing things". Later, referring to Richard Nixon, she said, "Oh but you just don't realize how much fun he is! He's just so much fun!" Following a brief honeymoon in Mexico, the two lived in a small apartment in Whittier. As U.S. involvement in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> began, the couple moved to Washington, D.C., with Richard taking a position as a lawyer for the <a href="Office%20of%20Price%20Administration">Office of Price Administration</a> (OPA); Pat worked as a secretary for the <a href="American%20Red%20Cross">American Red Cross</a>, but also qualified as a price analyst for the OPA. He then joined the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, and while he was stationed in San Francisco, she resumed work for the OPA as an economic analyst.

Veteran <a href="United%20Press%20International">UPI</a> reporter <a href="Helen%20Thomas">Helen Thomas</a> suggested that in public, the Nixons "moved through life ritualistically", but privately, however, they were "very close". In private, Richard Nixon was described as being "unabashedly sentimental", often praising Pat for her work, remembering anniversaries and surprising her with frequent gifts. During state dinners, he ordered the protocol changed so that Pat could be served first. Pat, in turn, felt that her husband was vulnerable and sought to protect him. Of his critics, she said that "Lincoln had worse critics. He was big enough not to let it bother him. That's the way my husband is."

Pat campaigned at her husband's side in 1946 when he entered politics and successfully ran for a seat in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a>. That same year, she gave birth to a daughter and namesake, <a href="Patricia%20Nixon%20Cox">Patricia</a>, known as Tricia. In 1948, Pat had her second and last child, <a href="Julie%20Nixon%20Eisenhower">Julie</a>. When asked about her husband's career, Pat once stated, "The only thing I could do was help him, but [politics] was not a life I would have chosen." Pat participated in the campaign by doing research on his opponent, incumbent <a href="Jerry%20Voorhis">Jerry Voorhis</a>. She also wrote and distributed campaign literature. Nixon was elected in his first campaign to represent <a href="California%27s%2012th%20congressional%20district">California's 12th congressional district</a>. During the next six years, Pat saw her husband move from the U.S. House of Representatives to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>, and then be nominated as <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>'s <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice presidential</a> candidate.

Although Pat Nixon was a <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a>, she and her husband attended whichever <a href="Protestant%20church">Protestant church</a> was nearest to their home, especially after moving to Washington. They attended the Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Church because it sponsored her daughters' Brownie troop, occasional <a href="Baptist">Baptist</a> services with the Reverend Dr. <a href="Billy%20Graham">Billy Graham</a>, and <a href="Norman%20Vincent%20Peale">Norman Vincent Peale</a>'s <a href="Marble%20Collegiate%20Church">Marble Collegiate Church</a>.

At the time of her husband coming under consideration for the vice presidential nomination, Pat Nixon was against her husband accepting the selection, as she despised campaigns and had been relieved that as a newly elected senator he would not have another one for six years. She thought she had prevailed in convincing him, until she heard the announcement of the pick from a news bulletin while at the <a href="1952%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1952 Republican National Convention</a>. During the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201952">Presidential campaign of 1952</a>, Pat Nixon's attitude toward politics changed when her husband was accused of accepting illegal campaign contributions. Pat encouraged him to fight the charges, and he did so by delivering the famed "<a href="Checkers%20speech">Checkers speech</a>", so-called for the family's dog, a <a href="cocker%20spaniel">cocker spaniel</a> given to them by a political supporter. This was Pat's first national television appearance, and she, her daughters, and the dog were featured prominently. Defending himself as a man of the people, Nixon stressed his wife's abilities as a stenographer, then said, "I should say this, that Pat doesn't have a mink coat. But she does have a respectable Republican cloth coat, and I always tell her she would look good in anything."

Pat Nixon accompanied her husband abroad during his vice presidential years. She traveled to 53 nations, often bypassing luncheons and teas and instead visiting hospitals, orphanages, and even a <a href="leper%20colony">leper colony</a> in <a href="Panama">Panama</a>. On a trip to <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>, the Nixons' limousine was pelted with rocks and the couple was spat upon as representatives of the U.S. government.

A November 1, 1958, article in "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>" was typical of the media's favorable coverage of the future First Lady, stating that "Mrs. Nixon is always reported to be gracious and friendly. And she sure is friendly. She greets a stranger as a friend. She doesn't just shake hands but clasps a visitor's hand in both her hands. Her manner is direct ... Mrs. Nixon also upheld her reputation of always looking neat, no matter how long her day has been." A year and a half later, during her husband's campaign for the presidency, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called her "a paragon of wifely virtues" whose "efficiency makes other women feel slothful and untalented".

Pat Nixon was named Outstanding Homemaker of the Year (1953), Mother of the Year (1955), and the Nation's Ideal Housewife (1957), and once admitted that she pressed all of her husband's suits one evening. "Of course, I didn't have to," she told "The New York Times", "But when I don't have work to do, I just think up some new project."

In <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201960">the 1960 election</a>, Vice President Nixon ran for President of the United States against Democratic opponent Senator <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. Pat was featured prominently in the effort; an entire advertising campaign was built around the slogan "Pat for First Lady". Nixon conceded the election to Kennedy, although the race was very close and there were allegations of voter fraud. Pat had urged her husband to demand a recount of votes, though Nixon declined. Pat was most upset about the television cameras, which recorded her reaction when her husband lost—"millions of television viewers witnessed her desperate fight to hold a smile upon her lips as her face came apart and the bitter tears flowed from her eyes", as one reporter put it. This permanently dimmed Pat Nixon's view of politics.

In 1962, the Nixons <a href="California%20gubernatorial%20election%2C%201962">embarked on another campaign</a>, this time for <a href="Governor%20of%20California">Governor of California</a>. Prior to Richard Nixon's announcement of his candidacy, Pat's brother Tom Ryan said, "Pat told me that if Dick ran for governor she was going to take her shoe to him." She eventually agreed to another run, citing that it meant a great deal to her husband, but Richard Nixon lost the gubernatorial election to <a href="Pat%20Brown">Pat Brown</a>.

Six years later, Richard Nixon ran again for the presidency. Pat was reluctant to face another campaign, her eighth since 1946. Her husband was a deeply controversial figure in American politics, and Pat had witnessed and shared the praise and vilification he had received without having established an independent public identity for herself. Although she supported him in his career, she feared another "1960", when Nixon lost to Kennedy. She consented, however, and participated in the campaign by traveling on campaign trips with her husband. Richard Nixon would make a political comeback with his <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201968">presidential victory of 1968</a> over Vice-President <a href="Hubert%20Humphrey">Hubert Humphrey</a>—and the country would have a new First Lady.

Pat Nixon felt that the First Lady should always set a public example of high virtue as a symbol of dignity, but she refused to revel in the trappings of the position. When considering ideas for a project as First Lady, Pat refused to do (or be) something simply to emulate her predecessor, <a href="Lady%20Bird%20Johnson">Lady Bird Johnson</a>. She decided to continue what she called "personal diplomacy", which meant traveling and visiting people in other states or other nations.

One of her major initiatives as First Lady was the promotion of volunteerism, in which she encouraged Americans to address social problems at the local level through volunteering at hospitals, civic organizations, and rehabilitation centers. She stated, "Our success as a nation depends on our willingness to give generously of ourselves for the welfare and enrichment of the lives of others." She undertook a "Vest Pockets for Volunteerism" trip, where she visited ten different volunteer programs. Susan Porter, in charge of the First Lady's scheduling, noted that Pat "saw volunteers as unsung heroes who hadn't been encouraged or given credit for their sacrifices and who needed to be". Her second volunteerism tour—she traveled within the United States—helped to boost the notion that not all students were protesting the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. She herself belonged to several volunteer groups, including Women in Community Services and Urban Services League, and was an advocate of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, a bill that encouraged volunteerism by providing benefits to a number of volunteer organizations. Some reporters viewed her choice of volunteerism as safe and dull compared to the initiatives undertaken by Lady Bird Johnson and <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy">Jacqueline Kennedy</a>.

Pat Nixon became involved in the development of recreation areas and parkland, was a member of the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped, and lent her support to organizations dedicated to improving the lives of handicapped children. For her first <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> in the White House, Pat organized a meal for 225 senior citizens who did not have families. The following year, she invited wounded servicemen to a second annual Thanksgiving meal in the White House. Though presidents since <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> had been issuing Thanksgiving proclamations, Pat became the only First Lady to issue one.

After her husband was elected president in 1968, Pat Nixon met with the outgoing First Lady Lady Bird Johnson and toured the private quarters of the White House on December 12. She eventually asked Sarah Jackson Doyle, an interior decorator who had worked for the Nixons since 1965 and who decorated the family's 10-room apartment on <a href="Fifth%20Avenue">Fifth Avenue</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> with French and English antiques, to serve as a design consultant. She hired <a href="Clement%20Conger">Clement Conger</a> from the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">State Department</a> to be the Executive Mansion's new curator, replacing James Ketchum, who had been hired by Jacqueline Kennedy.

Pat Nixon developed and led a coordinated effort to improve the authenticity of the White House as an historic residence and museum. She added more than 600 paintings, antiques and furnishings to the Executive Mansion and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration; this greatly, and dramatically, expanded upon <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy">Jacqueline Kennedy</a>'s more publicized efforts. She created the <a href="Map%20Room%20%28White%20House%29">Map Room</a> and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine other rooms, including the <a href="Red%20Room%20%28White%20House%29">Red Room</a>, <a href="Blue%20Room%20%28White%20House%29">Blue Room</a> and <a href="Green%20Room%20%28White%20House%29">Green Room</a>. She worked with engineers to develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white. She ordered the American flag atop the White House flown day and night, even when the president was not in residence.

She ordered pamphlets describing the rooms of the house for tourists so they could understand everything, and had them translated into Spanish, French, Italian and Russian for foreigners. She had ramps installed for the handicapped and physically disabled. She instructed the police who served as tour guides to attend sessions at the <a href="Winterthur%20Museum%2C%20Garden%20and%20Library">Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library</a> (to learn how tours were guided "in a real museum"), and arranged for them to wear less menacing uniforms, with their guns hidden underneath. The tour guides were to speak slowly to deaf groups, to help those who lip-read, and Pat ordered that the blind be able to touch the antiques.

The First Lady had long been irritated by the perception that the White House and access to the President and First Lady were exclusively for the wealthy and famous; she would routinely come down from the family quarters to greet tourists, shake hands, sign autographs, and pose for photos. Her daughter Julie Eisenhower reflected, "she invited so many groups to the White House to give them recognition, not famous ones, but little-known organizations..."

She invited former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy and her children <a href="Caroline%20Kennedy">Caroline</a> and <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy%2C%20Jr.">John Jr.</a> to dine with her family and view the White House's official portraits of her and her husband, the late President Kennedy. It was the first time that the three Kennedys had returned to the White House since the president's assassination eight years earlier. Pat had ordered the visit to be kept secret from the media until after the trip's conclusion in an attempt to maintain privacy for the Kennedys. She also invited President Kennedy's mother <a href="Rose%20Kennedy">Rose Kennedy</a> to see her son's official portrait.

She opened the White House for evening tours so that the public could see the interior design work that had been implemented. The tours that were conducted in December displayed the White House's Christmas decor. In addition, she instituted a series of performances by artists at the White House in varied American traditions, from opera to <a href="bluegrass%20music">bluegrass</a>; among the guests were <a href="The%20Carpenters">The Carpenters</a> in 1972. These events were described as ranging from "creative to indifferent, to downright embarrassing". When they entered the White House in 1969, the Nixons began inviting families to non-denominational Sunday church services in the <a href="East%20Room">East Room</a> of the White House. She also oversaw the White House wedding of her daughter, Tricia, to <a href="Edward%20F.%20Cox">Edward Ridley Finch Cox</a> in 1971.

In October 1969, she announced her appointment of Constance Stuart as her staff director and press secretary. To the White House residence staff, the Nixons were perceived as more stiff and formal than other first families, but nonetheless kind.

She spoke out in favor of women running for political office and encouraged her husband to nominate a woman to the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">Supreme Court</a>, saying "woman power is unbeatable; I've seen it all across this country". She was the first of the American First Ladies to publicly support the <a href="Equal%20Rights%20Amendment">Equal Rights Amendment</a>, though her views on abortion were mixed. Following the Court's 1973 "<a href="Roe%20vs.%20Wade">Roe vs. Wade</a>" decision, Pat stated she was <a href="pro-choice">pro-choice</a>. However, in 1972, she said, "I'm really not for abortion. I think it's a personal thing. I mean abortion on demand—wholesale."

In 1972, she became the first Republican First Lady to address a <a href="1972%20Republican%20National%20Convention">national convention</a>. Her efforts in the 1972 reelection campaign—traveling across the country and speaking on behalf of her husband—were copied by future candidates' spouses.

Pat Nixon held the record as the most-traveled First Lady until her mark was surpassed by <a href="Hillary%20Rodham%20Clinton">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a>. In President Nixon's first term, Pat traveled to 39 of 50 states, and in the first year alone, shook hands with a quarter of a million people. She undertook many missions of goodwill to foreign nations as well. Her first foreign trip took in Guam, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, Pakistan, Romania, and England. On such trips, Pat refused to be serviced by an entourage, feeling that they were an unnecessary barrier and a burden for taxpayers. Soon after, during a trip to <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>, Pat became the first First Lady to enter a combat zone. She had tea with the wife of President <a href="Nguy%E1%BB%85n%20V%C4%83n%20Thi%E1%BB%87u">Nguyễn Văn Thiệu</a> in a palace, visited an orphanage, and lifted off in an open-door helicopter—armed by military guards with machine guns—to witness U.S. troops fighting in a jungle below. She would later admit to experiencing a "moment of fear going into a battle zone", because, as author and historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted, "Pat Nixon was literally in a line of fire." She later visited an army hospital, where, for two hours, she walked through the wards and spoke with each wounded patient. The First Lady of South Vietnam, Madame Thieu, said Pat Nixon's trip "intensified our morale".

After hearing about the <a href="1970%20Ancash%20earthquake">Great Peruvian earthquake of 1970</a>, which caused an avalanche and additional destruction, Pat initiated a "volunteer American relief drive" and flew to the country, where she aided in taking relief supplies to earthquake victims. She toured damaged regions and embraced homeless townspeople; they trailed her as she climbed up hills of rubble and under fallen beams. Her trip was heralded in newspapers around the world for her acts of compassion and disregard for her personal safety or comfort, and her presence was a direct boost to political relations. One Peruvian official commented: "Her coming here meant more than anything else President Nixon could have done," and an editorial in Peru's "Lima Prensa" said that Peruvians could never forget Pat Nixon. <a href="Fran%20Lewine">Fran Lewine</a> of the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> wrote that no First Lady had ever undertaken a "mercy mission" resulting in such "diplomatic side effects". On the trip, the Peruvian government presented her with the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Sun%20%28Peru%29">Grand Cross of the Order of the Sun</a>, the highest Peruvian distinction and the oldest such honor in the Americas.

She became the first First Lady to visit Africa in 1972, on a , eight-day journey to <a href="Ghana">Ghana</a>, <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>, and the <a href="Ivory%20Coast">Ivory Coast</a>. Upon arrival in Liberia, Pat was honored with a 19-gun salute, a tribute reserved only for heads of government, and she reviewed troops. She later donned a traditional native costume and danced with locals. She was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Most Venerable Order of Knighthood, Liberia's highest honor. In Ghana, she again danced with local residents, and addressed the nation's <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ghana">Parliament</a>. In the Ivory Coast, she was met by a quarter of a million people shouting ""Vive Madame Nixon!"" She conferred with leaders of all three African nations. Upon her return home, White House staffer <a href="Charles%20Colson">Charles Colson</a> sent a memo to the President reading in part, "Mrs. Nixon has now broken through where we have failed ... People—men and women—identify with her, and in return with you."
Another notable journey was the <a href="1972%20Nixon%20visit%20to%20China">Nixons' historic visit</a> to the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> in 1972. While President Nixon was in meetings, Pat toured through <a href="Peking">Peking</a> in her red coat. According to Carl Sferrazza Anthony, China was Pat Nixon's "moment", her turning point as an acclaimed First Lady in the United States. She accompanied her husband to the Nixon–<a href="Leonid%20Brezhnev">Brezhnev</a> summit meetings in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> later in the year. Though security constraints left her unable to walk freely through the streets as she did in China, Pat was still able to visit with children and walk arm-in-arm with <a href="Soviet%20First%20Lady">Soviet First Lady</a> <a href="Viktoria%20Brezhneva">Viktoria Brezhneva</a>. Later, she visited <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a> and <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a> in 1974 with the unique diplomatic standing of personal representative of the president. The Nixons' last major trip was in June 1974, to Austria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Israel, and Jordan.

The traditional role of a First Lady as the nation's hostess puts her personal appearance and style under scrutiny, and the attention to Pat was lively. "<a href="Women%27s%20Wear%20Daily">Women's Wear Daily</a>" stated that Pat had a "good figure and good posture", as well as "the best-looking legs of any woman in public life today". Some fashion writers tended to have a lackluster opinion of her well tailored, but nondescript, American-made clothes. "I consider it my duty to use American designers", she said, and favored them because, "they are now using so many materials which are great for traveling because they're non crushable". She preferred to buy readymade garments rather than made-to-order outfits. "I'm a size 10," she told "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". "I can just walk in and buy. I've bought things in various stores in various cities. Only some of my clothes are by designers." She did, however, wear the custom work of some well-known talents, notably <a href="Geoffrey%20Beene">Geoffrey Beene</a>, at the suggestion of Clara Treyz, her personal shopper. Many fashion observers concluded that Pat Nixon did not greatly advance the cause of American fashion. Nixon's yellow-satin inaugural gown by Harvey Berin was criticized as "a schoolteacher on her night out", but Treyz defended her wardrobe selections by saying, "Mrs. Nixon must be ladylike."

Nixon did not sport the outrageous fashions of the 1970s, because she was concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose. "Always before, it was sort of fun to get some ... thing that was completely different, high-style", she told a reporter. "But this is not appropriate now. I avoid the spectacular."

At the time the Watergate scandal broke to the media, Nixon "barely noticed" the reports of a break-in at the <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> headquarters. Later, when asked by the press about Watergate, she replied curtly, "I know only what I read in the newspapers." In 1974, when a reporter asked "Is the press the cause of the president's problems?", she shot back, "What problems?" Privately, she felt that the power of her husband's staff was increasing, and President Nixon was becoming more removed from what was occurring in the administration."
Pat Nixon did not know of the secret tape recordings her husband had made. <a href="Julie%20Nixon%20Eisenhower">Julie Nixon Eisenhower</a> stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately, had she known of their existence. Once she did learn of the tapes, she vigorously opposed making them public, and compared them to "private love letters—for one person alone". Believing in her husband's innocence, she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him. She said to her friend Helene Drown, "Dick has done so much for the country. Why is this happening?"

After President Nixon told his family he would resign the office of the presidency, she replied, "But why?" She contacted White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new <a href="White%20House%20china">official china pattern</a> from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the <a href="Sunroom">solarium</a> of the White House for their last dinner. Pat sat on the edge of a couch and held her chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling."

On the morning of August 9 in the East Room, Nixon gave a televised 20-minute farewell speech to the White House staff, during which time he read from <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s biography and praised his own parents. The First Lady could hardly contain her tears; she was most upset about the cameras, because they recorded her anguish, as they had during the 1960 election defeat. The Nixons walked onto the Executive Mansion's South Lawn with Vice President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> and Betty Ford. The outgoing president would depart from the White House on <a href="Marine%20One">Marine One</a>. As the family walked towards the helicopter, Pat, with one arm around her husband's waist and one around Betty's, said to Betty, "You'll see many of these red carpets, and you'll get so you hate 'em." The helicopter transported them to <a href="Andrews%20Air%20Force%20Base">Andrews Air Force Base</a>; from there they flew to California.

Pat Nixon later told her daughter Julie, "Watergate is the only crisis that ever got me down ... And I know I will never live to see the vindication."

Historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony noted that ordinary citizens responded to, and identified with, Pat Nixon. When a group of people from a rural community visited the White House to present a quilt to the First Lady, many were overcome with nervousness; upon hearing their weeping, Pat hugged each individual tightly, and the tension dissipated. When a young boy doubted that the Executive Mansion was her house because he could not see her washing machine, Pat led him through the halls and up an elevator, into the family quarters and the laundry room. She mixed well with people of different races, and made no distinctions on that basis. During the Nixons' trip to China in 1972, foreign minister <a href="Zhou%20En-lai">Zhou En-lai</a> was sufficiently smitten with her so as to give two rare <a href="giant%20panda">giant panda</a>s to the United States as a gift from China.

Pat Nixon was listed on the <a href="Gallup%20Organization">Gallup Organization</a>'s <a href="Gallup%27s%20most%20admired%20man%20and%20woman%20poll">top-ten list of the most admired women</a> fourteen times, from 1959 to 1962 and 1968 to 1979. She was ranked third in 1969, second in 1970 and 1971, and first in 1972. She remained on the top-ten list until 1979, five years after her husband left office. To many, she was seen as an example of the "<a href="American%20Dream">American Dream</a>," having risen from a poor background, with her greatest popularity among the "great silent majority" of voters. Mary Brooks, the director of the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">United States Mint</a> and a long-time friend of Pat's, illustrated some of the cultural divides present at the time when she described the First Lady as "a good example to the women of this country–if they're not part of those Women's Liberation groups." Additionally, it was the view of veteran UPI correspondent <a href="Helen%20Thomas">Helen Thomas</a> that Pat "was the warmest First Lady I covered and the one who loved people the most. I think newspeople who covered her saw a woman who was sharp, responsive, sensitive."

Press accounts <a href="Framing%20%28social%20sciences%29">framed</a> Pat Nixon as an embodiment of <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> domesticity, in stark contrast to the <a href="second-wave%20feminism">second-wave feminism</a> of the time. Journalists often portrayed her as dutiful and selfless and seeing herself as a wife first and individual second. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine described her as "the perfect wife and mother–pressing [her husband's] pants, making dresses for daughters Tricia and Julie, doing her own housework even as the Vice President's wife." In the early years of her tenure as First Lady she was tagged "Plastic Pat," a derogatory nickname applied because, according to critics, she was always smiling while her face rarely expressed emotion and her body language made her seem reserved, and at times, artificial. Some observers described Pat Nixon as "a paper doll, a <a href="Barbie%20doll">Barbie doll</a>–plastic, antiseptic, unalive" and that she "put every bit of the energy and drive of her youth into playing a role, and she may no longer recognize it as such".

As for the criticisms, she said, "I am who I am and I will continue to be." She unguardedly revealed some of her opinions of her own life in a 1968 interview aboard a campaign plane with <a href="Gloria%20Steinem">Gloria Steinem</a>: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people. I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you ... all those people who had it easy."

Despite her largely demure public persona as a traditional wife and homemaker, she was not as self-effacing and timid as her critics often claimed. When a news photographer wanted her to strike yet another pose while wearing an apron, she firmly responded, "I think we've had enough of this kitchen thing, don't you?" Some journalists, such as columnist and White House Correspondent <a href="Robert%20E%20Thompson">Robert Thompson</a>, felt that Pat was an ideal balance for the 1970s; Thompson wrote that she proved that "women can play a vital role in world affairs" while still retaining a "feminine manner." Other journalists felt that Pat represented the failings of the <a href="feminine%20mystique">feminine mystique</a>, and portrayed her as being out of step with her times. Those who opposed the Vietnam War identified her with the Nixon administration's policies, and, as a result, occasionally picketed her speaking events. After she had spoken to some of them in one instance in 1970, however, one of the students told the press that "she wanted to listen. I felt like this is a woman who really cares about what we are doing. I was surprised." Veteran CBS correspondent <a href="Mike%20Wallace">Mike Wallace</a> expressed regret that the one major interview he was never able to conduct was that of Pat Nixon.

After returning to <a href="San%20Clemente%2C%20California">San Clemente, California</a>, in 1974 and settling into the Nixons' home, "<a href="La%20Casa%20Pacifica">La Casa Pacifica</a>", Pat Nixon rarely appeared in public and only granted occasional interviews to the press. In late May 1975, Pat went to her girlhood town of Artesia to dedicate the <a href="Patricia%20Nixon%20Elementary%20School">Patricia Nixon Elementary School</a>. In her remarks, she said, "I'm proud to have the school carry my name. I always thought that only those who have gone had schools named after them. I am happy to tell you that I'm not gone—I mean, not really gone." It was Pat's only solo public appearance in five and a half years in California.

On July 7, 1976 at "La Casa Pacifica", Nixon suffered a <a href="stroke">stroke</a>, which resulted in the paralysis of her entire left side. <a href="Physical%20therapy">Physical therapy</a> enabled her to eventually regain all movement. She said that her recovery was "the hardest thing I have ever done physically". In 1979, she and her husband moved to a townhouse on East 65th Street in <a href="Manhattan%2C%20New%20York">Manhattan, New York</a>. They lived there only briefly and in 1981 moved to a house in <a href="Saddle%20River%2C%20New%20Jersey">Saddle River</a>, New Jersey. This gave the couple additional space, and enabled them to be near their children and grandchildren. Pat, however, sustained another stroke in 1983 and two lung infections the following year.

In December 1987, Richard Nixon wrote to <a href="Donald%20Trump">Donald Trump</a> about Pat Nixon believing that Trump had performed well on "<a href="The%20Phil%20Donahue%20Show">The Phil Donahue Show</a>", Nixon furthering that his wife was "an expert on politics" and that she had predicted Trump would win when he decided to run for office. Decades later, Trump would enter the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016 U.S. presidential election</a> and fulfill her prophecy by becoming President of the United States. 
Appearing "frail and slightly bent", she appeared in public for the opening of the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace (now <a href="Richard%20Nixon%20Presidential%20Library%20and%20Museum">Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum</a>) in <a href="Yorba%20Linda%2C%20California">Yorba Linda</a>, California on July 19, 1990. The dedication ceremony included 50,000 friends and well-wishers, as well as former Presidents Ford, Reagan, and Bush and their wives. The library includes a Pat Nixon room, a Pat Nixon amphitheater, and rose gardens planted with the red-black Pat Nixon Rose developed by a French company in 1972, when she was first lady. Pat also attended the opening of the <a href="Ronald%20Reagan%20Presidential%20Library">Ronald Reagan Presidential Library</a> in <a href="Simi%20Valley%2C%20California">Simi Valley</a>, California in November 1991. Former First Lady <a href="Barbara%20Bush">Barbara Bush</a> reflected, "I loved Pat Nixon, who was a sensational, gracious, and thoughtful First Lady", and at the dedication of the Reagan Library, Bush remembered, "There was one sad thing. Pat Nixon did not look well at all. Through her smile you could see that she was in great pain and having a terrible time getting air into her lungs."

The Nixons moved to a gated complex in <a href="Park%20Ridge%2C%20New%20Jersey">Park Ridge</a>, New Jersey, in 1991. Pat's health was failing, and the house was smaller and contained an elevator. A heavy smoker most of her adult life who nevertheless never allowed herself to be seen with a cigarette in public, she eventually endured bouts of <a href="oral%20cancer">oral cancer</a>, <a href="emphysema">emphysema</a>, and ultimately <a href="lung%20cancer">lung cancer</a>, with which she was diagnosed in December 1992 while hospitalized with respiratory problems.

Pat Nixon died at her Park Ridge, New Jersey, home at 5:45 a.m. on June 22, 1993, the day after her fifty-third wedding anniversary. She was 81 years old. Her daughters and husband were by her side.

The funeral service for Pat Nixon took place in the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, including <a href="Governor%20of%20California">California Governor</a> <a href="Pete%20Wilson">Pete Wilson</a>, Kansas senator <a href="Bob%20Dole">Bob Dole</a>, and the Reverend Dr. <a href="Billy%20Graham">Billy Graham</a>, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> and <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> and their wives, <a href="Nancy%20Reagan">Nancy</a> and <a href="Betty%20Ford">Betty</a>, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a> did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.

Nixon's tombstone gives her name as "Patricia Ryan Nixon", the name by which she was popularly known. Former President Nixon survived her by ten months, dying on April 22, 1994. Her <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> reads: 

In 1994, the <a href="Pat%20Nixon%20Park">Pat Nixon Park</a> was established in <a href="Cerritos%2C%20California">Cerritos, California</a>. The site where her girlhood home stood is on the property. The Cerritos City Council voted in April 1996 to erect a statue of the former first lady, one of the few statues created in the image of a first lady.

Pat has been portrayed by <a href="Joan%20Allen">Joan Allen</a> in the 1995 film "<a href="Nixon%20%28film%29">Nixon</a>", <a href="Patty%20McCormack">Patty McCormack</a> in the 2008 film "<a href="Frost/Nixon%20%28film%29">Frost/Nixon</a>" and <a href="Nicole%20Sullivan">Nicole Sullivan</a> in the 2009 film "<a href="Black%20Dynamite">Black Dynamite</a>". She was sung by soprano Carolann Page in <a href="John%20Adams%20%28composer%29">John Adams</a>' opera "<a href="Nixon%20in%20China%20%28opera%29">Nixon in China</a>" 1987 world premiere in Houston, Texas; a "New York Times" critic noted that the performance captured "the First Lady's shy mannerisms" while one from the "Los Angeles Times" described the subject as the "chronically demure First Lady". The part was later sung by Scottish soprano Janis Kelly in the 2011 <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> premiere in New York. This "New York Times" critic wrote that Kelly "was wonderful as Pat Nixon. During the affecting Act II scene in which she is guided by Chinese escorts and journalists to a glass factory, a people's commune and a health clinic, she is finally taken to a school. She speaks of coming from a poor family and tells the obliging children that for a while she was a schoolteacher. In Mr. Adams's tender music, as sung by Ms. Kelly, you sense Mrs. Nixon wistfully pondering the much different life she might have had."

Battle of Ticonderoga (1759)

The 1759 Battle of Ticonderoga was a minor confrontation at <a href="Fort%20Carillon">Fort Carillon</a> (later renamed <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a>) on July 26 and 27, 1759, during the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>. A British military force of more than 11,000 men under the command of General Sir <a href="Jeffery%20Amherst%2C%201st%20Baron%20Amherst">Jeffery Amherst</a> moved artillery to high ground overlooking the fort, which was defended by a garrison of 400 Frenchmen under the command of Brigadier General <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Charles%20de%20Bourlamaque">François-Charles de Bourlamaque</a>.

Rather than defend the fort, de Bourlamaque, operating under instructions from General <a href="Louis-Joseph%20de%20Montcalm">Louis-Joseph de Montcalm</a> and <a href="New%20France">New France</a>'s <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20New%20France">governor</a>, the <a href="Pierre%20de%20Rigaud%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Vaudreuil-Cavagnial">Marquis de Vaudreuil</a>, withdrew his forces, and attempted to blow up the fort. The fort's <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">powder magazine</a> was destroyed, but its walls were not severely damaged. The British then occupied the fort, which was afterwards known by the name Fort Ticonderoga. They embarked on a series of improvements to the area and began construction of a fleet to conduct military operations on <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>.

The French tactics were sufficient to prevent Amherst's army from joining <a href="James%20Wolfe">James Wolfe</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Plains%20of%20Abraham">Battle of the Plains of Abraham</a>. However, they also tied up 3,000 of their own troops that were not able to assist in Quebec's defense. The capture of the fort, which had previously <a href="Battle%20of%20Carillon">repulsed a large British army a year earlier</a>, contributed to the <a href="Annus%20Mirabilis%20of%201759">Annus Mirabilis of 1759</a>.

The <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, which started in 1754 over territorial disputes in what are now western <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and upstate <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, had finally turned in the favor of the British in 1758 following a string of defeats in 1756 and 1757. The British were successful in <a href="Siege%20of%20Louisbourg%20%281758%29">capturing Louisbourg</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Frontenac">Fort Frontenac</a> in 1758. The only significant French victory in 1758 came when a large British army commanded by <a href="James%20Abercrombie%20%28British%20Army%20general%29">James Abercrombie</a> was defeated by a smaller French force in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carillon">Battle of Carillon</a>. During the following winter, French commanders withdrew most of the <a href="garrison">garrison</a> from Fort Carillon (called <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Ticonderoga</a> by the British) to defend <a href="Quebec%20City%2C%20Quebec">Quebec City</a>, <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> and French-controlled forts on the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> and the <a href="Saint%20Lawrence%20River">Saint Lawrence River</a>.

Carillon, located near the southern end of <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>, occupied a place that was strategic in importance even before <a href="Samuel%20de%20Champlain">Samuel de Champlain</a> discovered it in 1609, controlling access to a key <a href="portage">portage</a> trail between Champlain and <a href="Lake%20George%20%28New%20York%29">Lake George</a> along the main travel route between the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> valley and the Saint Lawrence River. When the war began, the area was part of the <a href="frontier">frontier</a> between the British <a href="province%20of%20New%20York">province of New York</a> and the French <a href="Canada%2C%20New%20France">province of Canada</a>, and the British had stopped French advances further south in the 1755 <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20George">Battle of Lake George</a>. However, the fort was constructed in a difficult location: in order to build on rock, the French had sited it relatively far from the lake, while it was still below nearby hilltops.

For the 1759 campaign, British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">secretary of state</a>, <a href="William%20Pitt%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Chatham">William Pitt</a>, ordered General <a href="Jeffery%20Amherst%2C%201st%20Baron%20Amherst">Jeffery Amherst</a>, the victor at Louisbourg, to lead an army into <a href="Canada%2C%20New%20France">Canada</a> by sailing north on Lake Champlain, while a second force under <a href="James%20Wolfe">James Wolfe</a>, who distinguished himself while serving under Amherst at Louisbourg, was targeted at the city of Quebec via the Saint Lawrence. Instructions were sent to the governors of the <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">Thirteen Colonies</a> to raise up 20,000 provincial <a href="militia">militia</a> for these campaigns. About 8,000 provincial men were raised and sent to <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany</a> by provinces as far south as Pennsylvania and New Jersey. New York sent 3,000 men and <a href="Province%20of%20New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> sent 1,000. <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Massachusetts</a> mustered 6,500 men; about 3,500 went to Albany, while the remainder were dispatched for service with Wolfe at Quebec or other service in <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>. The balance of the provincial men came from the other <a href="New%20England">New England</a> provinces and <a href="Province%20of%20Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. When <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> Pennsylvania balked at sending any men, Amherst convinced them to raise men by threatening to withdraw troops from forts in the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> Valley on the province's western <a href="frontier">frontier</a>, which were regularly subjected to threats from Indians and the French.
When Amherst learned through Sir <a href="Sir%20William%20Johnson%2C%201st%20Baronet">William Johnson</a> that the <a href="Iroquois%20League">Iroquois League</a> was prepared to support British efforts to drive the French out of their frontier forts, he decided to send an expedition to capture <a href="Fort%20Niagara">Fort Niagara</a>. He sent 2,000 of the provincials west from Albany along with 3,000 <a href="regular%20army">regular</a> troops under Brigadier General <a href="John%20Prideaux%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Prideaux</a> in May. He led the remainder of the provincials, consisting primarily of Massachusetts, New Jersey, and Connecticut men, north to <a href="Fort%20Edward%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Fort Edward</a>, where they joined 6,000 regular troops (about 2,000 <a href="42nd%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">Royal Highlanders</a>, as well as the <a href="Royal%20Leicestershire%20Regiment">17th</a>, <a href="27th%20%28Inniskilling%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">27th</a>, and <a href="53rd%20%28Shropshire%29%20Regiment%20of%20Foot">53rd</a> <a href="List%20of%20Regiments%20of%20Foot">regiments of foot</a>, the 1st Battalion of the <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">60th Foot</a>, about 100 <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, 700 of <a href="Rogers%27%20Rangers">Rogers' Rangers</a>, and 500 <a href="light%20infantry">light infantry</a> under <a href="Thomas%20Gage">Thomas Gage</a>).

In the 1759 campaign, French war planners directed most of their war resources into the European theater of the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War%23Strategies">Seven Years' War</a>. In February, France's war minister, Marshal <a href="Charles%20Louis%20Auguste%20Fouquet%2C%20duc%20de%20Belle-Isle">Belle-Isle</a>, notified General <a href="Louis-Joseph%20de%20Montcalm">Louis-Joseph de Montcalm</a>, who was responsible for the defense of Canada, that he would not receive any significant support from France, due in large part to English naval domination of the Atlantic and the risks associated with sending a large military force under those circumstances. Belle-Isle impressed on Montcalm the importance of maintaining at least a foothold in North America, as the territory would be virtually impossible to retake otherwise. Montcalm responded, "Unless we have unexpected luck, or stage a diversion elsewhere within North America, Canada will fall during the coming campaign season. The English have 60,000 men, we have 11,000."
Montcalm decided to focus French manpower on defending the core territory of Canada: <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, the <a href="Quebec%20City">city of Quebec</a>, and the Saint Lawrence River Valley. He placed 3,000 troops from the <a href="R%C3%A9giment%20de%20la%20Reine">la Reine</a> and <a href="R%C3%A9giment%20de%20Berry">Berry</a> regiments under Brigadier General <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Charles%20de%20Bourlamaque">François-Charles de Bourlamaque</a> for the defense south of Montreal, of which around 2,300 were assigned to <a href="Fort%20Carillon">Fort Carillon</a>. He knew (after his own experience in the previous year's battle there) that this force was too small to hold Carillon against a determined attack by a force with competent leaders. Instructions from Montcalm and <a href="New%20France">New France</a>'s governor, the <a href="Pierre%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20de%20Rigaud%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Vaudreuil-Cavagnal">Marquis de Vaudreuil</a>, to de Bourlamaque were to hold Carillon as long as possible, then to destroy it, as well as the nearby <a href="Fort%20St.%20Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric">Fort St. Frédéric</a>, before retreating toward Montreal.
Although General Amherst had been ordered to move his forces "as early in the year, as on or about, the 7th of May, if the season shall happen to permit", Amherst's army of 11,000 did not leave the southern shores of <a href="Lake%20George%20%28New%20York%29">Lake George</a> until July 21. There were several reasons for the late departure. One was logistical; Prideaux's expedition to forts <a href="Fort%20Oswego">Oswego</a> and <a href="Fort%20Niagara">Niagara</a> also departed from Albany; another was the slow arrival of provincial militias.
When his troops landed and began advancing on the fort, Amherst was pleased to learn that the French had abandoned the outer defenses. He still proceeded with caution, occupying the old French lines from the 1758 battle on July 22, amid reports that the French were actively loading <a href="bateaux">bateaux</a> at the fort. His original plan had been to flank the fort, denying the road to Fort St. Frédéric as a means of French escape. In the absence of French resistance outside the fort, he decided instead to focus his attention on the fort itself.

For the next three days, the British entrenched and began laying <a href="siege">siege</a> lines to establish positions near the fort. This work was complicated by the fact there was little diggable ground near the fort, and sandbags were required to protect the siege works. During this time, the French gun batteries fired, at times quite heavily, on the British positions. On July 25, a detachment of Rogers' Rangers launched some boats onto the lake north of the fort and cut a <a href="log%20boom">log boom</a> the French had placed to prevent ships from moving further north on the lake. By July 26, the British had pulled artillery to within of the fort's walls.

Bourlamaque had withdrawn with all but 400 of his men to Fort St. Frédéric as soon as he learned that the British were approaching. The cannon fire by this small force killed five and wounded another 31 of the besieging British. Captain Louis-Philippe Le Dossu d'Hébécourt, who had been left in command of the fort, judged on the evening of July 26 that it was time to leave. His men aimed the fort's guns at its walls, laid mines, and put down a powder trail to the overstocked <a href="Magazine%20%28artillery%29">powder magazine</a>. They then lit the fuse and abandoned the fort, leaving the French flag flying. The British were notified of this action by the arrival of French deserters. General Amherst offered 100 <a href="Guinea%20%28British%20coin%29">guineas</a> to any man willing to enter the works to find and douse the fuse; but no one was willing to take up the offer. The entire works went off late that evening with a tremendous roar. The powder magazine was destroyed, and a number of wooden structures caught fire due to flying embers, but the fort's walls were not badly damaged. After the explosion, some of Gage's light infantry rushed into the fort and retrieved the French flag. Fires in the fort were not entirely extinguished for two days.

The British began occupying the fort the next day. In one consequence of the French forces' hasty departure from Carillon, one of their scouting parties returned to the fort, believing it to still be in French hands; forty men were taken prisoner.

The retreating French destroyed Fort St. Frédéric on July 31, leaving the way clear for the British to begin military operations on Lake Champlain (denying the British access to Champlain had been the reason for the existence of both forts). However, the French had a small armed fleet, which would first need to be neutralized. The time needed to capture and effect some repairs to the two forts, as well as the need to build ships for use on Lake Champlain, delayed Amherst's forces further and prevented him from joining General Wolfe at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Plains%20of%20Abraham">Siege of Quebec</a>. Amherst, worried that Bourlamaque's retreat might be leading him into a trap, spent August and September overseeing the construction of a small navy, <a href="Fort%20Crown%20Point">Fort Crown Point</a> (a new fort next to the ruins of Fort St. Frédéric), and supply roads to the area from New England.

On October 11, Amherst's army began to sail and row north on Lake Champlain to attack Bourlamaque's position at the <a href="%C3%8Ele-aux-Noix">Île-aux-Noix</a> in the <a href="Richelieu%20River">Richelieu River</a>. Over the next two days, one of the French ships was captured; the French abandoned and burned the others to prevent their capture. On October 18, he received word of Quebec's fall. As there was an "appearance of winter" (parts of the lake were beginning to freeze), and provincial militia enlistments were set to end on November 1, Amherst called off his attack, dismissed his militia forces, and returned the army to winter quarters.
The British definitively gained control of Canada with the surrender of Montreal in 1760. Fort Carillon, which had always been called "Ticonderoga" by the British (after the place where the fort is located), was held by them through the end of the French and Indian War. Following that war, it was manned by small garrisons until 1775, when it was <a href="Capture%20of%20Fort%20Ticonderoga">captured by American militia</a> early in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>.

A major reenactment of French and Indian War events took place at Fort Ticonderoga on June 26–27, 2009.

Père Goriot

Le Père Goriot (, "Old Goriot" or "Father Goriot") is an 1835 novel by French novelist and playwright <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> (1799–1850), included in the "Scènes de la vie privée" section of his <a href="novel%20sequence">novel sequence</a> "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>". Set in Paris in 1819, it follows the intertwined lives of three characters: the elderly doting Goriot; a mysterious criminal-in-hiding named <a href="Vautrin">Vautrin</a>; and a naive law student named <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Rastignac">Eugène de Rastignac</a>.

Originally published in <a href="Serial%20%28literature%29">serial</a> form during the winter of 1834/35, "Le Père Goriot" is widely considered Balzac's most important novel. It marks the first serious use by the author of characters who had appeared in other books, a technique that distinguishes Balzac's fiction. The novel is also noted as an example of his <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realist</a> style, using minute details to create character and <a href="subtext">subtext</a>.

The novel takes place during the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">Bourbon Restoration</a>, which brought profound changes to French society; the struggle by individuals to secure a higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters – especially young Rastignac, who grew up in the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.

The novel was released to mixed reviews. Some critics praised the author for his complex characters and attention to detail; others condemned him for his many depictions of corruption and greed. A favorite of Balzac's, the book quickly won widespread popularity and has often been adapted for film and the stage. It gave rise to the French expression "", a social climber willing to use any means to better his situation.

"Le Père Goriot" begins in June 1819, following <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a>'s defeat at <a href="Battle%20of%20Waterloo">Waterloo</a>, after the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">House of Bourbon</a> had been <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">restored</a> to the throne of France. Tension was mounting between the <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a>, which had returned with <a href="Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France">King Louis XVIII</a>, and the <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> produced by the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>. During this era, France saw a tightening of social structures, with a lower class steeped in overwhelming poverty. By one estimate, almost three-quarters of Parisians did not make the 500–600 <a href="franc">franc</a>s a year required for a minimal standard of living. At the same time, this upheaval made possible a social mobility unthinkable during the <a href="Ancien%20R%C3%A9gime">Ancien Régime</a> of previous centuries. Individuals willing to adapt themselves to the rules of this new society could sometimes ascend into its upper echelons from modest backgrounds, much to the distaste of the established wealthy class.

When Balzac began writing "Le Père Goriot" in 1834, he had written several dozen books, including a stream of <a href="pseudonym">pseudonym</a>ously published <a href="potboiler">potboiler</a> novels. In 1829 he published "<a href="Les%20Chouans">Les Chouans</a>", the first novel to which he signed his own name; this was followed by "<a href="Louis%20Lambert%20%28novel%29">Louis Lambert</a>" (1832), "<a href="Le%20Colonel%20Chabert%20%28novel%29">Le Colonel Chabert</a>" (1832), and "<a href="La%20Peau%20de%20chagrin">La Peau de chagrin</a>" (1831). Around this time, Balzac began organizing his work into a <a href="novel%20sequence">sequence of novels</a> that he eventually called "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>", divided into sections representing various aspects of life in France during the early 19th century.

One of these aspects which fascinated Balzac was the life of crime. In the winter of 1828–29, a French <a href="confidence%20trick">grifter</a>-turned-policeman named <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Vidocq">Eugène François Vidocq</a> published a pair of sensationalized memoirs recounting his criminal exploits. Balzac met Vidocq in April 1834, and used him as a model for a character named <a href="Vautrin">Vautrin</a> he was planning for an upcoming novel.

In the summer of 1834 Balzac began to work on a tragic story about a father who is rejected by his daughters. His journal records several undated lines about the plot: "Subject of Old Goriot – A good man – middle-class lodging-house – 600 fr. income – having stripped himself bare for his daughters who both have 50,000 fr. income – dying like a dog." He wrote the first draft of "Le Père Goriot" in forty autumn days; it was published as a <a href="Serial%20%28literature%29">serial</a> in the "<a href="Revue%20de%20Paris">Revue de Paris</a>" between December and February. It was released as a novel in March 1835 by the publishing house of Werdet, who also published the second edition in May. A much-revised third edition was published in 1839 by Charpentier. As was his custom, Balzac made copious notes and changes on proofs he received from publishers, so that the later editions of his novels were often significantly different from the earliest. In the case of "Le Père Goriot", he changed a number of the characters into persons from other novels he had written, and added new paragraphs filled with detail.

The character <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20de%20Rastignac">Eugène de Rastignac</a> had appeared as an old man in Balzac's earlier philosophical fantasy novel "<a href="La%20Peau%20de%20chagrin">La Peau de chagrin</a>". While writing the first draft of "Le Père Goriot", Balzac named the character "Massiac", but he decided to use the same character from "La Peau de chagrin". Other characters were changed in a similar fashion. It was his first structured use of recurring characters, a practice whose depth and rigor came to characterize his novels.

In 1843 Balzac placed "Le Père Goriot" in the section of "La Comédie humaine" entitled "Scènes de la vie parisienne" ("Scenes of life in Paris"). Quickly thereafter, he reclassified it – due to its intense focus on the private lives of its characters – as one of the "Scènes de la vie privée" ("Scenes of private life"). These categories and the novels in them were his attempt to create a body of work "depicting all society, sketching it in the immensity of its turmoil". Although he had prepared only a small predecessor for "La Comédie humaine", entitled "Études de Mœurs", at this time, Balzac carefully considered each work's place in the project and frequently rearranged its structure.

The novel opens with an extended description of the Maison Vauquer, a <a href="boarding%20house">boarding house</a> in Paris' "rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève" covered with vines, owned by the widow Madame Vauquer. The residents include the law student Eugène de Rastignac, a mysterious agitator named Vautrin, and an elderly retired <a href="vermicelli">vermicelli</a>-maker named Jean-Joachim Goriot. The old man is ridiculed frequently by the other boarders, who soon learn that he has bankrupted himself to support his two well-married daughters.

Rastignac, who moved to Paris from the south of France, becomes attracted to the upper class. He has difficulty fitting in, but is tutored by his cousin, Madame de Beauséant, in the ways of high society. Rastignac endears himself to one of Goriot's daughters, Delphine, after extracting money from his own already-poor family. Vautrin, meanwhile, tries to convince Rastignac to pursue an unmarried woman named Victorine, whose family fortune is blocked only by her brother. He offers to clear the way for Rastignac by having the brother killed in a <a href="duel">duel</a>.

Rastignac refuses to go along with the plot, balking at the idea of having someone killed to acquire their wealth, but he takes note of Vautrin's machinations. This is a lesson in the harsh realities of high society. Before long, the boarders learn that police are seeking Vautrin, revealed to be a master criminal nicknamed "Trompe-la-Mort" ("Cheater of Death"). Vautrin arranges for a friend to kill Victorine's brother, in the meantime, and is captured by the police.

Goriot, supportive of Rastignac's interest in his daughter and furious with her husband's tyrannical control over her, finds himself unable to help. When his other daughter, Anastasie, informs him that she has been selling off her husband's family jewelry to pay her lover's debts, the old man is overcome with grief at his own impotence and suffers a <a href="stroke">stroke</a>.

Delphine does not visit Goriot as he lies on his deathbed, and Anastasie arrives too late, only once he has lost consciousness. Before dying, Goriot rages about their disrespect toward him. His funeral is attended only by Rastignac, a servant named Christophe, and two <a href="professional%20mourning">paid mourners</a>. Goriot's daughters, rather than being present at the funeral, send their empty coaches, each bearing their families' respective coat of arms. After the short ceremony, Rastignac turns to face Paris as the lights of evening begin to appear. He sets out to dine with Delphine de Nucingen and declares to the city: "À nous deux, maintenant!" ("It's between you and me now!")

Balzac's style in "Le Père Goriot" is influenced by the American novelist <a href="James%20Fenimore%20Cooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a> and Scottish writer <a href="Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a>. In Cooper's representations of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, Balzac saw a human barbarism that survived through attempts at civilization. In a preface to the second edition in 1835, Balzac wrote that the title character Goriot – who made his fortune selling <a href="vermicelli">vermicelli</a> during a time of widespread hunger – was an "<a href="Illinois%20Confederation">Illinois</a> of the flour trade" and a "<a href="Wyandot%20people">Huron</a> of the grain market". Vautrin refers to Paris as "a forest of the New World where twenty varieties of savage tribes clash" – another sign of Cooper's influence.

Scott was also a profound influence on Balzac, particularly in his use of real historical events as the backdrop for his novels. Although history is not central to "Le Père Goriot", the post-Napoleonic era serves as an important setting, and Balzac's use of meticulous detail reflects the influence of Scott. In his 1842 introduction to "La Comédie humaine", Balzac praises Scott as a "modern troubadour" who "vivified [literature] with the spirit of the past". At the same time, Balzac accused the Scottish writer of romanticizing history, and tried to distinguish his own work with a more balanced view of human nature.

Although the novel is often referred to as "a mystery", it is not an example of <a href="whodunit">whodunit</a> or <a href="detective%20fiction">detective fiction</a>. Instead, the central puzzles are the origins of suffering and the motivations of unusual behavior. Characters appear in fragments, with brief scenes providing small clues about their identity. Vautrin, for example, slips in and out of the story – offering advice to Rastignac, ridiculing Goriot, bribing the housekeeper Christophe to let him in after hours – before he is revealed as a master criminal. This pattern of people moving in and out of view mirrors Balzac's use of characters throughout "La Comédie humaine".

"Le Père Goriot" is also recognized as a "<a href="bildungsroman">bildungsroman</a>", wherein a naive young person matures while learning the ways of the world. Rastignac is tutored by Vautrin, Madame de Beauséant, Goriot, and others about the truth of Parisian society and the coldly dispassionate and brutally realistic strategies required for social success. As an <a href="everyman">everyman</a>, he is initially repulsed by the gruesome realities beneath society's gilded surfaces; eventually, however, he embraces them. Setting aside his original goal of mastering the law, he pursues money and women as instruments for social climbing. In some ways this mirrors Balzac's own social education, reflecting the distaste he acquired for the law after studying it for three years.

"Le Père Goriot", especially in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly different times of life. Pleased with the effect he achieved with the return of Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of "Le Père Goriot" that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac's appearance shows, for the first time in Balzac's fiction, a novel-length <a href="backstory">backstory</a> that illuminates and develops a returning character.

Balzac experimented with this method throughout the thirty years he worked on "La Comédie humaine". It enabled a depth of <a href="characterization">characterization</a> that went beyond simple narration or dialogue. "When the characters reappear", notes the critic <a href="Samuel%20Rogers">Samuel Rogers</a>, "they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see." Although the complexity of these characters' lives inevitably led Balzac to make errors of chronology and consistency, the mistakes are considered minor in the overall scope of the project. Readers are more often troubled by the sheer number of people in Balzac's world, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a> said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he "did not know where to begin".

This pattern of character reuse had repercussions for the plot of "Le Père Goriot". Baron de Nucingen's reappearance in "" (1837) reveals that his wife's love affair with Rastignac was planned and coordinated by the baron himself. This new detail sheds considerable light on the actions of all three characters within the pages of "Le Père Goriot", complementing the evolution of their stories in the later novel.

Balzac uses meticulous, abundant detail to describe the Maison Vauquer, its inhabitants, and the world around them; this technique gave rise to his title as the father of the <a href="literary%20realism">realist novel</a>. The details focus mostly on the penury of the residents of the Maison Vauquer. Much less intricate are the descriptions of wealthier homes; Madame de Beauséant's rooms are given scant attention, and the Nucingen family lives in a house sketched in the briefest detail.

At the start of the novel, Balzac declares (in English): "All is true". Although the characters and situations are fictions, the details employed – and their reflection of the realities of life in Paris at the time – faithfully render the world of the Maison Vauquer. The rue Neuve-Sainte-Geneviève (where the house is located) presents "a grim look about the houses, a suggestion of a jail about those high garden walls". The interiors of the house are painstakingly described, from the shabby sitting room ("Nothing can be more depressing") to the coverings on the walls depicting a feast ("papers that a little suburban tavern would have disdained") – an ironic decoration in a house known for its wretched food. Balzac owed the former detail to the expertise of his friend Hyacinthe de Latouche, who was trained in the practice of hanging wallpaper. The house is even defined by its repulsive smell, unique to the poor boardinghouse.

One of the main themes in "Le Père Goriot" is the quest to understand and ascend <a href="Social%20stratification">society's strata</a>. The <a href="Charter%20of%201814">Charter of 1814</a> granted by King <a href="Louis%20XVIII%20of%20France">Louis XVIII</a> had established a "legal country" which allowed only a small group of the nation's most wealthy men to vote. Thus, Rastignac's drive to achieve social status is evidence not only of his personal ambition but also of his desire to participate in the <a href="body%20politic">body politic</a>. As with Scott's characters, Rastignac epitomizes, in his words and actions, the "<a href="Zeitgeist">Zeitgeist</a>" in which he lives.

Through his characters and narration, Balzac lays bare the <a href="social%20Darwinism">social Darwinism</a> of this society. In one particularly blunt speech, Madame de Beauséant tells Rastignac:

This attitude is further explored by Vautrin, who tells Rastignac: "The secret of a great success for which you are at a loss to account is a crime that has never been discovered, because it was properly executed." This sentence has been frequently – and somewhat inaccurately – paraphrased as: "Behind every great fortune is a great crime."

The novel's representations of social stratification are specific to Paris, perhaps the most densely populated city in Europe at the time. Traveling only a few blocks – as Rastignac does continually – takes the reader into vastly different worlds, distinguished by their architecture and reflecting the class of their inhabitants. Paris in the <a href="Bourbon%20Restoration">post-Napoleonic era</a> was split into distinct neighborhoods. Three of these are featured prominently in "Le Père Goriot": the aristocratic area of the <a href="Faubourg%20Saint-Germain">Faubourg Saint-Germain</a>, the newly upscale quarter of the <a href="rue%20de%20la%20Chauss%C3%A9e-d%27Antin">rue de la Chaussée-d'Antin</a>, and the run-down area on the eastern slope of the <a href="Montagne%20Sainte-Genevi%C3%A8ve">Montagne Sainte-Geneviève</a>.

These "quartiers" of the city serve as microcosms which Rastignac seeks to master; Vautrin, meanwhile, operates in stealth, moving among them undetected. Rastignac, as the naive young man from the country, seeks in these worlds a new home. Paris offers him a chance to abandon his far-away family and remake himself in the city's ruthless image. His urban exodus is like that of many people who moved into the French capital, doubling its population between 1800 and 1830. The texture of the novel is thus inextricably linked to the city in which it is set; "Paris", explains critic <a href="Peter%20Brooks%20%28writer%29">Peter Brooks</a>, "is the looming presence that gives the novel its particular tone".

Rastignac, Vautrin, and Goriot represent individuals corrupted by their desires. In his thirst for advancement, Rastignac has been compared to <a href="Faust">Faust</a>, with Vautrin as <a href="Mephistopheles">Mephistopheles</a>. Critic Pierre Barbéris calls Vautrin's lecture to Rastignac "one of the great moments of the "Comédie humaine", and no doubt of all world literature". France's social upheaval provides Vautrin with a playground for an ideology based solely on personal advancement; he encourages Rastignac to follow suit.

Still, it is the larger social structure that finally overwhelms Rastignac's soul – Vautrin merely explains the methods and causes. Although he rejects Vautrin's offer of murder, Rastignac succumbs to the principles of brutality upon which high society is built. By the end of the novel, he tells Bianchon: "I'm in Hell, and I have no choice but to stay there."

While Rastignac desires wealth and social status, Goriot longs only for the love of his daughters: a longing that borders on <a href="idolatry">idolatry</a>. Because he represents bourgeois wealth acquired through trade – and not aristocratic <a href="Primitive%20accumulation%20of%20capital">primitive accumulation</a> – his daughters are happy to take his money, but will see him only in private. Even as he is dying in extreme poverty, at the end of the book, he sells his few remaining possessions to provide for his daughters so that they might look splendid at a ball.

The relations between family members follow two patterns: the bonds of marriage serve mostly as <a href="Machiavellianism">Machiavellian</a> means to financial ends, while the obligations of the older generation to the young take the form of sacrifice and deprivation. Delphine is trapped in a loveless marriage to Baron de Nucingen, a money-savvy banker. He is aware of her extramarital affairs, and uses them as a means to extort money from her. Anastasie, meanwhile, is married to the comte de Restaud, who cares less about the illegitimate children she has than the jewels she sells to provide for her lover – who is conning her in a scheme that Rastignac has heard was popular in Paris. This depiction of marriage as a tool of power reflects the harsh reality of the unstable social structures of the time.

Parents, meanwhile, give endlessly to their children; Goriot sacrifices everything for his daughters. Balzac refers to him in the novel as the "Christ of paternity" for his constant suffering on behalf of his children. That they abandon him, lost in their pursuit of social status, only adds to his misery. The end of the book contrasts Goriot's deathbed moments with a festive ball hosted by Madame de Beauséant – attended by his daughters, as well as Rastignac – suggesting a fundamental schism between society and the family.

The betrayal of Goriot's daughters is often compared to that of the characters in Shakespeare's "<a href="King%20Lear">King Lear</a>"; Balzac was even accused of plagiarism when the novel was first published. Discussing these similarities, critic <a href="George%20Saintsbury">George Saintsbury</a> claims that Goriot's daughters are "as surely murderesses of their father as [Lear's daughters] Goneril and Regan". As Herbert J. Hunt points out in "Balzac's Comédie humaine", however, Goriot's tale is in some ways more tragic, since "he has a Regan and a Goneril, but no Cordelia".

The narrative of Goriot's painful relations with his children has also been interpreted as a tragicomic parable of Louis XVI's decline. At a crucial moment of filial sentiment in Balzac's novel, Vautrin breaks in singing "O Richard, O mon roi"—the royalist anthem that precipitated the October Days of 1789 and the eventual downfall of Louis XVI—a connection that would have been powerful to Balzac's readers in the 1830s. An ill-founded faith in paternal legitimacy follows both Goriot and Louis XVI into the grave.

Rastignac's family, off-stage, also sacrifices extensively for him. Convinced that he cannot achieve a decent status in Paris without a considerable display of wealth, he writes to his family and asks them to send him money: "Sell some of your old jewelry, my kind mother; I will give you other jewels very soon." They do send him the money he requests, and – although it is not described directly in the novel – endure significant hardship for themselves as a result. His family, absent while he is in Paris, becomes even more distant despite this sacrifice. Although Goriot and Vautrin offer themselves as father figures to him, by the end of the novel they are gone and he is alone.

"Le Père Goriot" is widely considered Balzac's essential novel. Its influence on <a href="French%20literature">French literature</a> has been considerable, as shown by novelist <a href="F%C3%A9licien%20Marceau">Félicien Marceau</a>'s remark: "We are all children of "Le Père Goriot"." Brooks refers to its "perfection of form, its economy of means and ends". Martin Kanes, meanwhile, in his book "Le Pére Goriot: Anatomy of a Troubled World", calls it "the keystone of the "Comédie humaine"". It is the central text of Anthony Pugh's voluminous study "Balzac's Recurring Characters", and entire chapters have been written about the detail of the Maison Vauquer. Because it has become such an important novel for the study of French literature, "Le Père Goriot" has been translated many times into many languages. Thus, says Balzac biographer <a href="Graham%20Robb">Graham Robb</a>, ""Goriot" is one of the novels of "La Comédie humaine" that can safely be read in English for what it is."

Initial reviews of the book were mixed. Some reviewers accused Balzac of <a href="plagiarism">plagiarism</a> or of overwhelming the reader with detail and painting a simplistic picture of Parisian high society. Others attacked the questionable morals of the characters, implying that Balzac was guilty of legitimizing their opinions. He was condemned for not including more individuals of honorable intent in the book. Balzac responded with disdain; in the second preface of 1835, he wrote with regard to Goriot: "Poor man! His daughters refused to recognize him because he had lost his fortune; now the critics have rejected him with the excuse that he was immoral."

Many critics of the time, though, were positive: a review in "Le Journal des femmes" proclaimed that Balzac's eye "penetrates everywhere, like a cunning serpent, to probe women's most intimate secrets". Another review, in "La Revue du théâtre", praised his "admirable technique of details". The many reviews, positive and negative, were evidence of the book's popularity and success. One publisher's critique dismissed Balzac as a "boudoir writer", although it predicted for him "a brief career, but a glorious and enviable one".

Balzac himself was extremely proud of the work, declaring even before the final installment was published: ""Le Père Goriot" is a raging success; my fiercest enemies have had to bend the knee. I have triumphed over everything, over friends as well as the envious." As was his custom, he revised the novel between editions; compared to other novels, however, "Le Père Goriot" remained largely unchanged from its initial version.

In the years following its release, the novel was often adapted for the stage. Two theatrical productions in 1835 – several months after the book's publication – sustained its popularity and increased the public's regard for Balzac. In the 20th century, a number of film versions were produced, including adaptations directed by <a href="Travers%20Vale">Travers Vale</a> (1915), <a href="Jacques%20de%20Baroncelli">Jacques de Baroncelli</a> (1922), and <a href="Paddy%20Russell">Paddy Russell</a> (1968). The name of Rastignac, meanwhile, has become an iconic <a href="sobriquet">sobriquet</a> in the French language; a "" is synonymous with a person willing to climb the social ladder at any cost.

Another well known line of this book by Balzac is when <a href="Vautrin">Vautrin</a> tells Eugene, "In that case I will make you an offer that no one would decline." This has been reworked by <a href="Mario%20Puzo">Mario Puzo</a> in the novel "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>" (1969) and <a href="The%20Godfather">its film adaptation</a> (1972); "I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse". It was ranked as the second most significant cinematic quote in <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Movie%20Quotes">AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes</a> (2005) by the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>.

The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction

The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction (usually referred to as F&SF) is a U.S. <a href="fantasy%20fiction%20magazine">fantasy</a> and <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a> first published in 1949 by Fantasy House, a subsidiary of <a href="Lawrence%20E.%20Spivak">Lawrence Spivak</a>'s <a href="Mercury%20Publications">Mercury Press</a>. Editors <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a> and <a href="J.%20Francis%20McComas">J. Francis McComas</a> had approached Spivak in the mid-1940s about creating a fantasy companion to Spivak's existing mystery title, "<a href="Ellery%20Queen%27s%20Mystery%20Magazine">Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</a>". The first issue was titled "The Magazine of Fantasy", but the decision was quickly made to include science fiction as well as fantasy, and the title was changed correspondingly with the second issue. "F&SF" was quite different in presentation from the existing science fiction magazines of the day, most of which were in <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp</a> format: it had no interior illustrations, no letter column, and text in a single column format, which in the opinion of science fiction historian <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a> "set "F&SF" apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine".

"F&SF" quickly became one of the leading magazines in the science fiction and fantasy field, with a reputation for publishing literary material and including more diverse stories than its competitors. Well-known stories that appeared in its early years include <a href="Richard%20Matheson">Richard Matheson</a>'s "<a href="Born%20of%20Man%20and%20Woman">Born of Man and Woman</a>", and <a href="Ward%20Moore">Ward Moore</a>'s "<a href="Bring%20the%20Jubilee">Bring the Jubilee</a>", a novel of an <a href="alternate%20history">alternative history</a> in which the South has won the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. McComas left for health reasons in 1954, but Boucher continued as sole editor until 1958, winning the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for Best Magazine that year, a feat his successor, <a href="Robert%20P.%20Mills">Robert Mills</a>, repeated in the next two years. Mills was responsible for publishing "<a href="Flowers%20for%20Algernon">Flowers for Algernon</a>" by <a href="Daniel%20Keyes">Daniel Keyes</a>, "<a href="Rogue%20Moon">Rogue Moon</a>" by <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a>, "<a href="Starship%20Troopers">Starship Troopers</a>" by <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>, and the first of <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>'s "<a href="Hothouse%20%28novel%29">Hothouse</a>" stories. The first few issues mostly featured cover art by <a href="George%20Salter">George Salter</a>, Mercury Press's art director, but other artists soon began to appear, including <a href="Chesley%20Bonestell">Chesley Bonestell</a>, <a href="Frank%20Kelly%20Freas">Kelly Freas</a>, and <a href="Ed%20Emshwiller">Ed Emshwiller</a>.

In 1962, Mills was succeeded as editor by <a href="Avram%20Davidson">Avram Davidson</a>. When Davidson left at the end of 1964, <a href="Joseph%20W.%20Ferman">Joseph Ferman</a>, who had bought the magazine from Spivak in 1954, took over briefly as editor, though his son <a href="Edward%20L.%20Ferman">Edward</a> soon began doing the editorial work under his father's supervision. At the start of 1966 Edward Ferman was listed as editor, and four years later he acquired the magazine from his father and moved the editorial offices to his house in Connecticut. Ferman remained editor for over 25 years, and published many well-received stories, including <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>'s "<a href="Ill%20Met%20in%20Lankhmar">Ill Met in Lankhmar</a>", <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a>'s "<a href="Born%20with%20the%20Dead">Born with the Dead</a>", and <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>'s "<a href="The%20Dark%20Tower%20%28series%29">The Dark Tower</a>" series. In 1991 he turned the editorship over to <a href="Kristine%20Kathryn%20Rusch">Kristine Kathryn Rusch</a>, who began including more <a href="horror%20fiction">horror</a> and <a href="dark%20fantasy">dark fantasy</a> than had appeared under Ferman. In the mid-1990s circulation began to decline; most magazines were losing subscribers and "F&SF" was no exception. <a href="Gordon%20Van%20Gelder">Gordon Van Gelder</a> replaced Rusch in 1997, and bought the magazine from Ferman in 2001, but circulation continued to fall, and by 2011 it was below 15,000. <a href="Charles%20Coleman%20Finlay">Charles Coleman Finlay</a> took over from Van Gelder as editor in 2015.

The first magazine dedicated to fantasy, "<a href="Weird%20Tales">Weird Tales</a>", appeared in 1923; it was followed in 1926 by "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", the first science fiction (sf) magazine. By the end of the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, nearly twenty new sf and fantasy titles appearing between 1938 and 1941. These were all <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a>s, which meant that despite the occasional high-quality story, most of the magazines presented badly written fiction and were regarded as trash by many readers. In 1941, "<a href="Ellery%20Queen%27s%20Mystery%20Magazine">Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine</a>" appeared, edited by <a href="Frederic%20Dannay">Fred Dannay</a> and focusing on detective fiction. The magazine was published in <a href="digest%20size">digest format</a>, rather than pulp, and printed a mixture of classic stories and fresh material. Dannay attempted to avoid the sensationalist fiction appearing in the pulps, and soon made the magazine a success.

In the early 1940s <a href="Anthony%20Boucher">Anthony Boucher</a>, a successful writer of fantasy and sf and also of mystery stories, got to know Dannay through his work on the <a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Ellery%20Queen%20%28radio%20program%29">Ellery Queen radio show</a>. Boucher also knew <a href="J.%20Francis%20McComas">J. Francis McComas</a>, an editor who shared his interest in fantasy and sf. By 1944 McComas and Boucher became interested in the idea of a fantasy companion to "Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine", and spoke to Dannay about it. Dannay was interested in the idea, but paper was scarce because of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. The following year Boucher and McComas suggested that the new magazine could use the Ellery Queen name, but Dannay knew little about fantasy and suggested instead that they approach <a href="Lawrence%20E.%20Spivak">Lawrence Spivak</a>, the owner of Mercury Press, which published "Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine".

In January 1946, Boucher and McComas went to New York and met with Spivak, who let them know later in the year that he wanted to go ahead. At Spivak's request they began acquiring material for the new magazine, including a new story by <a href="Raymond%20Chandler">Raymond Chandler</a>, and reprint rights to stories by <a href="H.P.%20Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>, <a href="John%20Dickson%20Carr">John Dickson Carr</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Bloch">Robert Bloch</a>. Spivak initially planned the first issue (for which Boucher and McComas were proposing the title "Fantasy and Horror") for early 1947, but repeatedly delayed the launch because of poor newsstand sales of digest magazines. He also suggested that it should be priced at 35 cents an issue, which was higher than the original plan, to provide a financial buffer against poor sales. In May 1949 Spivak suggested a new title, "The Magazine of Fantasy", and in August a press release announced that the magazine would appear in October. On October 6, 1949, Spivak, Boucher and McComas held a luncheon at the <a href="Waldorf-Astoria%20Hotel">Waldorf-Astoria</a> in New York City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the death of <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> and to launch "a new fantasy anthology periodical". Invitees included Carr, <a href="Basil%20Rathbone">Basil Rathbone</a>, and <a href="Boris%20Karloff">Boris Karloff</a>.

The first issue, published by Fantasy House, a subsidiary of American Mercury, sold 57,000 copies, which was less than Spivak had hoped for, but in November he gave Boucher and McComas the go-ahead for another issue. The title was changed to "The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction" (almost always abbreviated to "F&SF" by both fans and science fiction historians) to reflect the contents. Sales of the second issue were strong enough for Spivak to commit further, and the magazine's future became more assured, despite the difficulties caused by the fact that both Boucher and McComas lived on the west coast, whereas the magazine's publishing offices were in New York. The publishing schedule moved to bimonthly with the December 1950 issue. The pay rate for the early issues was two cents per word, or $100 for short pieces, which was competitive with "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Astounding Science Fiction</a>", the leading sf magazine of the day. By 1953 the rates had changed to three-and-a-half cents per word for stories under 3,000 words.

In 1951, McComas, who had a full-time job in sales on top of his role as editor of "F&SF", was forced to reduce his workload for health reasons. Boucher then did most of the reading and editing, while McComas reviewed the results and occasionally vetoed a story. In August the following year the schedule switched to monthly. In 1954 Spivak sold his shares in Mercury Press to his general manager, <a href="Joseph%20W.%20Ferman">Joseph Ferman</a>; that year also saw McComas's departure—his health had deteriorated to the point where he had to give up the editing post completely.

In 1957 Ferman launched a companion magazine, "<a href="Venture%20Science%20Fiction">Venture Science Fiction</a>", which was intended to focus on more action-oriented fiction than "F&SF". Boucher was unable to take on the extra work, so <a href="Robert%20P.%20Mills">Robert P. Mills</a>, who had been the managing editor for "F&SF", became "Venture"'s editor, with Boucher in an advisory role. Later that year Ferman sold "Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine" to <a href="Bernard%20George%20Davis">Bernard Davis</a>, who was leaving <a href="Ziff%20Davis">Ziff-Davis</a> to start his own publishing venture. Ferman retained "F&SF", though Boucher departed, and Mills became the editor of "F&SF" while remaining managing editor of Queen's magazine. Mills stayed for over three years, leaving at the end of 1961 to spend more time working as a literary agent, and Ferman replaced him with <a href="Avram%20Davidson">Avram Davidson</a>, whose name first appeared on the masthead with the April 1962 issue. Joseph Ferman's son Edward had worked for the magazine as an editorial assistant in the 1950s, but left in 1959 to gain experience elsewhere; he returned in 1962, and worked under Davidson as managing editor. In 1963 <a href="Ted%20White%20%28author%29">Ted White</a>, later the editor of "Amazing Stories", became assistant editor, and stayed with the magazine until 1968.

Davidson gave up the editor's chair in late 1964 in order to have more time to write, and was initially replaced by Joseph Ferman, who handed over control to his son Edward from May 1965, though the masthead did not reflect the change till 1966. Four years later the younger Ferman took over from his father as publisher as well, and moved the editorial and publishing offices to his house in <a href="Cornwall%2C%20Connecticut">Cornwall, Connecticut</a>. His wife, Audrey, was business manager, and <a href="Andrew%20I.%20Porter">Andrew Porter</a> was an assistant editor. In the early 1970s Ferman contacted <a href="Sol%20Cohen">Sol Cohen</a>, the owner of "Amazing Stories" and "<a href="Fantastic%20%28magazine%29">Fantastic Stories</a>", two competing sf magazines, about purchasing them both. Ferman was considering combining them into a single magazine and publishing them alongside "F&SF", but Cohen decided to keep both titles.

In 1969, an issue of "F&SF" was priced at 50 cents; by the end of the 1970s the price had gone up to $1.25, although the page count also rose, from 128 to 160 pages. Circulation did not suffer, but rose from 50,000 to over 60,000, partly because of subscription drives through <a href="Publishers%20Clearing%20House">Publishers' Clearing House</a>, and perhaps also because the magazine's quality remained consistent throughout the decade. In Ashley's words, ""F&SF" delivered the goods month after month": the schedule was reliable, the format remained unchanged, and the editor remained the same from 1965 throughout the next two decades and more. Ferman managed to keep the circulation above 50,000, and sometimes above 60,000, during the 1980s when most other magazines were losing subscribers. He turned over the editorship to <a href="Kristine%20Kathryn%20Rusch">Kristine Kathryn Rusch</a> in 1991, and by the mid-1990s circulation began to fall again. In 1997 Gordon Van Gelder took over as editor, and from the February 2001 issue was publisher as well, having bought the magazine from Ferman. <a href="John%20Joseph%20Adams">John Joseph Adams</a> was Van Gelder's assistant editor from 2001 until December 2009. Van Gelder was unable to arrest the decline in circulation, which by 2011 was down to less than 15,000. Van Gelder reduced the publication frequency to bimonthly, increasing the page count and price. Charles Coleman Finlay guest-edited the July/August 2014 issue, and was hired in 2015 as full-time editor, beginning with the March/April 2015 issue.

Boucher and McComas's original goal for the new magazine was to imitate the formula that had made "Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine" successful: classic reprints, along with quality fiction that avoided the excesses of the pulps. The initial proposal called for the magazine to include fantasy, but not science fiction. Even before the launch, the editors found they were having trouble deciding exactly where the boundary lay, so when in February 1949 Joseph Ferman, Spivak's general manager, asked them to add sf to the lineup as a way to broaden the readership, they were happy to comply. The first issue included only one story that could be called science fiction: <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>'s "The Hurkle is a Happy Beast"; it also included reprints from the <a href="slick%20%28magazine%20format%29">slick</a> magazines by writers such as <a href="Richard%20Sale%20%28director%29">Richard Sale</a>, and <a href="Guy%20Endore">Guy Endore</a>. The interior layout was quite different from the existing fantasy and sf magazines: there were no interior illustrations, and the text was printed in a single column, instead of two as was usual elsewhere. There was a book review column, but no letters page. According to sf historian Mike Ashley, this "set "F&SF" apart, giving it the air and authority of a superior magazine". The logo design and layout were the work of Mercury Press's art director, George Salter, whose background was in book design rather than in pulp magazines. Salter remained with the magazine until 1958. He was responsible for many of the surreal early covers; these gave way to work by other artists, but his design for "F&SF" remained intact for decades, and in Ashley's opinion the consistency of appearance has been "one of the major selling points" of the magazine.

When the second issue appeared, with the title revised to include "Science Fiction", there was no announcement of the change, and not much more science fiction than in the first issue. <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a> contributed one example, "Not with a Bang", which Knight has described as his first fully professional story. The next issue included <a href="Richard%20Matheson">Richard Matheson</a>'s first sale, "<a href="Born%20of%20Man%20and%20Woman">Born of Man and Woman</a>", widely considered one of the finest stories "F&SF" ever published. Over the next few years several writers became strongly associated with the magazine, including <a href="Margaret%20St.%20Clair">Margaret St. Clair</a>, <a href="Reginald%20Bretnor">Reginald Bretnor</a>, <a href="Miriam%20Allen%20deFord">Miriam Allen deFord</a>, and <a href="Zenna%20Henderson">Zenna Henderson</a>, and Boucher was also able to attract some of the best-known established names, such as <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>, and <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>. <a href="Fletcher%20Pratt">Fletcher Pratt</a> and <a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> began their "Gavagan's Bar" series of stories in the first issue of "F&SF", and <a href="Manly%20Wade%20Wellman">Manly Wade Wellman</a> published the first of his "<a href="John%20the%20Balladeer">John the Balladeer</a>" stories in the December 1951 issue. The focus was on short fiction; <a href="Serial%20%28literature%29">serials</a> and novels were mainly avoided. One exception was <a href="Ward%20Moore">Ward Moore</a>'s "<a href="Bring%20the%20Jubilee">Bring the Jubilee</a>", an <a href="alternate%20history">alternative history</a> set in a world where the South wins the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. Boucher bought "A Canticle for Leibowitz" from <a href="Walter%20M.%20Miller%20Jr.">Walter M. Miller</a>, who had been unable to sell it elsewhere, and printed it in the April 1955 issue; it was the first story in the series that would become <a href="A%20Canticle%20for%20Leibowitz">the novel of the same name</a>, and has since become recognized as a classic of the genre.

A controversial article by the astronomer <a href="Robert%20S.%20Richardson">R.S. Richardson</a> titled "The Day After We Land on Mars" appeared in the December 1955 issue; Richardson commented that an <a href="space%20colonization">exploration of other worlds</a> would require "the men stationed on a planet [to be] openly accompanied by women to relieve the sexual tensions that develop among normal healthy males". Responses by <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a> and Miriam Allen deFord appeared in "F&SF" the following year. DeFord argued that Richardson was assuming that women were not people in the same way as men, and the controversy has since been cited as part of the long debate within the genre about the <a href="Women%20in%20speculative%20fiction">image of women in science fiction</a>.

In 1958 "F&SF" won its first <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for Best Magazine, and when Mills became editor that year he maintained the high standards Boucher had set, winning the award again in 1959 and 1960. Mills continued to publish a broad range of material without limiting the magazine to particular subgenres. Ashley cites <a href="John%20Collier%20%28fiction%20writer%29">John Collier</a>, <a href="Robert%20Arthur%20Jr.">Robert Arthur</a>, <a href="Allen%20Drury">Allen Drury</a>, and Ray Bradbury, all authors with mainstream reputations who appeared in "F&SF" in 1960, as evidence of the magazine's diversity. <a href="Daniel%20Keyes">Daniel Keyes</a> had been unable to sell "<a href="Flowers%20for%20Algernon">Flowers for Algernon</a>" until Mills bought it in 1959; it went on to win several awards and according to Clute and Nicholls is "arguably the most popular sf novel ever published". "<a href="Rogue%20Moon">Rogue Moon</a>", a novel about a deadly artifact left by <a href="Extraterrestrials%20in%20fiction">aliens on the moon</a>, is often considered <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a>'s best novel; it appeared in 1960, and the following year saw <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>'s "Hothouse", the first in <a href="Hothouse%20%28novel%29">that series</a>. (Budrys later said that what he described as the "cuteness of the early F&SF school of editing — and its open contempt for the accomplishments of the <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">Campbellian</a> school" had resulted in "buckets and buckets of froth" but, more favorably, "Liberal Arts concepts in what had been almost exclusively a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">B. S.</a> field".) Zenna Henderson's stories of The People, a group of refugee humanoid aliens hiding on Earth, were published through the 1950s and 1960s and became a "central feature" of the magazine according to sf critic <a href="John%20Clute">John Clute</a>. Boucher published Damon Knight's "The Country of the Kind", described by Ashley as "one of his most potent stories from the fifties", in 1956, and the same year, under the pseudonym "Grendel Briarton", Reginald Bretnor began a series of punning stories known as "Feghoots" that lasted until 1964. At the end of the 1950s, during Mills' tenure as editor, <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>'s "<a href="Starship%20Troopers">Starship Troopers</a>" was serialized in "F&SF", under the title "Starship Soldier"; this was intended to be a juvenile novel but was rejected by <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Scribner's</a> for being too violent. It won the Hugo Award in the novel category the following year, and proved to be one of Heinlein's most controversial books.

Among the cover artists in the first decade, sf historian and critic Thomas Clareson singles out the early astronomical scenes by <a href="Chesley%20Bonestell">Chesley Bonestell</a> as being the most notable; these were among the first to replace George Salter's surreal artwork on the cover. <a href="Frank%20Kelly%20Freas">Kelly Freas</a> and <a href="Ed%20Emshwiller">Ed Emshwiller</a>, two of the most popular artists in the sf field, also contributed covers during the 1950s. <a href="Mel%20Hunter">Mel Hunter</a> began contributing covers with the November 1953 issue, and in October 1955 began a long-running series of covers that depicted a <a href="artificial%20intelligence">robot survivor</a> of a <a href="nuclear%20holocaust">nuclear holocaust</a> engaging in human activities amidst the desolation—watering a flower, playing with toys, or reading a store catalog, for example. A regular book review column appeared, titled "Recommended Reading"; it was signed simply "The Editors" until McComas ceased to be one of the co-editors, after which Boucher used his own name. According to Clareson, the column "long remained the most catholic appraisal of the field" because of the variety of works reviewed. Boucher did not review his own fiction in the column, though on at least one occasion he listed a new book of his, telling the reader: "Comments eagerly welcomed; in this case, you are the reviewer". When Boucher left, he was succeeded by Damon Knight as book reviewer; <a href="Alfred%20Bester">Alfred Bester</a> took over in 1960 and remained in the role until Avram Davidson became the book reviewer when he took the editorial chair. <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> had begun a series of science articles for "Venture Science Fiction" in January 1958, and when "Venture" was cancelled Mills brought the science column over to "F&SF". The column, which according to Asimov he enjoyed writing more than any of his other works, ran for decades without interruption, helping to contribute to a long-standing feeling of consistency and continuity in "F&SF"'s format and contents.

Avram Davidson, who became editor in 1962, had sold his first story to "F&SF" in 1954, though he was better remembered for "The Golem", which appeared in the March 1955 issue. Under Davidson more work appeared by non-English-speaking writers such as <a href="Hugo%20Correa">Hugo Correa</a>, <a href="Herbert%20W.%20Franke">Herbert Franke</a>, and <a href="Shinichi%20Hoshi">Shin'ishi Hoshi</a>. Notable stories he acquired for "F&SF" include <a href="Terry%20Carr">Terry Carr</a>'s first sale, "Who Sups with the Devil?", in 1962, and <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>'s "<a href="A%20Rose%20for%20Ecclesiastes">A Rose for Ecclesiastes</a>" in November 1963. He published two "author special" issues: Theodore Sturgeon was featured in the September 1962 issue, and Ray Bradbury in May 1963. These author issues, which had been Joseph Ferman's idea, became a regular feature, with subsequent issues featuring Isaac Asimov (October 1966), Fritz Leiber (July 1969), Poul Anderson (April 1971), <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a> (April 1972), <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a> (September 1973), <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a> (April 1974), Damon Knight (November 1976), <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a> (July 1977), <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> (December 1990), <a href="Lucius%20Shepard">Lucius Shepard</a> (March 2001), <a href="Kate%20Wilhelm">Kate Wilhelm</a> (September 2001), <a href="Barry%20N.%20Malzberg">Barry N. Malzberg</a> (June 2003), <a href="Gene%20Wolfe">Gene Wolfe</a> (April 2007), and <a href="David%20Gerrold">David Gerrold</a> (September/October 2016).
Joseph Ferman's son, Edward Ferman, was managing editor during Davidson's tenure as editor. When Davidson left, Joseph Ferman took over the editorial chair, but in reality Edward Ferman was doing all the editorial work, and by the May 1965 issue was in full control of the magazine. It remained eclectic through the 1960s and 1970s, publishing work by <a href="New%20Wave%20science%20fiction">New Wave</a> writers such as <a href="Thomas%20M.%20Disch">Thomas Disch</a> and <a href="John%20Thomas%20Sladek">John Sladek</a>, along with new US writers such as <a href="Samuel%20R.%20Delany">Samuel Delany</a> and Roger Zelazny, hard science fiction stories by <a href="Gregory%20Benford">Gregory Benford</a> and <a href="John%20Varley%20%28author%29">John Varley</a>, fantasies by <a href="Sterling%20Lanier">Sterling Lanier</a> and <a href="Tom%20Reamy">Tom Reamy</a>, and horror by <a href="Charles%20L.%20Grant">Charles L. Grant</a> and <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a>. The mid-1960s saw an increase in the diversity of stories appearing elsewhere in the field; magazines like "<a href="New%20Worlds%20%28magazine%29">New Worlds</a>" and "<a href="Science%20Fantasy%20%28magazine%29">Science Fantasy</a>" published material that previously could only have appeared in "F&SF". Sf author Christopher Priest, writing in 1978, commented that many writers later considered part of the New Wave soon found "a natural home for their work" in "F&SF". In Ashley's view the rest of the field was starting to catch up to "F&SF"'s open-mindedness, but this did not lead to a drop in "F&SF"'s quality; the end of the 1960s saw Ferman printing some old-fashioned material such as <a href="John%20Christopher">John Christopher</a>'s novel about miniaturization, "The Little People", alongside much of Roger Zelazny's early output, and "anarchic and often indefinable" stories by <a href="R.%20A.%20Lafferty">R.A. Lafferty</a>, Harvey Jacobs, and others. In 1968, <a href="Piers%20Anthony">Piers Anthony</a>'s early novel "<a href="Battle%20Circle">Sos the Rope</a>" was serialized; Anthony had won a competition sponsored in part by "F&SF".

Harlan Ellison and <a href="James%20Tiptree%20Jr.">James Tiptree, Jr.</a> were frequent contributors in the 1970s, Tiptree contributing some of her best-known stories, such as "<a href="And%20I%20Awoke%20and%20Found%20Me%20Here%20on%20the%20Cold%20Hill%27s%20Side">And I Awoke and Found Me Here on the Cold Hill's Side</a>" and "<a href="The%20Women%20Men%20Don%27t%20See">The Women Men Don't See</a>"; Ellison's many stories in "F&SF" included "<a href="The%20Deathbird">The Deathbird</a>", in 1973, which won a Hugo Award, and "<a href="Jeffty%20Is%20Five">Jeffty Is Five</a>" in 1977, which won both a Hugo and a <a href="Nebula%20Award">Nebula Award</a>. Other award-winning stories from Ferman's first decade and a half included Fritz Leiber's "Ship of Shadows" in 1969, "<a href="Ill%20Met%20in%20Lankhmar">Ill Met in Lankhmar</a>" in 1970, and "<a href="Catch%20That%20Zeppelin">Catch That Zeppelin</a>" in 1975; all three won Hugos, and the latter two also won Nebulas. <a href="Poul%20Anderson">Poul Anderson</a>'s "<a href="The%20Queen%20of%20Air%20and%20Darkness%20%28novella%29">The Queen of Air and Darkness</a>" won both a Hugo and a Nebula, Robert Silverberg's "<a href="Born%20with%20the%20Dead">Born with the Dead</a>" won a Nebula, and <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>'s novel of Martian colonization, "<a href="Man%20Plus">Man Plus</a>", also won a Nebula.

<a href="Judith%20Merril">Judith Merril</a> took over the book review column on Davidson's departure, and was followed by James Blish in 1970 and Algis Budrys in 1975, with frequent contributions from other reviewers such as <a href="Joanna%20Russ">Joanna Russ</a> and <a href="Gahan%20Wilson">Gahan Wilson</a>. In 1965 Wilson began contributing cartoons, and continued to do so regularly until 1981. Ferman set a humorous competition for the readers in the November 1971 issue, and thereafter ran two or three similar competitions every year. These were later collected in a 1996 anthology, titled "Oi, Robot", the title taken from a competition to add a single letter to a well-known work of sf. A film review column, the first in the magazine since <a href="Charles%20Beaumont">Charles Beaumont</a>'s "The Science Screen" (and "William Morrison" aka <a href="Joseph%20Samachson">Joseph Samachson</a>'s live-theater column "The Science Stage") in the latter 1950s, conducted by <a href="Samuel%20R.%20Delany">Samuel R. Delany</a>, commenced in 1969; <a href="Baird%20Searles">Baird Searles</a> contributed the column between 1970 and 1984. Among the later reviewers, Ellison was one of the most popular, and columns from his first four years were collected as "<a href="Harlan%20Ellison%27s%20Watching">Harlan Ellison's Watching</a>" in 1989.

"<a href="Isaac%20Asimov%27s%20Science%20Fiction%20Magazine">Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine</a>" was launched in 1977 and from 1983, under the editorships of <a href="Shawna%20McCarthy">Shawna McCarthy</a> and later <a href="Gardner%20Dozois">Gardner Dozois</a>, it began to publish more mature material, becoming a more direct competitor to "F&SF"'s market niche. Authors such as Lucius Shepard, <a href="James%20Blaylock">James Blaylock</a>, and <a href="John%20Crowley%20%28author%29">John Crowley</a>, whose work was a natural fit for "F&SF", were selling to "Asimov"'s as well. The launch of "<a href="Omni%20%28magazine%29">Omni</a>" in 1978 also had an impact. For almost every year in the 1970s stories published in "F&SF" won more award nominations, and were selected for more "Year's Best" anthologies, than the other magazines; in the 1980s that was no longer true, as "Asimov's" took over the leading role, and "Omni" sometimes pushed "F&SF" into third place. Ferman was still able to acquire some highly regarded material, such as "Lost Boys" by <a href="Orson%20Scott%20Card">Orson Scott Card</a>, and "<a href="Kirinyaga%20%28short%20story%29">Kirinyaga</a>" by <a href="Mike%20Resnick">Mike Resnick</a>. When "Omni" rejected <a href="George%20R.%20R.%20Martin">George R.R. Martin</a>'s "Monkey Treatment" and Gardner Dozois's "Down Among the Dead Men", which were dark fantasy, Ferman acquired both. Along with these regular columns, Ferman occasionally published articles, such as "Science Fiction and the University", a feature in the May 1972 issue that included contributions from <a href="Darko%20Suvin">Darko Suvin</a>, Thomas Clareson, and <a href="William%20Tenn">Philip Klass</a>.

"F&SF" won the <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Professional%20Magazine">Hugo Award for Best Magazine</a> for four consecutive years, from 1969 through 1972, when the award was changed to "Best Professional Editor". Initially this category was dominated by <a href="Ben%20Bova">Ben Bova</a>, the editor of "<a href="Analog%20Science%20Fiction%20and%20Fact">Analog</a>", but Ferman won it for three more years at the start of the 1980s.

Some of the artists who had provided covers for early issues of "F&SF", including Chesley Bonestell, Ed Emshwiller, and <a href="Alex%20Schomburg">Alex Schomburg</a>, were still contributing their work into the late 1970s, and many of the regular writers from the early years, such as Reginald Bretnor, <a href="Ron%20Goulart">Ron Goulart</a>, and <a href="Hilbert%20Schenck">Hilbert Schenck</a>, continued to appear in "F&SF" into the 1980s. A newer group, including Joanna Russ and R.A. Lafferty, had become regulars more recently. Some established writers such as Thomas Disch published their more unusual work in "F&SF", and there were also writers such as <a href="Felix%20C.%20Gotschalk">Felix C. Gotschalk</a>, whose unusual stories were described by Ferman as "a step ahead of most SF writers (or perhaps he's marching in a different direction)". In Ashley's opinion, Ferman managed to "balance the work of these eccentric writers so that they never distorted the contents yet kept the magazine on the edge".

Newer writers who began to appear regularly in the 1980s included <a href="Bruce%20Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a>, who published his early <a href="Shaper/Mechanist%20universe">Shaper/Mechanist</a> stories in "F&SF", beginning with "Swarm", in 1982. Stephen King's "<a href="The%20Dark%20Tower%20%28series%29">The Dark Tower</a>" series had begun in 1979 in "F&SF", and four more stories appeared over the next three years before being collected as a novel in 1982; and <a href="Michael%20Shea%20%28author%29">Michael Shea</a> and <a href="Bob%20Leman">Bob Leman</a> contributed horror and weird fiction regularly in the 1980s. Despite the increased competition from "Omni" and "Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine", Ferman managed to keep "F&SF"'s reputation for quality intact throughout the 1980s; it was not as distinct from its competition as it had once been, but it retained an "idiosyncratic individuality", in Ashley's words.

Under Kristine Kathryn Rusch "F&SF" began to publish more dark fantasy and horror stories, such as "The Night We Buried Road Dog" by <a href="Jack%20Cady">Jack Cady</a>, which won a Nebula Award. When Rusch took over as editor, Isaac Asimov had been writing the science column for over three decades, and Algis Budrys had been contributing a book review column since 1975; in 1992 Asimov died and Budrys departed. The science column ran for 399 consecutive issues, ending in February 1992. Asimov's widow, <a href="Janet%20Asimov">Janet Asimov</a>, wrote another essay for the December 1994 issue, based on her conversations with her husband before his death, and a final essay appeared in January 1996, containing material from the book "Yours, Isaac Asimov: A Lifetime of Letters". The science column continued to appear, written by Bruce Sterling and Gregory Benford among others, and <a href="John%20Kessel">John Kessel</a> took over the book reviews; Robert Killheffer succeeded Kessel, with some overlap in 1994 and 1995. "Asimov's" maintained its dominance of the field through the 1990s, though Rusch published well-received material such as "The Martian Child" by David Gerrold and "Last Summer at Mars Hill" by <a href="Elizabeth%20Hand">Elizabeth Hand</a>. Rusch won one Hugo Award as editor during her five years at "F&SF", in 1994.

Van Gelder printed more fantasy and less hard science fiction than had Rusch, and in Ashley's opinion he was able to "restore some of the magazine's distinctiveness". As a result of the switch to bimonthly in 2009, with the resulting higher page count in each issue, the magazine began to publish longer stories.

"F&SF" quickly established itself as one of the leading magazines. Ashley describes it as bridging "the attitude gap between the slick magazines and the pulps"', and argues that it made the genre more respectable. The fantasy side of the magazine attracted writers who had been regular contributors to "Weird Tales" and "Unknown", two of the best-known fantasy pulps, and in Ashley's opinion, it soon found a "middle ground" between those pulp traditions and fantasy written for the slicks. It was known as the most literary of the science fiction and fantasy magazines, and it published the most diverse range of material. In a 1978 review of New Wave sf, Christopher Priest agreed that "F&SF" has a bias for literary work, and added that "it has been a sort of New Wave of its own ever since its inception".

From the 1950s, "F&SF" was regarded as one of the "big three" science fiction magazines, along with "Astounding Science Fiction" and "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction">Galaxy Science Fiction</a>". In a review of a 1952 issue, James Blish (writing as William Atheling, Jr.) commented that much of the magazine to that point was wonderfully written, and that Boucher's and McComas's editorial acumen made "F&SF" very readable, but that on occasion a well-written, sophisticated, but unoriginal science fiction story might be accepted by "F&SF" because it was not a specialist sf magazine. At the end of the 1950s Kingsley Amis described it as "the most highbrow" of the science fiction magazines, and <a href="Gary%20K.%20Wolfe">Gary K. Wolfe</a> later said that "F&SF", along with "Galaxy", "defined the tenor" of the 1950s. In 1966, Judith Merril argued that it was Boucher and McComas who made a place in the genre for writers such as Charles Beaumont, Mildred Clingerman, Edgar Pangborn, and many others who, in her opinion, had "virtually stopped writing until the necessary new magazine came along".

In 2007, Ashley commented that "F&SF" had been "the most consistently enjoyable magazine of the last 50 years". In his view, a key reason for the magazine's appeal was that its roots were in the literary tradition, with Lawrence Spivak, its first publisher, the inheritor of <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H.L. Mencken</a>'s "<a href="The%20American%20Mercury">American Mercury</a>", which had been successful and widely respected as a literary review. Unlike most of its competitors, "F&SF" had no connection to the pulp magazine era, and its editors had always intended to appeal to readers of books, rather than of magazines. Ashley also cites "F&SF"'s broad editorial policy, which allowed the magazine to carry a wider range of fiction than its competitors. In 2014 <a href="Gary%20Westfahl">Gary Westfahl</a> praised the "creative editors of the 1980s and 1990s, such as Gardner Dozois ... and Gordon Van Gelder", but added that "such editors were no longer the most important figures in the field".

As of March 2017, the editorial succession is as follows:
The first issue was titled "The Magazine of Fantasy"; with the second issue the title switched to "The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction". It has been in digest format since the beginning.

The publisher was initially Fantasy House, a subsidiary of Mercury Press; from March 1958 the publisher was listed as Mercury Press instead. Since February 2001 the publisher has been Van Gelder's Spilogale, Inc.

The following table lists "F&SF"'s prices over the years. When Joseph Ferman announced the price change in the February 1959 issue, his justification for the increase was that "during the past ten years...paper costs have gone up by 38%, composition, printing, binding and handling costs have gone up by 32%, postages costs have gone up from 33% to 60%, and various other costs have risen as much or more".
The following anthologies of fiction from "F&SF" have appeared.

In 1981, <a href="Martin%20H.%20Greenberg">Martin H. Greenberg</a> edited a hardcover facsimile edition of the April 1965 issue of "F&SF", with the addition of an introduction by Edward Ferman, and memoirs by the authors whose work appeared in the issue. The book was published by <a href="Southern%20Illinois%20University%20Press">Southern Illinois University Press</a>.

"F&SF" has had multiple foreign editions, including:

Blast Corps

Blast Corps is a 1997 <a href="action%20video%20game">action video game</a> for the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> in which the player uses vehicles to destroy buildings in the path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. In the game's 57 <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>, the player solves puzzles by transferring between vehicles to move objects and bridge gaps. It was developed by <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a>, published by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, and released in March 1997 in Japan and North America. A wider release followed at the end of that year.

The game was among Rare's first for the Nintendo 64. Its development team ranged between four and seven members, many of whom were recent graduates. The team sought to find gameplay to fit Rare co-founder <a href="Chris%20Stamper">Chris Stamper</a>'s idea for a building destruction game. The puzzle <a href="game%20mechanics">game mechanics</a> were inspired by those of "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20%28Game%20Boy%29">Donkey Kong</a>" (1994).

"Blast Corps" was released to universal acclaim and received <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>'s second highest Nintendo 64 ratings of 1997. The game sold one million copies—lower than the team's expectations—and received several editor's choice awards. Reviewers highly praised its originality, variety, and graphics, but some critiqued its controls and repetition. Reviewers of Rare's 2015 "<a href="Rare%20Replay">Rare Replay</a>" retrospective compilation noted "Blast Corps" as a standout title.

"Blast Corps" is a <a href="single-player">single-player</a> <a href="action%20video%20game">action video game</a>. The player controls vehicles to destroy buildings, farms, and other structures in the path of a runaway nuclear missile carrier. The player fails if the carrier collides with an object. The eight demolition vehicles vary in the way they clear structures: the bulldozer rams, the dump truck <a href="drifting%20%28motorsport%29">drifts</a>, the lightweight <a href="Dune%20buggy">buggy</a> crashes from higher ground, the tricycle shoots missiles, another truck presses outwards from its sides, and robot <a href="mecha">mechs</a> tumble and stomp from the land and the air. The player must transfer between vehicles and other machinery to solve puzzles. Objectives include transporting timed explosive crates and bridging gaps. The game's puzzles increase in <a href="difficulty%20level">difficulty</a> as the player progresses through its 57 <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a>.

The world is portrayed from a three-quarters <a href="overhead%20view">overhead view</a>. The player can adjust the game's viewable perspective with zoom and horizontal <a href="panning%20%28camera%29">panning</a> functions. Pop-up hints will guide the player in the early stages of the game, and <a href="non-player%20character">other characters</a> audibly encourage the player as each level wears on. The cheery soundtrack increases in tempo as the level's timer runs low. After completing a level, the player can return to explore without a time limit. By finding secrets and activating lights throughout the level, the player raises their score and final <a href="medal">medal</a> ranking. There are also secret levels hidden throughout the game, where the player completes objectives against the clock. The player can compete against a <a href="ghost%20%28video%20gaming%29">ghost</a> copy of their previous path through a level. There are no settings to change the game's difficulty, and the <a href="saved%20game">game saves</a> to both the <a href="game%20cartridge">game cartridge</a> itself and <a href="Controller%20Pak">external storage</a>.

"Blast Corps" was among <a href="Rare%20%28company%29">Rare</a>'s first games for the <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> and led a run of seven critically acclaimed Rare titles for the console. The game's production began in early 1996. The development team consisted of four recent graduates, though it expanded at times to seven concurrent staff. Martin Wakeley became the game's lead <a href="game%20design">designer</a>. He credited the team's small size for their easy progression from planning to market. Rare founder <a href="Chris%20Stamper">Chris Stamper</a> was the impetus for the project. He had wanted to make a game about destroying buildings for years prior to "Blast Corps" development. The team worked to fit his idea to a gameplay concept and devised a "Constantly Moving Object" conceit that would give the levels a time limit. This idea became the nuclear missile carrier.

"Retro Gamer" credited Wakeley for "Blast Corps" idiosyncratic ideas and humor in light of the game's serious premise. For instance, the "<a href="Mario%20Kart%2064">Mario Kart 64</a>" "power slide" drift mechanics inspired that of "Blast Corps" dump truck. Wakeley championed the drift controls against the rest of the team, who found them aggravating. The game's lead artist, Ricky Berwick, had developed the vehicle concepts without consideration for their in-game function, and the vehicles were only later retrofitted to the gameplay. One of the robot vehicles was designed without an arm because the developers had run out of computer memory to store the data and liked the look anyway. Wakeley determined the game's <a href="high%20score">high score</a> "goal medal" objectives, in which players would attempt to better a set completion time on each level. "Blast Corps" Japanese and American <a href="quality%20assurance">quality assurance</a> teams later competed to push the levels to their limits, which resulted in the game's platinum level objectives. Wakeley described these platinum challenges as "just insane" and said he could only finish four himself.

Wakeley saw "Blast Corps" as a <a href="puzzle%20game">puzzle game</a> at its core. He was influenced by the 1994 "<a href="Donkey%20Kong%20%28Game%20Boy%29">Donkey Kong</a>", in which the player begins each level with all the tools they need to finish but must learn how to use them. Wakeley said this was "Blast Corp" core <a href="game%20mechanic">game mechanic</a>. He was also inspired by the "<a href="Super%20Mario%2064">Super Mario 64</a>" demo at the 1995 <a href="Space%20World">Space World</a>, which introduced him to the 3D <a href="analog%20stick">analog stick</a> and spurred him achieve something similar. The team's technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of <a href="distance%20fog">distance fog</a> to obscure the <a href="draw%20distance">draw distance</a>.

<a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> published "Blast Corps" for their Nintendo 64. It was originally titled "Blast Dozer" in its 1995 <a href="Nintendo%20Space%20World">Shōshinkai</a> preview, a name it retained for its Japanese release. (The team had considered other titles, including "Heavy Duty Heroes", "Blast Radius", and "Power Dozer".) "Blast Corps" was first released in Japan on March 21, 1997, and in North America three days later. Its European and Australian release followed on December 22. The game had been in production for just over a year.

The game received "universal acclaim", according to video game <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, and "unanimous critical success", according to "<a href="Retro%20Gamer">Retro Gamer</a>". Reviewers highly praised the novelty and variety of "Blast Corps" gameplay. <a href="Peer%20Schneider">Peer Schneider</a> ("<a href="IGN">IGN</a>"), in particular, lauded the game's originality in <a href="video%20game%20industry">an industry</a> hesitant to take risks. Trent Ward commented in "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" that the premise taps into childhood fantasies, while "the unique relationship between the terrain and the vehicles you pilot ensures that "Blast Corps" will exercise your mind as well as your reflexes."

Reviewers struggled to master the game's controls. "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>"s Slo Mo praised this aspect of the game, saying that even mastering the extreme precision of the steering is fun, and rewards the player with both better gameplay technique and an appreciation for the strong distinction between the game's many vehicles. Schneider likewise overcame his initial concerns to appreciate the complexity of the controls and the differences between the vehicles. He considered the locked camera view restrictive when compared to the unrestricted 3D camera in the game's contemporaries. Schneider thought the game should have been longer, with fewer bonus levels and more main missions, though he did appreciate the pacing, design, and difficulty of the included levels. Slo Mo instead asserted that "Over 60 levels and hidden areas within hidden areas give you your money's worth". A "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" critic agreed, asserting that the vast size of the levels and numerous secrets and bonus areas make "Blast Corps" "one of the few Nintendo 64 games that justifies its exorbitant price tag." Shawn Smith and Sushi-X of "Electronic Gaming Monthly" ("EGM") thought the game was repetitive, as did "Computer and Video Games". The latter, though, praised "Blast Corps" level design and difficulty progression. Ward had fewer reservations, writing that "basically what you have here is a game with great graphics, great sound, and a great premise. What's even more impressive is that the game doesn't really have any substantial flaws to speak of - unless you want to count lack of a two-player mode, which really isn't fair." Crispin Boyer of "EGM" wrote that the game's best feature was its "palpable sense of suspense" as the carrier advanced on resistant buildings.

Critics praised the game's graphics and sound. Schneider found the game unpretentious in comparison to video game trends of <a href="photorealistic%20rendering">photorealistic rendering</a> and cartoonish art. He likened the slick vehicle animations and metallic elements to "<a href="Micro%20Machines%20%28video%20game%20series%29">Micro Machines</a>" and Rare's "<a href="R.C.%20Pro-Am">R.C. Pro-Am</a>". Schneider praised the game's <a href="texture%20maps">texture maps</a>, which made the night scenes and houses look realistic, and the canyons breathtaking. He wrote that the game's 3D programming was errorless, and was particularly pleased about the game's lack of fog, usually used to cover developer limitations. "EGM" echoed Schneider's praise of the deep landscapes, which Boyer called "incredible". Scott McCall ("<a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>") praised the game's realistic polygonal models and technical prowess, and Steve Polak ("<a href="The%20Weekend%20Australian">The Weekend Australian</a>") wrote that "Blast Corps" showcased the console's graphics capabilities. Schneider described the soundtrack as between "<a href="1970s%20in%20music">70s pop</a>, <a href="disaster%20film">disaster movie</a> score, and <a href="Country%20Bear%20Jamboree">Country Bear Jamboree</a>". He praised the range of engine, tire screeching, and crashing sound effects. Reviewers disliked the <a href="country%20music">country music</a> tracks with <a href="jaw%20harp">jaw harp</a>.

"IGN" wrote that "Blast Corps" exemplified qualities of enjoyable <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Nintendo Entertainment System</a> and <a href="arcade%20game">arcade</a> games, while "EGM" considered the game unlike all others. "Retro Gamer" wrote that the game's combination of puzzles and continuous destruction made the game so unique as to defy genre classification. The magazine described the gameplay concept of returning to explore without a time limit as "a stroke of genius". "Retro Gamer" thought of "Blast Corps" as a 3D successor to "nail-biting reaction games" such as "<a href="Loco-Motion%20%28video%20game%29">Loco-Motion</a>". "Computer and Video Games" agreed with a reader that "Blast Corps" was part of a "Destroy" subgenre including games like "<a href="Desert%20Strike">Desert Strike</a>", "<a href="Return%20Fire">Return Fire</a>", and "<a href="Body%20Harvest">Body Harvest</a>", and Matt Fox of "The Video Games Guide" put the game in a lineage with "<a href="Highway%20Encounter">Highway Encounter</a>" and "<a href="Lunar%20Jetman">Lunar Jetman</a>". Slo Mo said it was "like "<a href="Pilotwings%20%28series%29">Pilotwings</a>" with a kamikaze twist. It's a multifaceted game that melds a slick vehicle sim and a mind-thumping action/strategy challenge with massive destructive force." Schneider said "Blast Corps" was on par with the quality of <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> games and an excellent display of Rare's potential. "Next Generation" described it as "effectively every <a href="Tonka">Tonka</a> fantasy brought vividly and explosively to life."

"Blast Corps" sold one million copies, which was fewer than Rare had expected. The game was most successful in Japan. Metacritic ranked the title among the top ten games released in 1997. It remained Metacritic's highest ranked 1997 Nintendo 64 game after "<a href="GoldenEye%20007%20%281997%20video%20game%29">GoldenEye 007</a>". "Blast Corps" was selected as "Electronic Gaming Monthly" May 1997 Game of the Month and an "IGN" Editors' Choice. Four of six "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" reviewers recommended the game.

Wakeley, the game's designer, considered making a sequel as an action combat game, but thought the concepts behind "Blast Corps" had been fully exhausted. After praising the game in a 2010 Rare retrospective feature, "Retro Gamer" writers craved a sequel. The magazine said the title was proof of the company's inventiveness. Steve Ellis, who was a programmer at Rare, thought "Blast Corps" to be among the company's most underrated games, and though its physics were now dated, he continued to find the game fun enough to revisit regularly. "Blast Corps" is included in "<a href="Rare%20Replay">Rare Replay</a>", a compilation of 30 Rare titles, released on the <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a> on August 4, 2015. The release's bonus features included <a href="making-of">behind-the-scenes</a> interviews with "Blast Corps" developers. "Blast Corps" was a standout favorite among "Rare Replay" reviewers.

Rare's "Blast Corps" began a run of seven highly lauded and respected <a href="Nintendo%2064">Nintendo 64</a> games, including "GoldenEye 007", "<a href="Banjo-Kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>", "<a href="Perfect%20Dark">Perfect Dark</a>", and "<a href="Jet%20Force%20Gemini">Jet Force Gemini</a>". "Retro Gamer" wrote that Rare had doubled the number of classic Nintendo 64 games and was an important alliance for Nintendo. Microsoft acquired Rare in 2002 for a record price of $377 million. The industry had changed, "Blast Corps" designer Martin Wakeley reflected a decade after the game's 1997 release. In 2009, Wakeley said, a studio would rarely entrust the scope of a project like "Blast Corps" to a team of four recent graduates.

The staff of "Nintendo Power" (1997) and "IGN" (2014) both listed "Blast Corps" in the bottom halves of their top 100 Nintendo games of all time.

White-breasted nuthatch

The white-breasted nuthatch ("Sitta carolinensis") is a small <a href="songbird">songbird</a> of the <a href="nuthatch">nuthatch</a> family which breeds in old-growth woodland across much of temperate <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. It is a stocky bird, with a large head, short tail, powerful bill, and strong feet. The upperparts are pale blue-gray, and the face and underparts are white. It has a black cap and a chestnut lower belly. The nine <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> differ mainly in the color of the body <a href="plumage">plumage</a>.

Like other nuthatches, the white-breasted nuthatch forages for insects on trunks and branches and is able to move head-first down trees. Seeds form a substantial part of its winter diet, as do <a href="acorn">acorn</a>s and <a href="hickory">hickory</a> nuts that were stored by the bird in the fall. The nest is in a hole in a tree, and the breeding pair may smear insects around the entrance as a deterrent to squirrels. Adults and young may be killed by hawks, owls, and snakes, and forest clearance may lead to local habitat loss, but this is a common species with no major conservation concerns over most of its range.

The <a href="nuthatch">nuthatch</a>es are a <a href="genus">genus</a>, "Sitta", of small <a href="passerine">passerine</a> <a href="bird">bird</a>s which derive their English name from the propensity of some species to wedge large insects or seeds into cracks, and then hack at them with their strong bills. "Sitta" is derived from "sittē", the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> for nuthatch, and "carolinensis" means "of Carolina" in <a href="Latin">Latin</a>. The white-breasted nuthatch was first described by English ornithologist <a href="John%20Latham%20%28ornithologist%29">John Latham</a> in his 1790 work, the "Index Ornithologicus".

Nuthatch taxonomy is complex, with geographically separated species sometimes closely resembling each other. The white-breasted nuthatch has an appearance and contact call similar to those of the <a href="white-cheeked%20nuthatch">white-cheeked nuthatch</a>, "Sitta leucopsis", of the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> and was formerly considered to be <a href="Conspecificity">conspecific</a> with it. A study published in 2012 showed that four distinct lineages were genetically isolated from each other and could represent different species, recognizable by morphology and song. A molecular phylogeny published in 2014 and including all main species' lineages within nuthatches concluded that the white-breasted nuthatch was more closely related to the <a href="giant%20nuthatch">giant nuthatch</a> ("S. magna") than to "<a href="Sitta%20przewalskii">S. przewalskii</a>", formerly regarded as possibly conspecific with it; "S. przewalskii" turned out to be <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> in the family.

Like other members of its genus, the white-breasted nuthatch has a large head, short tail, short wings, a powerful bill and strong feet; it is long, with a wingspan of and a weight of .

The adult male of the <a href="Subspecies%23Nomenclature">nominate subspecies</a>, "S. c. carolinensis", has pale blue-gray upperparts, a glossy black cap (crown of the head), and a black band on the upper back. The <a href="covert%20%28feather%29">wing coverts</a> and <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s are very dark gray with paler fringes, and the closed wing is pale gray and black, with a thin white wing bar. The face and the underparts are white. The outer tail feathers are black with broad diagonal white bands across the outer three feathers, a feature readily visible in flight.

The female has, on average, a narrower black back band, slightly duller upperparts and buffer underparts than the male. Her cap may be gray, but many females have black caps and cannot be reliably distinguished from the male in the field. In the northeastern United States, at least 10% of females have black caps, but the proportion rises to 40–80% in the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a>, Mexico and the southeastern U.S. Juveniles are similar to the adult, but duller plumaged.

Like other nuthatches, this is a noisy species with a range of vocalizations. The male's mating song is a rapid nasal "qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui-qui". The contact call between members of a pair, given most frequently in the fall and winter is a thin squeaky "nit", uttered up to 30 times a minute. A more distinctive sound is a shrill "kri" repeated rapidly with mounting anxiety or excitement "kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri-kri"; the Rocky Mountains and <a href="Great%20Basin">Great Basin</a> subspecies have a higher, faster "yididitititit" call, and Pacific birds a more nasal "beeerf".

Three other, significantly smaller, nuthatches have ranges which overlap that of white-breasted, but none has white plumage completely surrounding the eye. Further distinctions are that the <a href="red-breasted%20nuthatch">red-breasted nuthatch</a> has a black eye line and reddish underparts, and the <a href="Brown-headed%20nuthatch">brown-headed</a> and <a href="pygmy%20nuthatch">pygmy nuthatch</a>es each have a brown cap, and a white patch on the nape of the neck.

The white-breasted nuthatch has nine subspecies, although the differences are small and change gradually across the range. The subspecies are sometimes treated as three groups based on close similarities in <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, habitat usage, and vocalizations. These groups cover eastern North America, the Great Basin and central Mexico, and the Pacific coastal regions. The subspecies of the western interior have the darkest upperparts, and eastern "S. c. carolinensis" has the palest back. The eastern form also has a thicker bill and broader dark cap stripe than the interior and Pacific races. The calls of the three groups differ, as described above. The Great Basin and Eastern forms have been observed in secondary contact on the Great Plains, where they do not seem to mix.

The breeding habitat of the white-breasted nuthatch is woodland across <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, from southern Canada to northern <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and southern Mexico. In the eastern part of its range, its preferred habitat is old-growth open <a href="deciduous">deciduous</a> or mixed forest, including orchards, parks, suburban gardens and cemeteries; it is found mainly in the lowlands, although it breeds at altitude in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. In the west and Mexico, this nuthatch is found in open <a href="Montane%20forest">montane</a> <a href="pine">pine</a>-<a href="oak">oak</a> woodlands, and nesting occurs at up to altitude in Nevada, California and Mexico. <a href="Pinyon%20pine">Pinyon</a>-<a href="juniper">juniper</a> and riverside woodlands may be used locally where available. The white-breasted nuthatch is the only North American nuthatch usually found in deciduous trees; red-breasted, pygmy and brown-headed nuthatches prefer pines.

The presence of mature or decaying trees with holes suitable for nesting is essential, and trees such as oak, <a href="beech">beech</a> and hickory are favored in the east since they also provide edible seeds. Although suitable habitat is distributed continentally, it is discontinuous, and the separate populations of this <a href="bird%20migration">non-migratory</a> species have diverged to form distinct regional subspecies.

This nuthatch, like most of its genus, is non-migratory, and the adults normally stay in their territory year-round. There may be more noticeable dispersal due to seed failure or high reproductive success in some years, and this species has occurred as a vagrant to <a href="Vancouver%20Island">Vancouver Island</a>, <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Island">Santa Cruz Island</a>, and <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>. One bird landed on the <a href="RMS%20Queen%20Mary">RMS "Queen Mary"</a> six hours' sailing east of <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in October 1963.

The white-breasted nuthatch is <a href="monogamy">monogamous</a>, and pairs form following a courtship in which the male bows to the female, spreading his tail and drooping his wings while swaying back and forth; he also feeds her morsels of food. The pair establish a territory of in woodland, and up to in semi-wooded habitats, and then remain together year-round until one partner dies or disappears. The nest cavity is usually a natural hole in a decaying tree, sometimes an old <a href="woodpecker">woodpecker</a> nest.

The nest hole is usually high in a tree and is lined with fur, fine grass, and shredded bark. The clutch is 5 to 9 eggs which are creamy-white, speckled with reddish brown, and average in size. The eggs are incubated by the female for 13 to 14 days prior to hatching, and the <a href="altricial">altricial</a> chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> in a further 18 to 26 days. Both adults feed the chicks in the nest and for about two weeks after fledging, and the male also feeds the female while she is incubating. Once independent, juveniles leave the adults' territory and either establish their own territory or become "floaters", unpaired birds without territories. It is probably these floaters which are mainly involved in the irregular dispersals of this species. This species of nuthatch roosts in tree holes or behind loose bark when not breeding and has the unusual habit of removing its <a href="feces">feces</a> from the roost site in the morning. It usually roosts alone except in very cold weather, when up to 29 birds have been recorded together.

Predators of adult nuthatches include owls and <a href="diurnality">diurnal</a> <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a> (such as <a href="Sharp-shinned%20hawk">sharp-shinned</a> and <a href="Cooper%27s%20hawk">Cooper's hawk</a>s), and nestlings and eggs are eaten by woodpeckers, small <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, and climbing snakes such as the <a href="western%20rat%20snake">western rat snake</a>. The white-breasted nuthatch responds to predators near the nest by flicking its wings while making "hn-hn" calls. When a bird leaves the nest hole, it wipes around the entrance with a piece of fur or vegetation; this makes it more difficult for a predator to find the nest using its sense of smell. The nuthatch may also smear <a href="blister%20beetle">blister beetle</a>s around the entrance to its nest, and it has been suggested that the unpleasant smell from the crushed insects deters <a href="squirrel">squirrel</a>s, its chief competitor for natural tree cavities. The estimated average lifespan of this nuthatch is two years, but the record is twelve years and nine months.

This nuthatch's responses to predators may be linked to a reproductive strategy. A study compared the white-breasted nuthatch with the red-breasted nuthatch in terms of the willingness of males to feed incubating females on the nest when presented with models of predators. The models were of a sharp-shinned hawk, which hunts adult nuthatches, and a <a href="house%20wren">house wren</a>, which destroys eggs. The white-breasted nuthatch is shorter-lived than the red-breasted nuthatch, but has more young, and was found to respond more strongly to the egg predator, whereas the red-breasted showed greater concern with the hawk. This supports the theory that longer-lived species benefit from adult survival and future breeding opportunities, while birds with shorter life spans place more value on the survival of their larger broods.

The white-breasted nuthatch forages along tree trunks and branches in a similar way to woodpeckers and <a href="Certhia">treecreepers</a>, but does not use its tail for additional support, instead progressing in jerky hops using its strong legs and feet. All nuthatches are distinctive when seeking food because they are able to descend tree trunks head-first and can hang upside-down beneath twigs and branches.

This nuthatch is <a href="omnivorous">omnivorous</a>, eating <a href="insect">insect</a>s and seeds. It places large food items such as acorns or hickory nuts in crevices in tree trunks, and then hammers them open with its strong beak; surplus seeds are cached under loose bark or crevices of trees. The diet in winter may be nearly 70% seeds, but in summer it is mainly insects. The insects consumed by the white-breasted nuthatch include caterpillars, ants, and pest species such as <a href="Hylobius%20abietis">pine weevils</a>, <a href="Lepidosaphes%20ulmi">oystershell</a> and other <a href="scale%20insect">scale insect</a>s, and <a href="jumping%20plant%20louse">jumping plant lice</a>. This bird will occasionally feed on the ground, and readily visits feeding stations for nuts, suet and <a href="sunflower">sunflower</a> seeds, the last of which it often takes away to store. The white-breasted nuthatch was also observed visiting raccoon latrines in order to find seeds.

The white-breasted nuthatch often travels with small <a href="mixed-species%20feeding%20flock">mixed flocks</a> in winter. These flocks are led by <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">titmice and chickadees</a>, with nuthatches and <a href="downy%20woodpecker">downy woodpecker</a>s as common attendant species. Participants in such flocks are thought to benefit in terms of foraging and predator avoidance. It is likely that the attendant species also access the information carried in the chickadees' calls and reduce their own level of vigilance accordingly.

The white-breasted nuthatch is a common species with a large range, estimated at . Its total population is estimated at 10 million individuals, and there is evidence of an overall population increase, so it is not believed to approach either the size criterion (fewer than 10,000 mature individuals) or the population decline criterion (declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations) of the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a>. For these reasons, the species is evaluated as <a href="Least-concern%20species">Least Concern</a>.

The removal of dead trees from forests may cause problems locally for this species because it requires cavity sites for nesting; declines have been noted in Washington, Florida, and more widely in the southeastern U.S. west to Texas. In contrast, the breeding range is expanding in Alberta, and numbers are increasing in the northeast due to regrown forest. This nuthatch is protected under the <a href="Migratory%20Bird%20Treaty%20Act%20of%201918">Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918</a>, to which the three countries in which it occurs (Canada, Mexico, and the United States) are all signatories.

Interstate 805

Interstate 805 (I-805) is a major north–south <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway</a> in <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a>. It is a <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypass</a> auxiliary route of <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">I-5</a>, running roughly through the center of the <a href="San%20Diego%E2%80%93Tijuana%20metropolitan%20area">Greater San Diego region</a> from <a href="San%20Ysidro%2C%20San%20Diego">San Ysidro</a> (part of the city of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>) near the <a href="Mexico%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Mexico–U.S. border</a> to near <a href="Del%20Mar%2C%20California">Del Mar</a>. The southern terminus of I-805 at I-5 in San Ysidro is less than a mile north of the Mexican border. I-805 then traverses the cities of <a href="Chula%20Vista%2C%20California">Chula Vista</a> and <a href="National%20City%2C%20California">National City</a> before reentering San Diego. The freeway passes though the San Diego neighborhoods of <a href="North%20Park%2C%20San%20Diego">North Park</a>, <a href="Mission%20Valley%2C%20San%20Diego">Mission Valley</a>, <a href="Clairemont%2C%20San%20Diego">Clairemont</a>, and <a href="University%20City%2C%20San%20Diego">University City</a> before terminating at I-5 in the <a href="Sorrento%20Valley%2C%20San%20Diego">Sorrento Valley</a> neighborhood near the Del Mar city limit.

Planning for I-805 began in 1956, and the route was officially designated in 1959 before it was renumbered in the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. Starting in 1967, the freeway was built in phases, with the northern part of the freeway finished before the southern part. I-805 was completed and open to traffic in 1975. Named the Jacob Dekema Freeway after the longtime head of the regional division of the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans), I-805 has been frequently cited for its complex engineering and architecture, including near I-8 on the Mission Valley Viaduct. Since then, several construction projects have taken place, including the construction of local and express lanes at the northern interchange with I-5. <a href="High-occupancy%20toll">High-occupancy toll</a> lanes are under construction on both the northern and southern portions of the route.

The route begins at <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">I-5</a> near the Mexican border in a far south part of <a href="San%20Ysidro%2C%20San%20Diego">San Ysidro</a>, a neighborhood of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>. As it starts its journey northward, it quickly has a junction with <a href="California%20State%20Route%20905">State Route 905</a> (SR 905) before exiting the city of San Diego and entering <a href="Chula%20Vista%2C%20California">Chula Vista</a>. Within the past 20 years the freeway has delineated the apparent divide between rich and poor in the city of Chula Vista; those on the eastern side of the freeway have been more affluent and have better schools compared to those on the western side. Just outside the city, I-805 meets <a href="County%20Route%20S17%20%28California%29">County Route S17</a> (CR S17), also named Bonita Road, before coming to an interchange with <a href="California%20State%20Route%2054">SR 54</a>. The freeway then enters <a href="National%20City%2C%20California">National City</a>, where it intersects Sweetwater Road and Plaza Boulevard, before leaving the city and reentering the city of San Diego.

I-805 continues northward through San Diego, where it intersects <a href="California%20State%20Route%2094">SR 94</a>, the Martin Luther King Jr. Freeway. As the freeway continues through downtown San Diego, it meets <a href="California%20State%20Route%2015">SR 15</a>, the continuation of <a href="Interstate%2015">I-15</a>. It then intersects <a href="El%20Cajon%20Boulevard">El Cajon Boulevard</a> before passing under the Hazard Memorial Bridge that carries Adams Avenue. The bridge was named after Roscoe Hazard for his involvement in the construction of several roads and highways in <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a>. I-805 then travels on the Mission Valley Viaduct, a towering <a href="reinforced%20concrete">reinforced</a> <a href="concrete%20viaduct">concrete viaduct</a> built in 1972, spanning over <a href="Mission%20Valley%2C%20San%20Diego">Mission Valley</a> and the <a href="San%20Diego%20River">San Diego River</a>. The viaduct is the top stack of the Jack Schrade Interchange over <a href="Interstate%208">I-8</a>, which runs along the south side of Mission Valley and crosses underneath the viaduct perpendicularly, and is San Diego County's only symmetrical <a href="stack%20interchange">stack interchange</a>. The <a href="San%20Diego%20Trolley">San Diego Trolley</a> traffic also runs under the viaduct on the valley floor.
After intersecting <a href="California%20State%20Route%20163">SR 163</a>, also known as the Cabrillo Freeway, I-805 continues through suburban San Diego, where it meets <a href="California%20State%20Route%2052">SR 52</a> in <a href="Clairemont%2C%20San%20Diego">Clairemont Mesa</a>. North of SR 52, it closely parallels I-5 near <a href="La%20Jolla">La Jolla</a>, heading northwest. Passing under the Eastgate Mall arch bridge and entering <a href="Sorrento%20Valley%2C%20San%20Diego">Sorrento Valley</a>, it finally meets its north end at I-5. During the widening project which was completed in 2007, I-5 at the I-805 merge was built to be 21 lanes wide. Eastbound <a href="California%20State%20Route%2056">SR 56</a> and Carmel Mountain Road are accessible via a parallel <a href="carriageway">carriageway</a> for local traffic heading northbound from I-805; traffic from SR 56 westbound can merge onto I-805 from the local bypass.

The route is officially known as the Jacob Dekema Freeway after Jacob Dekema, a pioneering force from the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans) who helped shape the San Diego freeway system. It is also part of the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a> and the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. In 2013, I-805 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 41,500 at the southern terminus, and 262,000 between Bonita Road and SR 54, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

According to Dekema, planning for I-805 began in 1956. The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July 1958. It was added to the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route 241. I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US 101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the former was opened. Route 241 was renumbered to Route 805 in the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>, and I-5 was designated along the route from Los Angeles to San Diego. Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route built by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline. This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, houses along the route in the <a href="North%20Park%2C%20San%20Diego">North Park</a> area were being sold, as the land was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed. The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be between Home and Adams avenues.

In May 1967, <a href="Construction%20bidding">bidding</a> began, after construction had been delayed by that of the I-5 and I-8 freeways, both of which had been given higher priority. This first portion would run from Wabash Boulevard to around Madison Avenue (a distance of ), and the next portion would include the I-8 interchange. The R.E. Hazard and W.F. Maxwell Companies won the low bid of $11.7 million (equivalent to $ in ) in mid-1967. The groundbreaking ceremony happened on September 25 at El Cajon Boulevard and Boundary Street. In August 1968, the portion of I-805 from just south of I-8 to north of Friars Road, including the interchange with I-8, was put up for bidding; at a budgeted $27.5 million (equivalent to $ in ), it was the most expensive job that the Division of Highways had ever put up for bid. The winning bid was $20.9 million (equivalent to $ in ), and was awarded to R.E. Hazard Contracting Company and W.F. Maxwell Company.
Construction had begun on the viaduct by May 1969; in the meantime, National City was making plans for developing the freeway corridor with motels and restaurants, as well as a shopping center. In mid-1969, bidding was to begin on of I-805 from north of Friars Road to north of what was then <a href="U.S.%20Route%20395%20in%20California">US 395</a>, which would become SR 163. Construction from J Street south to near San Ysidro was underway by September, when there were concerns that an order from President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> to reduce federal construction projects by 75 percent might affect funding for the portion north of Friars Road. However, Governor <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> lifted the associated freeze in construction at the state level a few weeks later. A month later, the contract for the portion between Friars Road and US 395 had been awarded for $15 million (equivalent to $ in ); the portions between there and north of Miramar Road were in the planning phases, while construction continued south of I-8 to Wabash Boulevard. The portion from SR 52 to Miramar Road had been contracted out to O.G. Sansome Company for $5.6 million (equivalent to $ in ) by the end of 1969. Meanwhile, $4 million (equivalent to $ in ) of state funding was spent in 1969 to find housing for those who were to be displaced by the freeway in San Ysidro.

By March 1970, the original section between Home Avenue and near I-8 was almost finished. The Mission Valley portion extending north of US 395, as well as from Otay Valley Road and J Street in Chula Vista, were still under construction. The portion immediately north of US 395 was contracted to A.A. Baxter Corporation, E.C. Young, and Young and Sons, Inc. for $7.9 million (equivalent to $ in ). On July 6, the first section to begin construction was dedicated, and was to be opened from El Cajon Boulevard to Wabash Boulevard soon thereafter; the rest of the section would not open until the Mission Valley interchange with I-8 was finished.

A second border crossing in the San Ysidro area was proposed near the <a href="Playas%20de%20Tijuana">Playas de Tijuana</a> area, that would be accessible from I-805, although another alternative was considered near <a href="Brown%20Field%20Municipal%20Airport">Brown Field</a>. A formal study on the matter was commissioned in August. However, this would have added $10 million (equivalent to $ in ) to the cost of the freeway, and possibly delay it by up to 10 years; furthermore, most traffic crossing the border was found to head to <a href="Tijuana">Tijuana</a> and not <a href="Ensenada%2C%20Baja%20California">Ensenada</a>. Following this, the city of Chula Vista asked that the state proceed with the original plans to construct the freeway, even though it would pass through a San Ysidro neighborhood.

In September 1970, bidding began for the final portion of the northern half of I-805 between Miramar Road and I-5; a month later, the segments between Home Avenue and SR 94, and SR 54 to 12th Street had funding allocated. By the end of the year, Hazard, Maxwell, and Matich had submitted the low bid of around $7.2 million (equivalent to $ in ) for the northernmost portion. The Chula Vista portion of the freeway from Main Street to L Street was completed in February 1971; by then, the estimated date for completing the entire freeway had slipped to 1975 from 1972. By March, the projected completion date for the Mission Valley bridge was revised to July 1972. A 102-home <a href="mobile%20home%20park">mobile home park</a> was approved by the City Council a few weeks later to house those who were displaced by the freeway construction.

The portion of the freeway from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road opened during 1972. On October 22, several unconstructed portions of I-805 were partially funded, including from Chula Vista south past <a href="California%20State%20Route%2075">SR 75</a>, north of the completed Chula Vista portion to SR 54, from SR 54 to Plaza Boulevard in National City, from there to SR 94 (including the interchange with <a href="SR%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B252%20%28CA%29">SR 252</a>), and from there to Home Avenue. Before the end of the year, the portion from SR 94 to Home Avenue entered the bidding phase; Guy F. Atkinson Company won the contract for roughly $9.96 million (equivalent to $ in ) in early 1972. Following a request from the El Cajon City Council, March 19 was set aside as a Community Cycle Day for bicyclists to travel the newly finished freeway from El Cajon Boulevard to SR 52, just before the freeway was to be dedicated the next day; the entire Mission Valley Viaduct was open to traffic that month.

By the beginning of 1974, I-805 was open north of Home Avenue, and from Otay Valley Road to Telegraph Canyon Road in Chula Vista; five segments remaining were under construction, and the last segment was funded. The Imperial Avenue section of I-805 remained in the budget, despite revisions in response to the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>. In late January, I-805 between SR 15 and SR 94 was opened to traffic, though not all of the ramps at the SR 94 interchange were operational. The connectors to SR 94 east were completed in March. The entire portion between SR 94 and Home Avenue cost $10.5 million (equivalent to $ in ). Construction between SR 94 and Imperial Avenue was well under way by December, at a cost of $8.5 million (equivalent to $ in ).

As the scheduled completion of the freeway neared, Mayor Tom Hamilton of Chula Vista expressed concerns regarding the predicted development of the I-805 corridor, and the decisions that the City Council would need to make regarding such plans. The portion south of Otay Valley Road cost $15 million (equivalent to $ in ), and the portion between Telegraph Canyon Road and Sweetwater Road cost $12 million (equivalent to $ in ). The portion from there to Imperial Avenue was projected to cost $10.2 million (equivalent to $ in ). The dedication of the freeway took place on July 23, 1975, even though the freeway was not entirely finished, due to the desire to hold the ceremony during the summer. I-805 from Plaza Boulevard to Telegraph Canyon Road opened to traffic on July 28, leaving the freeway complete except for the portion between Plaza Boulevard and SR 94. While portions of the freeway were nearly ready for traffic, there were reports of motorists driving on the closed freeway, which the <a href="California%20Highway%20Patrol">California Highway Patrol</a> warned was illegal. On September 3, Dekema announced that the entirety of the freeway would open the next day as he made a final inspection of the unopened portion; the total cost of the construction was $145 million (equivalent to $ in ). However, Dekema announced that there was no more state funding available to construct further roads for the short-term.

The Mission Valley Viaduct was recognized by the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">American Society of Civil Engineers</a> (ASCE) as the "Outstanding Civil Engineering Project for 1973 in the San Diego Area"; it was designed to match the close-by <a href="Mission%20San%20Diego%20de%20Alcal%C3%A1">Mission San Diego de Alcalá</a> with its columns that look similar to cathedral windows, and arch-like shapes etched into the textured concrete. The viaduct was designed to span , and use squared-off support columns instead of traditional cylindrical supports. Octagonal columns were to be used on the ramps and the ends of the bridge. Over 600 tons of steel bars were to be used, and the bridge was constructed as high as above I-8. The Adams Avenue Bridge over I-805 was also recognized for its span and two tapered supports on the ends of the bridge; in 1968, a <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> engineering professor asked for a copy of the design from Caltrans for educational purposes. The construction supervisor, in fact, compared the construction of this bridge to building a boat, and it was constructed from the middle outward rather than the conventional method of building from the ends inward. The span was designed to be long, and high.

Awards for the Eastgate Mall (or Old Miramar Bridge) came from the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>, San Diego Highway Development Association, and Prestressed Concrete Institute Awards Program; at the time, it was one of the first arch bridges in the state, and did not use traditional concrete pillars. The "San Diego Union" (predecessor to the "Union-Tribune") published a few freelance articles in 1984 about I-805, complimenting the four-level interchange with I-8 and the <a href="arch%20bridge">arch bridge</a> at Eastgate Mall, while mentioning that subsequent inflation after their completion would have made such structures more difficult to build if they had been constructed later. Other artwork and architecture that was mentioned included the Wateridge development in Sorrento Valley, and the "Stargazer" building by Alexander Liberman that was lit with fluorescent colors at night.

However, not all forms of artwork along the highway were uncontroversial. In 1977, there were several complaints regarding new billboards that were installed at the northern terminus of the highway, since they blocked the view of the coast. In 1981, an illegal mural that was determined to be incomplete was discovered at the I-8 interchange; while Caltrans discouraged the painting of such murals, they were impressed with the portion that had already been completed. Art Cole, the artist, stepped forward to the department, and was allowed to finish the mural of a desert highland sunrise; following this, Caltrans made efforts to have other murals commissioned.

The San Ysidro Chamber of Commerce attempted to have I-805 named as the San Ysidro Freeway in 1976. However, I-805 was named after Jacob Dekema in August 1981, and ceremonies to mark the occasion occurred in February 1982. The plaque honoring Dekema was installed in November at the Governor Drive interchange. Because of his efforts in designing I-805, Ed Settle of Caltrans was given the Outstanding Civil Engineering Award from the ASCE; he designed several other regional freeways, including SR 163 through <a href="Balboa%20Park%20%28San%20Diego%29">Balboa Park</a> and I-5 through San Diego.

The construction of a "dual freeway" at the northern end of I-805 was discussed as early as 1989, referring to the two <a href="carriageways">carriageways</a> needed for each direction of the freeway, resulting in four total. It would require drivers to use the new local lanes to access eastbound SR 56 from I-5 or I-805. The project would allow for trucks to use the new lanes to assist in merging with traffic. However, it faced opposition from local residents, concerned about the loss of the view from their homes, as well as environmentalists concerned about nearby wetlands. Further objections espoused the view that the congestion would continue to increase, regardless of what was done, and that the new road would be at capacity in a few years. The San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) funded the construction with $110 million (equivalent to $ in ) in mid-2000.

Construction of the "dual freeway" began in early 2002, at a cost of $182 million (equivalent to $ in ). The northbound lanes were scheduled to open in February 2006. The southbound lanes were completed in early 2007. That year, a three-year project began to allow <a href="Driverless%20car">robot controlled vehicles</a>, including buses and trucks, to use a special lane. The intention is to allow the vehicles to travel at shorter following distances and thereby allow more vehicles to use the lanes. The vehicles will still have drivers since they need to enter and exit the special lanes. The system was designed by Swoop Technology, based in San Diego County.

Two years later, construction began on two auxiliary lanes on I-805 southbound from SR 54 to Bonita Road, to improve traffic flow at the SR 54 interchange. In 2010, Caltrans proposed adding <a href="high-occupancy%20toll">high-occupancy toll</a> express lanes between SR 15 and East Palomar Street in Chula Vista. The California Transportation Commission (CTC) awarded $100 million for the work in June 2011, which would be split into two phases at the interchange with SR 54. Work is also underway to add two <a href="High-occupancy%20vehicle">HOV lanes</a> between SR 52 and Mira Mesa Boulevard; this project also received $59.5 million from the CTC in September 2011. Meanwhile, SANDAG made arrangements to purchase the <a href="SR%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B125%20%28CA%29">SR 125</a> toll road and reduce the tolls, which was hoped to encourage commuters to take that road instead of I-805 and reduce congestion; this would then enable Caltrans to construct two managed lanes instead of the original four.

In February 2013, construction began on the northern HOV lanes; the project is expected to cost $86 million. By May, construction on the Palomar Street direct access ramps had begun, and the Carroll Canyon Road ramps were almost finished. The northern project is expected to be complete in 2015, and the southern express lanes opened in March 2014 at a cost of $1.4 billion, with an option to expand them into two lanes in each direction, and a proposed direct ramp to the express lanes. A 2012 Caltrans report proposed adding four managed lanes along the entire length of the highway. Construction on HOV lanes from SR 905 to SR 15 is planned for 2016.

Yagan

Yagan (; c. 1795 – 11 July 1833) was an <a href="Indigenous%20Australian">Indigenous Australian</a> warrior from the <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> people. He played a key part in <a href="Indigenous%20Australian%20resistance">early resistance</a> to <a href="History%20of%20Australia%20%281788%E2%80%931850%29">British colonial settlement</a> and rule in the area surrounding what is now <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth, Western Australia</a>. Yagan was pursued by the local authorities after he killed Erin Entwhistle, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler. It was an act of retaliation after Thomas Smedley, another of Butler's servants, shot at a group of Noongar people stealing potatoes and fowls, killing one of them. The government offered a <a href="bounty%20%28reward%29">bounty</a> for Yagan's capture, dead or alive, and a young settler, William Keats, subsequently shot and killed him. Yagan's execution figures in Australian history as a symbol of the unjust and sometimes brutal treatment of the indigenous peoples of Australia by colonial settlers. He is considered a hero by the Noongar.

After his shooting, settlers removed Yagan's head to claim the bounty. Later, an official sent it to London, where it was exhibited as an "<a href="anthropology">anthropological</a> curiosity" and eventually given to a museum in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. It held the head in storage for more than a century before burying it with other remains in an unmarked grave in Liverpool in 1964. Over the years, the Noongar asked for repatriation of the head, both for religious reasons and because of Yagan's traditional stature. The burial site was identified in 1993; officials <a href="exhumation%20of%20Yagan%27s%20head">exhumed the head</a> four years later and <a href="Repatriation">repatriated</a> it to Australia. After years of debate within the Noongar community on the appropriate final resting place, Yagan's head was buried in a traditional ceremony in the <a href="Swan%20Valley%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan Valley</a> in July 2010, 177 years after his death.

A member of the <a href="Whadjuk">Whadjuk</a> Noongar people, Yagan belonged to a <a href="tribe">tribe</a> of around 60 people whose name, according to <a href="Robert%20Lyon%20%28Australian%20settler%29">Robert Lyon</a>, was "<a href="Beeliar%20%28tribe%29">Beeliar</a>". Scholars now believe that the Beeliar people may have been a family subgroup (or <a href="clan">clan</a>) of a larger tribe whom <a href="Daisy%20Bates%20%28Australia%29">Daisy Bates</a> called "Beelgar". According to Lyon, the Beeliar people occupied the land south of the <a href="Swan%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan</a> and <a href="Canning%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Canning</a> rivers, as far south as <a href="Mangles%20Bay%2C%20Western%20Australia">Mangles Bay</a>. The group had customary land usage rights over a much larger area than this, extending north as far as <a href="Lake%20Monger%2C%20Western%20Australia">Lake Monger</a> and northeast to the <a href="Helena%20River">Helena River</a>. The group also had an unusual degree of freedom to move over their neighbours' land, possibly due to kinship and marriage ties with neighbouring groups.

Yagan is thought to have been born around 1795. His father was <a href="Midgegooroo">Midgegooroo</a>, an <a href="elder%20%28administrative%20title%29">elder</a> of the Beeliar people; his mother was presumably one of Midgegooroo's two wives. Yagan was probably a "Ballaroke" in the <a href="Noongar%20classification">Noongar classification</a>.

According to the historian Neville Green, Yagan had a wife and two children. A report in the "<a href="Perth%20Gazette">Perth Gazette</a>" in 1833 gives the names of his children as "Naral", age 9, and "Willim", age 11; however, most other sources state that the warrior was unmarried and childless. Described as taller than average with an impressive burly physique, Yagan had a distinctive tribal tattoo on his right shoulder, which identified him as "a man of high degree in tribal law." He was generally acknowledged to be the most physically powerful of his tribe.

Yagan would have been about 35 years old in 1829 when <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">British</a> settlers landed in the area and established the <a href="Swan%20River%20Colony">Swan River Colony</a>. For the first two years of the colony, relations between settlers and Noongar were generally amicable, as there was little competition for resources. The Noongar welcomed the white settlers as "Djanga", the returned spirits of their dead. Historical reports noted the two groups shared fish. As time passed, conflicts between the two cultures gradually became more frequent. The settlers incorrectly thought that the Noongar were nomads who had no claim to the land over which they roamed. Colonists fenced off land for grazing and farming according to their traditional practices of land use.

As the colonists fenced off more land, the Noongar were increasingly denied access to their traditional hunting grounds and sacred sites. In search of food, the Noongar raided the settlers' crops and killed their cattle. They also developed a taste for the settlers' supplies, and began to take flour and other food, which became a serious problem for the colony. In addition, the Noongar practice of <a href="firestick%20farming">firestick farming</a>: <a href="bushfire">firing</a> <a href="the%20bush">the bush</a> to flush out game and encourage germination of undergrowth for sustainability, threatened the settlers' crops and houses.

In December 1831 Yagan and his father led the first significant Aboriginal resistance to white settlement in Western Australia. Thomas Smedley, a servant of farmer Archibald Butler, ambushed some natives who were raiding a potato patch, and killed one of Yagan's family group. A few days later, Yagan, Midgegooroo and others stormed the farmhouse and, finding the door locked, began to break through the mud-brick walls. Inside were Butler's servant Erin Entwhistle and his two sons Enion and Ralph. After hiding his sons under the bed, Entwhistle opened the door to parley and was killed by Yagan and Midgegooroo. Noongar tribal law required that murders be avenged by the killing of a member of the murderer's tribal group, not necessarily the murderer. The Noongar considered servants and employees to be part of the settlers' groups. Historians believe the Noongar attack on Entwhistle was retribution under their tribal law. Not understanding tribal law (and unlikely to agree with its concepts), the white settlers took the killing to be an unprovoked murder and dispatched a force to arrest Yagan's group, without success.

In June 1832 Yagan led a party of Aborigines in attacking two labourers sowing a field of wheat alongside the Canning River near <a href="Kelmscott%2C%20Western%20Australia">Kelmscott</a>. One of the men, John Thomas, escaped, but the other, William Gaze, was wounded and later died as a result. The settlement declared Yagan an outlaw and offered a reward of £20 for his capture. He avoided capture until early October 1832. A group of fishermen enticed Yagan and two companions into their boat, then pushed off into deep water. The fishermen took the three Noongar men to the Perth guardhouse, from which they were transferred to the <a href="Round%20House%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Round House</a> at <a href="Fremantle">Fremantle</a>. Yagan was sentenced to death, but he was saved by the intercession of settler <a href="Robert%20Lyon%20%28Australian%20settler%29">Robert Lyon</a>. Arguing that Yagan was defending his land against invasion, Lyon said Yagan should not be considered a criminal but a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> and suggested he should be treated as such. At the recommendation of <a href="John%20Septimus%20Roe">John Septimus Roe</a>, the <a href="Surveyor-General%20of%20Western%20Australia">Surveyor-General of Western Australia</a>, Yagan and his men were exiled on <a href="Carnac%20Island">Carnac Island</a> under the supervision of Lyon and two soldiers.

Lyon thought he could teach Yagan British ways and convert him to Christianity. He hoped to gain his cooperation and use his tribal stature to persuade the Noongar to accept colonial authority. Lyon spent many hours with Yagan learning his language and customs. After a month, Yagan and his companions escaped by stealing an unattended <a href="dinghy">dinghy</a> and rowing to <a href="Woodman%20Point%2C%20Western%20Australia">Woodman Point</a> on the mainland. The Government did not pursue them; apparently its officials considered they had been sufficiently punished.

In January 1833 two Noongar, Gyallipert and Manyat, visited Perth from <a href="King%20George%20Sound">King George Sound</a>, where relations between settlers and natives were amicable. Two settlers, Richard [Robert?] Dale and George Smythe, arranged for the men to meet a party of local Noongar to encourage friendly relations in the Swan River Colony. On 26 January Yagan led a group of ten formally armed Noongars in greeting the two men near Lake Monger. The men exchanged weapons and held a "<a href="corroboree">corroboree</a>", though the groups did not appear to share a language. Yagan and Gyallipert competed at spear throwing. As an example of his prowess, Yagan struck a walking stick from a distance of 25 metres.

Gyallipert and Manyat remained in Perth for some time. On 3 March, Yagan obtained permission to hold another corroboree, this time in the Post Office garden in Perth. The Perth and King George Sound men met at dusk, chalked their bodies, and performed a number of dances including a <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a> hunt dance. "<a href="The%20Perth%20Gazette">The Perth Gazette</a>" wrote that Yagan "was master of ceremonies and acquitted himself with infinite grace and dignity."

During February and March, Yagan was involved in a series of minor conflicts with settlers. In February William Watson complained that Yagan had pushed open his door, demanded a gun, and taken <a href="handkerchief">handkerchief</a>s. Watson had to give him and his companions flour and bread. The following month, Yagan was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply, Yagan threatened him with his spear. Later that month, Yagan was with a group of Noongar who entered Watson's house while he was away. The group left after Watson's wife called on neighbours for help. The next day Captain Ellis lectured the Noongar about their behaviour. The frequent incidents prompted "The Perth Gazette" to remark on "the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin's fee ... For the most trivial offence  ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him. He is at the head and front of any mischief."

On the night of 29 April, a party of Noongar broke into a Fremantle store to steal flour and they were shot at by the caretaker Peter Chidlow. Domjum, a brother of Yagan, was badly injured and died in jail a few days later. The rest of the party moved from Fremantle to <a href="Preston%20Point%2C%20Western%20Australia">Preston Point</a>, where Yagan reportedly vowed vengeance for the death. Between 50 and 60 Noongar gathered at <a href="Bull%20Creek%2C%20Western%20Australia">Bull Creek</a>, where they met a party of settlers who were loading carts with provisions. Later that day, the group ambushed the lead cart, killing two settlers, Tom and John Velvick. Tribal law required only a single death for vengeance. Some historians have speculated that the Velvicks were targeted because they had previously been convicted for assaulting Aboriginal people and coloured seamen. <a href="Alexandra%20Hasluck">Alexandra Hasluck</a> has also argued that stealing provisions was an important motive in the attack, but this has been refuted elsewhere.

For the killing of the Velvicks, the Lieutenant-Governor <a href="Frederick%20Irwin">Frederick Irwin</a> declared Yagan, Midgegooroo and Munday to be outlaws, offering rewards of £20 each for the capture of Midgegooroo and Munday, and a reward of £30 for Yagan's capture, dead or alive. Munday successfully appealed against his proscription. Midgegooroo, Yagan and their group immediately moved from their territory north towards the Helena Valley. On 17 May, Midgegooroo was captured on the Helena River. After a brief, informal trial, he was executed by <a href="Execution%20by%20firing%20squad">firing squad</a>. Yagan remained at large for over two months.

Late in May, <a href="George%20Fletcher%20Moore">George Fletcher Moore</a> reported seeing Yagan on his property and talking with him in <a href="pidgin">pidgin</a> English. Moore wrote in the "Perth Gazette":
Yagan asked Moore whether Midgegooroo was dead or alive. Moore gave no reply, but a servant answered that Midgegooroo was a prisoner on Carnac Island. Yagan warned, "White man shoot Midgegooroo, Yagan kill three." Moore reported the encounter but made no attempt to restrain Yagan. He later wrote, "The truth is, every one wishes him taken, but no one likes to be the captor ... there is something in his daring which one is forced to admire."

On 11 July 1833, two teenage brothers named William and James Keates were herding cattle along the Swan River north of <a href="Guildford%2C%20Western%20Australia">Guildford</a> when a group of Noongar approached while en route to collect flour rations from <a href="Henry%20Bull%20%28settler%29">Henry Bull</a>'s house. The Keates brothers suggested Yagan remain with them to avoid arrest. While he was staying with them during the morning, the brothers decided to kill the warrior and claim the reward. When the natives were ready to depart, the Keateses took their last opportunity. William Keates shot Yagan, and James shot Heegan, another native, in the act of throwing his spear. The brothers ran away, but other Noongar overtook William and speared him to death. James escaped by swimming the river. Shortly afterward he returned with a party of armed settlers from Bull's estate.

When the party of settlers arrived, they found Yagan dead and Heegan dying. Heegan "was groaning and his brains were partly out when the party came, and whether humanity or brutality, a man put a gun to his head and blew it to pieces." The settlers cut Yagan's head from his body, and skinned his back to obtain his tribal markings as a trophy. They buried the bodies a short distance away.

James Keates claimed the reward, but his conduct was widely criticised. "The Perth Gazette" referred to Yagan's killing as "a wild and treacherous act ... it is revolting to hear this lauded as a meritorious deed." However, <a href="Daisy%20Bates%20%28Australia%29">Daisy Bates</a> understood that "he was killed in self-defence by the young lad." Keates left the colony the following month; it is possible that he left from fear of being murdered in tribal retaliation.

Yagan's head was initially taken to Henry Bull's house. Moore saw it there and sketched the head a number of times in his unpublished, handwritten diary, commenting that "possibly it may yet figure in some museum at home." The head was preserved by smoking.

In September 1833, <a href="Frederick%20Irwin">Governor Irwin</a> sailed for London, partly to give his own account of the events leading up to the killing. This was an unusual measure, especially given his regiment was about to leave for a tour of duty in India. The Colonial Office indicated satisfaction with Irwin's administration of the colony.

Travelling with Irwin was Ensign <a href="Robert%20Dale">Robert Dale</a>, who had somehow acquired Yagan's head. According to the historian Paul Turnbull, Dale appears to have persuaded Irwin to let him have the head as an "anthropological curiosity". After arriving in London, Dale tried to sell the head to scientists, approaching a number of <a href="anatomy">anatomists</a> and <a href="phrenology">phrenologists</a>. His price of ₤20 failed to find a buyer, so he made an agreement with <a href="Thomas%20Pettigrew">Thomas Pettigrew</a> for the exclusive use of the head for 18 months. Pettigrew, a surgeon and antiquarian, was well known in the London social scene for holding private parties at which he unrolled and <a href="autopsy">autopsied</a> <a href="ancient%20Egypt">Egyptian</a> <a href="mummy">mummies</a>. He displayed the head on a table in front of a <a href="Panoramic%20View%20of%20King%20George%27s%20Sound%2C%20Part%20of%20the%20Colony%20of%20Swan%20River">panoramic view of King George Sound</a> reproduced from Dale's sketches. For effect, the head was adorned with a fresh corded headband and feathers of the <a href="red-tailed%20black%20cockatoo">red-tailed black cockatoo</a>.
Pettigrew had the head examined by a phrenologist. Examination was considered difficult because of the large <a href="Bone%20fracture">fracture</a> across the back of the head caused by the gunshot. His conclusions were consistent with contemporary European opinion of Indigenous Australians. Dale published these in a pamphlet entitled "<a href="Descriptive%20Account%20of%20the%20Panoramic%20View%20%26amp%3Bc.%20of%20King%20George%27s%20Sound%20and%20the%20Adjacent%20Country">Descriptive Account of the Panoramic View &c. of King George's Sound and the Adjacent Country</a>", which Pettigrew encouraged his guests to buy as a <a href="souvenir">souvenir</a> of their evening. The frontispiece of the pamphlet was a hand-coloured <a href="aquatint">aquatint</a> print of Yagan's head by the artist <a href="George%20Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>.

Early in October 1835, Yagan's head and the panoramic view were returned to Dale, then living in <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. On 12 October he presented them to the <a href="Liverpool%20Royal%20Institution">Liverpool Royal Institution</a>, where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy. In 1894 the Institution's collections were dispersed, and Yagan's head was lent to the <a href="Liverpool%20Museum">Liverpool Museum</a>; it is thought not to have been put on display there. By the 1960s Yagan's head was badly deteriorated. In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it. It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964, together with a <a href="Peru">Peru</a>vian mummy and a <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> head. They were buried in <a href="Everton%20Cemetery">Everton Cemetery</a>'s General Section 16, grave number 296. In later years a number of burials were made around the grave. For example, in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box, 20 <a href="stillbirth">stillborn</a> babies and two infants who died soon after birth.

For many years beginning in the early 1980s, a number of Noongar groups sought the return of Yagan's head to Australia.
At the time, there was no historical trail for the head after Pettigrew passed it on. Tribal elders entrusted the Aboriginal leader <a href="Ken%20Colbung">Ken Colbung</a> with the search. In the early 1990s, Colbung enlisted the aid of <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a> <a href="archaeology">archaeologist</a> <a href="Peter%20Ucko">Peter Ucko</a>. One of Ucko's researchers, Cressida Fforde, conducted a literature search for information on the head. Fforde successfully traced the head in December 1993. The following April, Colbung applied to exhume the remains under Section 25 of the <a href="Burial%20Act%201857">Burial Act 1857</a>. <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> regulations required <a href="next%20of%20kin">next of kin</a> consent before disturbing the remains of the 22 infants. Colbung's solicitors requested waiver of this condition on grounds that the exhumation would be of great personal significance to Yagan's living relatives, and great national importance to Australia.

Meanwhile, divisions in the Noongar community in Perth began to develop. Some elders questioned Colbung's role and one Noongar registered a complaint with the <a href="Liverpool%20City%20Council">Liverpool City Council</a> over his involvement. Media reports indicated acrimonious debate within the Noongar community about who had the best cultural qualifications to take possession of the head. The academic Hannah McGlade claims that these divisions were largely manufactured by the media, particularly "<a href="The%20West%20Australian">The West Australian</a>", which "aimed to and successfully represented the Nyungar community in terms of disharmony and dissent". She alleges that one "West" reporter contacted Noongar who were known to be in disagreement, and quoted one to the other, so as to elicit provocative responses. The disputes were "trumpeted" by "The West", allowing it to "preach" against the infighting.

On 25 July a public meeting was held in Perth. All parties agreed to put aside their differences and co-operate to ensure that the repatriation was a "national success". A Yagan Steering Committee was established to co-ordinate the repatriation, and Colbung's application was allowed to proceed. In January 1995 the Home Office advised Colbung that it was unable to waive the requirement to obtain next of kin consent for the exhumation. It contacted the five relatives whose addresses were known, and received unconditional consent from only one. Accordingly, on 30 June 1995, Colbung and the other interested parties were advised that the application for exhumation had been rejected.

Meeting on 21 September, the Yagan Steering Committee decided to lobby Australian and British politicians for support. In 1997 Colbung was invited to visit the United Kingdom at the British government's expense and he arrived on 20 May. His visit attracted substantial media coverage, and increased the political pressure on the British Government. He secured the support of the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, <a href="John%20Howard">John Howard</a>, after <a href="gatecrasher%20%28person%29">gate crashing</a> the Prime Minister's June visit to the United Kingdom.

While Colbung was in the United Kingdom, Martin and Richard Bates were engaged to undertake a <a href="geophysics">geophysical</a> survey of the grave site. Using <a href="electromagnetism">electromagnetic</a> and <a href="ground%20penetrating%20radar">ground penetrating radar</a> techniques, they identified an approximate position of the box that suggested it could be accessed from the side via the adjacent plot. A report of the survey was passed to the Home Office, prompting further discussions between the British and Australian Governments.

Of concern to the Home Office were an undisclosed number of letters that it had received objecting to Colbung's involvement in the repatriation process; it therefore sought assurances from the Australian Government that Colbung was a correct applicant. In response Colbung asked his elders to ask the <a href="Aboriginal%20and%20Torres%20Strait%20Islander%20Commission">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission</a> (ATSIC) to tell the British Home Office that he was the correct applicant. ATSIC then convened a meeting in Perth at which it was again resolved that Colbung's application could proceed.

Colbung continued to press for the exhumation, asking that it be performed before the 164th anniversary of Yagan's death on 11 July, so that the anniversary could be the occasion of a celebration. His request was not met, and on the anniversary of Yagan's death, Colbung conducted a short memorial service at the burial plot in Everton. He returned to Australia empty-handed on 15 July.

The <a href="exhumation%20of%20Yagan%27s%20head">exhumation of Yagan's head</a> eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating six feet down the side of the grave, then tunnelling horizontally to the location of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a <a href="forensics">forensic</a> <a href="palaeontology">palaeontologist</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Bradford">University of Bradford</a> positively identified the <a href="human%20skull">skull</a> as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.

On 27 August 1997, a delegation of Noongars consisting of Ken Colbung, <a href="Robert%20Bropho">Robert Bropho</a>, Richard Wilkes and Mingli Wanjurri-Nungala arrived in the UK to collect Yagan's head. The delegation was to have been larger, but Commonwealth funding was withdrawn at the last minute. The handover of Yagan's skull was further delayed, however, when a Noongar named Corrie Bodney applied to the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Western%20Australia">Supreme Court of Western Australia</a> for an injunction against the handover. Claiming that his family group has sole responsibility for Yagan's remains, Bodney declared the exhumation illegal and denied the existence of any tradition or belief necessitating the head's exhumation and removal to Australia. On 29 August, Justice Henry Wallwork rejected the injunction application, on the grounds that Bodney had previously agreed to the current arrangements, and on the evidence of another Noongar elder (Albert Corunna, who claimed to be a closer relation of Yagan) and anthropologist Pat Baines, both of whom refuted Bodney's claim to sole responsibility.

Yagan's skull was handed over to the Noongar delegation at a ceremony at <a href="Liverpool%20Town%20Hall">Liverpool Town Hall</a> on 31 August 1997. In accepting the skull, Colbung made comments that were interpreted as linking Yagan's death with the <a href="death%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">death of Diana, Princess of Wales</a>, earlier that day: That is how nature goes ... Nature is a carrier of all good things and all bad things. And because the Poms did the wrong thing, they now have to suffer. Colbung's comments prompted a media furore throughout Australia, with newspapers receiving many letters from the public expressing shock and anger at the comments. Colbung later claimed that his comments had been misinterpreted.

Throughout the repatriation process, many sections of the international media treated the story as a joke. For example, the "<a href="US%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">US News & World Report</a>" ran a story under the headline "Raiders of the Lost Conk", in which Yagan's head was referred to as a "pickled curio", and Colbung's actions were treated as a publicity stunt.

On its return to Perth, Yagan's head continued to be a source of controversy and conflict. Responsibility for reburial of the head was given to a "Committee for the Reburial of Yagan's Kaat", headed by Richard Wilkes. However, the reburial was delayed by disputes between elders over the burial location, mainly due to uncertainty of the whereabouts of the rest of his body, and disagreement about the importance of burying the head with the body.

A number of attempts were made to locate the remains of Yagan's body, which were believed to be on Lot 39 West Swan Road in the outer Perth suburb of <a href="Belhus%2C%20Western%20Australia">Belhus</a>. A <a href="remote%20sensing">remote sensing</a> survey of the site was carried out in 1998, but no remains were found. An archaeological survey of the area was undertaken two years later, but this also was unsuccessful. Disputes then arose over whether the head could be buried separately from the body. Wilkes has claimed that it can, so long as it is placed where Yagan was killed, so that <a href="Dreamtime">Dreamtime</a> spirits can reunite the remains.

In 1998 the Western Australian Planning Commission and the <a href="Department%20of%20Aboriginal%20Affairs">Department of Aboriginal Affairs</a> jointly published a document entitled "Yagan's Gravesite Master Plan", which discussed "matters of ownership, management, development and future use" of the property on which Yagan's remains are believed to be buried. Under consideration was the possibility of turning the site into an Indigenous burial site, to be managed by the Metropolitan Cemeteries Board.

Yagan's head spent some time in storage in a bank vault before being handed over to forensics experts who reconstructed a model from it. After that it was held in storage at Western Australia's state <a href="morgue">mortuary</a>. Plans to re-bury the head were repeatedly deferred, causing ongoing conflict between Noongar groups. In September 2008 it was reported that Yagan's head would be reburied in November, and a <a href="Yagan%20Memorial%20Park">Yagan Memorial Park</a> created as a projected cost of A$996,000; but in November it was announced that the reburial had been rescheduled for July 2009 because of logistical problems. In March 2009, it was announced that the <a href="Department%20of%20Families%2C%20Housing%2C%20Community%20Services%20and%20Indigenous%20Affairs">Department of Indigenous Affairs</a> had given the <a href="City%20of%20Swan">City of Swan</a> more than A$500,000 to develop the park.

The head was finally buried in a private ceremony attended only by invited <a href="Noongar">Noongar</a> elders, on 10 July 2010, the anniversary of the last full day he lived and one day before the end of <a href="NAIDOC%20Week">NAIDOC Week</a> 2010. The site in <a href="Belhus%2C%20Western%20Australia">Belhus</a> was chosen as it is believed to be near to where the rest of Yagan's body was buried. The burial coincided with a ceremony to mark the opening of the Yagan Memorial Park which was attended by around 300 people, including Noongar elders and State government representatives. <a href="Premier%20of%20Western%20Australia">State Premier</a> <a href="Colin%20Barnett">Colin Barnett</a> described the occasion as "a wonderful day for all West Australians."

The art works for the Yagan Memorial Park were designed by Peter Farmer, Sandra Hill, Jenny Dawson and Kylie Ricks. Dawson and Hill created an entry wall of Yagan's story; Farmer designed the park entry statements and Ricks the <a href="Coolamon%20%28vessel%29">female Coolamon</a>.

The repatriation of Yagan's head increased the Aboriginal leader's notability. He is considered a famous historical figure throughout Australia, with material about him appearing in such publications as the "<a href="Australian%20Dictionary%20of%20Biography">Australian Dictionary of Biography</a>", and Western Australia's school <a href="curriculum">curriculum</a>. He is of greatest significance, however, to the Noongar people, for whom he is "a revered, cherished and heroic individual ... patriot and visionary hero of WA's South-West". The return of his head was likened by some Indigenous Australians to the November 1993 ceremonial repatriation from <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a> of Australia's <a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Unknown%20Soldier">unknown soldier</a>.

The former Upper Swan Bridge, which carries the <a href="Great%20Northern%20Highway">Great Northern Highway</a> over the Swan River at <a href="Belhus%2C%20Western%20Australia">Belhus</a>, was renamed the Yagan Bridge in 2010. Also, an open plaza in the <a href="Perth%20%28suburb%29">Perth central business district</a>, constructed as part of the <a href="Perth%20City%20Link">Perth City Link</a> urban renewal project, was named <a href="Yagan%20Square">Yagan Square</a>. The plaza, located adjacent to the <a href="Horseshoe%20Bridge">Horseshoe Bridge</a>, was opened on 3 March 2018.

On 6 September 1997 "<a href="The%20West%20Australian">The West Australian</a>" published a <a href="Dean%20Alston">Dean Alston</a> <a href="cartoon">cartoon</a> entitled "<a href="Alas%20Poor%20Yagan">Alas Poor Yagan</a>", which was critical of the fact that the return of Yagan's head had become a source of conflict between Noongars instead of fostering unity. The cartoon was interpreted by some as insulting aspects of Noongar culture, and casting aspersions on the motives and legitimacy of Indigenous Australians with mixed racial heritage. The content of the cartoon offended many Indigenous Australians, and a group of Noongar elders complained about the cartoon to the <a href="Human%20Rights%20and%20Equal%20Opportunity%20Commission">Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</a>. The commission ruled that the cartoon made inappropriate references to Noongar beliefs but was not in breach of the <a href="Racial%20Discrimination%20Act%201975">Racial Discrimination Act 1975</a> because it was "an artistic work" that was published "reasonably and in good faith", and was therefore exempt. This ruling was upheld on appeal by the <a href="Federal%20Court%20of%20Australia">Federal Court of Australia</a>, Some academic commentators have since expressed concern that the protections offered under the act have been undermined by the ruling's broad interpretation of the exemptions.

From the mid-1970s, members of the Noongar community lobbied for the erection of a <a href="statue">statue</a> of Yagan as part of the <a href="WAY%201979">WAY 1979</a> sesquicentennial celebrations. Their requests were refused, however, after then <a href="Premier%20of%20Western%20Australia">Premier of Western Australia</a> <a href="Charles%20Court">Sir Charles Court</a> was advised by one prominent historian that Yagan was not important enough to warrant a statue. Colbung claims "Court was more interested in spending tax payers' money on refurbishing the badly neglected burial place of <a href="James%20Stirling%20%28Australian%20governor%29">Captain James Stirling</a>, WA's first governor." Despite this setback, the Noongar community persisted, establishing a Yagan Committee and running a number of fund-raising drives. Eventually, sufficient funds were collected to allow the commissioning of Australian sculptor <a href="Robert%20Hitchcock">Robert Hitchcock</a> to create a statue. The result was a life-size statue in <a href="bronze">bronze</a>, depicting Yagan standing naked with a spear held across his shoulders. Hitchcock's statue of Yagan was officially opened by Yagan Committee chairperson Elizabeth Hanson on 11 September 1984. It stands on <a href="Heirisson%20Island">Heirisson Island</a> in the <a href="Swan%20River%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Swan River</a> near Perth.

In 1997, within a week of the return of Yagan's head to Perth, vandals beheaded the statue using an <a href="angle%20grinder">angle grinder</a>. Soon after a replacement head was installed and it too was detached and stolen. Credit for the act was anonymously claimed by a "British loyalist" as an act of retaliation for Colbung's comments about <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">Diana, Princess of Wales</a>. The <a href="Western%20Australia%20Police">Western Australia Police</a> did not succeed in identifying the vandals, nor in recovering the heads, and deemed it infeasible to have the statue fenced off or placed under guard.

Commentary on the beheadings varied widely. One column in "The West Australia" found humour in them, referring to the head as a "bonce" and a "noggin", and finished with a pun on "skullduggery". Stephen Muecke calls this the "satirical trivialising of Aboriginal concerns"; and Adam Shoemaker writes "This is the stuff of light humour and comic relief. There is no sense of the decapitation as being an act of vandalism, even less that it could have been motivated by malevolence ... [T]he piece has a definite authorising function". On the other hand, academic analysis has treated the act with much more gravity. In 2007, for example, David Martin described the decapitation as "an act which speaks not only to the continuance of white settler racism, but also to the power of mimesis to invigorate our modern memorials and monuments with a life of their own."

In 2002, <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Western%20Australian%20Legislative%20Assembly">Member of the Western Australian Legislative Assembly</a> <a href="Janet%20Woollard">Janet Woollard</a> called for the statue's <a href="intimate%20part">genitalia</a> to be covered up, but nothing was done. In November 2005 Richard Wilkes again called for the statue's groin to be covered, on the grounds that such a depiction would be more historically accurate, as Yagan would have worn a covering for most of the year. Also under consideration is the creation of a new statue with a head shape that accords better with the forensic reconstruction of Yagan's head.

<a href="Mary%20Durack">Mary Durack</a> published a fictionalised account of Yagan's life in her 1964 children's novel "The Courteous Savage: Yagan of the Swan River", which was renamed "Yagan of the Bibbulmun" on reissue in 1976.

The repeated beheading of Yagan's statue in 1997 prompted Aboriginal writer <a href="Archie%20Weller">Archie Weller</a> to write a short story entitled "Confessions of a Headhunter". Weller later worked with film director Sally Riley to adapt the story into a script, and in 2000 a 35-minute movie, also named "Confessions of a Headhunter", was released. Directed by Sally Riley, the movie won Best Short Fiction Film at the 2000 <a href="Australian%20Film%20Institute%20Awards">AFI Awards</a>. The following year the script won the Script Award in the 2001 <a href="Western%20Australian%20Premier%27s%20Book%20Awards">Western Australian Premier's Book Awards</a>.

In 2002, the South African-born Australian poet <a href="John%20Mateer">John Mateer</a> published his fourth collection of poems, entitled "Loanwords". The collection is divided into four sections, of which the third, "In the Presence of a Severed Head", has Yagan as its subject.

A section of "Kullark", a play by <a href="Jack%20Davis%20%28playwright%29">Jack Davis</a>, explores the deteriorating relationship between Yagan and a settler couple.

In September 1989 an early maturing cultivar of <a href="barley">barley</a>, bred by the Western Australian Department of Agriculture for performance on sandy soils, was released under the name ""Hordeum vulgare" (Barley) c.v. Yagan". Commonly referred to simply as "Yagan", the cultivar is named for Yagan, continuing a tradition of labelling Western Australian grain cultivars after historic people of Western Australia.
