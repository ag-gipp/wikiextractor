Tamil language

Tamil (; "" , ) is a <a href="Dravidian%20language">Dravidian language</a> predominantly spoken by the <a href="Tamil%20people">Tamil people</a> of <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, and by the <a href="Tamil%20diaspora">Tamil diaspora</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20Moors">Sri Lankan Moors</a>, <a href="Dougla">Dougla</a>s, and <a href="Chindian">Chindian</a>s. Tamil is an <a href="official%20language">official language</a> of two countries: <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> and <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a> and official language of the Indian state <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>. It has official status in the <a href="States%20and%20union%20territories%20of%20India">Indian state</a> of <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> and the Indian <a href="Union%20Territory">Union Territory</a> of <a href="Puducherry">Puducherry</a>. It is used as one of the languages of education in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, along with English, Malay and Mandarin. Tamil is spoken by significant minorities in the four other <a href="South%20India">South India</a>n states of <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> and <a href="Telangana">Telangana</a> and the Union Territory of the <a href="Andaman%20and%20Nicobar%20Islands">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a>. It is one of the 22 <a href="scheduled%20languages%20of%20India">scheduled languages of India</a>.

Tamil is one of the longest-surviving <a href="classical%20language">classical language</a>s in the world. Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions from 500 BC have been found on <a href="Adichanallur">Adichanallur</a> and 2,200-year-old Tamil-Brahmi inscriptions have been found on <a href="Samanar%20hills">Samanamalai</a>. <a href="A.%20K.%20Ramanujan">A. K. Ramanujan</a> described it as "the only language of contemporary India which is recognizably continuous with a classical past." The variety and quality of classical Tamil literature has led to it being described as "one of the great classical traditions and literature of the world".

A recorded <a href="Tamil%20literature">Tamil literature</a> has been documented for over 2000 years. The earliest period of Tamil literature, <a href="Sangam%20literature">Sangam literature</a>, is dated from ca. 300 BC – AD 300. It has the oldest extant <a href="Tamil%20literature">literature</a> among <a href="Dravidian%20languages">Dravidian languages</a>. The earliest <a href="Epigraphy">epigraphic</a> records found on rock edicts and '<a href="hero%20stone">hero stone</a>s' date from around the 3rd century BC. More than 55% of the epigraphical inscriptions (about 55,000) found by the <a href="Archaeological%20Survey%20of%20India">Archaeological Survey of India</a> are in the Tamil language. <a href="Tamil%20Brahmi">Tamil language inscriptions</a> written in Brahmi script have been discovered in Sri Lanka and on trade goods in Thailand and Egypt. The two earliest <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s from India, acknowledged and registered by the <a href="Memory%20of%20the%20World%20Programme">UNESCO Memory of the World register</a> in 1997 and 2005, were written in Tamil.

In 1578, Portuguese Christian missionaries published a Tamil prayer book in old Tamil script named "<a href="Thambiran%20Vanakkam">Thambiran Vanakkam</a>", thus making Tamil the first Indian language to be printed and published. The "<a href="Tamil%20Lexicon">Tamil Lexicon</a>," published by the <a href="University%20of%20Madras">University of Madras</a>, was one of the earliest <a href="dictionary">dictionaries</a> published in the Indian languages. According to a 2001 survey, there were 1,863 newspapers published in Tamil, of which 353 were dailies.

Tamil belongs to the <a href="Southern%20Dravidian%20languages">southern</a> branch of the <a href="Dravidian%20languages">Dravidian languages</a>, a family of around 26 languages native to the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>. It is also classified as being part of a <a href="Tamil%20languages">Tamil language family</a> that, alongside Tamil proper, includes the languages of about 35 ethno-linguistic groups such as the <a href="Irula%20language">Irula</a> and <a href="Yerukala%20language">Yerukula</a> languages (see <a href="SIL%20Ethnologue">SIL Ethnologue</a>).

The closest major relative of Tamil is <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a>; the two began diverging around the 9th century AD. Although many of the differences between Tamil and Malayalam demonstrate a pre-historic split of the western dialect, the process of separation into a distinct language, Malayalam, was not completed until sometime in the 13th or 14th century.

According to linguists like <a href="Bhadriraju%20Krishnamurti">Bhadriraju Krishnamurti</a>, Tamil, as a Dravidian language, descends from <a href="Proto-Dravidian%20language">Proto-Dravidian</a>, a <a href="proto-language">proto-language</a>. Linguistic reconstruction suggests that Proto-Dravidian was spoken around the third <a href="millennium">millennium</a> BC, possibly in the region around the lower <a href="Godavari">Godavari</a> river basin in peninsular India. The material evidence suggests that the speakers of Proto-Dravidian were of the culture associated with the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> complexes of <a href="South%20India">South India</a>. The next phase in the reconstructed proto-history of Tamil is Proto-South-Dravidian. The linguistic evidence suggests that Proto-South-Dravidian was spoken around the middle of the second millennium BC, and that proto-Tamil emerged around the 3rd century BC. The earliest <a href="Tamil-Brahmi">epigraphic</a> attestations of Tamil are generally taken to have been written shortly thereafter.

Among Indian languages, Tamil has the most ancient non-Sanskritic Indian literature. Scholars categorise the attested history of the language into three periods: Old Tamil (300 BC–AD 700), Middle Tamil (700–1600) and Modern Tamil (1600–present). In November 2007, an excavation at Quseir-al-Qadim revealed Egyptian pottery dating back to first century BC with ancient Tamil Brahmi inscriptions. <a href="John%20Guy%20%28historian%29">John Guy</a> states that Tamil was the lingua franca for early maritime traders from India.

According to Hindu legend, Tamil or in personification form <a href="Tamil%20Thai">Tamil Thāi</a> (Mother Tamil) was created by Lord <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a>. <a href="Murugan">Murugan</a>, revered as the Tamil God, along with sage <a href="Agastya">Agastya</a>, brought it to the people.

The earliest extant Tamil literary works and their commentaries celebrate the <a href="Pandiyan%20Kingdom">Pandiyan Kings</a> for the organization of long-termed <a href="Tamil%20Sangams">Tamil Sangams</a>, which researched, developed and made amendments in Tamil language. Even though the name of the language which was developed by these <a href="Tamil%20Sangams">Tamil Sangams</a> is mentioned as Tamil, the period when the name "Tamil" came to be applied to the language is unclear, as is the precise etymology of the name. The earliest attested use of the name is found in <a href="Tholkappiyam">Tholkappiyam</a>, which is dated as early as 1st century BC. Southworth suggests that the name comes from > "self-speak", or "one's own speech". <a href="Kamil%20Zvelebil">Kamil Zvelebil</a> suggests an etymology of , with meaning "self" or "one's self", and "" having the connotation of "unfolding sound". Alternatively, he suggests a derivation of < < * < *, meaning in origin "the proper process (of speaking)".

The Tamil Lexicon of University of Madras defines the word "Tamil" as "sweetness". S. V. Subramanian suggests the meaning "sweet sound" from "tam" — "sweet" and "il" — "sound".

Old Tamil is the period of the Tamil language spanning the 3rd century BC to the 8th century AD. The earliest records in Old Tamil are short inscriptions from between the 3rd and 2nd century BC in caves and on pottery. These inscriptions are written in a variant of the <a href="Brahmi%20script">Brahmi script</a> called <a href="Tamil-Brahmi">Tamil-Brahmi</a>. The earliest long text in Old Tamil is the "<a href="Tolk%C4%81ppiyam">Tolkāppiyam</a>", an early work on Tamil grammar and poetics, whose oldest layers could be as old as the 1st century BC. A large number of literary works in Old Tamil have also survived. These include a corpus of 2,381 poems collectively known as <a href="Sangam%20literature">Sangam literature</a>. These poems are usually dated to between the 1st and 5th centuries AD.

The evolution of <a href="Old%20Tamil">Old Tamil</a> into <a href="Middle%20Tamil">Middle Tamil</a>, which is generally taken to have been completed by the 8th century, was characterised by a number of phonological and grammatical changes. In phonological terms, the most important shifts were the virtual disappearance of the aytam (ஃ), an old phoneme, the coalescence of the alveolar and dental nasals, and the transformation of the alveolar <a href="plosive">plosive</a> into a <a href="Rhotic%20consonant">rhotic</a>. In grammar, the most important change was the emergence of the present tense. The present tense evolved out of the verb ' (), meaning "to be possible" or "to befall". In Old Tamil, this verb was used as an <a href="Grammatical%20aspect">aspect marker</a> to indicate that an action was micro-durative, non-sustained or non-lasting, usually in combination with a time marker such as ' (). In Middle Tamil, this usage evolved into a present tense marker – "" () – which combined the old aspect and time markers.

The <a href="Nannul">Nannul</a> remains the standard normative grammar for modern literary Tamil, which therefore continues to be based on Middle Tamil of the 13th century rather than on Modern Tamil. Colloquial spoken Tamil, in contrast, shows a number of changes. The negative conjugation of verbs, for example, has fallen out of use in Modern Tamil – instead, negation is expressed either morphologically or syntactically. Modern spoken Tamil also shows a number of sound changes, in particular, a tendency to lower high vowels in initial and medial positions, and the disappearance of vowels between plosives and between a plosive and rhotic.

Contact with European languages affected written and spoken Tamil. Changes in written Tamil include the use of European-style punctuation and the use of consonant clusters that were not permitted in Middle Tamil. The syntax of written Tamil has also changed, with the introduction of new aspectual auxiliaries and more complex sentence structures, and with the emergence of a more rigid word order that resembles the <a href="Theta%20role">syntactic argument structure</a> of English. Simultaneously, a strong strain of <a href="linguistic%20purism">linguistic purism</a> emerged in the early 20th century, culminating in the <a href="Pure%20Tamil%20Movement">Pure Tamil Movement</a> which called for removal of all Sanskritic elements from Tamil. It received some support from <a href="Dravidian%20parties">Dravidian parties</a>. This led to the replacement of a significant number of <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> loanwords by Tamil equivalents, though many others remain.

Tamil is the primary language of the majority of the people residing in <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a>, <a href="Puducherry">Puducherry</a>, in India and <a href="Northern%20Province%2C%20Sri%20Lanka">Northern Province</a>, <a href="Eastern%20Province%2C%20Sri%20Lanka">Eastern Province</a>, in Sri Lanka. The language is spoken among small minority groups in other states of India which include <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a>, <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a>, <a href="Kerala">Kerala</a>, <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> and in certain regions of Sri Lanka such as <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a> and <a href="Central%20Province%2C%20Sri%20Lanka">the hill country</a>. Tamil or dialects of it were used widely in the state of Kerala as the major language of administration, literature and common usage until the 12th century AD. Tamil was also used widely in inscriptions found in southern <a href="Andhra%20Pradesh">Andhra Pradesh</a> districts of <a href="Chittoor%20district">Chittoor</a> and <a href="Nellore%20district">Nellore</a> until the 12th century AD. Tamil was used for inscriptions from the 10th through 14th centuries in southern Karnataka districts such as <a href="Kolar%20District">Kolar</a>, <a href="Mysore">Mysore</a>, <a href="Mandya">Mandya</a> and <a href="Bangalore">Bangalore</a>.

There are currently sizeable <a href="Tamil%20diaspora">Tamil-speaking populations</a> descended from colonial-era migrants in <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>, <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>, <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="Tamil%20South%20Africans">South Africa</a>, Indonesia, Thailand, <a href="Burma">Burma</a>, and <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>. A large community of <a href="Tamils%20in%20Pakistan">Pakistani Tamils</a> speakers exists in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, which includes Tamil-speaking Hindus as well as Christians and Muslims – including some Tamil-speaking Muslim refugees from Sri Lanka. Many in <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>, <a href="Guyana">Guyana</a>, <a href="Fiji">Fiji</a>, <a href="Suriname">Suriname</a>, and <a href="Trinidad%20and%20Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a> have Tamil origins, but only a small number speak the language. In Reunion where the Tamil language was forbidden to be learnt and used in public space by <a href="France">France</a> it is now being relearnt by students and adults. It is also used by groups of migrants <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20Tamil%20diaspora">from Sri Lanka</a> and India in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> (especially <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>), <a href="Tamil%20Americans">United States</a> (especially <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> and <a href="Indians%20in%20the%20New%20York%20City%20metropolitan%20region">New York City</a>), <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, many Middle Eastern countries, and some European countries.

Tamil is the <a href="official%20language">official language</a> of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu and one of the <a href="Languages%20with%20official%20status%20in%20India">22 languages under schedule 8 of the constitution of India</a>. It is one of the official languages of the union territory of <a href="Puducherry">Puducherry</a> and the <a href="Andaman%20and%20Nicobar%20Islands">Andaman and Nicobar Islands</a>. Tamil is also one of the official languages of <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>. Tamil is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka, along with <a href="Sinhala%20language">Sinhala</a>. It was once given nominal official status in the Indian state of <a href="Haryana">Haryana</a>, purportedly as a rebuff to <a href="Punjab%20%28India%29">Punjab</a>, though there was no attested Tamil-speaking population in the state, and was later replaced by <a href="Punjabi%20language">Punjabi</a>, in 2010. In Malaysia, 543 primary education <a href="Education%20in%20Malaysia%23Stages">government schools</a> are available fully in <a href="medium%20of%20instruction">Tamil medium</a>. The establishments of Tamil medium schools have been currently in process in <a href="Myanmar">Myanmar</a> to provide education completely in Tamil language by the Tamils who settled there 200 years ago. Tamil is taught in <a href="Canada">Canada</a> for the local Tamil minority populations and the month of January has been declared "Tamil Heritage Month" by the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">Parliament of Canada</a>. Tamil enjoys a special status of protection under Article 6(b), Chapter 1 of the <a href="Constitution%20of%20South%20Africa">Constitution of South Africa</a> and is taught as a subject in schools in <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a> province. Recently, it has been rolled out as a subject of study in schools in the <a href="Overseas%20France">French overseas department</a> of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>.

In addition, with the creation in October 2004 of a legal status for classical languages by the <a href="Government%20of%20India">Government of India</a> and following a political campaign supported by several Tamil associations, Tamil became the first legally recognised <a href="Languages%20of%20India%23Classical%20languages">Classical language</a> of India. The recognition was announced by the contemporaneous <a href="President%20of%20India">President of India</a>, <a href="Abdul%20Kalam">Abdul Kalam</a>, in a joint sitting of both houses of the <a href="Parliament%20of%20India">Indian Parliament</a> on 6 June 2004.

The <a href="Socio-linguistics">socio-linguistic</a> situation of Tamil is characterised by <a href="diglossia">diglossia</a>: there are two separate registers varying by <a href="socioeconomic%20status">socioeconomic status</a>, a high register and a low one. Tamil dialects are primarily differentiated from each other by the fact that they have undergone different phonological changes and sound shifts in evolving from Old Tamil. For example, the word for "here"—' in "Centamil" (the classic variety)—has evolved into ' in the Kongu dialect of <a href="Coimbatore">Coimbatore</a>, "inga" in the dialect of <a href="Thanjavur">Thanjavur</a>, and ' in some <a href="Sri%20Lankan%20Tamil%20dialects">dialects of Sri Lanka</a>. Old Tamil's ' (where ' means place) is the source of ' in the dialect of <a href="Tirunelveli">Tirunelveli</a>, Old Tamil ' is the source of ' in the dialect of <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a>, and "" in some northern dialects. Even now, in the Coimbatore area, it is common to hear "" meaning "that place". Although Tamil dialects do not differ significantly in their vocabulary, there are a few exceptions. The dialects spoken in Sri Lanka retain many words and grammatical forms that are not in everyday use in India, and use many other words slightly differently. Tamil dialects include <a href="Central%20Tamil%20dialect">Central Tamil dialect</a>, <a href="Kongu%20Tamil">Kongu Tamil</a>, <a href="Madras%20Bashai">Madras Bashai</a>, <a href="Madurai%20Tamil">Madurai Tamil</a>, <a href="Nellai%20Tamil">Nellai Tamil</a>, <a href="Kumari%20tamil">Kumari tamil</a> in <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Batticaloa%20Tamil%20dialect">Batticaloa Tamil dialect</a>, <a href="Jaffna%20Tamil%20dialect">Jaffna Tamil dialect</a>, <a href="Negombo%20Tamil%20dialect">Negombo Tamil dialect</a> in Sri Lanka. <a href="Sankethi%20dialect">Sankethi dialect</a> in Karnataka has been heavily influenced by <a href="Kannada">Kannada</a>.

The dialect of the district of <a href="Palakkad">Palakkad</a> in Kerala has a large number of <a href="Malayalam%20language">Malayalam</a> loanwords, has been influenced by Malayalam's syntax, and has a distinctive Malayalam accent. Similarly, Tamil spoken in Kanyakumari District has more unique words and phonetic style than Tamil spoken at other parts of Tamil Nadu. The words and phonetics are so different that a person from <a href="Kanyakumari%20district">Kanyakumari district</a> is easily identifiable by their spoken Tamil. <a href="Hebbar%20Iyengars">Hebbar</a> and <a href="Mandyam">Mandyam</a> dialects, spoken by groups of Tamil <a href="Vaishnavism">Vaishnavites</a> who migrated to <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> in the 11th century, retain many features of the "Vaishnava paribasai", a special form of Tamil developed in the 9th and 10th centuries that reflect Vaishnavite religious and spiritual values. Several <a href="caste">caste</a>s have their own <a href="sociolect">sociolect</a>s which most members of that caste traditionally used regardless of where they come from. It is often possible to identify a person's caste by their speech. Tamil in Sri Lanka incorporates <a href="Loan%20words%20in%20Sri%20Lankan%20Tamil">loan words</a> from <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, <a href="Dutch%20Language">Dutch</a>, and English.

In addition to its dialects, Tamil exhibits different forms: a classical literary style modelled on the ancient language ('), a modern literary and formal style ('), and a modern <a href="colloquial">colloquial</a> form ('). These styles shade into each other, forming a stylistic continuum. For example, it is possible to write ' with a vocabulary drawn from ', or to use forms associated with one of the other variants while speaking '.

In modern times, ' is generally used in formal writing and speech. For instance, it is the language of textbooks, of much of <a href="Tamil%20literature">Tamil literature</a> and of public speaking and debate. In recent times, however, ' has been making inroads into areas that have traditionally been considered the province of '. Most contemporary cinema, theatre and popular entertainment on television and radio, for example, is in ', and many politicians use it to bring themselves closer to their audience. The increasing use of ' in modern times has led to the emergence of unofficial ‘standard' spoken dialects. In India, the ‘standard' ', rather than on any one dialect, but has been significantly influenced by the dialects of <a href="Thanjavur">Thanjavur</a> and <a href="Madurai">Madurai</a>. In Sri Lanka, the standard is based on the dialect of <a href="Jaffna">Jaffna</a>.

After <a href="Tamil%20Brahmi">Tamil Brahmi</a> fell out of use, Tamil was written using a script called <a href="Vatteluttu%20alphabet"></a> amongst others such as <a href="Grantha%20script">Grantha</a> and <a href="Pallava%20script">Pallava</a>. The current Tamil script consists of 12 <a href="vowel">vowel</a>s, 18 <a href="consonant">consonant</a>s and one special character, the "<a href="%C4%81ytam">āytam</a>". The vowels and consonants combine to form 216 compound characters, giving a total of 247 characters (12 + 18 + 1 + (12 x 18)). All consonants have an inherent vowel "a", as with other <a href="Indic%20scripts">Indic scripts</a>. This inherent vowel is removed by adding a <a href="tittle">tittle</a> called a "", to the consonantal sign. For example, is "ṉa" (with the inherent "a") and is "ṉ" (without a vowel). Many Indic scripts have a similar sign, generically called <a href="virama">virama</a>, but the Tamil script is somewhat different in that it nearly always uses a visible "puḷḷi" to indicate a 'dead consonant' (a consonant without a vowel). In other Indic scripts, it is generally preferred to use a ligature or a half form to write a syllable or a cluster containing a dead consonant, although writing it with a visible virama is also possible. The Tamil script does not differentiate voiced and unvoiced <a href="plosive">plosive</a>s. Instead, plosives are articulated with voice depending on their position in a word, in accordance with the rules of <a href="Tamil%20phonology">Tamil phonology</a>.

In addition to the standard characters, six characters taken from the <a href="Grantha%20script">Grantha script</a>, which was used in the Tamil region to write Sanskrit, are sometimes used to represent sounds not native to Tamil, that is, words adopted from Sanskrit, Prakrit and other languages. The traditional system prescribed by classical grammars for writing loan-words, which involves respelling them in accordance with Tamil phonology, remains, but is not always consistently applied. <a href="ISO%2015919%23Overview">ISO 15919</a> is an international standard for the <a href="Tamil%20script%23Letters">transliteration of Tamil</a> and other Indic scripts into Latin characters. It uses diacritics to map the much larger set of Brahmic consonants and vowels to the Latin script. Tamil can be transliterated into English by using ISO 15919, since English language uses the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin script</a> for writing.

Apart from the usual numerals, Tamil has numerals for 10, 100 and 1000. Symbols for day, month, year, debit, credit, as above, rupee, and numeral are present as well. Tamil also uses several historical fractional signs.

Tamil phonology is characterised by the presence of <a href="retroflex%20consonant">retroflex consonant</a>s and multiple <a href="Rhotic%20consonant">rhotics</a>. Tamil does not distinguish phonologically between voiced and unvoiced consonants; phonetically, voice is assigned depending on a consonant's position in a word. Tamil phonology permits few consonant clusters, which can never be word initial. Native grammarians classify Tamil phonemes into vowels, consonants, and a "secondary character", the āytam.

Tamil has five vowel qualities, namely , , , and . Each may be long or short. There are two <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s, and . Long vowels are about twice as long as short vowels. The <a href="diphthong">diphthong</a>s are usually pronounced about 1.5 times as long as short vowels. Most grammatical texts place them with the long vowels.

Tamil <a href="consonants">consonants</a> are presented as hard, soft and medial in some grammars which roughly corresponds to plosives, nasals and approximants. Unlike most Indian languages, Tamil does not distinguish <a href="aspiration%20%28phonetics%29">aspirated and unaspirated</a> consonants. In addition, the voicing of <a href="plosive">plosive</a>s is governed by strict rules in "". Plosives are unvoiced if they occur word-initially or doubled. Elsewhere they are voiced, with a few becoming <a href="fricative">fricative</a>s <a href="%3Awiktionary%3Aintervocalic">intervocalically</a>, which means that voicing is not a phonological trait for plosives. <a href="Nasal%20stop">Nasals</a> and <a href="Approximant%20consonant">approximants</a> are always voiced.

Tamil is characterised by its use of more than one type of <a href="coronal%20consonant">coronal consonant</a>s: like many of the other languages of India, it contains a series of <a href="retroflex%20consonant">retroflex consonant</a>s. Notably, the Tamil retroflex series includes the <a href="retroflex%20approximant">retroflex approximant</a> () (example Tamil; often transcribed 'zh'), which is absent in the Indo-Aryan languages. Among the other Dravidian languages, the retroflex approximant also occurs in <a href="Malayalam%20language">Malayalam</a> (for example in 'Kozhikode'), disappeared from spoken <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a> around 1000 AD (although the character is still written, and exists in <a href="Unicode">Unicode</a>, ೞ as in ಕೊೞೆ), and was never present in <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>. In many dialects of colloquial Tamil, this consonant is seen as disappearing and shifting to the <a href="alveolar%20lateral%20approximant">alveolar lateral approximant</a> . <a href="Dental%20consonant">Dental</a> and <a href="alveolar%20consonant">alveolar consonant</a>s also historically contrasted with each other, a typically Dravidian trait not found in the neighbouring Indo-Aryan languages. While this distinction can still be seen in the written language, it has been largely lost in colloquial spoken Tamil, and even in literary usage the letters (dental) and (alveolar) may be seen as <a href="allophonic">allophonic</a>. Likewise, the historical alveolar stop has transformed into a trill consonant in many modern dialects.

A chart of the Tamil consonant <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a>s in the follows:

The plosives have <a href="Voice%20%28phonetics%29">voiced</a> allophones after nasals. The sounds and are peripheral to the phonology of Tamil, being found only in loanwords and frequently replaced by native sounds. There are well-defined rules for <a href="elision">elision</a> in Tamil categorised into classes based on the phoneme which undergoes elision.

Classical Tamil had a phoneme called the "<a href="visarga">āytam</a>", written as ‘'. Tamil grammarians of the time classified it as a dependent phoneme (or restricted phoneme) (""), but it is very rare in modern Tamil. The rules of pronunciation given in the "Tolkāppiyam", a text on the grammar of Classical Tamil, suggest that the "āytam" could have <a href="Glottal%20stop">glottalised</a> the sounds it was combined with. It has also been suggested that the "āytam" was used to represent the <a href="Implosive%20consonant">voiced implosive</a> (or closing part or the first half) of geminated voiced plosives inside a word. The āytam, in modern Tamil, is also used to convert "p" to "f" when writing English words using the Tamil script.

Tamil employs <a href="Agglutination">agglutinative</a> grammar, where suffixes are used to mark <a href="noun%20class">noun class</a>, <a href="grammatical%20number">number</a>, and <a href="Grammatical%20case">case</a>, verb <a href="grammatical%20tense">tense</a> and other grammatical categories. Tamil's standard <a href="metalanguage">metalinguistic</a> terminology and scholarly vocabulary is itself Tamil, as opposed to the <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> that is standard for most <a href="Indo-Aryan%20languages">Aryan languages</a>.

Much of Tamil grammar is extensively described in the oldest known grammar book for Tamil, the "<a href="Tolk%C4%81ppiyam">Tolkāppiyam</a>". Modern Tamil writing is largely based on the 13th century grammar ' which restated and clarified the rules of the "Tolkāppiyam", with some modifications. Traditional Tamil grammar consists of five parts, namely ', "sol", ', "yāppu", '. Of these, the last two are mostly applied in poetry.

Tamil words consist of a <a href="lexeme">lexical root</a> to which one or more <a href="affix">affix</a>es are attached. Most Tamil affixes are <a href="suffix">suffix</a>es. Tamil suffixes can be <a href="Morphological%20derivation">derivational</a> suffixes, which either change the part of speech of the word or its meaning, or <a href="inflection">inflection</a>al suffixes, which mark categories such as <a href="Grammatical%20person">person</a>, <a href="Grammatical%20number">number</a>, <a href="Grammatical%20mood">mood</a>, <a href="Grammatical%20tense">tense</a>, etc. There is no absolute limit on the length and extent of <a href="agglutination">agglutination</a>, which can lead to long words with a large number of suffixes, which would require several words or a sentence in English. To give an example, the word "pōkamuṭiyātavarkaḷukkāka" (போகமுடியாதவர்களுக்காக) means "for the sake of those who cannot go" and consists of the following <a href="morpheme">morpheme</a>s:

Tamil nouns (and pronouns) are classified into two super-classes (')—the "rational" ('), and the "irrational" ("")—which include a total of five classes ("pāl", which literally means "gender"). Humans and <a href="deity">deities</a> are classified as "rational", and all other nouns (animals, objects, abstract nouns) are classified as irrational. The "rational" nouns and pronouns belong to one of three classes ("pāl")—masculine singular, feminine singular, and rational plural. The "irrational" nouns and pronouns belong to one of two classes: irrational singular and irrational plural. The "pāl" is often indicated through suffixes. The plural form for rational nouns may be used as an <a href="honorific">honorific</a>, gender-neutral, singular form.

Suffixes are used to perform the functions of <a href="Grammatical%20case">cases</a> or <a href="postposition">postposition</a>s. Traditional grammarians tried to group the various suffixes into eight cases corresponding to the cases used in <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>. These were the <a href="nominative%20case">nominative</a>, <a href="accusative%20case">accusative</a>, <a href="dative%20case">dative</a>, <a href="sociative%20case">sociative</a>, <a href="genitive%20case">genitive</a>, <a href="instrumental%20case">instrumental</a>, <a href="locative%20case">locative</a>, and <a href="ablative%20case">ablative</a>. Modern grammarians argue that this classification is artificial, and that Tamil usage is best understood if each suffix or combination of suffixes is seen as marking a separate case. Tamil nouns can take one of four <a href="Prefix%20%28linguistics%29">prefixes</a>: "i", "a", "u", and "e" which are functionally equivalent to the <a href="demonstrative">demonstrative</a>s in English. For example, the word "vazhi" (வழி) meaning "way" can take these to produce "ivvazhi" (இவ்வழி) "this way", "avvazhi" (அவ்வழி) "that way", "uvvazhi" (உவ்வழி) "the medial way" and "evvazhi" (எவ்வழி) "which way".

Tamil verbs are also inflected through the use of suffixes. A typical Tamil verb form will have a number of <a href="suffix">suffix</a>es, which show person, number, mood, tense, and voice.

Traditional grammars of Tamil do not distinguish between <a href="adjective">adjective</a>s and <a href="adverb">adverb</a>s, including both of them under the category "uriccol", although modern grammarians tend to distinguish between them on morphological and syntactical grounds. Tamil has a large number of <a href="ideophone">ideophone</a>s that act as adverbs indicating the way the object in a given state "says" or "sounds".

Tamil does not have <a href="article%20%28grammar%29">articles</a>. Definiteness and indefiniteness are either indicated by special grammatical devices, such as using the number "one" as an indefinite article, or by the context. In the first person plural, Tamil makes a distinction between <a href="Clusivity">inclusive</a> pronouns ' (we), ' (our) that include the addressee and exclusive pronouns ' (we), ' (our) that do not.

Tamil is a consistently <a href="head-final">head-final</a> language. The verb comes at the end of the clause, with a typical word order of <a href="subject%E2%80%93object%E2%80%93verb">subject–object–verb</a> (SOV). However, word order in Tamil is also flexible, so that surface permutations of the SOV order are possible with different <a href="pragmatics">pragmatic</a> effects. Tamil has <a href="postposition">postposition</a>s rather than <a href="prepositions">prepositions</a>. Demonstratives and modifiers precede the noun within the noun phrase. Subordinate clauses precede the verb of the matrix clause.

Tamil is a <a href="null-subject%20language">null-subject language</a>. Not all Tamil sentences have subjects, verbs, and objects. It is possible to construct grammatically valid and meaningful sentences which lack one or more of the three. For example, a sentence may only have a verb—such as ' ("completed")—or only a subject and object, without a verb such as ' ("That [is] my house"). Tamil does not have a <a href="copula%20%28linguistics%29">copula</a> (a linking verb equivalent to the word "is"). The word is included in the translations only to convey the meaning more easily.

The vocabulary of Tamil is mainly Dravidian. A strong sense of <a href="linguistic%20purism">linguistic purism</a> is found in Modern Tamil, which opposes the use of foreign loanwords. Nonetheless, a number of words used in classical and modern Tamil are loanwords from the languages of neighbouring groups, or with whom the Tamils had trading links, including <a href="Munda%20languages">Munda</a> (for example, "frog" from Munda ), <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> (e.g. "sago" from Malay ), Chinese (for example, "skiff" from Chinese san-pan) and Greek (for example, from Greek ὥρα). In more modern times, Tamil has imported words from <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a> and <a href="Marathi%20language">Marathi</a>, reflecting groups that have influenced the Tamil area at times, and from neighbouring languages such as <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>, <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a>, and Sinhala. During the modern period, words have also been adapted from European languages, such as Portuguese, French, and English.

The strongest impact of purism in Tamil has been on words taken from Sanskrit. During its history, Tamil, along with other Dravidian languages like <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu</a>, <a href="Kannada%20language">Kannada</a>, <a href="Malayalam">Malayalam</a> etc., was influenced by <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a> in terms of vocabulary, grammar and literary styles, reflecting the increased trend of <a href="Sanskritisation">Sanskritisation</a> in the Tamil country. Tamil vocabulary never became quite as heavily Sanskritised as that of the other Dravidian languages, and unlike in those languages, it was and remains possible to express complex ideas (including in science, art, religion and law) without the use of Sanskrit loan words. In addition, Sanskritisation was actively resisted by a number of authors of the late medieval period, culminating in the 20th century in a movement called "<a href="Tanittamil%20Iyakkam"></a>" (meaning "pure Tamil movement"), led by <a href="Parithimaar%20Kalaignar">Parithimaar Kalaignar</a> and <a href="Maraimalai%20Adigal">Maraimalai Adigal</a>, which sought to remove the accumulated influence of Sanskrit on Tamil. As a result of this, Tamil in formal documents, literature and public speeches has seen a marked decline in the use Sanskrit loan words in the past few decades, under some estimates having fallen from 40–50% to about 20%. As a result, the Prakrit and Sanskrit loan words used in modern Tamil are, unlike in some other Dravidian languages, restricted mainly to some spiritual terminology and <a href="abstract%20noun">abstract noun</a>s.

In the 20th century, institutions and learned bodies have, with government support, generated technical dictionaries for Tamil containing <a href="neologism">neologism</a>s and words derived from Tamil roots to replace loan words from English and other languages.

Words of Tamil origin occur in other languages. A notable example of a word in worldwide use with Dravidian (not specifically Tamil) etymology is "<a href="%3Awikt%3Aorange">orange</a>", via Sanskrit ' from a Dravidian predecessor of Tamil "nartaṅkāy" "fragrant fruit". One suggestion as to the origin of the word "anaconda" is the Tamil "anaikkonda," "having killed an elephant". <a href="Words%20of%20Tamil%20origin">Examples in English</a> include "cheroot" (' meaning "rolled up"), "mango" (from "māngāi"), "mulligatawny" (from ', "pepper water"), "pariah" (from "paraiyan"), "curry" (from "kari"), and "catamaran" (from ', "bundled logs"), congee (from "kanji" – rice porridge or gruel).

Texas A&M University (Texas A&M or A&M) is a <a href="public%20university">public</a> research university in <a href="College%20Station%2C%20Texas">College Station, Texas</a>, United States. It is a state flagship university and since 1948 is the founding member of the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%20System">Texas A&M University System</a>. The Texas A&M system endowment is among the 10 largest endowments in the nation. , Texas A&M's student body is the <a href="List%20of%20universities%20in%20Texas%20by%20enrollment">largest in Texas</a> and <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20university%20campuses%20by%20enrollment">the second largest in the United States</a>. Texas A&M's designation as a <a href="land-grant%20university">land</a>, <a href="sea%20grant%20colleges">sea</a>, and <a href="space%20grant%20colleges">space grant</a> institution–the only university in Texas to hold all three designations–reflects a range of research with ongoing projects funded by organizations such as the <a href="NASA">National Aeronautics and Space Administration</a> (NASA), the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a>, the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>, and the <a href="Office%20of%20Naval%20Research">Office of Naval Research</a>. In 2001, Texas A&M was inducted as a member of the <a href="Association%20of%20American%20Universities">Association of American Universities</a>. The school's students, <a href="alumnus">alumni</a>—over 450,000 strong—and sports teams are known as <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20Aggies">Aggies</a>. The Texas A&M Aggies athletes compete in 18 varsity sports as a member of the <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a>.

The first public institution of higher education in Texas, the school opened on October 4, 1876, as the <a href="History%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas</a> under the provisions of the <a href="Morrill%20Land-Grant%20Acts">Morrill Land-Grant Acts</a>. Originally, the college taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on classical studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After four years, students could attain degrees in scientific agriculture, <a href="civil%20engineering">civil</a> and mechanical engineering, and language and literature. Under the leadership of President <a href="James%20Earl%20Rudder">James Earl Rudder</a> in the 1960s, A.M.C. desegregated, became coeducational, and dropped the requirement for participation in the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%20Corps%20of%20Cadets">Corps of Cadets</a>. To reflect the institution's expanded roles and academic offerings, the <a href="Texas%20Legislature">Texas Legislature</a> renamed the school to Texas A&M University in 1963. The letters "A&M," originally A.M.C. short for "Agricultural and Mechanical College," are retained as a link to the university's tradition.

The main campus is one of the largest in the United States, spanning , and is home to the <a href="George%20Bush%20Presidential%20Library">George Bush Presidential Library</a>. About one-fifth of the student body lives on campus. Texas A&M has more than 1,000 officially recognized student organizations. Many students also observe the <a href="Traditions%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">traditions</a>, which govern daily life, as well as special occasions, including sports events. Working with various A&M-related agencies, the school has a direct presence in each of the 254 counties in Texas. The university offers degrees in more than 150 courses of study through ten colleges and houses 18 research institutes.

As a <a href="United%20States%20Senior%20Military%20College">Senior Military College</a>, Texas A&M is one of six American public universities with a full-time, volunteer Corps of Cadets who study alongside civilian undergraduate students.

The <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> laid the groundwork for the establishment of A.M.C. in 1862 with the adoption of the <a href="Morrill%20Act">Morrill Act</a>. The act auctioned land grants of public lands to establish endowments for colleges where the "leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mechanical arts... to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and professions in life". In 1871, the <a href="Texas%20Legislature">Texas Legislature</a> used these funds to establish the state's first public institution of higher education, the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, then known as Texas A.M.C. <a href="Brazos%20County">Brazos County</a> donated near <a href="Bryan%2C%20Texas">Bryan, Texas</a>, for the school's campus. A detailed listing and backgrounds of all of the University's presidents can be found on the Brazos County Texas Genealogical Association's site 

Enrollment began on October 2, 1876. Six students enrolled on the first day, and classes officially began on October 4, 1876, with six faculty members. During the first semester, enrollment increased to 48 students, and by the end of the spring 1877 semester, 106 students had enrolled. Admission was limited to white males, and all students were required to participate in the <a href="Texas%20A.M.C.%20University%20Corps%20of%20Cadets">Corps of Cadets</a> and receive military training. Although traditional <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%20Corps%20of%20Cadets">Texas A&M University Corps of Cadets</a> "campusologies" indicate 40 students began classes on October 4, 1876, the exact number of students enrolled on that day is unknown. Enrollment climbed to 258 students before declining to 108 students in 1883, the year the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas</a> opened in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a>. Although originally envisioned and annotated in the <a href="Texas%20Constitution">Texas Constitution</a> as a branch of the University of Texas, Texas A.M.C. had a separate Board of Directors from the University of Texas from the first day of classes and was never enveloped into the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20System">University of Texas System</a>.

In the late 1880s, many Texas residents saw no need for two colleges in Texas and clamored for an end of Texas A.M.C. In 1891, Texas A.M.C. was saved from potential closure by its new president <a href="Lawrence%20Sullivan%20Ross">Lawrence Sullivan Ross</a>, former <a href="governor%20of%20Texas">governor of Texas</a>, and well-respected <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> <a href="Brigadier%20General">Brigadier General</a>. Ross made many improvements to the school and enrollment doubled to 467 cadets as parents sent their sons to Texas A.M.C. "to learn to be like Ross". During his tenure, many enduring <a href="Traditions%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Aggie traditions</a> were born, including the creation of the first <a href="Traditions%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Aggie Ring</a>. After his death in 1898, a statue was erected in front of what is now Academic Plaza to honor Ross and his achievements in the history of the school. In 2017, the status of this statue was in doubt after other schools removed statues of former Confederate officers. In contrast, the Texas A&M Chancellor and President announced the Sul Ross statue would remain as Ross's statue's place of honor was not based upon his service in the Confederate Army.

Under pressure from the legislature, in 1911 the school began allowing women to attend classes during the summer semester. At the same time, A.M.C. began expanding its academic pursuits with the establishment of the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20College%20of%20Veterinary%20Medicine%20%26amp%3B%20Biomedical%20Sciences">School of Veterinary Medicine</a> in 1915.

Many Texas A&M graduates served during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. By 1918, 49% of all graduates of the college were in military service, more than any other school. In early September 1918, the entire senior class enlisted, with plans to send the younger students at staggered dates throughout the next year. Many of the seniors were fighting in France when the war ended two months later.
More than 1,200 alumni served as commissioned officers. After the war, Texas A&M grew rapidly and became nationally recognized for its programs in agriculture, engineering, and military science. The first graduate school was organized in 1924 and the school awarded its first PhD in 1940. In 1925, Mary Evelyn Crawford Locke became the first female to receive a diploma from Texas A&M, although she was not allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony. The following month the Board of Directors officially prohibited all women from enrolling.

Many Aggies again served in the military during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, with the college producing 20,229 combat troops. Of those, 14,123 Aggies served as officers, more than any other school and more than the combined total of the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a>. During the war, 29 A&M graduates reached the rank of general.

At the start of World War II, Texas A&M was selected as one of six engineering colleges to participate in the <a href="Electronics%20Training%20Program">Electronics Training Program</a>, a ten-month activity of 12-hour study days to train Navy personnel who were urgently needed to maintain the then-new, highly complex electronic equipment such as <a href="radar">radar</a>. These colleges provided the Primary School, wherein the key topics of the first two years of a college <a href="electrical%20engineering">electrical engineering</a> curriculum were condensed into three months. The instructional effort at College Station was developed and led by Frank Bolton, EE department head and future Texas A&M president. At a given time, some 500 Navy students were on the campus, a significant fraction of the then-years enrollment. Students graduating from the Primary Schools then went to a secondary school, one of which was at <a href="Ward%20Island%20%28Texas%29">Ward Island, Texas</a> (the future location of <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University-Corpus%20Christi">Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi</a>).

Enrollment soared after the war as many former soldiers used the <a href="G.I.%20Bill">G.I. Bill</a> to further their education. In 1948, the state legislature formally recognized Texas A&M as a separate university system from the University of Texas System, codifying the de facto arrangement between the schools.

On March 26, 1960, <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="James%20Earl%20Rudder">James Earl Rudder</a>, class of 1932, became the 16th president of the college. Rudder's tenure (1959–1970) marked a critical turning point in the school's history. Under his leadership, Texas A&M underwent a dramatic expansion in its physical plant construction, but more importantly, it diversified and expanded its student body by admitting women and minorities. The Corps of Cadets became voluntary. In the face of growing student activism during the 1960s, Rudder worked diligently to ensure that the school continue to fulfill its mission of providing a quality education for all Aggies. By his death in 1970, Rudder had overseen the growth of the school from 7,500 to 14,000 students from all 50 states and 75 nations.

In 1963, the 58th <a href="Legislature%20of%20Texas">Legislature of Texas</a> approved of Rudder's changes, and officially renamed the school "Texas A&M University," specifying that the "A" and the "M" were purely symbolic, reflecting the school's past, and no longer stood for "Agricultural and Mechanical". In the following 35 years, Texas A&M more than tripled its enrollment from 14,000 students to more than 45,000.

Much of the legislative work allowing the expansion of Texas A&M and the admission of women was pushed by <a href="Texas%20State%20Senate">State Senator</a> <a href="William%20T.%20Moore%20%28Texas%20politician%29">William T. "Bill" Moore</a>, who served from 1949 to 1981. Known as "the Bull of the Brazos" and "the father of the modern Texas A&M University," Moore was a Bryan attorney and businessman originally from <a href="Wheelock%2C%20Texas">Wheelock</a> in <a href="Robertson%20County%2C%20Texas">Robertson County</a>. He also taught economics at TAMU before his entry into World War II.

Texas A&M became one of the first four universities given the designation <a href="sea-grant%20university">sea-grant</a> for its achievements in <a href="oceanography">oceanography</a> and marine resources development in 1971. In 1989, the university earned the title <a href="space-grant%20college">space-grant</a> by <a href="NASA">NASA</a>, to recognize its commitment to space research and participation in the Texas Space Grant Consortium.
In 1997, the school became the home of the <a href="George%20Bush%20Presidential%20Library">George Bush Presidential Library</a>. Operated by the <a href="National%20Archives%20and%20Records%20Administration">National Archives and Records Administration</a>, it is one of thirteen American <a href="Presidential%20library">presidential libraries</a>. Former President <a href="George%20H.W.%20Bush">George Bush</a> remained actively involved with the university, frequently visiting the campus and participating in special events.

In 1998, activists on campus (including Professor Patrick Slattery) suggested the statue of former university president <a href="Lawrence%20Sullivan%20Ross">Lawrence Sullivan Ross</a> should be removed on the basis that he was a member of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. Instead, Slattery and others wanted to create a "diversity plaza," with a statue of <a href="Matthew%20Gaines">Matthew Gaines</a>, an African-American politician. The project was abandoned in the wake of the <a href="Aggie%20Bonfire%20tragedy">Aggie Bonfire tragedy</a>, in 1999.

Texas A&M received national media attention on November 18, 1999, when <a href="Aggie%20Bonfire">Aggie Bonfire</a>, a ninety-year-old student tradition, collapsed during construction. Eleven enrolled students and one alumnus died and twenty-seven others were injured. The accident was later attributed to improper design and poor construction practices. The victims' family members filed six lawsuits against Texas A&M officials, the Aggie Bonfire officials and the university. Half of the defendants settled their portion of the case in 2005, and a federal appeals court dismissed the remaining lawsuits against the university in 2007.

With strong support from <a href="Rice%20University">Rice University</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>, the <a href="Association%20of%20American%20Universities">Association of American Universities</a> inducted Texas A&M in May 2001, on the basis of the depth of the university's research and academic programs.

Texas A&M left the <a href="Big%2012%20Conference">Big 12 Conference</a> for the <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> on July 1, 2012. This ended Texas A&M's scheduled NCAA athletic competitions with three former <a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a> rivals–UT Austin, <a href="Baylor%20University">Baylor</a>, and <a href="Texas%20Tech%20University">Texas Tech</a>–for the foreseeable future.

The university underwent several large expansions in 2013. On July 12, 2013, <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20Health%20Science%20Center">Texas A&M Health Science Center</a> was formally merged into the university. On August 12, 2013, the university purchased the Texas Wesleyan University School of Law and renamed it the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20School%20of%20Law">Texas A&M School of Law</a>. Texas A&M on October 23, 2013, announced plans to build a new branch campus, Texas A&M University at Nazareth - Peace Campus, in <a href="Israel">Israel</a>.

In the fall of 2017 <a href="semester">semester</a>, Texas A&M was the second largest public <a href="List%20of%20largest%20U.S.%20universities%20by%20enrollment">American university</a> with an enrollment of more than 63,288 students pursuing degrees in 10 academic colleges. Another 5,700 are at the branch campuses in Galveston and Qatar and other locations across Texas. The student body includes students from all 50 US states and 124 foreign countries. As of Fall 2018, Texas residents account for 85.00% of the student population, while 8.74% are of international origin. Members of ethnic <a href="minority%20groups">minority groups</a> make up 44.16% of the student population. The student body consists of 46.99% women and 53.01% men.

The university consistently ranks among the top ten public universities each year in enrollment of <a href="National%20Merit">National Merit</a> scholars. According to the <a href="College%20Board">College Board</a>, the fall 2008 entering freshman class consisted of 54% students in the top 10% of their high school graduating class, 86% in the top quarter, and 99% in the top half. Seventy-four percent of these students took the <a href="SAT">SAT</a>. The middle 50% of the freshmen had average scores as follows: in critical reading, 520–630, math, 560–670, and in writing 500–610. Twenty-six percent of the incoming freshmen took the <a href="ACT%20%28examination%29">ACT</a>, with the middle 50% scoring between a 23 and 29. About 80 percent of the student body receives about $420 million in financial aid annually. The admission rate for students who applied as undergraduates in 2012 was 67%.

The Texas A&M University System, in 2006, was the first to explicitly state in its policy that technology commercialization was a criterion that could be used for <a href="tenure">tenure</a>. Passage of this policy was intended to give faculty more academic freedom and strengthen the university's industry partnerships. Texas A&M works with both state and university agencies on various local and international research projects to forge innovations in science and technology that can have commercial applications. This work is concentrated in two primary locations–Research Valley and Research Park. Research Valley, an alliance of educational and business organizations, consists of with of dedicated research space. An additional , with of research space, is located in Research Park.

Texas A&M has a campus in <a href="Education%20City">Education City</a>, <a href="Doha">Doha, Qatar</a>. The campus is part of Qatar's "massive venture to import elite higher education from the United States". TAMUQ was set up through an agreement between Texas A&M and the <a href="Qatar%20Foundation">Qatar Foundation</a> for Education, Science, and Community Development, a foundation started in 1995 by then-emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani and his wife and mother of the current emir, Sheikha Moza bint Nasser. TAMUQ was opened in 2003, and the current contract extends through 2023. The campus offers undergraduate degrees in chemical, electrical, mechanical and petroleum engineering and a graduate degree in chemical engineering. TAMUQ has received numerous awards for its research. Texas A&M receives $76.2 million per year from the Qatar Foundation for the campus. In the agreement with the Qatar Foundation, TAMU agreed that 70% of its undergraduate population at its Qatar campus would be Qatari citizens. The curriculum aims to "duplicate as closely as possible" the curriculum at College Station, but questions constantly arise over whether this is possible due to Qatar's strict stance on some of the freedoms granted to U.S. students. TAMU has also been the subject of criticism over its Qatari campus due to Qatar's support of global <a href="terrorism">terrorism</a> and appalling human rights record. Texas A&M Aggie Conservatives, a campus activism group, has spoken out against the campus and called for its immediate closure on the grounds that it violates a commitment to educating Texans, and diminishes the credibility of engineering degrees earned by students at College Station.

In late 2013, Texas A&M signed an agreement to open a $200 million campus in Nazareth, Israel as a "peace campus" for Arabs and Israelis. The agreement led to protests from students at the Qatari campus who claimed that it was "an insult to [their] people". The campus was never opened. Instead, Texas A&M opened a $6 million marine biology center in Haifa, Israel.

Texas A&M's <a href="College%20Station%2C%20Texas">College Station</a> campus, one of the largest in America, spans plus for Research Park.

Texas A&M also maintains the <a href="Bryan%20Air%20Force%20Base">RELLIS campus</a> formerly, Texas A&M Riverside Campus or Bryan Air Force Base. This extension of the main campus is to the northwest adjacent to <a href="Texas%20State%20Highway%2047">Texas State Highways 47</a> and <a href="Texas%20State%20Highway%2021">21</a>. RELLIS stands for "Respect," "Excellence," "Leadership," "Loyalty," "Integrity," and "Selfless service." <a href="Blinn%20College">Blinn College</a> will also maintain a campus presence at RELLIS to partner with other institutions and organizations. The Bryan City Council is considering <a href="Annexation">annexing</a> the 2,000-acre campus and nearby land. Annexation would allow the city to regulate development at the site, provide various municipal services, and expand the tax base though RELLIS itself as a public entity would not contribute to city <a href="property%20tax">property tax</a> revenues. Related private businesses attracted to the RELLIS area would produce such revenues.

Public art on the campus includes the 1997 statue, "<a href="The%20Day%20the%20Wall%20Came%20Down">The Day the Wall Came Down</a>", displayed at the Bush Presidential Library.

During the 2006 fall semester, 20.5 percent of the student body lived on campus in one of two distinct housing sections located on opposite ends of campus. Both the Northside and Southside areas contain student residence halls. While some halls are single-sex, others are <a href="co-educational">co-educational</a>. Usually students of different genders live on alternate floors, although some halls are segregated by room or suite. Residence hall styles vary. Many halls offer only indoor access to individual rooms, but other halls locate room entrances on an outdoor balcony. Room sizes vary by building. Halls with larger rooms include en-suite or private bathrooms, while halls with smaller rooms have a common bathroom on each floor. Several halls include a "substance-free" floor, where residents pledge to avoid bringing <a href="alcoholic%20beverage">alcohol</a>, <a href="recreational%20drug%20use">drugs</a>, or cigarettes into the hall.

Northside consists of 17 student residence halls, including the 3 university honors halls. Two of the university honors halls are freshman only. The halls are located near local entertainment district <a href="Northgate%2C%20TX">Northgate</a>, and offer convenient access to campus dining establishments: Sbisa Dining Hall and The Underground, a food court located in the Sbisa basement.

Several of the residence halls located on Southside are reserved for members of the <a href="%23Corps%20of%20Cadets">Corps of Cadets</a>. Non-corps halls in this area center around the Commons, a hub for activities and dining. Southside has two Learning Living Communities, which allow freshmen to live in a cluster with other students who share common interests.

Facilities for the Corps of Cadets are located in the Quadrangle, or <a href="List%20of%20Texas%20Aggie%20terms%23Q">"The Quad"</a>, an area consisting of dormitories, Duncan Dining Hall, and the Corps training fields. The Corps Arches, a series of 12 arches that "[symbolize] the spirit of <a href="%2312th%20Man">the 12th Man</a> of Texas A&M", mark the entrance to the Quadrangle. All cadets, except those who are married or who have had previous military service, must live in the Quad with assigned roommates from the same unit and graduating class. <a href="Reveille%20%28Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%29">Reveille</a>, the Aggie <a href="mascot">mascot</a>, lives with her handlers in the Quadrangle.

Texas A&M is one of six United States <a href="Senior%20Military%20College">Senior Military College</a>s. The schools' <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%20Corps%20of%20Cadets">Corps of Cadets</a> (or "the Corps") is one of the largest uniformed student bodies outside the <a href="service%20academy">service academies</a>. Many members participate in <a href="ROTC">ROTC</a> programs and earn commissions in the <a href="United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">United States Armed Forces</a> upon graduation. Members of the Corps have served in every <a href="armed%20conflict">armed conflict</a> fought by the United States since 1876. There were 20,229 Aggies who served in World War II, and of these, 14,123 served as officers. Since 1876, 225 Aggies have served as generals or <a href="Flag%20Officers">Flag Officers</a>.

Until 1965, Corps membership was mandatory. The Corps welcomed female members in the fall of 1974, and as of spring 2012, the co-ed Corps boasted an enrollment of more than 2000 cadets.
The Corps is composed of three Air Force Wings, three Army Brigades, three Navy and Marine Regiments, as well as the <a href="Fightin%27%20Texas%20Aggie%20Band">Fightin' Texas Aggie Band</a>, whose members may be affiliated with any military branch. Parson's Mounted Cavalry is the only mounted ROTC unit in the United States. The Ross Volunteer Company, the oldest student-run organization in the state, is the official honor guard for the <a href="Governor%20of%20Texas">Governor of Texas</a>. The Fish Drill Team, a precision, close-order rifle drill team composed entirely of Corps freshmen, represents the school in local and national competitions. They have won the national championship almost every year since their creation in 1946, and have appeared in several Hollywood productions, with prominent roles in the movies "<a href="A%20Few%20Good%20Men%20%28film%29">A Few Good Men</a>" and "<a href="Courage%20Under%20Fire">Courage Under Fire</a>".

The <a href="Fightin%27%20Texas%20Aggie%20Band">Fightin' Texas Aggie Band</a>, the world's largest precision <a href="military%20band">military</a> <a href="marching%20band">marching band</a>, provides music for University functions and presents intricate halftime performances at football games. Some band drills are so complicated that they require band members to step between each other's feet to complete the maneuvers. These drills must be drawn by hand as computer marching programs have returned errors; their calculations require two people to be in the same spot at the same time. Corps of Cadets membership is a requirement to join the Aggie Band, and bandsmen live by the same standards, schedules, and regimens as the rest of the Corps.

Texas A&M has over 1,000 student organizations, including academic, service, religious, <a href="Fraternities%20and%20sororities">Greek</a> and common interest organizations. Orientation programs encourage students to become involved in campus activities and organizations from the beginning. An April 2005 campus survey found that 74% of the students were involved with at least one organization and that 88% participated in a campus organization in the past.

Since 1955, the <a href="MSC%20Student%20Conference%20on%20National%20Affairs">MSC Student Conference on National Affairs</a> has held conferences, lectures, and other programs to bring the wider world to Texas A&M by discussing issues of national and international importance with top-caliber speakers like then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General <a href="Martin%20Dempsey">Martin Dempsey</a>, Texas A&M students, and those from across the nation.

One of the oldest student organizations is the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20Singing%20Cadets">Singing Cadets</a>, founded in 1893. Known as the "Voice of Aggieland", the Singing Cadets are an all-male choral group with about 70 members not affiliated with the Corps of Cadets. The group travels nationally and has completed several international tours; most recently, China in 2013.

<a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20Hillel">Texas A&M Hillel</a>, the oldest Hillel organization in the United States, was founded in 1920 at the original college. The organization occurred three years before the national <a href="Hillel%20Foundation">Hillel Foundation</a> was organized at the <a href="University%20of%20Illinois">University of Illinois</a>.
<a href="GLBT%20Aggies">GLBT Aggies</a> is the descendant organization of Gay Student Services (GSS), the only student organization to ever successfully sue the institution for official recognition. In the decision "<a href="Gay%20Student%20Services%20v.%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Gay Student Services v.

The Graduate Student Council, founded in 1995, serves as the student government for Texas A&M University's graduate and professional students. It is a council representing all TAMU graduate students with a purpose to improve graduate students' academic, living and social experiences. The GSC represents students' concerns and is their liaison with the University Administration.

The Department of Recreational Sports provides drop-in recreation, intramural sports, sport clubs, indoor climbing, strength and conditioning, fitness classes, Outdoor Adventures, aquatics classes, and more. Rec Sports facilities include the flagship Student Recreation Center, which is undergoing a renovation and expansion that will increase the size of the facility to approximately 400,000 square feet; a natatorium; the Penberthy Rec Sports Complex; and the Omar Smith Instructional Tennis Center.

Some national service organizations originated at A&M. Aggie students founded the largest one-day student-run service project in America known as The Big Event. The annual service project allows students to give back to their community by assisting local residents. The organization CARPOOL, a student-run, <a href="designated%20driver">safe ride program</a> has provided over 250,000 free rides () to Aggies unable to transport themselves home. Its organizers also assist other universities in establishing similar programs. In addition, the <a href="Corporation%20for%20National%20and%20Community%20Service">Corporation for National and Community Service</a> listed A&M among the 500 academic institutions in the 2005–06 President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll.

The Student Government Association (SGA), one of A&M's largest organizations, consists of over 1,300 student members in 3 branches, 15 committees, and 4 commissions. SGA has changed little since 1972, except its relative position within the official framework of the university.

"<a href="The%20Princeton%20Review">The Princeton Review</a>" ranked "<a href="The%20Battalion">The Battalion</a>", founded in 1893, as the 5th best college newspaper in America in 2010. The "Aggieland", formerly known as "The Olio" and "The Longhorn", is one of America's largest college yearbooks in number of pages and copies sold. The university houses the public broadcasting stations: "<a href="KAMU-TV">KAMU-TV</a>", a <a href="PBS">PBS</a> member station since 1970, "<a href="KAMU-FM">KAMU-FM</a>" an <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">NPR</a> affiliate since 1977, and the student-run "<a href="KANM%20%28college%20radio%29">KANM</a>", "the college station of <a href="College%20Station%2C%20Texas">College Station</a>". W5AC broadcast the first live, play-by-play broadcast of a college football game, at Kyle Field, in November 1921. The game, played in Dallas between the Aggies and the <a href="Texas%20Longhorns">University of Texas</a>, ended in a scoreless tie.

The Texas A&M culture is a product of the university's founding as a rural military and agricultural school. Although the school and surrounding community have grown, and military training is no longer required, the <a href="History%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">school's history</a> has instilled in students "the idealized elements of a small-town life: community, tradition, loyalty, optimism, and unabashed sentimentality." "<a href="Texas%20Monthly">Texas Monthly</a>" posits that Texas A&M students' respect for school traditions and values is the university's greatest strength. Some of the school traditions date to the 1890s, while others have been introduced more recently. These traditions enable enrolled students and alumni to cultivate the Aggie Spirit, a sense of loyalty and respect for the school. They dictate many aspects of student life, including how to greet others (using the official school greeting "Howdy!"), how to act at an A&M sporting event, and often, what words a student may use in conversation.

A visible designation tradition among senior undergraduates and former students is the wearing of the <a href="Aggie%20Ring">Aggie Ring</a>, whose design has been relatively unchanged since its introduction in 1894. Students may order a ring after completing 90 <a href="credit%20hours">credit hours</a> of coursework, including at least 45 hours at A&M, or after graduation. Graduate students may receive a ring after 75% of their graduate coursework is completed or after the acceptance of their dissertation or thesis. Although unsanctioned by the university, many students "dunk" their newly acquired Aggie Rings into a pitcher of beer and quickly chug the entire pitcher to "earn" the ring. Some students dunk their rings in alternative substances, including ice cream or nonalcoholic beverages.
In keeping with the idea that all enrolled students and "former students" comprise a family (the term alumni is not generally used, as "former students" include those who could not complete their education, such as those who entered military service), Aggies have created two traditions to honor members of the Aggie family who have died. <a href="Muster%20%28Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%29">Aggie Muster</a> is held annually on the anniversary of the <a href="Battle%20of%20San%20Jacinto">Battle of San Jacinto</a>, April 21, to honor the death during the previous year of any enrolled student or alumni. Over 300 Musters are held around the world, with the largest taking place at <a href="Reed%20Arena">Reed Arena</a> on the <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%20campus">Texas A&M University campus</a>. All Muster ceremonies feature the Roll Call for the Absent. As the names of the deceased Aggies are called, a family member or friend answers "Here" and lights a candle, to symbolize that although their loved one is not present in body, his or her spirit will shine forever. The event received worldwide attention during World War II, when 25 Aggies "mustered" during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Corregidor">battle</a> for the island of <a href="Corregidor">Corregidor</a>.

Students who die while enrolled at Texas A&M are also honored at Silver Taps, a ceremony held, when necessary, on the first Tuesday of the month. This tradition began as a memorial for former Texas A&M president <a href="Lawrence%20Sullivan%20Ross">Lawrence Sullivan Ross</a>. On the day of the ceremony, flags fly half-staff and notices are posted throughout campus. At 10:15 pm the lights around campus are extinguished and hymns chime from Albritton Tower while students and faculty collect in the Academic Plaza. Following a <a href="21-gun%20salute">21-gun salute</a> by the Ross Volunteer Firing Squad, six <a href="Bugle%20%28instrument%29">buglers</a> play an A&M version of the song "<a href="Taps">Taps</a>", Silver Taps, three times from the dome of the school's Academic Building: once to the north, the south and to the west. The song is not played to the east symbolizing that the sun will never rise on that Aggie again.

Aggie students are called the <a href="12th%20Man%20%28football%29">12th Man</a>, meaning in the context of football that they support the 11 players on the field and would be willing, if it were possible, to enter the game if necessary. To further symbolize their "readiness, desire, and enthusiasm," it is traditional for students in attendance to stand throughout the game. The tradition began on January 2, 1922, at the <a href="Dixie%20Classic%20%28bowl%20game%29">Dixie Classic</a> where A&M played <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a>. A&M had so many injuries in the first half of the game that <a href="head%20coach">Coach</a> <a href="Dana%20X.%20Bible">Dana X. Bible</a> feared he would not have enough men to finish the game. He called into the stands for <a href="E.%20King%20Gill%23History">E. King Gill</a>, a reserve who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Although he did not actually play, his readiness symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. A&M won 22–14, but E. King Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. In recent decades, the 12th Man is represented on the field by a <a href="Walk-on%20%28sport%20term%29">walk-on</a> player who wears the No. 12 jersey and participates in kick-offs. Although originally from football students supporting any of the sports.

The 12th Man uses a variety of school yells, rather than cheers, to support Aggie teams. Each year the student body elects five students to serve as the Yell Leaders. At midnight before each home <a href="American%20football">football</a> game at Kyle Field or at a predesignated location at away games, the fans gather together to practice the yells for the next day's game. Led by the Yell Leaders, and the Fightin' Texas Aggie Band, the Twelfth Man files into the stadium to participate in <a href="Midnight%20Yell%20Practice">Midnight Yell Practice</a> to practice yells, sing the , and joke about their opponents. At the conclusion of the yell practice, the stadium lights are extinguished and fans kiss their dates. This is also done as practice, because Aggies are expected to "mug down", or kiss their dates, every time the football team scores on the field. "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" named Midnight Yell as one of the "100 Things You Gotta Do Before You Graduate."

On November 12, 2015, Texas A&M sued the Indianapolis Colts for infringing on its trademark of the 12th Man.

Almost every year since 1909, A&M students have built a large bonfire to celebrate their "burning desire to beat the hell outta t.u." (derogatory term for the University of Texas). <a href="Aggie%20Bonfire">Aggie Bonfire</a> was traditionally lit around <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> in conjunction with the festivities surrounding the annual <a href="college%20football">college football</a> game between the schools. Although it began as a trash pile, Aggie Bonfire evolved into a massive six-tiered structure, the world record being held at . The collapse of the 1999 structure, causing the deaths of 12 students and an alumnus, prompted the university to suspend the official sanction of the bonfire, but the tradition continues off-campus.

The Aggies are a member of the <a href="Southeastern%20Conference">Southeastern Conference</a> in all sports . Previously a charter member of the <a href="Southwest%20Conference">Southwest Conference</a> until its dissolution in 1996, A&M competed in the <a href="Big%2012%20Conference">Big 12 Conference</a> until June 30, 2012. The school's 20 sports teams are known as the <a href="Texas%20Aggie">Aggies</a>, and the school's colors are maroon and white. , Aggies have earned 138 Southwest and Big 12 conference regular-season and tournament titles and 11 team national championships. The <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20Aggies%20women%27s%20soccer">women's soccer</a> team, formed in 1993, earned 15 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1995 to 2009, advancing at least as far as the round of 16 in seven of the last eight appearances. The women's volleyball team earned 12 consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances from 1993 to 2004, advancing past the first round each time. In 2004 "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated%20on%20Campus">Sports Illustrated on Campus</a>" ranked <a href="Olsen%20Field">Olsen Field</a> "the best college baseball venue". "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" ranked the university 46th, in a 2002 analysis of "America's Best Sports College[s]" and College Station the 9th best college sports town.

A&M's <a href="college%20rivalry">archrival</a> was the <a href="Texas%20Longhorns">University of Texas</a> until joining the SEC. In 2004, sporting events between the Aggies and Longhorns became known as the <a href="Lone%20Star%20Showdown">Lone Star Showdown</a>. The most-watched event in the rivalry was the annual <a href="American%20football">football</a> game held the day of <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving</a>. Other rivalries have included <a href="Texas%20Tech%20Red%20Raiders">Texas Tech</a>, <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Brazos">Baylor University</a>, and the recently renewed rivalries with the <a href="University%20of%20Arkansas">University of Arkansas</a> and <a href="Louisiana%20State%20University">Louisiana State University</a>.

Thorium

Thorium is a weakly <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> metallic <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol Th and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 90. Thorium is silvery and <a href="tarnish">tarnish</a>es black when it is exposed to air, forming <a href="thorium%20dioxide">thorium dioxide</a>; it is moderately hard, <a href="malleable">malleable</a>, and has a high <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a>. Thorium is an electropositive <a href="actinide">actinide</a> whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.

All known thorium <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s are unstable. The most stable isotope, Th, has a half-life of 14.05 billion years, or about the <a href="Hubble%20time">age of the universe</a>; it decays very slowly via <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a>, starting a <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a> named the <a href="thorium%20series">thorium series</a> that ends at stable <a href="Lead">Pb</a>. In the universe, thorium and <a href="uranium">uranium</a> are the only two radioactive elements that still occur naturally in large quantities as <a href="primordial%20nuclide">primordial elements</a>. It is estimated to be over three times as <a href="natural%20abundance">abundant</a> as uranium in the Earth's crust, and is chiefly refined from <a href="monazite">monazite</a> sands as a by-product of extracting <a href="rare-earth%20metal">rare-earth metal</a>s.

Thorium was discovered in 1829 by the Norwegian amateur mineralogist <a href="Morten%20Thrane%20Esmark">Morten Thrane Esmark</a> and identified by the Swedish chemist <a href="J%C3%B6ns%20Jacob%20Berzelius">Jöns Jacob Berzelius</a>, who named it after <a href="Thor">Thor</a>, the <a href="list%20of%20Germanic%20deities">Norse god</a> of thunder. Its first applications were developed in the late 19th century. Thorium's radioactivity was widely acknowledged during the first decades of the 20th century. In the second half of the century, thorium was replaced in many uses due to concerns about its radioactivity.

Thorium is still being used as an alloying element in <a href="TIG%20welding">TIG welding</a> electrodes but is slowly being replaced in the field with different compositions. It was also a material in high-end optics and scientific instrumentation, and as the light source in <a href="gas%20mantle">gas mantle</a>s, but these uses have become marginal. It has been suggested as a replacement for uranium as nuclear fuel in <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s, and several <a href="thorium%20fuel%20cycle%23Reactors">thorium reactors</a> have been built.

Thorium is a moderately <a href="hardness%20%28materials%20science%29">soft</a>, <a href="paramagnetism">paramagnetic</a>, bright silvery radioactive actinide metal. In the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>, it lies to the right of <a href="actinium">actinium</a>, to the left of <a href="protactinium">protactinium</a>, and below <a href="cerium">cerium</a>. Pure thorium is very <a href="Ductility">ductile</a> and, as normal for metals, can be <a href="cold-rolling%23Cold%20rolling">cold-rolled</a>, <a href="Swaging">swaged</a>, and <a href="Drawing%20%28manufacturing%29">drawn</a>. At room temperature, thorium metal has a <a href="Cubic%20crystal%20system">face-centred cubic</a> crystal structure; it has two other forms, one at high temperature (over 1360 °C; body-centred cubic) and one at high pressure (around 100 GPa; <a href="tetragonal%20crystal%20system">body-centred tetragonal</a>).

Thorium metal has a <a href="bulk%20modulus">bulk modulus</a> (a measure of resistance to compression of a material) of 54 <a href="gigapascal">GPa</a>, about the same as <a href="tin">tin</a>'s (58.2 GPa). <a href="Aluminium">Aluminium</a>'s is 75.2 GPa; copper's 137.8 GPa; and mild steel's is 160–169 GPa. Thorium is about as hard as soft <a href="steel">steel</a>, so when heated it can be rolled into sheets and pulled into wire.

Thorium is nearly half as dense as <a href="uranium">uranium</a> and plutonium and is harder than either of them. It becomes <a href="superconductor">superconductive</a> below 1.4 <a href="kelvin">K</a>. Thorium's <a href="melting%20point">melting point</a> of 1750 °C is above both those of actinium (1227 °C) and protactinium (1568 °C). At the start of <a href="period%207%20element">period 7</a>, from <a href="francium">francium</a> to thorium, the melting points of the elements increase (as in other periods), because the number of delocalised electrons each atom contributes increases from one in francium to four in thorium, leading to greater attraction between these electrons and the metal ions as their charge increases from one to four. After thorium, there is a new downward trend in melting points from thorium to <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>, where the number of f electrons increases from about 0.4 to about 6: this trend is due to the increasing hybridisation of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds resulting in more complex crystal structures and weakened metallic bonding. (The f-electron count for thorium is a non-integer due to a 5f–6d overlap.) Among the actinides up to <a href="californium">californium</a>, which can be studied in at least milligram quantities, thorium has the highest melting and boiling points and second-lowest density; only actinium is lighter. Thorium's boiling point of 4788 °C is the fifth-highest among all the elements with known boiling points.

The properties of thorium vary widely depending on the degree of impurities in the sample. The major impurity is usually <a href="thorium%20dioxide">thorium dioxide</a> (ThO); even the purest thorium specimens usually contain about a tenth of a percent of the dioxide. Experimental measurements of its density give values between 11.5 and 11.66 g/cm: these are slightly lower than the theoretically expected value of 11.7 g/cm calculated from thorium's <a href="lattice%20parameter">lattice parameter</a>s, perhaps due to microscopic voids forming in the metal when it is cast. These values lie between those of its neighbours actinium (10.1 g/cm) and protactinium (15.4 g/cm), part of a trend across the early actinides.

Thorium can form <a href="alloy">alloy</a>s with many other metals. Addition of small proportions of thorium improves the mechanical strength of <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>, and thorium-aluminium alloys have been considered as a way to store thorium in proposed future thorium nuclear reactors. Thorium forms <a href="eutectic%20mixture">eutectic mixture</a>s with <a href="chromium">chromium</a> and uranium, and it is completely <a href="miscibility">miscible</a> in both solid and liquid <a href="state%20of%20matter">states</a> with its lighter <a href="congener%20%28chemistry%29">congener</a> cerium.

All but two elements up to <a href="bismuth">bismuth</a> (element 83) have an isotope that is practically stable for all purposes ("classically stable"), with the exceptions being <a href="technetium">technetium</a> and <a href="promethium">promethium</a> (elements 43 and 61). All elements from <a href="polonium">polonium</a> (element 84) onward are measurably <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a>. Th is one of the three nuclides beyond bismuth (the other two being <a href="uranium-235">U</a> and <a href="uranium-238">U</a>) that have half-lives measured in billions of years; its half-life is 14.05 billion years, about three times the <a href="age%20of%20the%20earth">age of the earth</a>, and slightly longer than the <a href="age%20of%20the%20universe">age of the universe</a>. Four-fifths of the thorium present at Earth's formation has survived to the present. Th is the only isotope of thorium occurring in quantity in nature. Its stability is attributed to its closed <a href="nuclear%20shell">nuclear shell</a> with 142 neutrons. Thorium has a characteristic terrestrial isotopic composition, with <a href="standard%20atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a> 232.0377(4). It is one of only three radioactive elements (along with protactinium and uranium) that occur in large enough quantities on Earth for a standard atomic weight to be determined.

Thorium nuclei are susceptible to <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha decay</a> because the strong nuclear force cannot overcome the electromagnetic repulsion between their protons. The alpha decay of Th initiates the 4"n" <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a> which includes isotopes with a <a href="mass%20number">mass number</a> divisible by 4 (hence the name; it is also called the thorium series after its progenitor). This chain of consecutive alpha and <a href="beta%20decay">beta decay</a>s begins with the decay of Th to Ra and terminates at Pb. Any sample of thorium or its compounds contains traces of these daughters, which are isotopes of <a href="thallium">thallium</a>, <a href="lead">lead</a>, bismuth, polonium, <a href="radon">radon</a>, <a href="radium">radium</a>, and actinium. Natural thorium samples can be chemically purified to extract useful daughter nuclides, such as Pb, which is used in <a href="nuclear%20medicine">nuclear medicine</a> for <a href="cancer%20therapy">cancer therapy</a>. Th (alpha emitter with a 18.68 days half-life) can also be used in cancer treatments such as targeted alpha therapies. Th also very occasionally undergoes <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> rather than alpha decay, and has left evidence of doing so in its minerals (as trapped <a href="xenon">xenon</a> gas formed as a fission product), but the <a href="partial%20half-life">partial half-life</a> of this process is very large at over 10 years and alpha decay predominates.
Thirty <a href="radioisotope">radioisotope</a>s have been characterised, which range in mass number from 209 to 238. After Th, the most stable of them (with respective half-lives) are Th (75,380 years), Th (7,340 years), Th (1.92 years), Th (24.10 days), and Th (18.68 days). All of these isotopes occur in nature as <a href="trace%20radioisotope">trace radioisotope</a>s due to their presence in the decay chains of Th, U, U, and <a href="neptunium">Np</a>: the last of these is long <a href="extinct%20radionuclide">extinct</a> in nature due to its short half-life (2.14 million years), but is continually produced in minute traces from <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> in uranium ores. All of the remaining thorium isotopes have half-lives that are less than thirty days and the majority of these have half-lives that are less than ten minutes.

In deep <a href="seawater">seawater</a>s the isotope Th makes up to 0.04% of natural thorium. This is because its parent U is soluble in water, but Th is insoluble and precipitates into the sediment. Uranium ores with low thorium concentrations can be purified to produce gram-sized thorium samples of which over a quarter is the Th isotope, since Th is one of the daughters of U. The <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Pure%20and%20Applied%20Chemistry">International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry</a> (IUPAC) reclassified thorium as a binuclidic element in 2013; it had formerly been considered a <a href="mononuclidic%20element">mononuclidic element</a>.

Thorium has three known <a href="nuclear%20isomer">nuclear isomer</a>s (or metastable states), Th, Th, and Th. Th has the lowest known excitation energy of any isomer, measured to be . This is so low that when it undergoes <a href="isomeric%20transition">isomeric transition</a>, the emitted gamma radiation is in the <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> range.

Different isotopes of thorium are chemically identical, but have slightly differing physical properties: for example, the densities of pure Th, Th, Th, and Th are respectively expected to be 11.5, 11.6, 11.6, and 11.7 g/cm. The isotope Th is expected to be <a href="fissionable">fissionable</a> with a bare <a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a> of 2839 kg, although with steel reflectors this value could drop to 994 kg. Th is not fissionable, but it is <a href="fertile%20material">fertile</a> as it can be converted to fissile <a href="uranium-233">U</a> by neutron capture and subsequent beta decay.

Two radiometric dating methods involve thorium isotopes: <a href="uranium%E2%80%93thorium%20dating">uranium–thorium dating</a>, based on the decay of <a href="uranium-234">U</a> to Th, and ionium–thorium dating, which measures the ratio of Th to Th. These rely on the fact that Th is a primordial radioisotope, but Th only occurs as an intermediate decay product in the decay chain of U. Uranium–thorium dating is a relatively short-range process because of the short half-lives of U and Th relative to the age of the Earth: it is also accompanied by a sister process involving the alpha decay of U into Th, which very quickly becomes the longer-lived Pa, and this process is often used to check the results of uranium–thorium dating. Uranium–thorium dating is commonly used to determine the age of <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> materials such as <a href="speleothem">speleothem</a> or <a href="coral">coral</a>, because uranium is more soluble in water than thorium and protactinium, which are selectively precipitated into ocean-floor <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s, where their ratios are measured. The scheme has a range of several hundred thousand years. Ionium–thorium dating is a related process, which exploits the insolubility of thorium (both Th and Th) and thus its presence in ocean sediments to date these sediments by measuring the ratio of Th to Th. Both of these dating methods assume that the proportion of Th to Th is a constant during the period when the sediment layer was formed, that the sediment did not already contain thorium before contributions from the decay of uranium, and that the thorium cannot migrate within the sediment layer.

A thorium atom has 90 electrons, of which four are <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s. Three <a href="atomic%20orbital">atomic orbital</a>s are theoretically available for the valence electrons to occupy: 5f, 6d, and 7s. Despite thorium's position in the <a href="f-block">f-block</a> of the periodic table, it has an anomalous [Rn]6d7s electron configuration in the ground state, as the 5f and 6d subshells in the early actinides are very close in energy, even more so than the 4f and 5d subshells of the lanthanides: thorium's 6d subshells are lower in energy than its 5f subshells, because its 5f subshells are not well-shielded by the filled 6s and 6p subshells and are destabilised. This is due to <a href="relativistic%20effects">relativistic effects</a>, which become stronger near the bottom of the periodic table, specifically the relativistic <a href="spin%E2%80%93orbit%20interaction">spin–orbit interaction</a>. The closeness in energy levels of the 5f, 6d, and 7s energy levels of thorium results in thorium almost always losing all four valence electrons and occurring in its highest possible oxidation state of +4. This is different from its lanthanide congener cerium, in which +4 is also the highest possible state, but +3 plays an important role and is more stable. Thorium is much more similar to the <a href="transition%20metal">transition metal</a>s zirconium and hafnium than to cerium in its ionisation energies and redox potentials, and hence also in its chemistry: this transition-metal-like behaviour is the norm in the first half of the actinide series.

Despite the anomalous electron configuration for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This was first realised in 1995, when it was pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the [Rn]6d7s configuration with the 5f orbitals above the <a href="Fermi%20level">Fermi level</a> should be <a href="hexagonal%20close%20packed">hexagonal close packed</a> like the <a href="group%204%20element">group 4 element</a>s titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the electron configuration [Rn]5f.

Tetravalent thorium compounds are usually colourless or yellow, like those of <a href="silver">silver</a> or lead, as the Th ion has no 5f or 6d electrons. Thorium chemistry is therefore largely that of an electropositive metal forming a single <a href="diamagnetic">diamagnetic</a> ion with a stable noble-gas configuration, indicating a similarity between thorium and the <a href="main%20group%20element">main group element</a>s of the s-block. Thorium and uranium are the most investigated of the radioactive elements because their radioactivity is low enough not to require special handling in the laboratory.

Thorium is a highly <a href="reactivity%20%28chemistry%29">reactive</a> and electropositive metal. With a <a href="standard%20reduction%20potential">standard reduction potential</a> of −1.90 V for the Th/Th couple, it is somewhat more electropositive than zirconium or aluminium. Finely divided thorium metal can exhibit <a href="pyrophoricity">pyrophoricity</a>, spontaneously igniting in air. When heated in air, thorium <a href="swarf">turnings</a> ignite and burn with a brilliant white light to produce the dioxide. In bulk, the reaction of pure thorium with air is slow, although corrosion may occur after several months; most thorium samples are contaminated with varying degrees of the dioxide, which greatly accelerates corrosion. Such samples slowly tarnish, becoming grey and finally black at the surface.

At <a href="standard%20temperature%20and%20pressure">standard temperature and pressure</a>, thorium is slowly attacked by water, but does not readily dissolve in most common acids, with the exception of <a href="hydrochloric%20acid">hydrochloric acid</a>, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> containing a small quantity of catalytic <a href="fluoride">fluoride</a> or <a href="fluorosilicate">fluorosilicate</a> ions; if these are not present, <a href="passivation%20%28chemistry%29">passivation</a> by the nitrate can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.

Most binary compounds of thorium with nonmetals may be prepared by heating the elements together. In air, thorium burns to form ThO, which has the <a href="fluorite">fluorite</a> structure. Thorium dioxide is a <a href="refractory%20material">refractory material</a>, with the highest melting point (3390 °C) of any known oxide. It is somewhat <a href="hygroscopic">hygroscopic</a> and reacts readily with water and many gases; it dissolves easily in concentrated nitric acid in the presence of fluoride. When heated, it emits intense blue light through <a href="incandescence">incandescence</a>; the light becomes white when ThO is mixed with its lighter homologue <a href="cerium%20dioxide">cerium dioxide</a> (CeO, ceria): this is the basis for its previously common application in <a href="gas%20mantle">gas mantle</a>s. Several binary thorium <a href="chalcogen">chalcogen</a>ides and oxychalcogenides are also known with <a href="sulfur">sulfur</a>, <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, and <a href="tellurium">tellurium</a>.

All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as are some low-valent bromides and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a <a href="monoclinic%20crystal%20system">monoclinic</a> crystal structure like those of <a href="zirconium%20tetrafluoride">zirconium tetrafluoride</a> and <a href="hafnium%20tetrafluoride">hafnium tetrafluoride</a>, where the Th ions are coordinated with F ions in somewhat distorted <a href="square%20antiprism">square antiprism</a>s. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower iodides ThI (black) and ThI (gold-coloured) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th and could be more clearly formulated as <a href="electride">electride</a> compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, <a href="barium">barium</a>, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides. For example, when treated with <a href="potassium%20fluoride">potassium fluoride</a> and <a href="hydrofluoric%20acid">hydrofluoric acid</a>, Th forms the complex anion , which precipitates as an insoluble salt, KThF.

Thorium borides, carbides, silicides, and nitrides are refractory materials, like those of uranium and plutonium, and have thus received attention as possible <a href="nuclear%20fuel">nuclear fuel</a>s. All four heavier <a href="pnictogen">pnictogen</a>s (<a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a>, <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, and bismuth) also form binary thorium compounds. Thorium germanides are also known. Thorium reacts with hydrogen to form the thorium hydrides ThH and ThH, the latter of which is superconducting below 7.5–8 K; at standard temperature and pressure, it conducts electricity like a metal. The hydrides are thermally unstable and readily decompose upon exposure to air or moisture.

In an acidic aqueous solution, thorium occurs as the tetrapositive <a href="aqua%20ion">aqua ion</a> [Th(HO)], which has <a href="tricapped%20trigonal%20prismatic%20molecular%20geometry">tricapped trigonal prismatic molecular geometry</a>: at pH < 3, the solutions of thorium salts are dominated by this cation. The Th ion is the largest of the tetrapositive actinide ions, and depending on the coordination number can have a radius between 0.95 and 1.14 Å. It is quite acidic due to its high charge, slightly stronger than <a href="sulfurous%20acid">sulfurous acid</a>: thus it tends to undergo hydrolysis and polymerisation (though to a lesser extent than <a href="iron">Fe</a>), predominantly to [Th(OH)] in solutions with pH 3 or below, but in more alkaline solution polymerisation continues until the gelatinous hydroxide Th(OH) forms and precipitates out (though equilibrium may take weeks to be reached, because the polymerisation usually slows down before the precipitation). As a <a href="HSAB%20theory">hard Lewis acid</a>, Th favours hard ligands with oxygen atoms as donors: complexes with sulfur atoms as donors are less stable and are more prone to hydrolysis.

High coordination numbers are the rule for thorium due to its large size. Thorium nitrate pentahydrate was the first known example of coordination number 11, the oxalate tetrahydrate has coordination number 10, and the borohydride (first prepared in the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>) has coordination number 14. These thorium salts are known for their high solubility in water and polar organic solvents.

Many other inorganic thorium compounds with polyatomic anions are known, such as the <a href="perchlorate">perchlorate</a>s, <a href="sulfate">sulfate</a>s, <a href="sulfite">sulfite</a>s, nitrates, carbonates, <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a>s, <a href="vanadate">vanadate</a>s, <a href="molybdate">molybdate</a>s, and <a href="chromate">chromate</a>s, and their hydrated forms. They are important in thorium purification and the disposal of nuclear waste, but most of them have not yet been fully characterised, especially regarding their structural properties. For example, thorium nitrate is produced by reacting thorium hydroxide with nitric acid: it is soluble in water and alcohols and is an important intermediate in the purification of thorium and its compounds. Thorium complexes with organic ligands, such as <a href="oxalate">oxalate</a>, <a href="citrate">citrate</a>, and <a href="EDTA">EDTA</a>, are much more stable. In natural thorium-containing waters, organic thorium complexes usually occur in concentrations orders of magnitude higher than the inorganic complexes, even when the concentrations of inorganic ligands are much greater than those of organic ligands.

Most of the work on organothorium compounds has focused on the <a href="cyclopentadienyl%20complex">cyclopentadienyl complex</a>es and <a href="cyclooctatetraenide%20anion">cyclooctatetraenyls</a>. Like many of the early and middle actinides (up to <a href="americium">americium</a>, and also expected for <a href="curium">curium</a>), thorium forms a cyclooctatetraenide complex: the yellow Th(CH), <a href="thorocene">thorocene</a>. It is <a href="isotypic">isotypic</a> with the better-known analogous uranium compound <a href="uranocene">uranocene</a>. It can be prepared by reacting <a href="potassium%20cyclooctatetraenide">KCH</a> with thorium tetrachloride in <a href="tetrahydrofuran">tetrahydrofuran</a> (THF) at the temperature of <a href="dry%20ice">dry ice</a>, or by reacting thorium tetrafluoride with MgCH. It is unstable in air and decomposes in water or at 190 °C. <a href="Half%20sandwich%20compound">Half sandwich compound</a>s are also known, such as ("η"-CH)ThCl(THF), which has a piano-stool structure and is made by reacting thorocene with thorium tetrachloride in tetrahydrofuran.

The simplest of the cyclopentadienyls are Th(CH) and Th(CH): many derivatives are known. The former (which has two forms, one purple and one green) is a rare example of thorium in the formal +3 oxidation state; a formal +2 oxidation state occurs in a derivative. The chloride derivative [Th(CH)Cl] is prepared by heating thorium tetrachloride with <a href="limiting%20reagent">limiting</a> K(CH) used (other univalent metal cyclopentadienyls can also be used). The <a href="alkyl">alkyl</a> and <a href="aryl">aryl</a> derivatives are prepared from the chloride derivative and have been used to study the nature of the Th–C <a href="sigma%20bond">sigma bond</a>.

Other organothorium compounds are not well-studied. Tetrabenzylthorium, Th(CHCH), and tetraallylthorium, Th(CH), are known, but their structures have not been determined. They decompose slowly at room temperature. Thorium forms the monocapped trigonal prismatic anion [Th(CH)], heptamethylthorate, which forms the salt [Li(tmeda)][ThMe] (tmeda= MeNCHCHNMe). Although one methyl group is only attached to the thorium atom (Th–C distance 257.1 pm) and the other six connect the lithium and thorium atoms (Th–C distances 265.5–276.5 pm), they behave equivalently in solution. Tetramethylthorium, Th(CH), is not known, but its <a href="adduct">adduct</a>s are stabilised by <a href="phosphine">phosphine</a> ligands.

Th is a primordial nuclide, having existed in its current form for over ten billion years; it was forged in the cores of dying stars through the <a href="r-process">r-process</a> and scattered across the galaxy by <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e and <a href="neutron%20star%20merger">neutron star merger</a>s. The letter "r" stands for "rapid neutron capture", and occurs in core-collapse supernovae, where heavy seed nuclei such as <a href="iron-56">Fe</a> rapidly capture neutrons, running up against the <a href="neutron%20drip%20line">neutron drip line</a>, as neutrons are captured much faster than the resulting nuclides can beta decay back toward stability. Neutron capture is the only way for stars to synthesise elements beyond iron because of the increased <a href="Coulomb%20barrier">Coulomb barrier</a>s that make interactions between charged particles difficult at high atomic numbers and the fact that fusion beyond Fe is endothermic. Because of the abrupt loss of stability past Bi, the r-process is the only process of stellar nucleosynthesis that can create thorium and uranium; all other processes are too slow and the intermediate nuclei alpha decay before they capture enough neutrons to reach these elements.
In the universe, thorium is among the rarest of the primordial elements, because it is one of the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process (the other being uranium), and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are <a href="thulium">thulium</a>, <a href="lutetium">lutetium</a>, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals, as well as uranium. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond "A"= 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei that cross the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of U to Th and the natural depletion of U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.

In the Earth's crust, thorium is much more abundant: with an abundance of 8.1 <a href="parts%20per%20million">parts per million</a> (ppm), it is one of the most abundant of the heavy elements, almost as abundant as lead (13 ppm) and more abundant than tin (2.1 ppm). This is because thorium is likely to form oxide minerals that do not sink into the core; it is classified as a <a href="Goldschmidt%20classification">lithophile</a>. Common thorium compounds are also poorly soluble in water. Thus, even though the Earth contains the same abundances of the elements as the Solar System as a whole, there is more accessible thorium than heavy platinum group metals in the crust.

Natural thorium is usually almost pure Th, which is the longest-lived and most stable isotope of thorium, having a half-life comparable to the age of the universe. Its radioactive decay is the largest single contributor to the <a href="Earth%23Heat">Earth's internal heat</a>; the other major contributors are the shorter-lived primordial radionuclides, which are U, K, and U in descending order of their contribution. (At the time of the Earth's formation, K and U contributed much more by virtue of their short half-lives, but they have decayed more quickly, leaving the contribution from Th and U predominant.) Its decay accounts for a gradual decrease of thorium content of the Earth: the planet currently has around 85% of the amount present at the formation of the Earth. The other natural thorium isotopes are much shorter-lived; of them, only Th is usually detectable, occurring in <a href="secular%20equilibrium">secular equilibrium</a> with its parent U, and making up at most 0.04% of natural thorium.

Thorium only occurs as a minor constituent of most minerals, and was for this reason previously thought to be rare. Soil normally contains about 6 ppm of thorium.

In nature, thorium occurs in the +4 oxidation state, together with uranium(IV), <a href="zirconium">zirconium</a>(IV), hafnium(IV), and cerium(IV), and also with <a href="scandium">scandium</a>, <a href="yttrium">yttrium</a>, and the trivalent lanthanides which have similar <a href="ionic%20radius">ionic radii</a>. Because of thorium's radioactivity, minerals containing it are often <a href="metamictization">metamict</a> (amorphous), their crystal structure having been damaged by the alpha radiation produced by thorium. An extreme example is <a href="ekanite">ekanite</a>, (Ca,Fe,Pb)(Th,U)SiO, which almost never occurs in nonmetamict form due to the thorium it contains.

<a href="Monazite">Monazite</a> (chiefly phosphates of various rare-earth elements) is the most important commercial source of thorium because it occurs in large deposits worldwide, principally in India, South Africa, Brazil, Australia, and <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a>. It contains around 2.5% thorium on average, although some deposits may contain up to 20%. Monazite is a chemically unreactive mineral that is found as yellow or brown sand; its low reactivity makes it difficult to extract thorium from it. <a href="Allanite">Allanite</a> (chiefly silicates-hydroxides of various metals) can have 0.1–2% thorium and <a href="zircon">zircon</a> (chiefly <a href="zirconium%20silicate">zirconium silicate</a>, ZrSiO) up to 0.4% thorium.

Thorium dioxide occurs as the rare mineral <a href="thorianite">thorianite</a>. Due to its being isotypic with <a href="uranium%20dioxide">uranium dioxide</a>, these two common actinide dioxides can form solid-state solutions and the name of the mineral changes according to the ThO content. <a href="Thorite">Thorite</a> (chiefly <a href="thorium%20silicate">thorium silicate</a>, ThSiO), also has a high thorium content and is the mineral in which thorium was first discovered. In thorium silicate minerals, the Th and ions are often replaced with M (where M= Sc, Y, or Ln) and phosphate () ions respectively. Because of the great insolubility of thorium dioxide, thorium does not usually spread quickly through the environment when released. The Th ion is soluble, especially in acidic soils, and in such conditions the thorium concentration can reach 40 ppm.

In 1815, the Swedish chemist <a href="J%C3%B6ns%20Jacob%20Berzelius">Jöns Jacob Berzelius</a> analysed an unusual sample of <a href="gadolinite">gadolinite</a> from a copper mine in <a href="Falun">Falun</a>, central Sweden. He noted impregnated traces of a white mineral, which he cautiously assumed to be an earth (<a href="oxide">oxide</a> in modern chemical nomenclature) of an unknown element. Berzelius had already discovered two elements, cerium and selenium, but he had made a public mistake once, announcing a new element, "gahnium", that turned out to be <a href="zinc%20oxide">zinc oxide</a>. Berzelius privately named the putative element "thorium" in 1817 and its supposed oxide "thorina" after <a href="Thor">Thor</a>, the <a href="Norse%20god">Norse god</a> of thunder. In 1824, after more deposits of the same mineral in <a href="Vest-Agder">Vest-Agder</a>, Norway, were discovered, he retracted his findings, as the mineral (later named <a href="xenotime">xenotime</a>) proved to be mostly <a href="yttrium%20phosphate">yttrium orthophosphate</a>.

In 1828, <a href="Morten%20Thrane%20Esmark">Morten Thrane Esmark</a> found a black mineral on <a href="L%C3%B8v%C3%B8ya%2C%20Telemark">Løvøya</a> island, <a href="Telemark">Telemark</a> county, Norway. He was a Norwegian <a href="priest">priest</a> and amateur <a href="mineralogist">mineralogist</a> who studied the minerals in Telemark, where he served as <a href="vicar">vicar</a>. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father, <a href="Jens%20Esmark">Jens Esmark</a>, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the <a href="Royal%20Frederick%20University">Royal Frederick University</a> in Christiania (today called <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>). The elder Esmark determined that it was not a known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius determined that it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing KThF with <a href="potassium">potassium</a> metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral thorite.

Berzelius made some initial characterisations of the new metal and its chemical compounds: he correctly determined that the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 <a href="atomic%20mass%20unit">amu</a>); it is actually 15 times as large. He determined that thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated for the first time in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.

In the periodic table published by <a href="Dmitri%20Mendeleev">Dmitri Mendeleev</a> in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside the main body of the table, at the end of each vertical period after the <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which also contained the modern <a href="carbon%20group">carbon group</a> (group 14) and titanium group (group 4), because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from the main body of the table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left with group 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as <a href="titanium">titanium</a> and zirconium.

While thorium was discovered in 1828 its first application dates only from 1885, when Austrian chemist <a href="Carl%20Auer%20von%20Welsbach">Carl Auer von Welsbach</a> invented the <a href="gas%20mantle">gas mantle</a>, a portable source of light which produces light from the incandescence of thorium oxide when heated by burning gaseous fuels. Many applications were subsequently found for thorium and its compounds, including ceramics, carbon arc lamps, heat-resistant crucibles, and as catalysts for industrial chemical reactions such as the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid.

Thorium was first observed to be radioactive in 1898, by the German chemist <a href="Gerhard%20Carl%20Schmidt">Gerhard Carl Schmidt</a> and later that year, independently, by the Polish-French physicist <a href="Marie%20Curie">Marie Curie</a>. It was the second element that was found to be radioactive, after the 1896 discovery of radioactivity in uranium by French physicist <a href="Henri%20Becquerel">Henri Becquerel</a>. Starting from 1899, the British physicist <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> and the American electrical engineer <a href="Robert%20Bowie%20Owens">Robert Bowie Owens</a> studied the radiation from thorium; initial observations showed that it varied significantly. It was determined that these variations came from a short-lived gaseous daughter of thorium, which they found to be a new element. This element is now named <a href="radon">radon</a>, the only one of the rare radioelements to be discovered in nature as a daughter of thorium rather than uranium.

After accounting for the contribution of radon, Rutherford, now working with the British physicist <a href="Frederick%20Soddy">Frederick Soddy</a>, showed how thorium decayed at a fixed rate over time into a series of other elements in work dating from 1900 to 1903. This observation led to the identification of the <a href="half-life">half-life</a> as one of the outcomes of the <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a> experiments that led to the disintegration theory of <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a>. The biological effect of radiation was discovered in 1903. The newly discovered phenomenon of radioactivity excited scientists and the general public alike. In the 1920s, thorium's radioactivity was promoted as a cure for <a href="rheumatism">rheumatism</a>, <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a>, and <a href="sexual%20impotence">sexual impotence</a>. In 1932, most of these uses were banned in the United States after a federal investigation into the health effects of radioactivity. 10,000 individuals in the United States had been injected thorium during X-ray diagnosis; they were later found to suffer health issues such as leukaemia and abnormal chromosomes. Public interest in radioactivity had declined by the end of the 1930s.

Up to the late 19th century, chemists unanimously agreed that thorium and uranium were analogous to hafnium and tungsten; the existence of the lanthanides in the sixth row was considered to be a one-off fluke. In 1892, British chemist Henry Bassett postulated a second extra-long periodic table row to accommodate known and undiscovered elements, considering thorium and uranium to be analogous to the lanthanides. In 1913, Danish physicist <a href="Niels%20Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> published a <a href="Bohr%20model">theoretical model</a> of the atom and its electron orbitals, which soon gathered wide acceptance. The model indicated that the seventh row of the periodic table should also have f-shells filling before the d-shells that were filled in the transition elements, like the sixth row with the lanthanides preceding the 5d transition metals. The existence of a second inner transition series, in the form of the actinides, was not accepted until similarities with the electron structures of the lanthanides had been established; Bohr suggested that the filling of the 5f orbitals may be delayed to after uranium.

It was only with the discovery of the first <a href="transuranic%20element">transuranic element</a>s, which from plutonium onward have dominant +3 and +4 oxidation states like the lanthanides, that it was realised that the actinides were indeed filling f-orbitals rather than d-orbitals, with the transition-metal-like chemistry of the early actinides being the exception and not the rule. In 1945, when American physicist <a href="Glenn%20T.%20Seaborg">Glenn T. Seaborg</a> and his team had discovered the transuranic elements americium and curium, he realised that thorium was the second member of the actinide series and was filling an f-block row, instead of being the heavier congener of <a href="hafnium">hafnium</a> filling a fourth d-block row.

In the 1990s, most applications that do not depend on thorium's radioactivity declined quickly due to safety and environmental concerns as suitable safer replacements were found. Despite its radioactivity, the element has remained in use for applications where no suitable alternatives could be found. A 1981 study by the <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> in the United States estimated that using a thorium gas mantle every weekend would be safe for a person, but this was not the case for the dose received by people manufacturing the mantles or for the soils around some factory sites. Some manufacturers have changed to other materials, such as yttrium. As recently as 2007, some companies continued to manufacture and sell thorium mantles without giving adequate information about their radioactivity, with some even falsely claiming them to be non-radioactive.

Thorium has been used as a power source. The earliest thorium-based reactor was built at the <a href="Indian%20Point%20Energy%20Center">Indian Point Energy Center</a> in the United States in 1962. India has one of the largest supplies of thorium in the world and not much uranium, and in the 1950s targeted achieving energy independence with their <a href="India%27s%20three-stage%20nuclear%20power%20programme">three-stage nuclear power programme</a>. In most countries, uranium was relatively abundant and the progress of thorium-based reactors was slow; in the 20th century, three reactors were built in India and twelve elsewhere. Large-scale research was begun in 1996 by the <a href="International%20Atomic%20Energy%20Agency">International Atomic Energy Agency</a> to study the use of thorium reactors; a year later, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Energy">United States Department of Energy</a> started their research. <a href="Alvin%20Radkowsky">Alvin Radkowsky</a> of <a href="Tel%20Aviv%20University">Tel Aviv University</a> in Israel was the head designer of <a href="Shippingport%20Atomic%20Power%20Station">Shippingport Atomic Power Station</a> in Pennsylvania, the first American civilian reactor to breed thorium. He founded a consortium to develop thorium reactors, which included other laboratories: <a href="Raytheon">Raytheon</a> Nuclear Inc. and <a href="Brookhaven%20National%20Laboratory">Brookhaven National Laboratory</a> in the United States, and the <a href="Kurchatov%20Institute">Kurchatov Institute</a> in Russia. In the 21st century, thorium's potential for reducing nuclear proliferation and its <a href="nuclear%20waste">waste</a> characteristics led to renewed interest in the thorium fuel cycle.

During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> the United States explored the possibility of using Th as a source of U to be used in a <a href="nuclear%20bomb">nuclear bomb</a>; they fired <a href="Operation%20Teapot%23MET">a test bomb</a> in 1955. They concluded that a U-fired bomb would be a very potent weapon, but it bore few sustainable "technical advantages" over the contemporary uranium–plutonium bombs, especially since U is difficult to produce isotopically pure.

The low demand makes working mines for extraction of thorium alone not profitable, and it is almost always extracted with the rare earths, which themselves may be by-products of production of other minerals. The current reliance on monazite for production is due to thorium being largely produced as a by-product; other sources such as thorite contain more thorium and could easily be used for production if demand rose. Present knowledge of the distribution of thorium resources is poor, as low demand has led to exploration efforts being relatively minor. In 2014, world production of the monazite concentrate, from which thorium would be extracted, was 2,700 tonnes.

The common production route of thorium constitutes concentration of thorium minerals; extraction of thorium from the concentrate; purification of thorium; and (optionally) conversion to compounds, such as thorium dioxide.

There are two categories of thorium minerals for thorium extraction: primary and secondary. Primary deposits occur in acidic granitic magmas and pegmatites. They are concentrated, but of small size. Secondary deposits occur at the mouths of rivers in granitic mountain regions. In these deposits, thorium is enriched along with other heavy minerals. Initial concentration varies with the type of deposit.

For the primary deposits, the source pegmatites, which are usually obtained by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo <a href="froth%20flotation">flotation</a>. Alkaline earth metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with <a href="hydrogen%20chloride">hydrogen chloride</a>; then follow <a href="thickening">thickening</a>, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, with a series of magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.

Industrial production in the 20th century relied on treatment with hot, concentrated sulfuric acid in cast iron vessels, followed by selective precipitation by dilution with water, as on the subsequent steps. This method relied on the specifics of the technique and the concentrate grain size; many alternatives have been proposed, but only one has proven effective economically: alkaline digestion with hot sodium hydroxide solution. This is more expensive than the original method but yields a higher purity of thorium; in particular, it removes phosphates from the concentrate.

Acid digestion is a two-stage process, involving the use of up to 93% <a href="sulfuric%20acid">sulfuric acid</a> at 210–230 °C. First, 60% sulfuric acid is added, thickening the reaction mixture as products are formed. Then, fuming sulfuric acid is added and the mixture is kept at the same temperature for another five hours to reduce the volume of solution remaining after dilution. The concentration of the sulfuric acid is selected based on reaction rate and viscosity, which both increase with concentration, albeit with viscosity retarding the reaction. Increasing the temperature also speeds up the reaction, but temperatures of 300 °C and above must be avoided, because they cause insoluble thorium pyrophosphate to form. Since dissolution is very exothermic, the monazite sand cannot be added to the acid too quickly. Conversely, at temperatures below 200 °C the reaction does not go fast enough for the process to be practical. To ensure that no precipitates form to block the reactive monazite surface, the mass of acid used must be twice that of the sand, instead of the 60% that would be expected from stoichiometry. The mixture is then cooled to 70 °C and diluted with ten times its volume of cold water, so that any remaining monazite sinks to the bottom while the rare earths and thorium remain in solution. Thorium may then be separated by precipitating it as the phosphate at pH 1.3, since the rare earths do not precipitate until pH 2.

Alkaline digestion is carried out in 30–45% <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a> solution at about 140 °C for about three hours. Too high a temperature leads to the formation of poorly soluble thorium oxide and an excess of uranium in the filtrate, and too low a concentration of alkali leads to a very slow reaction. These reaction conditions are rather mild and require monazite sand with a particle size under 45 μm. Following filtration, the filter cake includes thorium and the rare earths as their hydroxides, uranium as <a href="sodium%20diuranate">sodium diuranate</a>, and phosphate as <a href="trisodium%20phosphate">trisodium phosphate</a>. This crystallises trisodium phosphate decahydrate when cooled below 60 °C; uranium impurities in this product increase with the amount of <a href="silicon%20dioxide">silicon dioxide</a> in the reaction mixture, necessitating recrystallisation before commercial use. The hydroxides are dissolved at 80 °C in 37% hydrochloric acid. Filtration of the remaining precipitates followed by addition of 47% sodium hydroxide results in the precipitation of thorium and uranium at about pH 5.8. Complete drying of the precipitate must be avoided, as air may oxidise cerium from the +3 to the +4 oxidation state, and the cerium(IV) formed can liberate free <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> from the hydrochloric acid. The rare earths again precipitate out at higher pH. The precipitates are neutralised by the original sodium hydroxide solution, although most of the phosphate must first be removed to avoid precipitating rare-earth phosphates. <a href="Solvent%20extraction">Solvent extraction</a> may also be used to separate out the thorium and uranium, by dissolving the resultant filter cake in nitric acid. The presence of <a href="titanium%20hydroxide">titanium hydroxide</a> is deleterious as it binds thorium and prevents it from dissolving fully.

High thorium concentrations are needed in nuclear applications. In particular, concentrations of atoms with high neutron capture <a href="cross-section%20%28physics%29">cross-sections</a> must be very low (for example, <a href="gadolinium">gadolinium</a> concentrations must be lower than one part per million by weight). Previously, repeated dissolution and recrystallisation was used to achieve high purity. Today, liquid solvent extraction procedures involving selective <a href="complexation">complexation</a> of Th are used. For example, following alkaline digestion and the removal of phosphate, the resulting nitrato complexes of thorium, uranium, and the rare earths can be separated by extraction with <a href="tributyl%20phosphate">tributyl phosphate</a> in <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a>.

Non-radioactivity-related uses have been in decline since the 1950s due to environmental concerns largely stemming from the radioactivity of thorium and its decay products.

Most thorium applications use its dioxide (sometimes called "thoria" in the industry), rather than the metal. This compound has a melting point of 3300 °C (6000 °F), the highest of all known oxides; only a few substances have higher melting points. This helps the compound remain solid in a flame, and it considerably increases the brightness of the flame; this is the main reason thorium is used in gas mantles. All substances emit energy (glow) at high temperatures, but the light emitted by thorium is nearly all in the <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a>, hence the brightness of thorium mantles. Energy, some of it in the form of visible light, is emitted when thorium is exposed to a source of energy itself, such as a cathode ray, heat or <a href="ultraviolet%20light">ultraviolet light</a>. This effect is shared by cerium dioxide, which converts ultraviolet light into visible light more efficiently, but thorium dioxide gives a higher flame temperature, emitting less <a href="infrared%20light">infrared light</a>. Thorium in mantles, though still common, has been progressively replaced with yttrium since the late 1990s. According to the 2005 review by the United Kingdom's <a href="National%20Radiological%20Protection%20Board">National Radiological Protection Board</a>, "although [thoriated gas mantles] were widely available a few years ago, they are not any more."

During the production of <a href="incandescent">incandescent</a> filaments, <a href="Recrystallization%20%28chemistry%29">recrystallisation</a> of tungsten is signifiantly lowered by adding small amounts of thorium dioxide to the tungsten <a href="sintering">sintering</a> powder before drawing the filaments. A small addition of thorium to tungsten <a href="hot%20cathode">thermocathodes</a> considerably reduces the <a href="work%20function">work function</a> of electrons; as a result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Thorium forms a one-atom-thick layer on the surface of tungsten. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity. Since the 1920s, thoriated tungsten wires have been used in electronic tubes and in the cathodes and anticathodes of X-ray tubes and rectifiers. Thanks to the reactivity of thorium with atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen, thorium also marks impurities in the evacuated tubes. The introduction of transistors in the 1950s significantly diminished this use, but not entirely. Thorium dioxide is used in <a href="gas%20tungsten%20arc%20welding">gas tungsten arc welding</a> (GTAW) to increase the high-temperature strength of tungsten electrodes and improve arc stability. Thorium oxide is being replaced in this use with other oxides, such as those of zirconium, cerium, and <a href="lanthanum">lanthanum</a>.

Thorium dioxide is found in <a href="refraction%20%28metallurgy%29">heat-resistant</a> ceramics, such as high-temperature laboratory <a href="crucible">crucible</a>s, either as the primary ingredient or as an addition to <a href="zirconium%20dioxide">zirconium dioxide</a>. An alloy of 90% <a href="platinum">platinum</a> and 10% thorium is an effective catalyst for oxidising <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a> to nitrogen oxides, but this has been replaced by an alloy of 95% platinum and 5% <a href="rhodium">rhodium</a> because of its better mechanical properties and greater durability.

When added to <a href="glass">glass</a>, thorium dioxide helps increase its <a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a> and decrease <a href="dispersion%20%28optics%29">dispersion</a>. Such glass finds application in high-quality <a href="lens%20%28optics%29">lenses</a> for cameras and scientific instruments. The radiation from these lenses can darken them and turn them yellow over a period of years and degrade film, but the health risks are minimal. Yellowed lenses may be restored to their original colourless state by lengthy exposure to intense ultraviolet radiation. Thorium dioxide has since been replaced by rare-earth oxides in this application, as they provide similar effects and are not radioactive.

Thorium tetrafluoride is used as an antireflection material in multilayered optical coatings. It is transparent to electromagnetic waves having wavelengths in the range of 0.35–12 µm, a range that includes near ultraviolet, visible and <a href="Infrared">mid infrared</a> light. Its radiation is primarily due to alpha particles, which can be easily stopped by a thin cover layer of another material. Replacements for thorium tetrafluoride are being developed as of the 2010s.

The main nuclear power source in a reactor is the neutron-induced fission of a nuclide; the synthetic fissile nuclei U and Pu can be <a href="breeder%20reactor">bred</a> from neutron capture by the naturally occurring quantity nuclides Th and U. U occurs naturally and is also fissile. In the thorium fuel cycle, the fertile isotope Th is bombarded by <a href="slow%20neutron">slow neutron</a>s, undergoing neutron capture to become Th, which undergoes two consecutive beta decays to become first <a href="protactinium-233">Pa</a> and then the fissile U:

U is fissile and can be used as a nuclear fuel in the same way as U or <a href="plutonium-239">Pu</a>. When U undergoes nuclear fission, the neutrons emitted can strike further Th nuclei, continuing the cycle. This parallels the uranium fuel cycle in <a href="fast%20breeder%20reactor">fast breeder reactor</a>s where U undergoes neutron capture to become U, beta decaying to first Np and then fissile Pu.

Thorium is more abundant than uranium and can satisfy world energy demands for longer.

Th absorbs neutrons more readily than U, and U has a higher probability of fission upon neutron capture (92.0%) than U (85.5%) or Pu (73.5%). It also releases more neutrons upon fission on average. A single neutron capture by U produces transuranic waste along with the fissile Pu, but Th only produces this waste after five captures, forming Np. This number of captures does not happen for 98–99% of the Th nuclei because the intermediate products U or U undergo fission, and fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in <a href="MOX%20fuel">mixed oxide fuels</a> to minimise the generation of transuranics and maximise the destruction of plutonium.

Thorium fuels also result in a safer and better-performing <a href="reactor%20core">reactor core</a> because thorium dioxide has a higher melting point, higher <a href="thermal%20conductivity">thermal conductivity</a>, and a lower <a href="coefficient%20of%20thermal%20expansion">coefficient of thermal expansion</a> and is more stable chemically than the now-common fuel uranium dioxide, which can further oxidise to <a href="triuranium%20octoxide">triuranium octoxide</a> (UO).

The used fuel is difficult and dangerous to reprocess because many of the daughters of Th and U are strong gamma emitters. All U production methods result in impurities of <a href="uranium-232">U</a>, either from parasitic knock-out (n,2n) reactions on Th, Pa, or U that result in the loss of a neutron, or from double neutron capture of Th, an impurity in natural Th:

U by itself is not particularly harmful, but quickly decays to produce the strong gamma emitter Tl. (Th follows the same decay chain, but its much longer half-life means that the quantities of Tl produced are negligible.) These impurities of U make U easy to detect and dangerous to work on, and the impracticality of their separation limits the possibilities of <a href="nuclear%20proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> using U as the fissile material. Pa has a relatively long half-life of 27 days and a high <a href="cross%20section%20%28physics%29">cross section</a> for neutron capture. Thus it is a <a href="neutron%20poison">neutron poison</a>: instead of rapidly decaying to the useful U, a significant amount of Pa converts to U and consumes neutrons, degrading <a href="neutron%20economy">the reactor efficiency</a>. To avoid this, Pa is extracted from the active zone of thorium <a href="molten%20salt%20reactor">molten salt reactor</a>s during their operation, so that it only decays to U.

The irradiation of Th with neutrons, followed by its processing, need to be mastered before these advantages can be realised, and this requires more advanced technology than the uranium and plutonium fuel cycle; research continues in this area. Others cite the low commercial viability of the thorium fuel cycle: the international <a href="Nuclear%20Energy%20Agency">Nuclear Energy Agency</a> predicts that the thorium cycle will never be commercially viable while uranium is available in abundance—a situation which may persist "in the coming decades". The isotopes produced in the thorium fuel cycle are mostly not transuranic, but some of them are still very dangerous, such as Pa, which has a half-life of 32,760 years and is a major contributor to the long-term <a href="radiotoxic">radiotoxic</a>ity of spent nuclear fuel.

Natural thorium decays very slowly compared to many other radioactive materials, and the emitted <a href="alpha%20radiation">alpha radiation</a> cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, such as those in gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>s of the <a href="lung">lung</a>, <a href="pancreas">pancreas</a>, and <a href="blood">blood</a>, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of <a href="liver">liver</a> diseases.

The decay products of Th include more dangerous radionuclides such as radium and radon. Although relatively little of those products are created as the result of the slow decay of thorium, a proper assessment of the radiological toxicity of Th must include the contribution of its daughters, some of which are dangerous <a href="gamma%20radiation">gamma</a> emitters, and which are built up quickly following the initial decay of Th due to the absence of long-lived nuclides along the decay chain. As the dangerous daughters of thorium have much lower melting points than thorium dioxide, they are volatilised every time the mantle is heated for use. In the first hour of use large fractions of the thorium daughters Ra, Ra, Pb, and Bi are released. Most of the radiation dose by a normal user arises from inhaling the radium, resulting in a radiation dose of up to 0.2 <a href="sievert">millisieverts</a> per use, about a third of the dose sustained during a <a href="mammogram">mammogram</a>.

Some <a href="nuclear%20safety">nuclear safety</a> agencies make recommendations about the use of thorium mantles and have raised safety concerns regarding their <a href="Gas%20mantle%23Safety%20concerns">manufacture</a> and disposal; the radiation dose from one mantle is not a serious problem, but that from many mantles gathered together in factories or landfills is.

Thorium is odourless and tasteless. The chemical toxicity of thorium is low because thorium and its most common compounds (mostly the dioxide) are poorly soluble in water, precipitating out before entering the body as the hydroxide. Some thorium compounds are chemically moderately <a href="toxic">toxic</a>, especially in the presence of strong complex-forming ions such as citrate that carry the thorium into the body in soluble form. If a thorium-containing object has been chewed or sucked, it loses 0.4% of thorium and 90% of its dangerous daughters to the body. Three quarters of the thorium that has penetrated the body accumulates in the <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>. Absorption through the skin is possible, but is not a likely means of exposure. Thorium's low solubility in water also means that excretion of thorium by the kidneys and faeces is rather slow.

Tests on the thorium uptake of workers involved in monazite processing showed thorium levels above recommended limits in their bodies, but no adverse effects on health were found at those moderately low concentrations. No chemical toxicity has yet been observed in the <a href="tracheobronchial%20tract">tracheobronchial tract</a> and the lungs from exposure to thorium. People who work with thorium compounds are at a risk of <a href="dermatitis">dermatitis</a>. It can take as much as thirty years after the ingestion of thorium for symptoms to manifest themselves. Thorium has no known biological role.

Powdered thorium metal is pyrophoric: it ignites spontaneously in air. In 1964, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">United States Department of the Interior</a> listed thorium as "severe" on a table entitled "Ignition and explosibility of metal powders". Its ignition temperature was given as 270 °C (520 °F) for dust clouds and 280 °C (535 °F) for layers. Its minimum explosive concentration was listed as 0.075 oz/cu ft (0.075 kg/m); the minimum igniting energy for (non-submicron) dust was listed as 5 <a href="Joule">mJ</a>.

In 1956, the <a href="Sylvania%20Electric%20Products%20explosion">Sylvania Electric Products explosion</a> occurred during reprocessing and burning of thorium sludge in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, United States. Nine people were injured; one died of complications caused by <a href="third-degree%20burns">third-degree burns</a>.

Thorium exists in very small quantities everywhere on Earth although larger amounts exist in certain parts: the average human contains about 40 <a href="microgram">microgram</a>s of thorium and typically consumes three micrograms per day. Most thorium exposure occurs through dust inhalation; some thorium comes with food and water, but because of its low solubility, this exposure is negligible.

Exposure is raised for people who live near thorium deposits or radioactive waste disposal sites, those who live near or work in uranium, phosphate, or tin processing factories, and for those who work in gas mantle production. Thorium is especially common in the <a href="Tamil%20Nadu">Tamil Nadu</a> coastal areas of India, where residents may be exposed to a naturally occurring radiation dose ten times higher than the worldwide average. It is also common in northern Brazilian coastal areas, from south Bahia to <a href="Guarapari">Guarapari</a>, a city with radioactive monazite sand beaches, with radiation levels up to 50 times higher than world average background radiation.

Another possible source of exposure is thorium dust produced at weapons testing ranges, as thorium is used in the guidance systems of some missiles. This has been blamed for a high incidence of birth defects and cancer at <a href="Salto%20di%20Quirra">Salto di Quirra</a> on the Italian island of Sardinia.

Thylacine

The thylacine ( , or , also ; (from Ancient Greek θύλακος thúlakos, “pouch, sack” + Latin -inus "-ine") ("Thylacinus cynocephalus"), now <a href="extinct">extinct</a>, was the largest known <a href="carnivorous%20marsupial">carnivorous marsupial</a> <a href="mammal">mammal</a>, evolving about 4 million years ago. The last known live animal was captured in 1933 in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. It is commonly known as the Tasmanian tiger because of its striped lower back, or the Tasmanian wolf because of its <a href="Canid">canid-like</a> characteristics. It was native to continental Tasmania, <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, and the <a href="Australia%20%28continent%29">Australian mainland</a>.

The thylacine was relatively shy and nocturnal, with the general appearance of a medium-to-large-size dog, except for its stiff tail and <a href="Pouch%20%28marsupial%29">abdominal pouch</a> similar to a kangaroo, and dark transverse stripes that radiated from the top of its back, reminiscent of a tiger. The thylacine was a formidable <a href="apex%20predator">apex predator</a>, though exactly how large its prey animals were is disputed. Because of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a> it displayed a form and <a href="adaptations">adaptations</a> similar to the <a href="tiger">tiger</a> and <a href="wolf">wolf</a> of the Northern Hemisphere, even though not related. Its closest living relative is either the <a href="Tasmanian%20devil">Tasmanian devil</a> or the <a href="numbat">numbat</a>. The thylacine was one of only two marsupials to have a pouch in both sexes: the other is <a href="water%20opossum">water opossum</a>. The pouch of the male thylacine served as a protective sheath covering the <a href="Marsupial%20reproductive%20system">external reproductive organs</a>.

The thylacine had become extremely rare or extinct on the Australian mainland before <a href="History%20of%20Australia%20before%201901">British settlement</a> of the continent, but it survived on the island of Tasmania along with several other <a href="endemic%20%28ecology%29">endemic</a> species, including the <a href="Tasmanian%20devil">Tasmanian devil</a>. Intensive hunting encouraged by <a href="bounty%20%28reward%29">bounties</a> is generally blamed for its extinction, but other contributing factors may have been disease, the introduction of dogs, and human encroachment into its habitat.

The modern thylacine probably appeared about 4 million years ago. Species of the family Thylacinidae date back to the beginning of the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>; since the early 1990s, at least seven fossil species have been uncovered at <a href="Australian%20Fossil%20Mammal%20Sites%20%28Riversleigh%29">Riversleigh</a>, part of <a href="Lawn%20Hill%20National%20Park">Lawn Hill National Park</a> in northwest <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. <a href="Dickson%27s%20thylacine">Dickson's thylacine</a> ("Nimbacinus dicksoni") is the oldest of the seven discovered fossil species, dating back to 23 million years ago. This <a href="thylacinid">thylacinid</a> was much smaller than its more recent relatives. The largest species, the powerful thylacine ("<a href="Thylacinus%20potens">Thylacinus potens</a>") which grew to the size of a wolf, was the only species to survive into the late Miocene. In late <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> and early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> times, the modern thylacine was widespread (although never numerous) throughout Australia and New Guinea.

An example of <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>, the thylacine showed many similarities to the members of the dog family, <a href="Canidae">Canidae</a>, of the Northern Hemisphere: sharp teeth, powerful jaws, <a href="digitigrade">raised heels</a> and the same general body form. Since the thylacine filled the same <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a> in Australia as the dog family did elsewhere, it developed many of the same features. Despite this, as a marsupial it is unrelated to any of the Northern Hemisphere <a href="Placentalia">placental mammal</a> predators.
The thylacine is a <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> member of the <a href="Dasyuromorphia">Dasyuromorphia</a> along with <a href="numbat">numbat</a>s, <a href="dunnart">dunnart</a>s, <a href="wambenger">wambenger</a>s, and <a href="quoll">quoll</a>s. The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> follows:

Descriptions of the thylacine come from preserved specimens, fossil records, skins and skeletal remains, and black and white photographs and film of the animal both in captivity and from the field.

The thylacine resembled a large, short-haired dog with a stiff tail which smoothly extended from the body in a way similar to that of a <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>. Although not related, it was similar to the <a href="hyena">hyena</a> in its unusual stance and general demeanour.

The mature thylacine ranged from long, plus a tail of around . Adults stood about at the shoulder and weighed . There was slight <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> with the males being larger than females on average.
Thylacines, uniquely for marsupials, have largely cartilaginous <a href="epipubic">epipubic</a> bones with a highly reduced osseous element. This has been once considered a synapomorphy with <a href="sparassodonts">sparassodonts</a>, though its now thought that both groups reduced their epipubics independently.

Its yellow-brown coat featured 15 to 20 distinctive dark stripes across its back, rump and the base of its tail, which earned the animal the nickname "tiger". The stripes were more pronounced in younger specimens, fading as the animal got older. One of the stripes extended down the outside of the rear thigh. Its body hair was dense and soft, up to in length. Colouration varied from light fawn to a dark brown; the belly was cream-coloured.

Its rounded, erect ears were about long and covered with short fur.

The early scientific studies suggested it possessed an acute sense of smell which enabled it to track prey, but analysis of its brain structure revealed that its <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>s were not well developed. It is likely to have relied on sight and sound when hunting instead.

The thylacine was able to open its jaws to an unusual extent: up to 80 degrees. This capability can be seen in part in <a href="David%20Fleay">David Fleay</a>'s short black-and-white film sequence of a captive thylacine from 1933. The jaws were muscular but weak and had 46 teeth.

The tail vertebrae were fused to a degree, with resulting restriction of full tail movement. Fusion may have occurred as the animal reached full maturity. The tail tapered towards the tip. In juveniles, the tip of the tail had a ridge.

The female thylacine had a pouch with four <a href="teat">teat</a>s, but unlike many other marsupials, the pouch opened to the rear of its body. Males had a scrotal pouch, unique amongst the Australian marsupials, into which they could withdraw their <a href="scrotum">scrotal sac</a> for protection.

Thylacine footprints could be distinguished from other native or introduced animals; unlike foxes, cats, dogs, <a href="wombat">wombat</a>s or <a href="Tasmanian%20devil">Tasmanian devil</a>s, thylacines had a very large rear pad and four obvious front pads, arranged in almost a straight line. The hindfeet were similar to the forefeet but had four digits rather than five. Their claws were non-retractable.

More detail can be seen in a cast taken from a freshly dead thylacine. The cast shows the plantar pad in more detail and shows that the plantar pad is tri-lobal in that it exhibits three distinctive lobes. It is a single plantar pad divided by three deep grooves. The distinctive plantar pad shape along with the asymmetrical nature of the foot makes it quite different from animals such as dogs or foxes. This cast dates back to the early 1930s and is part of the Museum of Victoria's thylacine collection.

Some observers described it having a strong and distinctive smell, others described a faint, clean, animal odour, and some no odour at all. It is possible that the thylacine, like its relative, the Tasmanian devil, gave off an odour when agitated.

The thylacine was noted as having a stiff and somewhat awkward <a href="gait">gait</a>, making it unable to run at high speed. It could also perform a bipedal hop, in a fashion similar to a kangaroo—demonstrated at various times by captive specimens. Guiler speculates that this was used as an accelerated form of motion when the animal became alarmed. The animal was also able to balance on its hind legs and stand upright for brief periods.

Observers of the animal in the wild and in captivity noted that it would growl and hiss when agitated, often accompanied
by a threat-yawn. During hunting it would emit a series of rapidly repeated guttural cough-like barks (described as "yip-yap", "cay-yip" or "hop-hop-hop"), probably for communication between the family pack members. It also had a long whining cry, probably for identification at distance, and a low snuffling noise used for communication between family members.

The thylacine probably preferred the <a href="Flora%20of%20Australia">dry eucalyptus forests, wetlands, and grasslands</a> of <a href="Australia%20%28continent%29">mainland Australia</a>. Indigenous Australian rock paintings indicate that the thylacine lived throughout mainland Australia and <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>. Proof of the animal's existence in mainland Australia came from a desiccated carcass that was discovered in a cave in the <a href="Nullarbor%20Plain">Nullarbor Plain</a> in Western Australia in 1990; <a href="carbon%20dating">carbon dating</a> revealed it to be around 3,300 years old. Recently examined fossilised footprints also suggest historical distribution of the species on <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>.

In Tasmania it preferred the woodlands of the midlands and coastal <a href="heath">heath</a>, which eventually became the primary focus of British settlers seeking grazing land for their livestock. The striped pattern may have provided camouflage in woodland conditions, but it may have also served for identification purposes. The animal had a typical home range of between . It appears to have kept to its home range without being territorial; groups too large to be a family unit were sometimes observed together.

Little is known about the behavior of the thylacine. A few observations were made of the animal in captivity, but only limited, anecdotal evidence exists of the animal's behaviour in the wild. Most observations were made during the day whereas the thylacine was naturally nocturnal. Those observations, made in the twentieth century, may have been atypical as they were of a species already under the stresses that would soon lead to its extinction. Some behavioral characteristics have been extrapolated from the behavior of its close relative, the Tasmanian devil.

The thylacine was a <a href="Nocturnal%20animal">nocturnal</a> and <a href="crepuscular">crepuscular</a> hunter, spending the daylight hours in small caves or hollow tree trunks in a nest of twigs, bark or fern fronds. It tended to retreat to the hills and forest for shelter during the day and hunted in the open heath at night. Early observers noted that the animal was typically shy and secretive, with awareness of the presence of humans and generally avoiding contact, though it occasionally showed inquisitive traits. At the time, much stigma existed in regard to its "fierce" nature; this is likely to be due to its perceived threat to agriculture.

There is evidence for at least some year-round breeding (cull records show joeys discovered in the pouch at all times of the year), although the peak breeding season was in winter and spring. They would produce up to four cubs per litter (typically two or three), carrying the young in a pouch for up to three months and protecting them until they were at least half adult size. Early pouch young were hairless and blind, but they had their eyes open and were fully furred by the time they left the pouch. After leaving the pouch, and until they were developed enough to assist, the juveniles would remain in the lair while their mother hunted. Thylacines only once bred successfully in captivity, in <a href="Melbourne%20Zoo">Melbourne Zoo</a> in 1899. Their life expectancy in the wild is estimated to have been 5 to 7 years, although captive specimens survived up to 9 years.

The thylacine was carnivorous. Prey is believed to have included <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s, <a href="wallaby">wallabies</a> and <a href="wombat">wombat</a>s, birds and small animals such as <a href="potoroo">potoroo</a>s and <a href="Phalangeriformes">possums</a>. One prey animal may have been the once common <a href="Tasmanian%20emu">Tasmanian emu</a>. The emu was a large, flightless bird which shared the habitat of the thylacine and was hunted to extinction by humans around 1850, possibly coinciding with the decline in thylacine numbers. Both <a href="dingo">dingo</a>es and foxes have been noted to hunt the emu on the mainland. European settlers believed the thylacine to prey upon farmers' sheep and poultry. Throughout the 20th century, the thylacine was often characterised as primarily a blood drinker; according to Robert Paddle, the story's popularity seems to have originated from a single second-hand account heard by Geoffrey Smith (1881–1916) in a shepherd's hut.

There is some controversy over the preferred prey size of the thylacine. A 2011 study by the <a href="University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">University of New South Wales</a> using advanced computer modelling indicated that the thylacine had surprisingly feeble jaws. Animals usually take prey close to their own body size, but an adult thylacine of around was found to be incapable of handling prey much larger than . Thus, some researchers believe thylacines only ate small animals such as <a href="bandicoot">bandicoot</a>s and possums, putting them into direct competition with the <a href="Tasmanian%20devil">Tasmanian devil</a> and the <a href="tiger%20quoll">tiger quoll</a>. However, an earlier study showed that the thylacine had a bite force quotient of 166, similar to that of most quolls; in modern mammalian predators, such a high bite force is almost always associated with predators which routinely take prey as large, or larger than, themselves. If the thylacine was indeed specialised for small prey, this specialisation likely made it susceptible to small disturbances to the ecosystem.

In captivity, thylacines were fed a wide variety of foods, including dead rabbits and wallabies as well as beef, mutton, horse, and occasionally poultry. There is a report of a captive thylacine which refused to eat dead wallaby flesh or to kill and eat a live wallaby offered to it, but "ultimately it was persuaded to eat by having the smell of blood from a freshly killed <a href="wallaby">wallaby</a> put before its nose."

Its <a href="stomach">stomach</a> was muscular, and could distend to allow the animal to eat large amounts of food at one time, probably an adaptation to compensate for long periods when hunting was unsuccessful and food scarce.

Analysis of the skeletal frame and observations of the thylacine in captivity suggest that it preferred to single out a target animal and pursue that animal until it was exhausted: a <a href="pursuit%20predation">pursuit predator</a>. However, trappers reported it as an <a href="ambush%20predator">ambush predator</a>: the animal may have hunted in small family groups, with the main group herding prey in the general direction of an individual waiting in ambush.
Although the living grey wolf is widely seen as the thylacine's counterpart, the thylacine may have been more of an ambush predator as opposed to a pursuit predator. In fact, the predatory behaviour of the thylacine was probably closer to ambushing felids than to large pursuit canids.

Australia lost more than 90% of its larger terrestrial vertebrates by around 40 thousand years ago, with the notable exceptions of the kangaroo and the thylacine. A 2010 paper examining this issue showed that the humans were likely to be one of the major factors in the extinction of many species in Australia, with climate change and bushfire activity playing facilitating roles, although the authors of the research warned that one-factor explanations might be oversimplistic. The thylacine itself is likely to have become near-extinct throughout most of its range in mainland Australia by about 2,000 years ago. 

However, reliable accounts of thylacine survival in South Australia (though confined to the 'thinly settled districts' and <a href="Flinders%20Ranges">Flinders Ranges</a>) and New South Wales (<a href="Blue%20Mountains%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Blue Mountains</a>) exist from as late as the 1830s, from both indigenous and European sources. The absolute extinction is attributed to competition from <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal Australians</a> and <a href="invasive%20species">invasive</a> dingoes.

A study proposes that the arrival of the dingoes may have led to the extinctions of the Tasmanian devil, the thylacine, and the <a href="Tasmanian%20nativehen">Tasmanian nativehen</a> in mainland Australia because the dingo might have competed with the thylacine and devil in preying on the nativehen. However, the study also proposes that an increase in the human population that gathered pace around 4,000 years ago may have led to this. 

However, a counter-argument is that the two species were not in direct competition with one another because the dingo primarily <a href="Diurnality">hunts during the day</a>, whereas it is thought that the thylacine <a href="Nocturnality">hunted mostly at night</a>. Nonetheless, recent morphological examinations of dingo and thylacine skulls show that although the dingo had a weaker bite, its skull could resist greater stresses, allowing it to pull down larger prey than the thylacine. The thylacine was less versatile in its diet than the omnivorous <a href="dingo">dingo</a>. Their ranges appear to have overlapped because thylacine <a href="subfossil">subfossil</a> remains have been discovered near those of dingoes. The adoption of the dingo as a hunting companion by the indigenous peoples would have put the thylacine under increased pressure.

Although the thylacine was extinct on mainland Australia, it survived into the 1930s on the island state of <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>. At the time of the first European settlement, the heaviest distributions were in the northeast, northwest and north-midland regions of the state. They were rarely sighted during this time but slowly began to be credited with numerous attacks on sheep. This led to the establishment of bounty schemes in an attempt to control their numbers. The <a href="Van%20Diemen%27s%20Land%20Company">Van Diemen's Land Company</a> introduced bounties on the thylacine from as early as 1830, and between 1888 and 1909 the <a href="Government%20of%20Tasmania">Tasmanian government</a> paid £1 per head (the equivalent of £100 or more today) for dead adult thylacines and ten <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s for pups. In all they paid out 2,184 bounties, but it is thought that many more thylacines were killed than were claimed for. Its extinction is popularly attributed to these relentless efforts by farmers and <a href="bounty%20hunter">bounty hunter</a>s. 

However, it is likely that multiple factors led to its decline and eventual extinction, including competition with wild dogs introduced by European settlers, erosion of its habitat, the concurrent extinction of prey species, and a <a href="wikt%3Adistemper">distemper</a>-like disease that affected many captive specimens at the time. A study from 2012 also found that were it not for an epidemiological influence, the extinction of thylacine would have been at best prevented, at worst postponed. "The chance of saving the species, through changing public opinion, and the re-establishment of captive breeding, could have been possible. But the marsupi-carnivore disease, with its dramatic effect on individual thylacine longevity and juvenile mortality, came far too soon, and spread far too quickly." 

Whatever the reason, the animal had become extremely rare in the wild by the late 1920s. Despite the fact that the thylacine was believed by many to be responsible for attacks on sheep, in 1928 the Tasmanian Advisory Committee for Native Fauna recommended a reserve similar to the <a href="Savage%20River%20National%20Park">Savage River National Park</a> to protect any remaining thylacines, with potential sites of suitable habitat including the <a href="Arthur%20River%2C%20Tasmania">Arthur</a>-<a href="Pieman%20River">Pieman</a> area of western Tasmania.

The last known thylacine to be killed in the wild was shot in 1930 by Wilf Batty, a farmer from <a href="Mawbanna%2C%20Tasmania">Mawbanna</a> in the state's northwest. The animal, believed to have been a male, had been seen around Batty's house for several weeks.

Work in 2012 examined the relationship of the genetic diversity of the thylacines before their extinction. The results indicated that the last of the thylacines in Australia, on top of the threats from dingoes, had limited genetic diversity, due to their complete geographic isolation from mainland Australia. Further investigations in 2017 showed evidence that this decline in genetic diversity started long before the arrival of humans in Australia, possibly starting as early as 70–120 thousand years ago.

The last captive thylacine, later referred to as "Benjamin", was trapped in the Florentine Valley by Elias Churchill in 1933, and sent to the <a href="Hobart%20Zoo">Hobart Zoo</a> where it lived for three years. The thylacine died on 7 September 1936. It is believed to have died as the result of neglect—locked out of its sheltered sleeping quarters, it was exposed to a rare occurrence of extreme Tasmanian weather: extreme heat during the day and freezing temperatures at night. This thylacine features in the last known motion picture footage of a living specimen: 62 seconds of black-and-white footage showing the thylacine in its enclosure in a clip taken in 1933, by naturalist <a href="David%20Fleay">David Fleay</a>. In the film footage, the thylacine is seen seated, walking around the perimeter of its enclosure, yawning (exposing its impressive gape), sniffing the air, scratching itself (in the same manner as a dog), and lying down.

Frank Darby, who claimed to have been a keeper at Hobart Zoo, suggested "Benjamin" as having been the animal's <a href="pet">pet</a> name in a newspaper article of May 1968. No documentation exists to suggest that it ever had a pet name, and Alison Reid ("de facto" curator at the zoo) and Michael Sharland (publicist for the zoo) denied that Frank Darby had ever worked at the zoo or that the name "Benjamin" was ever used for the animal. Darby also appears to be the source for the claim that the last thylacine was a male. Paddle was unable to uncover any records of any Frank Darby having been employed by Beaumaris/Hobart Zoo during the time that Reid or her father was in charge and noted several inconsistencies in the story Darby told during his interview in 1968.
The sex of the last captive thylacine has been a point of debate since its death at the Beaumaris Zoo in Hobart, Tasmania. In 2011, detailed examination of a single frame from the motion film footage confirmed that the thylacine was male. When frame III is enlarged the <a href="scrotum">scrotum</a> can be seen, confirming the thylacine to be male. By enhancing the frame (increasing exposure to 20% and contrast to 45%), the outline of the individual testes is discernable.

After the thylacine's death the zoo expected that it would soon find a replacement, and "Benjamin"'s death was not reported on in the media at the time. Although there had been a <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation movement</a> pressing for the thylacine's protection since 1901, driven in part by the increasing difficulty in obtaining specimens for overseas collections, political difficulties prevented any form of protection coming into force until 1936. Official protection of the species by the Tasmanian government was introduced on 10 July 1936, 59 days before the last known specimen died in captivity.

A thylacine was reportedly shot and photographed at <a href="Mawbanna%2C%20Tasmania">Mawbanna</a> in 1938. A 1957 sighting from a helicopter could not be confirmed on the ground. An animal killed in <a href="Sandy%20Cape">Sandy Cape</a> at night in 1961 was tentatively identified as a thylacine. The results of subsequent searches indicated a strong possibility of the survival of the species in Tasmania into the 1960s. Searches by Dr. Eric Guiler and David Fleay in the northwest of Tasmania found <a href="footprint">footprint</a>s and <a href="feces">scats</a> that may have belonged to the animal, heard <a href="Animal%20communication">vocalisations</a> matching the description of those of the thylacine, and collected anecdotal evidence from people reported to have sighted the animal. 

Despite the searches, no conclusive evidence was found to point to its continued existence in the wild. Between 1967 and 1973, zoologist <a href="Jeremy%20Griffith">Jeremy Griffith</a> and dairy farmer James Malley conducted what is regarded as the most intensive search ever carried out, including exhaustive surveys along Tasmania's west coast, installation of automatic camera stations, prompt investigations of claimed sightings, and in 1972 the creation of the Thylacine Expeditionary Research Team with Dr. <a href="Bob%20Brown">Bob Brown</a>, which concluded without finding any evidence of the thylacine's existence.

The thylacine held the status of <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> until the 1980s. International standards at the time stated that an animal could not be declared extinct until 50 years had passed without a confirmed record. Since no definitive proof of the thylacine's existence in the wild had been obtained for more than 50 years, it met that official criterion and was declared extinct by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> in 1982 and by the Tasmanian government in 1986. The species was removed from Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>) in 2013.

The Australian Rare Fauna Research Association reports having 3,800 sightings on file from mainland Australia since the 1936 extinction date, while the Mystery Animal Research Centre of Australia recorded 138 up to 1998, and the <a href="Department%20of%20Environment%20and%20Conservation%20%28Western%20Australia%29">Department of Conservation and Land Management</a> recorded 65 in Western Australia over the same period. Independent thylacine researchers Buck and Joan Emburg of Tasmania report 360 Tasmanian and 269 mainland post-extinction 20th century sightings, figures compiled from several sources. On the mainland, sightings are most frequently reported in Southern Victoria.

Some sightings have generated a large amount of publicity. In 1973, Gary and Liz Doyle shot ten seconds of 8 mm film showing an unidentified animal running across and alongside a South Australian road. Attempts to positively identify the creature as a thylacine have been impossible due to the poor quality of the film. In 1982, a researcher with the <a href="Tasmania%20Parks%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service</a>, Hans Naarding, observed what he believed to be a thylacine for three minutes during the night at a site near Arthur River in northwestern Tasmania. The sighting led to an extensive year-long government-funded search. In 1985, Aboriginal tracker Kevin Cameron produced five photographs which appear to show a digging thylacine, which he stated he took in <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a>.

In January 1995, a Parks and Wildlife officer reported observing a thylacine in the <a href="Pyengana%2C%20Tasmania">Pyengana</a> region of northeastern Tasmania in the early hours of the morning. Later searches revealed no trace of the animal. In 1997, it was reported that locals and missionaries near <a href="Mount%20Carstensz">Mount Carstensz</a> in Western New Guinea had sighted thylacines. The locals had apparently known about them for many years but had not made an official report. In February 2005 Klaus Emmerichs, a <a href="Germans">German</a> tourist, claimed to have taken digital photographs of a thylacine he saw near the <a href="Cradle%20Mountain-Lake%20St%20Clair%20National%20Park">Lake St Clair National Park</a>, but the authenticity of the photographs has not been established. The photos were published in April 2006, fourteen months after the sighting. The photographs, which showed only the back of the animal, were said by those who studied them to be inconclusive as evidence of the thylacine's continued existence. Due to the uncertainty of whether the species is still extant or not, the thylacine is sometimes regarded as a <a href="cryptid">cryptid</a>.

In 2008, a group of thylacines was purportedly captured on video in <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, but the veracity of the footage remains unconfirmed. In light of two detailed sightings around 1983 from the remote <a href="Cape%20York%20Peninsula">Cape York Peninsula</a> of mainland Australia, scientists led by <a href="Bill%20Laurance">Bill Laurance</a> announced plans in 2017 to survey the area for thylacines using <a href="camera%20trap">camera trap</a>s.

In 1983, the American <a href="media%20mogul">media mogul</a> <a href="Ted%20Turner">Ted Turner</a> offered a $100,000 reward for proof of the continued existence of the thylacine.

A letter sent in response to an inquiry by a thylacine-searcher, Murray McAllister in 2000, indicated that the reward had been withdrawn. In March 2005, Australian news magazine "<a href="The%20Bulletin%20%28Australian%20periodical%29">The Bulletin</a>", as part of its 125th anniversary celebrations, offered a $1.25 million reward for the safe capture of a live thylacine. When the offer closed at the end of June 2005, no one had produced any evidence of the animal's existence. An offer of $1.75 million has subsequently been offered by a Tasmanian tour operator, Stewart Malcolm. Trapping is illegal under the terms of the thylacine's protection, so any reward made for its capture is invalid, since a trapping licence would not be issued.

The <a href="Australian%20Museum">Australian Museum</a> in Sydney began a <a href="cloning">cloning</a> project in 1999. The goal was to use <a href="genetics">genetic material</a> from specimens taken and preserved in the early 20th century to <a href="cloning">clone</a> new individuals and <a href="de-extinction">restore</a> the species from extinction. Several molecular biologists have dismissed the project as a public relations stunt and its chief proponent, <a href="Mike%20Archer%20%28paleontologist%29">Mike Archer</a>, received a 2002 nomination for the Australian Skeptics <a href="Bent%20Spoon%20Award">Bent Spoon Award</a> for "the perpetrator of the most preposterous piece of paranormal or pseudo-scientific piffle."

In late 2002, the researchers had some success as they were able to extract replicable <a href="DNA">DNA</a> from the specimens. On 15 February 2005, the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the DNA retrieved from the specimens had been too badly degraded to be usable. In May 2005, Archer, the <a href="University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">University of New South Wales</a> Dean of Science at the time, former director of the <a href="Australian%20Museum">Australian Museum</a> and evolutionary biologist, announced that the project was being restarted by a group of interested universities and a research institute.

In 2008, researchers Andrew J. Pask and Marilyn B. Renfree from the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> and Richard R. Behringer from the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a> reported that they managed to restore functionality of a gene "<a href="Col2A1">Col2A1</a> enhancer" obtained from 100-year-old ethanol-fixed thylacine tissues from museum collections. The genetic material was found working in <a href="transgenic">transgenic</a> mice. The research enhanced hopes of eventually restoring the population of thylacines. That same year, another group of researchers successfully sequenced the complete thylacine mitochondrial genome from two museum specimens. Their success suggests that it may be feasible to sequence the complete thylacine nuclear genome from museum specimens. Their results were published in the journal "<a href="Genome%20Research">Genome Research</a>" in 2009.

<a href="Mike%20Archer%20%28paleontologist%29">Mike Archer</a> spoke about the possibilities of resurrecting the thylacine and the <a href="gastric-brooding%20frog">gastric-brooding frog</a> at <a href="TED%20%28conference%29">TED2013</a>. <a href="Stewart%20Brand">Stewart Brand</a> spoke at TED2013 about the ethics and possibilities of de-extinction, and made reference to thylacine in his talk.
A draft <a href="Whole%20genome%20sequencing">genome sequence</a> of the thylacine was produced by Feigin et al. 2017 using the DNA extracted from an ethanol-preserved pouch young specimen provided by <a href="Museums%20Victoria">Museums Victoria</a>. Researchers used the genome to study aspects of the thylacine's evolution and natural history, including the genetic basis of its <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergence</a> with <a href="canidae">canids</a>, clarifying its <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">evolutionary relationships</a> with other marsupials and examining changes in its <a href="effective%20population%20size">population size</a> over time.

Also in 2017 a reference library of 159 micrographic images of thylacine hair was jointly produced by CSIRO and Where Light Meets Dark, using scanning electron microscopy, metal-coated scanning electron microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy and optical light microscopy.

In 2018 Rehberg published a study into the appearance of thylacine stripes using infrared flash camera trap photography.

In 2017, Berns and Ashwell published comparative <a href="cortical%20map">cortical map</a>s of thylacine and <a href="Tasmanian%20devil">Tasmanian devil</a> brains, showing that the thylacine had a larger, more modularized <a href="basal%20ganglion">basal ganglion</a>. The authors associated these differences with the thylacine's predatory lifestyle. The same year, White, Mitchell and Austin published a large-scale analysis of thylacine mitochondrial genomes, showing that they had split into Eastern and Western populations on the mainland prior to the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">Last Glacial Maximum</a> and had low genetic diversity by the time of <a href="History%20of%20Australia%20%281788%E2%80%931850%29%23Colonisation">European arrival</a>.

In 2018, Newton et al. collected and CT-scanned all known preserved thylacine pouch young specimens to digitally reconstruct its development throughout its entire window of growth in the mother's pouch. This study revealed new information on the biology of the thylacine, including the growth of its limbs and when it developed its 'dog-like' appearance. It was found that two of the thylacine young in the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery (TMAG) were misidentified and of another species, reducing the number of known pouch young specimens to 11 worldwide.

By the beginning of the 20th century, the increasing rarity of thylacines led to increased demand for captive specimens by zoos around the world. Despite export of breeding pairs, these were unsuccessful and the last thylacine outside Australia died at London Zoo in 1931.

Since 1996, 7 September, the date of death of the last known thylacine, has been commemorated in Australia as National Threatened Species Day.

The best known illustrations of "Thylacinus cynocephalus" were those in <a href="John%20Gould">Gould</a>'s "<a href="The%20Mammals%20of%20Australia">The Mammals of Australia</a>" (1845–63), often copied since its publication and the most frequently reproduced, and given further exposure by <a href="Cascade%20Brewery">Cascade Brewery</a>'s appropriation for its label in 1987. The government of Tasmania published a monochromatic reproduction of the same image in 1934, the author <a href="Louisa%20Anne%20Meredith">Louisa Anne Meredith</a> also copied it for "Tasmanian Friends and Foes" (1881).

The thylacine has been used extensively as a symbol of Tasmania. The animal is featured on the official <a href="Coat%20of%20arms%20of%20Tasmania">Tasmanian coat of arms</a>. It is used in the official logos for the <a href="Government%20of%20Tasmania">Tasmanian government</a> and the <a href="City%20of%20Launceston">City of Launceston</a>. It is also used on the <a href="University%20of%20Tasmania">University of Tasmania</a>'s ceremonial mace and the <a href="Ship%27s%20badge">badge</a> of the submarine . Since 1998, it has been prominently displayed on <a href="Vehicle%20registration%20plates%20of%20Australia%23Tasmania">Tasmanian vehicle number plates</a>.

The plight of the thylacine was featured in a campaign for <a href="The%20Wilderness%20Society%20%28Australia%29">The Wilderness Society</a> entitled "We used to hunt thylacines". In video games, boomerang-wielding "<a href="Ty%20the%20Tasmanian%20Tiger">Ty the Tasmanian Tiger</a>" is the star of his own trilogy. Characters in the early 1990s cartoon "<a href="Taz-Mania">Taz-Mania</a>" included the neurotic Wendell T. Wolf, the last surviving Tasmanian wolf. "<a href="Tiger%20Tale">Tiger Tale</a>" is a children's book based on an Aboriginal myth about how the thylacine got its stripes. The thylacine character Rolf is featured in the extinction musical "<a href="Rockford%27s%20Rock%20Opera">Rockford's Rock Opera</a>". The thylacine is the mascot for the <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmanian cricket team</a>, and has appeared in postage stamps from Australia, <a href="Equatorial%20Guinea">Equatorial Guinea</a>, and <a href="Federated%20States%20of%20Micronesia">Micronesia</a>.

"<a href="The%20Hunter%20%281999%20novel%29">The Hunter</a>" is a novel by <a href="Julia%20Leigh">Julia Leigh</a> about an Australian hunter who sets out to find the last thylacine. The novel has been adapted into <a href="The%20Hunter%20%282011%20Australian%20film%29">a 2011 film by the same name</a> directed by Daniel Nettheim, and starring <a href="Willem%20Dafoe">Willem Dafoe</a>.

Numerous examples of thylacine engravings and <a href="Indigenous%20Australian%20art">rock art</a> have been found dating back to at least 1000 BC. <a href="Petroglyph">Petroglyph</a> images of the thylacine can be found at the Dampier Rock Art Precinct on the <a href="Burrup%20Peninsula">Burrup Peninsula</a> in Western Australia.

By the time the first European explorers arrived, the animal was already extinct in mainland Australia and rare in Tasmania. Europeans may have encountered it in Tasmania as far back as 1642 when <a href="Abel%20Tasman">Abel Tasman</a> first arrived in Tasmania. His shore party reported seeing the footprints of "wild beasts having claws like a "Tyger"". <a href="Marc-Joseph%20Marion%20du%20Fresne">Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne</a>, arriving with the "Mascarin" in 1772, reported seeing a "tiger cat". Positive identification of the thylacine as the animal encountered cannot be made from this report since the <a href="tiger%20quoll">tiger quoll</a> ("Dasyurus maculatus") is similarly described.

The first definitive encounter was by French explorers on 13 May 1792, as noted by the naturalist <a href="Jacques%20Labillardi%C3%A8re">Jacques Labillardière</a>, in his journal from the expedition led by <a href="D%27Entrecasteaux">D'Entrecasteaux</a>. In 1805 <a href="William%20Paterson%20%28governor%29">William Paterson</a>, the Lieutenant Governor of Tasmania, sent a detailed description for publication in the "<a href="Sydney%20Gazette">Sydney Gazette</a>". He also sent a description of the Thylacine in a letter to <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Joseph Banks</a> dated 30 March 1805.

The first detailed scientific description was made by Tasmania's Deputy Surveyor-General, <a href="George%20Prideaux%20Robert%20Harris">George Harris</a> in 1808, five years after first settlement of the island. Harris originally placed the thylacine in the genus "<a href="Didelphis">Didelphis</a>", which had been created by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> for the American <a href="opossum">opossum</a>s, describing it as "Didelphis cynocephala", the "dog-headed opossum". Recognition that the Australian marsupials were fundamentally different from the known mammal genera led to the establishment of the modern classification scheme, and in 1796, <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a> created the genus "<a href="Dasyurus">Dasyurus</a>" where he placed the thylacine in 1810. To resolve the mixture of Greek and Latin nomenclature, the species name was altered to "cynocephalus". In 1824, it was separated out into its own genus, "Thylacinus", by <a href="Coenraad%20Jacob%20Temminck">Temminck</a>. The common name derives directly from the genus name, originally from the Greek θύλακος ("thýlakos"), meaning "pouch" or "sack".

Thomas Cranmer

Thomas Cranmer (2 July 1489 – 21 March 1556) was a leader of the <a href="English%20Reformation">English Reformation</a> and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a> during the reigns of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII</a>, <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> and, for a short time, <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary I</a>. He helped build the case for the annulment of Henry's marriage to <a href="Catherine%20of%20Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a>, which was one of the causes of the separation of the English Church from union with the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>. Along with <a href="Thomas%20Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</a>, he supported the principle of <a href="Acts%20of%20Supremacy">Royal Supremacy</a>, in which the king was considered sovereign over the Church within his realm.

During Cranmer's tenure as Archbishop of Canterbury, he was responsible for establishing the first doctrinal and liturgical structures of the reformed <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>. Under Henry's rule, Cranmer did not make many radical changes in the Church, due to power struggles between religious conservatives and reformers. However, he succeeded in publishing the first officially authorised <a href="vernacular">vernacular</a> service, the "<a href="Exhortation%20and%20Litany">Exhortation and Litany</a>".

When Edward came to the throne, Cranmer was able to promote major reforms. He wrote and compiled the first two editions of the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>", a complete liturgy for the English Church. With the assistance of several Continental reformers to whom he gave refuge, he changed doctrine in areas such as the <a href="Eucharist">Eucharist</a>, <a href="clerical%20celibacy">clerical celibacy</a>, the role of <a href="Religious%20image">images</a> in places of worship, and the <a href="Veneration">veneration of saints</a>. Cranmer <a href="wikt%3Apromulgate">promulgated</a> the new doctrines through the Prayer Book, the "<a href="The%20Books%20of%20Homilies">Homilies</a>" and other publications.

After the accession of the <a href="Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a> Mary I, Cranmer was put on trial for treason and <a href="heresy">heresy</a>. Imprisoned for over two years and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several <a href="recantation">recantation</a>s and apparently reconciled himself with the Roman Catholic Church. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a <a href="heretic">heretic</a> to Roman Catholics and a <a href="martyr">martyr</a> for the principles of the English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in "<a href="Foxe%27s%20Book%20of%20Martyrs">Foxe's Book of Martyrs</a>" and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the "Book of Common Prayer" and the "<a href="Thirty-Nine%20Articles">Thirty-Nine Articles</a>", an <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> statement of faith derived from his work.

Cranmer was born in 1489 at <a href="Aslockton">Aslockton</a> in <a href="Nottinghamshire">Nottinghamshire</a>, England. He was a younger son of Thomas Cranmer by his wife Agnes Hatfield. Thomas Cranmer was of modest wealth but was from a well-established armigerous gentry family which took its name from the <a href="manor">manor</a> of Cranmer in Lincolnshire. Thomas was <a href="lord%20of%20the%20manor">lord of the manor</a> of Whatton, which had come to his great grandfather Edmund Cranmer by marriage with the heiress of the Aslactons, who held it from the reign of Henry II. It later passed by an heiress of Cranmer, to Sir John Molyneux, Baronet, who sold it to the Marquis of Dorchester, and in 1792 was owned by the representative of the Duke of Kingston. A <a href="ledger%20stone">ledger stone</a> to one of his relatives in Whatton Church, near Aslockton is inscribed as follows: "Hic jacet Thomas Cranmer, Armiger, qui obiit vicesimo septimo die mensis Maii, anno d(omi)ni. MD centesimo primo, cui(us) a(n)i(ma)e p(ro)p(i)cietur Deus Amen" ("here lies Thomas Cranmer, Esquire, who died on the 27th day of May in the year of our lord 1601, on whose soul may God look upon with mercy"). The arms on it are: "A chevron between three cranes" (Cranmer) and "Argent, five fusils in fesse gules each charged with an escallop or" (Aslacton). The figure is that of a man in flowing hair and gown, and a purse at his right side. Their oldest son, John Cranmer, inherited the family estate, whereas Thomas and his younger brother Edmund were placed on the path to a clerical career.

Today historians know nothing definite about Cranmer's early schooling. He probably attended a grammar school in his village. At the age of fourteen, two years after the death of his father, he was sent to the newly created <a href="Jesus%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Jesus College, Cambridge</a>. It took him a surprisingly long eight years to reach his Bachelor of Arts degree following a curriculum of logic, classical literature and philosophy. During this time, he began to collect medieval <a href="Scholasticism">scholastic</a> books, which he preserved faithfully throughout his life. For his master's degree he took a different course of study, concentrating on the <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">humanists</a>, <a href="Jacques%20Lef%C3%A8vre%20d%27%C3%89taples">Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples</a> and <a href="Erasmus">Erasmus</a>. This time he progressed with no special delay, finishing the course in three years. Shortly after receiving his <a href="Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Oxbridge%20and%20Dublin%29">Master of Arts</a> degree in 1515, he was elected to a <a href="Fellow">Fellow</a>ship of Jesus College.

Sometime after Cranmer took his MA, he married a woman named Joan. Although he was not yet a priest, he was forced to forfeit his fellowship, resulting in the loss of his residence at Jesus College. To support himself and his wife, he took a job as a <a href="Reader%20%28academic%20rank%29">reader</a> at <a href="Buckingham%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Buckingham Hall</a> (later reformed as <a href="Magdalene%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Magdalene College</a>). When Joan died during her first childbirth, Jesus College showed its regard for Cranmer by reinstating his fellowship. He began studying theology and by 1520 he had been <a href="holy%20orders">ordained</a>, the university already having named him as one of their preachers. He received his <a href="Doctor%20of%20Divinity">Doctor of Divinity</a> degree in 1526.

Not much is known about Cranmer's thoughts and experiences during his three decades at Cambridge. Traditionally, he has been portrayed as a humanist whose enthusiasm for biblical scholarship prepared him for the adoption of <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> ideas, which were spreading during the 1520s. However, a study of his <a href="marginalia">marginalia</a> reveals an early antipathy to <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a> and an admiration for Erasmus. When <a href="Cardinal%20Wolsey">Cardinal Wolsey</a>, the king's <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a>, selected several Cambridge scholars, including <a href="Edward%20Lee%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20York">Edward Lee</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Gardiner">Stephen Gardiner</a> and <a href="Richard%20Sampson">Richard Sampson</a>, to be diplomats throughout Europe, Cranmer was chosen to take a minor role in the English embassy in Spain. Two recently discovered letters written by Cranmer describe an early encounter with the king, Henry VIII of England: upon Cranmer's return from Spain, in June 1527, the king personally interviewed Cranmer for half an hour. Cranmer described the king as "the kindest of princes".

Henry VIII's first marriage had its origins in 1502 when his elder brother, <a href="Arthur%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Arthur</a>, died. Their father, <a href="Henry%20VII%20of%20England">Henry VII</a>, then betrothed Arthur's widow, Catherine of Aragon, to the future king. The betrothal immediately raised questions related to the biblical prohibition (in Leviticus 18 and 20) against marriage to a brother's wife. The couple married in 1509 and after a series of miscarriages, a daughter, <a href="Mary%20I%20of%20England">Mary</a>, was born in 1516. By the 1520s, Henry still did not have a son to name as heir and he took this as a sure sign of God's anger and made overtures to the Vatican about an <a href="annulment">annulment</a>. He gave Cardinal Wolsey the task of prosecuting his case; Wolsey began by consulting university experts. From 1527, in addition to his duties as a Cambridge don, Cranmer assisted with the annulment proceedings.

In the summer of 1529, Cranmer stayed with relatives in <a href="Waltham%20Holy%20Cross">Waltham Holy Cross</a> to avoid an outbreak of the <a href="Plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> in Cambridge. Two of his Cambridge associates, Stephen Gardiner and <a href="Edward%20Foxe">Edward Foxe</a>, joined him. The three discussed the annulment issue and Cranmer suggested putting aside the legal case in Rome in favour of a general canvassing of opinions from university theologians throughout Europe. Henry showed much interest in the idea when Gardiner and Foxe presented him this plan. It is not known whether the king or his new Lord Chancellor, <a href="Thomas%20More">Thomas More</a>, explicitly approved the plan. Eventually it was implemented and Cranmer was requested to join the royal team in Rome to gather opinions from the universities. Edward Foxe coordinated the research effort and the team produced the "<a href="Collectanea%20satis%20copiosa">Collectanea Satis Copiosa</a>" ("The Sufficiently Abundant Collections") and "The Determinations", historical and theological support for the argument that the king exercised supreme jurisdiction within his realm.

Cranmer's first contact with a Continental reformer was with <a href="Simon%20Grynaeus">Simon Grynaeus</a>, a humanist based in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, Switzerland, and a follower of the Swiss reformers, <a href="Huldrych%20Zwingli">Huldrych Zwingli</a> and <a href="Johannes%20Oecolampadius">Johannes Oecolampadius</a>. In the summer of 1531, Grynaeus took an extended visit to England to offer himself as an intermediary between the king and the Continental reformers. He struck up a friendship with Cranmer and after his return to Basel, he wrote about Cranmer to the German reformer <a href="Martin%20Bucer">Martin Bucer</a> in <a href="Strasbourg">Strasbourg</a>. Grynaeus' early contacts initiated Cranmer's eventual relationship with the Strasbourg and Swiss reformers.

In January 1532, Cranmer was appointed the resident ambassador at the court of the <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, <a href="Charles%20V%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Charles V</a>. As the emperor travelled throughout his realm, Cranmer had to follow him to his residence in <a href="Regensburg">Regensburg</a>. He passed through the Lutheran city of <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> and saw for the first time the effects of the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Reformation</a>. When the <a href="Imperial%20Diet%20%28Holy%20Roman%20Empire%29">Imperial Diet</a> was moved to Nuremberg in the summer, he met the leading architect of the Nuremberg reforms, <a href="Andreas%20Osiander">Andreas Osiander</a>. They became good friends, and during that July Cranmer took the surprising action of marrying Margarete, the niece of Osiander's wife. This was all the more remarkable given that the marriage required him to set aside his priestly vow of celibacy. He did not take her as his mistress, as was the prevailing custom with priests for whom celibacy was too rigorous. Scholars note that Cranmer had moved, however moderately at this stage, into identifying with certain Lutheran principles. This progress in his personal life was not matched in his political life as he was unable to persuade Charles, Catherine's nephew, to support the annulment of his aunt's marriage.

While Cranmer was following Charles through Italy, he received a royal letter dated 1 October 1532 informing him that he had been appointed the new Archbishop of Canterbury, following the death of archbishop <a href="William%20Warham">William Warham</a>. Cranmer was ordered to return to England. The appointment had been secured by the family of <a href="Anne%20Boleyn">Anne Boleyn</a>, who was being courted by Henry. When Cranmer's promotion became known in London, it caused great surprise as Cranmer had previously held only minor positions in the Church. Cranmer left <a href="Mantua">Mantua</a> on 19 November and arrived in England at the beginning of January. Henry personally financed the <a href="papal%20bulls">papal bulls</a> necessary for Cranmer's promotion to Canterbury. The bulls were easily acquired because the <a href="papal%20nuncio">papal nuncio</a> was under orders from Rome to please the English in an effort to prevent a final breach. The bulls arrived around 26 March 1533 and Cranmer was consecrated as a bishop on 30 March in <a href="St%20Stephen%27s%20Chapel">St Stephen's Chapel</a>, by <a href="John%20Longland">John Longland</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Bishop of Lincoln</a>; <a href="John%20Vesey">John Vesey</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Exeter">Bishop of Exeter</a>; and <a href="Henry%20Standish">Henry Standish</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20Asaph">Bishop of St Asaph</a>. Even while they were waiting for the bulls, Cranmer continued to work on the annulment proceedings, which required greater urgency after Anne announced her pregnancy. Henry and Anne were secretly married on 24 or 25 January 1533 in the presence of a handful of witnesses. Cranmer did not learn of the marriage until a fortnight (14 days) later.

For the next few months, Cranmer and the king worked on establishing legal procedures on how the monarch's marriage would be judged by his most senior clergy. Several drafts of the procedures have been preserved in letters written between the two. Once procedures were agreed upon, Cranmer opened court sessions on 10 May, inviting Henry and Catherine of Aragon to appear. Gardiner represented the king; Catherine did not appear or send a proxy. On 23 May Cranmer pronounced the judgement that Henry's marriage with Catherine was against the law of God. He even issued a threat of <a href="excommunication">excommunication</a> if Henry did not stay away from Catherine. Henry was now free to marry and, on 28 May, Cranmer validated Henry and Anne's marriage. On 1 June, Cranmer personally crowned and anointed Anne queen and delivered to her the <a href="Crown%20Jewels%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">sceptre and rod</a>. Pope <a href="Clement%20VII">Clement VII</a> was furious at this defiance, but he could not take decisive action as he was pressured by other monarchs to avoid an irreparable breach with England. However, on 9 July he provisionally excommunicated Henry and his advisers (which included Cranmer) unless he repudiated Anne by the end of September. Henry kept Anne as his wife and, on 7 September, Anne gave birth to <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth</a>. Cranmer <a href="Baptism">baptised</a> her immediately afterwards and acted as one of her godparents.

It is difficult to assess how Cranmer's theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days. There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus' pension that had previously been granted by Archbishop Warham. In June 1533, he was confronted with the difficult task of not only disciplining a reformer, but also seeing him burnt at the stake. <a href="John%20Frith">John Frith</a> was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the <a href="real%20presence">real presence</a>. Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success. Although he rejected Frith's radicalism, by 1534 he clearly signalled that he had broken with Rome and that he had set a new theological course. He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his <a href="ecclesiastical%20province">ecclesiastical province</a> with men who followed the new thinking such as <a href="Hugh%20Latimer">Hugh Latimer</a>. He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers to the disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain the link with Rome.

Cranmer was not immediately accepted by the bishops within his province. When he attempted a <a href="canonical%20visitation">canonical visitation</a>, he had to avoid locations where a resident conservative bishop might make an embarrassing personal challenge to his authority. In 1535, Cranmer had difficult encounters with several bishops, <a href="John%20Stokesley">John Stokesley</a>, <a href="John%20Longland">John Longland</a>, and Stephen Gardiner among others. They objected to Cranmer's power and title and argued that the <a href="Act%20of%20Supremacy">Act of Supremacy</a> did not define his role. This prompted <a href="Thomas%20Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</a>, the king's chief minister, to activate and to take the office of the <a href="vicegerent">vicegerent</a>, the deputy supreme head of ecclesiastical affairs. He created another set of institutions that gave a clear structure to the royal supremacy. Hence, the archbishop was eclipsed by Vicegerent Cromwell in regards to the king's spiritual jurisdiction. There is no evidence that Cranmer resented his position as junior partner. Although he was an exceptional scholar, he lacked the political ability to outface even clerical opponents. Those tasks were left to Cromwell.

On 29 January 1536, when Anne miscarried a son, the king began to reflect again on the biblical prohibitions that had haunted him during his marriage with Catherine of Aragon. Shortly after the miscarriage, the king started to take an interest in <a href="Jane%20Seymour">Jane Seymour</a>. By 24 April, he had commissioned Cromwell to prepare the case for a divorce. Unaware of these plans, Cranmer had continued to write letters to Cromwell on minor matters up to 22 April. Anne was sent to the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> on 2 May, and Cranmer was urgently summoned by Cromwell. On the very next day, Cranmer wrote a letter to the king expressing his doubts about the queen's guilt, highlighting his own esteem for Anne. After it was delivered, however, Cranmer was resigned to the fact that the end of Anne's marriage was inevitable. On 16 May, he saw Anne in the Tower and heard her confession and the following day, he pronounced the marriage null and void. Two days later, Anne was executed; Cranmer was one of the few who publicly mourned her death.

The vicegerency brought the pace of reforms under the control of the king. A balance was instituted between the conservatives and the reformers and this was seen in the "<a href="Ten%20Articles">Ten Articles</a>", the first attempt at defining the beliefs of the Henrician Church. The articles had a two-part structure. The first five articles showed the influence of the reformers by recognising only three of the <a href="Sacraments%20of%20the%20Catholic%20Church">former seven</a> <a href="sacraments">sacraments</a>: baptism, eucharist, and <a href="penance">penance</a>. The last five articles concerned the roles of <a href="Religious%20images">images</a>, <a href="Veneration">saints</a>, <a href="Ritual">rites</a> and ceremonies, and <a href="purgatory">purgatory</a>, and they reflected the views of the traditionalists. Two early drafts of the document have been preserved and show different teams of theologians at work. The competition between the conservatives and reformers is revealed in rival editorial corrections made by Cranmer and <a href="Cuthbert%20Tunstall">Cuthbert Tunstall</a>, the <a href="bishop%20of%20Durham">bishop of Durham</a>. The end product had something that pleased and annoyed both sides of the debate. By 11 July, Cranmer, Cromwell, and the <a href="Convocation%20of%20the%20English%20Clergy">Convocation</a>, the general assembly of the clergy, had subscribed to the "Ten Articles".

In the autumn of 1536, the north of England was convulsed in a series of uprisings collectively known as the <a href="Pilgrimage%20of%20Grace">Pilgrimage of Grace</a>, the most serious opposition to Henry's policies. Cromwell and Cranmer were the primary targets of the protesters' fury. Cromwell and the king worked furiously to quell the rebellion, while Cranmer kept a low profile. After it was clear that Henry's regime was safe, the government took the initiative to remedy the evident inadequacy of the "Ten Articles". The outcome after months of debate was "<a href="The%20Institution%20of%20a%20Christian%20Man">The Institution of a Christian Man</a>" informally known from the first issue as the Bishops' Book. The book was initially proposed in February 1537 in the first vicegerential synod, ordered by Cromwell, for the whole Church. Cromwell opened the proceedings, but as the synod progressed, Cranmer and Foxe took on the chairmanship and the co-ordination. Foxe did most of the final editing and the book was published in late September.

Even after publication, the book's status remained vague because the king had not given his full support to it. In a draft letter, Henry noted that he had not read the book, but supported its printing. His attention was most likely occupied by the pregnancy of Jane Seymour and the birth of the male heir, <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward</a>, that Henry had sought for so long. Jane died shortly after giving birth and her funeral was held on 12 November. That month Henry started to work on the Bishops' Book; his amendments were sent to Cranmer, Sampson, and others for comment. Cranmer's responses to the king were far more confrontational than his colleagues' and he wrote at much greater length. They reveal unambiguous statements supporting reformed theology such as justification by faith or "<a href="sola%20fide">sola fide</a>" (faith alone) and <a href="predestination">predestination</a>. However, his words did not convince the king. A new statement of faith would be delayed until 1543 with the publication of the King's Book.

In 1538, the king and Cromwell arranged with Lutheran princes to have detailed discussions on forming a political and religious alliance. Henry had been seeking a new embassy from the <a href="Schmalkaldic%20League">Schmalkaldic League</a> since summer 1537. The Lutherans were delighted by this and they sent a joint delegation from various German cities, including a colleague of Martin Luther, <a href="Friedrich%20Myconius">Friedrich Myconius</a>. The delegates arrived in England on 27 May 1538. After initial meetings with the king, Cromwell, and Cranmer, discussions on theological differences were transferred to <a href="Lambeth%20Palace">Lambeth Palace</a> under Cranmer's chairmanship. Progress on an agreement was slow partly due to Cromwell being too busy to help expedite the proceedings and partly due to the negotiating team on the English side, which was evenly balanced between conservatives and reformers. The talks dragged on through the summer with the Germans becoming weary despite the Archbishop's strenuous efforts. The negotiations, however, were fatally neutralised by an appointee of the king. Cranmer's colleague, Edward Foxe, who sat on Henry's <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>, had died earlier in the year. The king chose as his replacement Cranmer's conservative rival, Cuthbert Tunstall, who was told to stay near Henry to give advice. On 5 August, when the German delegates sent a letter to the king regarding three items that particularly worried them (compulsory clerical celibacy, the withholding of the chalice from the laity, and the maintenance of <a href="Sine%20populo">private masses</a> for the dead), Tunstall was able to intervene for the king and to influence the decision. The result was a thorough dismissal by the king of many of the Germans' chief concerns. Although Cranmer begged the Germans to continue with the negotiations using the argument "to consider the many thousands of souls in England" at stake, they left on 1 October having made no substantial achievements.

Continental reformer <a href="Philipp%20Melanchthon">Philipp Melanchthon</a> was aware that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell wrote a letter to the king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the <a href="Thomas%20Howard%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Duke of Norfolk</a> noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the "<a href="Six%20Articles%20%281539%29">Six Articles</a>". They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in <a href="Ford%20Palace">Ford Palace</a> in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and <a href="Nicholas%20Shaxton">Nicholas Shaxton</a> to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.
The setback for the reformers was short-lived. By September, Henry was displeased with the results of the Act and its promulgators; the ever-loyal Cranmer and Cromwell were back in favour. The king asked his archbishop to write a new preface for the <a href="Great%20Bible">Great Bible</a>, an English translation of the Bible that was first published in April 1539 under the direction of Cromwell. The preface was in the form of a sermon addressed to readers. As for Cromwell, he was delighted that his plan of a royal marriage between Henry and <a href="Anne%20of%20Cleves">Anne of Cleves</a>, the sister of a German prince was accepted by the king. In Cromwell's view, the marriage could potentially bring back contacts with the <a href="Schmalkaldic%20League">Schmalkaldic League</a>. Henry was dismayed with Anne when they first met on 1 January 1540 but married her reluctantly on 6 January in a ceremony officiated by Cranmer. However, the marriage ended in disaster as Henry decided shortly thereafter that he would request a royal divorce. This resulted in Henry being placed in an embarrassing position and Cromwell suffered the consequences. His old enemies, including the Duke of Norfolk, took advantage of the weakened Cromwell and he was arrested on 10 June. He immediately lost the support of all his friends, including Cranmer. However, as Cranmer had done for Anne Boleyn, he wrote a letter to the king defending the past work of Cromwell. Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves was quickly annulled on 9 July by the vice-gerential synod, now led by Cranmer and Gardiner.

Following the annulment, Cromwell was executed on 28 July. Cranmer now found himself in a politically prominent position, with no-one else to shoulder the burden. Throughout the rest of Henry's reign, he clung to Henry's authority. The king had total trust in him and in return, Cranmer could not conceal anything from the king. At the end of June 1541, Henry with his new wife, <a href="Catherine%20Howard">Catherine Howard</a>, left for his first visit to the north of England. Cranmer was left in London as a member of a council taking care of matters for the king in his absence. His colleagues were Lord Chancellor <a href="Thomas%20Audley%2C%201st%20Baron%20Audley%20of%20Walden">Thomas Audley</a> and <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset">Edward Seymour</a>, Earl of Hertford. This was Cranmer's first major piece of responsibility outside the Church. In October, while the king and queen were away, a reformer named <a href="John%20Lascelles">John Lascelles</a> revealed to Cranmer that Catherine engaged in extramarital affairs. Cranmer gave the information to Audley and Seymour and they decided to wait until Henry's return. Afraid of angering the king, Audley and Seymour suggested that Cranmer inform Henry. Cranmer slipped a message to Henry during mass on <a href="All%20Saints%20Day">All Saints Day</a>. An investigation revealed the truth of the marital indiscretions and Catherine was executed in February 1542.

In 1543, several conservative clergymen in Kent banded together to attack and denounce two reformers, <a href="Richard%20Turner%20%28reformer%29">Richard Turner</a> and <a href="John%20Bland%20%28reformer%29">John Bland</a>, before the <a href="Privy%20Council">Privy Council</a>. They prepared articles to present to the Council, but at the last moment, additional denunciations were added by Stephen Gardiner's nephew, <a href="Germain%20Gardiner">Germain Gardiner</a>. These new articles attacked Cranmer and listed his misdeeds back to 1541. This document and the actions that followed were the basis of the so-called <a href="Prebendaries%27%20Plot">Prebendaries' Plot</a>. The articles were delivered to the Council in London and were probably read on 22 April 1543. The king most likely saw the articles against Cranmer that night. The archbishop, however, appeared unaware that an attack on his person was made. His commissioners in Lambeth dealt specifically with Turner's case where he was acquitted, much to the fury of the conservatives.

While the plot against Cranmer was proceeding, the reformers were being attacked on other fronts. On 20 April, the Convocation reconvened to consider the revision of the Bishops' Book. Cranmer presided over the sub-committees, but the conservatives were able to overturn many reforming ideas, including justification by faith. On 5 May, the new revision called "<a href="A%20Necessary%20Doctrine%20and%20Erudition%20for%20any%20Christian%20Man">A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition for any Christian Man</a>" or the King's Book was released. Doctrinally, it was far more conservative than the Bishops' Book. On 10 May, the reformers received another blow. Parliament passed the Act for the Advancement of True Religion, which abolished "erroneous books" and restricted the reading of the Bible in English to those of noble status. From May to August, reformers were examined, forced to recant, or imprisoned.

For five months, Henry took no action on the accusations against his archbishop. The conspiracy was finally revealed to Cranmer by the king himself. According to Cranmer's secretary, <a href="Ralph%20Morice">Ralph Morice</a>, sometime in September 1543 the king showed Cranmer a paper summarising the accusations against him. An investigation was to be mounted and Cranmer was appointed chief investigator. Surprise raids were carried out, evidence gathered, and ringleaders identified. Typically, Cranmer put the clergymen involved in the conspiracy through immediate humiliation, but he eventually forgave them and continued to use their services. To show his trust in Cranmer, Henry gave Cranmer his personal ring. When the Privy Council arrested Cranmer at the end of November, the nobles were stymied by the symbol of the king's trust in him. Cranmer's victory ended with two second-rank leaders imprisoned and Germain Gardiner executed.
With the atmosphere in Cranmer's favour, he pursued quiet efforts to reform the Church, particularly the liturgy. On 27 May 1544 the first officially authorised vernacular service was published, the processional service of intercession known as the "<a href="Exhortation%20and%20Litany">Exhortation and Litany</a>". It survives today with minor modifications in the "Book of Common Prayer". The traditional <a href="litany">litany</a> uses <a href="invocation">invocation</a>s to saints, but Cranmer thoroughly reformed this aspect by providing no opportunity in the text for such <a href="veneration">veneration</a>. Additional reformers were elected to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20England">House of Commons</a> and new legislation was introduced to curb the effects of the Act of the Six Articles and the Act for the Advancement of True Religion.

In 1546, the conservatives in a coalition including Gardiner, the Duke of Norfolk, the Lord Chancellor <a href="Thomas%20Wriothesley%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Southampton">Wriothesley</a>, and the bishop of London, <a href="Edmund%20Bonner">Edmund Bonner</a>, made one last attempt to challenge the reformers. Several reformers with links to Cranmer were targeted. Some such as Lascelles were burnt at the stake. However, powerful reform-minded nobles Edward Seymour and <a href="John%20Dudley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Northumberland">John Dudley</a> returned to England during the summer from overseas and they were able to turn the tide against the conservatives. Two incidents in autumn tipped the balance. Gardiner was disgraced before the king when he refused to agree to exchange episcopal estates, and <a href="Henry%20Howard%2C%20Earl%20of%20Surrey">the son of the Duke of Norfolk</a> was charged with treason and executed. There is no evidence that Cranmer played any part in these political games, and there were no further plots as the king's health ebbed in his final months. Cranmer performed his final duties for the king on 28 January 1547 when he gave a reformed statement of faith while gripping Henry's hand instead of giving him his <a href="last%20rites">last rites</a>. Cranmer mourned Henry's death and it was later said that he demonstrated his grief by growing a beard. The beard was also a sign of his break with the past. Continental reformers grew beards to mark their rejection of the old Church and this significance of clerical beards was well understood in England. On 31 January, he was among the <a href="executor">executor</a>s of the king's final will that nominated Edward Seymour as <a href="Lord%20Protector">Lord Protector</a> and welcomed the boy king, <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a>.

Under the regency of Seymour, the reformers were now part of the establishment. A royal visitation of the provinces took place in August 1547 and each parish that was visited was instructed to obtain a copy of the "Homilies". This book consisted of twelve homilies of which four were written by Cranmer. His reassertion of the doctrine of justification by faith elicited a strong reaction from Gardiner. In the "Homily of Good Works annexed to Faith", Cranmer attacked <a href="Christian%20monasticism">monasticism</a> and the importance of various personal actions involved in liturgical recitations and ceremonies. Hence, he narrowed the range of good works that would be considered necessary and reinforced the primacy of faith. In each parish visited, injunctions were put in place that resolved to, "...eliminate any image which had any suspicion of devotion attached to it."

Cranmer's eucharistic views, which had already moved away from official Catholic doctrine, received another push from Continental reformers. Cranmer had been in contact with Martin Bucer since the time when initial contacts were made with the Schmalkaldic League. However, Cranmer and Bucer's relationship became ever closer due to Charles V's victory over the League at <a href="Battle%20of%20M%C3%BChlberg">Mühlberg</a>, which left England as the sole major nation that gave sanctuary to persecuted reformers. Cranmer wrote a letter to Bucer (now lost) with questions on eucharistic theology. In Bucer's reply dated 28 November 1547, he denied the corporeal real presence and condemned <a href="transubstantiation">transubstantiation</a> and the <a href="adoration">adoration</a> of the elements. The letter was delivered to Cranmer by two Italian reformed theologians, <a href="Pietro%20Martire%20Vermigli">Peter Martyr</a> and <a href="Bernardino%20Ochino">Bernardino Ochino</a> who were invited to take refuge in England. Martyr also brought with him an epistle written allegedly by <a href="John%20Chrysostom">John Chrysostom</a> (now regarded as a forgery), "Ad Caesarium Monachum", which appeared to provide <a href="patristic">patristic</a> support against the corporeal real presence. These documents were to influence Cranmer's thoughts on the eucharist.

In March 1549, the city of Strasbourg forced Martin Bucer and <a href="Paul%20Fagius">Paul Fagius</a> to leave. Cranmer immediately invited the men to come to England and promised that they would be placed in English universities. When they arrived on 25 April, Cranmer was especially delighted to meet Bucer face to face after eighteen years of correspondence. He needed these scholarly men to train a new generation of preachers as well as assist in the reform of liturgy and doctrine. Others who accepted his invitations include the Polish reformer, <a href="Jan%20%C5%81aski">Jan Łaski</a>, but Cranmer was unable to convince Osiander and Melanchthon to come to England.

As the use of English in worship services spread, the need for a complete uniform liturgy for the Church became evident. Initial meetings to start what would eventually become the "Book of Common Prayer" were held in the former <a href="Chertsey%20Abbey">abbey of Chertsey</a> and in <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a> in September 1548. The list of participants can only be partially reconstructed, but it is known that the members were balanced between conservatives and reformers. These meetings were followed by a debate on the Eucharist in the House of Lords which took place between 14 and 19 December. Cranmer publicly revealed in this debate that he had abandoned the doctrine of the corporeal real presence and believed that the Eucharistic presence was only spiritual. Parliament backed the publication of the Prayer Book after Christmas by passing the <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201549">Act of Uniformity 1549</a>; it then legalized clerical marriage.

It is difficult to ascertain how much of the Prayer Book is actually Cranmer's personal composition. Generations of liturgical scholars have been able to track down the sources that he used, including the <a href="Sarum%20Rite">Sarum Rite</a>, writings from <a href="Hermann%20of%20Wied">Hermann von Wied</a>, and several Lutheran sources including Osiander and <a href="Justus%20Jonas">Justus Jonas</a>. More problematic is determining how Cranmer worked on the book and with whom he worked. Despite the lack of knowledge of who might have helped him, however, he is given the credit for the editorship and the overall structure of the book.

The use of the new Prayer Book was made compulsory on 9 June 1549. This triggered a series of protests in <a href="Devon">Devon</a> and <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> where the English language was not yet in common usage, now known as the <a href="Prayer%20Book%20Rebellion">Prayer Book Rebellion</a>. By early July, the uprising had spread to other parts in the east of England. The rebels made a number of demands including the restoration of the Six Articles, the use of Latin for the mass with only the consecrated bread given to the laity, the restoration of prayers for souls in purgatory, and the rebuilding of abbeys. Cranmer wrote a strong response to these demands to the King in which he denounced the wickedness of the rebellion. On 21 July, Cranmer commandeered <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> where he vigorously defended the official Church line. A draft of his sermon, the only extant written sample of his preaching from his entire career, shows that he collaborated with Peter Martyr on dealing with the rebellion.

The Prayer Book Rebellion and other events had a negative effect on the <a href="Edward%20Seymour%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Somerset%23Council%20of%20Regency">Seymour regency</a>. The Privy Council became divided when a set of dissident Councillors banded together behind John Dudley in order to oust Seymour. Cranmer and two other Councillors, <a href="William%20Paget%2C%201st%20Baron%20Paget">William Paget</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Smith%20%28diplomat%29">Thomas Smith</a> initially rallied behind Seymour. However, after a flurry of letters passed between the two sides, a bloodless "coup d'état" resulted in the end of Seymour's Protectorship on 13 October 1549. Despite the support of religiously conservative politicians behind Dudley's coup, the reformers managed to maintain control of the new government and the English Reformation continued to consolidate gains. Seymour was initially imprisoned in the Tower, but he was shortly released on 6 February 1550 and returned to the Council. The archbishop was able to transfer his former chaplain, <a href="Nicholas%20Ridley%20%28martyr%29">Nicholas Ridley</a> from the minor <a href="see%20of%20Rochester">see of Rochester</a> to the <a href="diocese%20of%20London">diocese of London</a>, while <a href="John%20Ponet">John Ponet</a> took Ridley's former position. Incumbent conservatives were uprooted and replaced with reformers.
The first result of co-operation and consultation between Cranmer and Bucer was the Ordinal, the liturgy for the ordination of priests. This was missing in the first Prayer Book and was not published until 1550. Cranmer adopted Bucer's draft and created three services for commissioning a deacon, a priest, and a bishop. In the same year, Cranmer produced the "<a href="Defence%20of%20the%20True%20and%20Catholic%20Doctrine%20of%20the%20Sacrament%20of%20the%20Body%20and%20Blood%20of%20Christ">Defence of the True and Catholic Doctrine of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ</a>", a semi-official explanation of the eucharistic theology within the Prayer Book. It was the first full-length book to bear Cranmer's name on the title-page. The preface summarises his quarrel with Rome in a well-known passage where he compared "beads, pardons, pilgrimages, and such other like popery" with weeds, but the roots of the weeds were transubstantiation, the corporeal real presence, and the sacrificial nature of the mass.

Although Bucer assisted in the development of the English Reformation, he was still quite concerned about the speed of its progress. Both Bucer and Fagius had noticed that the 1549 Prayer Book was not a remarkable step forward, although Cranmer assured Bucer that it was only a first step and that its initial form was only temporary. However, by the winter 1550, Bucer was becoming disillusioned. Cranmer, however, made sure that he did not feel alienated and kept in close touch with him. This attention paid off during the <a href="vestments%20controversy">vestments controversy</a>. This incident was initiated by <a href="John%20Hooper%20%28bishop%29">John Hooper</a>, a follower of <a href="Heinrich%20Bullinger">Heinrich Bullinger</a> who had recently returned from <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>. Hooper was unhappy with Cranmer's Prayer Book and Ordinal and he particularly objected to the use of ceremonies and vestments. When the Privy Council selected him to be the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Gloucester">Bishop of Gloucester</a> on 15 May 1550, he laid down conditions that he would not wear the required vestments. He found an ally among the Continental reformers in Jan Łaski who had become a leader of the <a href="Dutch%20Church%2C%20Austin%20Friars">Stranger church</a> in London, a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees. His church's forms and practices had taken reforms much further than Cranmer would have liked. However, Bucer and Peter Martyr, while they sympathised with Hooper's position, supported Cranmer's arguments of timing and authority. Cranmer and Ridley stood their ground. This led to Hooper's imprisonment and he eventually gave in. He was consecrated on 8 March 1551 according to the Ordinal and he preached before the king in his episcopal garments. Cranmer's vision of reform through careful steps under the authority of the government was maintained.

Cranmer's role in politics was diminishing when on 16 October 1551 Seymour was arrested on charges of treason. In December he was put on trial and although acquitted of treason, he was judged guilty of <a href="felony">felony</a> and put to death on 22 January 1552. This was the beginning of the breach between Cranmer and Dudley. It was aggravated during the year by the gradual appropriation of ecclesiastical property by the regency. However, even throughout this political turmoil, Cranmer worked simultaneously on three major projects in his reform programme: the revision of <a href="canon%20law">canon law</a>, the revision of the Prayer Book, and the formation of a statement of doctrine.
The original Roman canon law that defined governance within the Church clearly needed revision following Henry's break with Rome. Several revision attempts were made throughout Henry's reign, but these initial projects were shelved as the speed of reform outpaced the time required to work on a revision. As the reformation stabilised, Cranmer formed a committee in December 1551 to restart the work. He recruited Peter Martyr to the committee and he also asked Łaski and Hooper to participate, demonstrating his usual ability to forgive past actions. Cranmer and Martyr realised that a successful enactment of a reformed ecclesiastical law-code in England would have international significance. Cranmer planned to draw together all the reformed churches of Europe under England's leadership to counter the <a href="Council%20of%20Trent">Council of Trent</a>, the Roman Catholic Church's response to the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>. In March 1552, Cranmer invited the foremost Continental reformers, Bullinger, <a href="John%20Calvin">John Calvin</a>, and Melanchthon to come to England and to participate in an ecumenical council. The response was disappointing: Melanchthon did not respond, Bullinger stated that neither of them could leave Germany as it was riven by war between the Emperor and the Lutheran princes, and while Calvin showed some enthusiasm, he said he was unable to come. Cranmer acknowledged Calvin and replied stating, "Meanwhile we will reform the English Church to the utmost of our ability and give our labour that both its doctrines and laws will be improved after the model of holy scripture." One partial manuscript of the project survived that was annotated with corrections and comments by Cranmer and Martyr. When the final version was presented to Parliament, the breach between Cranmer and Dudley was complete and the regent effectively killed the canon law bill in the House of Lords.

As in the first Prayer Book, the origins and participants in the work of its revision are obscure, but it was clear that Cranmer led the project and steered its development. It had begun as early as the end of 1549 when the Convocation of Canterbury met to discuss the matter. Late in 1550, the opinions of Martyr and Bucer were sought on how the liturgy might be improved and they significantly influenced the revision. The spiritual presence view was clarified by the use of entirely different words when the communicants are offered the bread and the wine. New <a href="rubrics">rubrics</a> noted that any kind of bread could be used and any bread or wine that remained could be used by the <a href="curate">curate</a>, thus disassociating the elements from any physical presence. The new book removed any possibility of prayers for the dead, as such prayers implied support for the doctrine of purgatory. The <a href="Act%20of%20Uniformity%201552">Act of Uniformity 1552</a>, which authorised the book's use, specified that it be exclusively used from 1 November. However, the final version was not officially published until nearly the last minute, due to Dudley's intervention. While travelling in the north of the country, he met the Scots reformer, <a href="John%20Knox">John Knox</a>, then based in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>. Impressed by his preaching, Dudley selected him to be a royal chaplain and brought him south to participate in the reform projects. In a sermon before the king, Knox attacked the practice of kneeling during communion. On 27 September 1552, the Privy Council stopped the printing of the new Prayer Book and told Cranmer to revise it. He responded with a long letter using the argument that it was for Parliament with the royal assent to decide any changes in the liturgy. On 22 October, the council decided to keep the liturgy as it is and add the so-called "<a href="Black%20Rubric">Black Rubric</a>", which explained that no adoration was intended when kneeling at communion.

The origins of the Statement that eventually became the "<a href="Forty-Two%20Articles">Forty-Two Articles</a>" are equally obscure. As early as December 1549, the archbishop was demanding from his bishops subscription to certain doctrinal articles. In 1551 Cranmer presented a version of a statement to the bishops, but its status remained ambiguous. Cranmer did not devote much effort into developing the articles, most likely due to work on the canon law revision. He became more interested once the hope for an ecumenical council began to fade. By September 1552, draft versions of the articles were being worked on by Cranmer and <a href="John%20Cheke">John Cheke</a>, his scholarly friend who was commissioned to translate them into Latin. When the "Forty-Two Articles" were finally published in May 1553, the title-page declared that the articles were agreed upon by the Convocation and were published by the authority of the king. This was not in fact the case and the mistake was likely caused by miscommunications between the archbishop and the Privy Council. Cranmer complained about this to the council, but the authorities responded by noting that the articles were developed during the time of the Convocation—hence evading a direct answer. The council gave Cranmer the unfortunate task of requiring subscription to the articles from the bishops, many of whom opposed them and pointed out the anomaly of the title-page. It was while Cranmer was carrying out this duty that events unfolded that would render the subscriptions futile.

<a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward VI</a> became seriously ill from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and the councillors were told that he did not have long to live. In May 1553, the council sent several letters to Continental reformers assuring them that Edward's health was improving. Among the letters was one addressed to Melanchthon inviting him to come to England to take up the <a href="Regius%20Professor%20of%20Divinity">Regius Chair</a> in Cambridge which was vacant since the death of Martin Bucer in February 1551. Both Henry VIII and Cranmer had previously failed to convince Melanchthon to come; this time the council made a serious effort by sending him an advance to cover his travel expenses. Cranmer sent a personal letter urging him to take the offer. Despite his plea, Melanchthon never made the voyage to England. While this effort to shore up the reformation was taking place, the council was working to convince several judges to put on the throne <a href="Lady%20Jane%20Grey">Lady Jane Grey</a>, Edward's cousin and a Protestant, instead of Mary, Henry and Catherine of Aragon's daughter and a Catholic. On 17 June 1553 the king made his will noting Jane would succeed him, contravening the <a href="Third%20Succession%20Act">Third Succession Act</a>. Cranmer tried to speak to Edward alone, but he was refused and his audience with Edward occurred in the presence of the councillors. Edward told him that he supported what he wrote in his will. Cranmer's decision to support Jane must have occurred before 19 June when royal orders were sent to convene the Convocation for the recognition of the new succession.

By mid-July, there were serious provincial revolts in Mary's favour and support for Jane in the council fell. As Mary was proclaimed queen, Dudley, Ridley, Cheke, and Jane's father, the <a href="Henry%20Grey%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Suffolk">Duke of Suffolk</a> were imprisoned. However, no action was taken against the archbishop. On 8 August he led Edward's funeral according to the rites of the Prayer Book. During these months, he advised others, including Peter Martyr, to flee England, but he himself chose to stay. Reformed bishops were removed from office and conservative clergy, such as Edmund Bonner, had their old positions restored. Cranmer did not go down without a fight. When rumours spread that he authorised the use of the mass in Canterbury Cathedral, he declared them to be false and said, "[A]ll the doctrine and religion, by our said sovereign lord king Edward VI is more pure and according to God's word, than any that hath been used in England these thousand years." Not surprisingly, the government regarded Cranmer's declaration as tantamount to sedition. He was ordered to stand before the council in the <a href="Star%20Chamber">Star Chamber</a> on 14 September and on that day he said his final goodbye to Martyr. Cranmer was sent straight to the Tower to join Hugh Latimer and Nicholas Ridley.

On 13 November 1553 Cranmer and four others were brought to trial for treason, found guilty, and condemned to death. Several enemies testified that Cranmer had encouraged heresy and had written heretical works.
Throughout February 1554 Jane Grey and other rebels were executed. It was now time to deal with the religious leaders of the reformation, and so on 8 March 1554 the Privy Council ordered Cranmer, Ridley, and Latimer to be transferred to <a href="Bocardo%20Prison">Bocardo prison</a> in Oxford to await a second trial for heresy. During this time Cranmer was able to smuggle out a letter to Martyr who had fled to Strasbourg, the last surviving document written in his own hand. He stated that the desperate situation of the church was proof that it will eventually be delivered and wrote, "I pray that God may grant that we may endure to the end!" Cranmer remained isolated in Bocardo prison for seventeen months before the trial started on 12 September 1555. Although it took place in England, the trial was under papal jurisdiction and the final verdict would come from Rome. Under interrogation, Cranmer admitted to every fact that was placed before him, but he denied any treachery, disobedience, or heresy. The trial of Latimer and Ridley started shortly after Cranmer's but their verdicts came almost immediately and they were burnt at the stake on 16 October. Cranmer was taken to a tower to watch the proceedings. On 4 December, Rome decided Cranmer's fate by <a href="Benefit%20of%20clergy">depriving him of the archbishopric</a> and giving permission to the secular authorities to carry out their sentence.

In his final days Cranmer's circumstances changed, which led to several <a href="recantation">recantation</a>s. On 11 December, Cranmer was taken out of Bocardo and placed in the house of the Dean of <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church</a>. This new environment was very different from that of his two years in prison. He was in an academic community and treated as a guest. Approached by a Dominican friar, <a href="Juan%20de%20Villagarc%C3%ADa">Juan de Villagarcía</a>, he debated the issues of papal supremacy and purgatory. In his first four recantations, produced between the end of January and mid-February, Cranmer submitted himself to the authority of the king and queen and recognised the pope as head of the church. On 14 February 1556, he was degraded from holy orders and returned to Bocardo. He had conceded very little and Edmund Bonner was not satisfied with these admissions. On 24 February a writ was issued to the mayor of Oxford and the date of Cranmer's execution was set for 7 March. Two days after the writ was issued, a fifth statement, the first which could be called a true recantation, was issued. Cranmer repudiated all <a href="Lutheranism">Lutheran</a> and <a href="Reformation%20in%20Switzerland">Zwinglian theology</a>, fully accepted Catholic theology including papal supremacy and transubstantiation, and stated that there was no salvation outside the Catholic Church. He announced his joy of returning to the Catholic faith, asked for and received sacramental <a href="absolution">absolution</a>, and participated in the mass. Cranmer's burning was postponed, and under normal practice of canon law he should have been absolved. Mary, however, decided that no further postponement was possible. His last recantation was issued on 18 March. It was a sign of a broken man, a sweeping confession of sin. Despite the stipulation in canon law that recanting heretics be reprieved, Mary was determined to make an example of Cranmer, arguing that "his iniquity and obstinacy was so great against God and your Grace that your clemency and mercy could have no place with him", and pressed ahead with his execution.

Cranmer was told that he would be able to make a final recantation but this time in public during a service at the <a href="University%20Church%20of%20St%20Mary%20the%20Virgin">University Church</a>. He wrote and submitted the speech in advance and it was published after his death. At the pulpit on the day of his execution, he opened with a prayer and an exhortation to obey the king and queen, but he ended his sermon totally unexpectedly, deviating from the prepared script. He renounced the recantations that he had written or signed with his own hand since his degradation and as such he stated his hand would be punished by being burnt first. He then said, "And as for the pope, I refuse him, as Christ's enemy, and <a href="Antichrist">Antichrist</a> with all his false doctrine." He was pulled from the pulpit and taken to where Latimer and Ridley had been burnt six months before. As the flames drew around him, he fulfilled his promise by placing his right hand into the heart of the fire while saying "that unworthy hand". His dying words were, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit ...; I see the heavens open and Jesus standing at the right hand of God."

The Marian government produced a pamphlet with all six recantations plus the text of the speech Cranmer was to have made in the University Church. His subsequent withdrawal of his recantations was not mentioned, though what actually happened soon became common knowledge, undermining the effectiveness of Marian propaganda. Similarly, the Protestant party had difficulty in making use of the event, given Cranmer's recantations. The <a href="Marian%20exiles">exiles</a>' propaganda concentrated on publishing various specimens of his writings. Eventually <a href="John%20Foxe">John Foxe</a> put Cranmer's story to effective use in 1559, and it features prominently in his "<a href="Acts%20and%20Monuments">Acts and Monuments</a>" when it was first printed in 1563.

Cranmer's family had been exiled to the Continent in 1539. It is not known exactly when they returned to England, but it was soon after the accession of Edward VI in 1547 that Cranmer publicly acknowledged their existence. Not much is known about the early years of the children. His daughter, Margaret, was likely born in the 1530s and his son, Thomas, came later, probably during the reign of Edward. Sometime around Mary's accession, Cranmer's wife, Margarete, escaped to Germany, while his son was entrusted to his brother, Edmund Cranmer, who took him too to the Continent. Margarete Cranmer eventually married Cranmer's favourite publisher, <a href="Edward%20Whitchurch">Edward Whitchurch</a>. The couple returned to England after Mary's reign and settled in <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a>. Whitchurch also negotiated for the marriage of Margaret to <a href="Thomas%20Norton">Thomas Norton</a>. Whitchurch died in 1562 and Margarete married for the third time to Bartholomew Scott. She died in the 1570s. Both of Cranmer's children died without issue and his line became extinct.

When <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a> came to power she restored the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>'s independence from Rome under the <a href="Elizabethan%20Religious%20Settlement">Elizabethan Religious Settlement</a>. The church that she re-established represented, in effect, a snapshot of the Edwardian Church from September 1552. Thus the Elizabethan Prayer Book was basically Cranmer's 1552 edition but without the "Black Rubric". In the <a href="Convocation%20of%201563">Convocation of 1563</a> the "Forty-Two Articles" which were never adopted by the Church were altered in the area of eucharistic doctrine to form the "Thirty-Nine Articles". Most of the exiles returned to England and resumed their careers in the Church. To some like <a href="Edmund%20Grindal">Edmund Grindal</a>, an Archbishop of Canterbury during Elizabeth's reign, Cranmer provided a shining example whose work should be upheld and extended.

Cranmer's greatest concerns were the maintenance of the royal supremacy and the diffusion of reformed theology and practice. Scholars note that he is best remembered for his contribution to the realms of language and of cultural identity. His prose helped to guide the development of the English language, and the "Book of Common Prayer" is a major contribution to English literature that influenced many lives in the Anglophone world. It guided Anglican worship for four hundred years.

Catholic biographers sometimes depict Cranmer as an unprincipled opportunist, a <a href="Nicodemite">Nicodemite</a>, and a tool of royal tyranny. For their part, hagiographic Protestant biographers sometimes overlook the times that Cranmer betrayed his own principles. Yet both sides can agree in seeing Cranmer as a committed scholar whose life showed the strengths and weaknesses of a very human and often under-appreciated reformer. The <a href="Anglican%20Communion">Anglican Communion</a> commemorates him as a Reformation Martyr on 21 March, the anniversary of his death.

The Shawshank Redemption

The Shawshank Redemption is a 1994 American <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama film</a> written and directed by <a href="Frank%20Darabont">Frank Darabont</a>, based on the 1982 <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> novella "<a href="Rita%20Hayworth%20and%20Shawshank%20Redemption">Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption</a>". It tells the story of banker Andy Dufresne (<a href="Tim%20Robbins">Tim Robbins</a>), who is sentenced to life in Shawshank State Penitentiary for the murder of his wife and her lover, despite his claims of innocence. Over the following two decades, he befriends a fellow prisoner, contraband smuggler Ellis "Red" Redding (<a href="Morgan%20Freeman">Morgan Freeman</a>), and becomes instrumental in a money laundering operation led by the <a href="prison%20warden">prison warden</a> Samuel Norton (<a href="Bob%20Gunton">Bob Gunton</a>). <a href="William%20Sadler%20%28actor%29">William Sadler</a>, <a href="Clancy%20Brown">Clancy Brown</a>, <a href="Gil%20Bellows">Gil Bellows</a>, and <a href="James%20Whitmore">James Whitmore</a> appear in supporting roles.

Darabont purchased the film rights to King's story in 1987, but development did not begin until five years later when he wrote the script over an eight-week period. Two weeks after submitting his script to the <a href="Castle%20Rock%20Entertainment">Castle Rock Entertainment</a> film studio, Darabont secured a $25 million budget to produce "The Shawshank Redemption", which started pre-production in January 1993. While the film is set in Maine, <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> took place from June to August 1993 almost entirely in <a href="Mansfield%2C%20Ohio">Mansfield, Ohio</a>, with the <a href="Ohio%20State%20Reformatory">Ohio State Reformatory</a> serving as the eponymous penitentiary. The project attracted many stars of the time for the lead roles including <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>, <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, and <a href="Kevin%20Costner">Kevin Costner</a>. <a href="Thomas%20Newman">Thomas Newman</a> provided the film's score.

While "The Shawshank Redemption" received positive reviews on its release, particularly for its story and the performances of Robbins and Freeman, it was a box office disappointment, earning only $16 million during its initial theatrical run. Many reasons were cited for its failure at the time, including competition from films such as "<a href="Pulp%20Fiction">Pulp Fiction</a>" and "<a href="Forrest%20Gump">Forrest Gump</a>", to the general unpopularity of prison films, lack of female characters, and even the title, which was considered to be confusing for audiences. Even so, it went on to receive multiple award nominations, including seven <a href="Academy%20Awards">Academy Award</a> nominations, and a theatrical re-release that, combined with international takings, increased the film's box office gross to $58.3 million.

Over 320,000 VHS copies were shipped throughout the United States, and based on its award nominations and word of mouth, it became one of the top rented films of 1995. The broadcast rights were acquired following the purchase of Castle Rock by the <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">Turner Broadcasting System</a>, and it was shown regularly on the <a href="TNT%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29">TNT</a> network starting in 1997, further increasing its popularity. It is now considered by many to be one of the greatest films of the 1990s. As of 2017, the film is still broadcast regularly, and is popular in several countries, with audience members and celebrities citing it as a source of inspiration, and naming the film as a favorite in various surveys. In 2015, the United States <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> selected the film for preservation in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a>, finding it "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

In 1947 <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and is sentenced to two <a href="Back-to-back%20life%20sentences">consecutive life sentences</a> at the Shawshank State Penitentiary. He is befriended by Ellis "Red" Redding, an inmate and prison <a href="contraband">contraband</a> smuggler serving a life sentence. Red procures a <a href="Geologist%27s%20hammer">rock hammer</a> and a large poster of <a href="Rita%20Hayworth">Rita Hayworth</a> for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly <a href="Prison%20rape">assaulted and raped</a> by "the Sisters" and their leader, Bogs.

In 1949, Andy overhears the captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being <a href="Inheritance%20tax">taxed on an inheritance</a> and offers to help him shelter the money legally. After an assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats and cripples Bogs, who is subsequently transferred to another prison; Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy begins managing financial matters for other prison staff, guards from other prisons, and the warden himself. He also begins writing weekly letters to the state legislature requesting funds to improve the prison's decaying library.

Brooks is <a href="parole">parole</a>d in 1954 after serving 50 years, but he cannot adjust to the outside world and eventually hangs himself. The legislature sends a library donation that includes a recording of "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>"; Andy plays <a href="Sull%27aria...che%20soave%20zeffiretto">an excerpt</a> over the public address system and is punished with <a href="solitary%20confinement">solitary confinement</a>. After his release from solitary, Andy explains that hope is what gets him through his time, a concept that Red dismisses. In 1963, Norton begins exploiting prison labor for public works, profiting by undercutting skilled labor costs and receiving <a href="Kickback%20%28bribery%29">bribes</a>. Andy <a href="money%20laundering">launders</a> the money using the alias "Randall Stephens".

Tommy Williams is incarcerated for burglary in 1965. Andy and Red befriend him, and Andy helps him pass his <a href="General%20Educational%20Development">GED</a> exam. A year later, Tommy reveals to Red and Andy that his cellmate at another prison had claimed responsibility for the murders for which Andy was convicted. Andy approaches Norton with this information, but Norton refuses to listen and sends him back to solitary confinement when he mentions the money laundering. Norton has Hadley murder Tommy under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy attempts to discontinue the laundering but relents after Norton threatens to destroy the library, remove Andy's protection from the guards, and move him to worse conditions. Andy is released from solitary confinement after two months, and he tells a skeptical Red that he dreams of living in <a href="Zihuatanejo">Zihuatanejo</a>, a Mexican coastal town. Andy also tells him of a specific hayfield near <a href="Buxton%2C%20Maine">Buxton</a>, asking Red to retrieve a package that Andy buried there. Red worries about Andy's well-being, especially when he learns Andy asked a fellow inmate for of rope.

At the next day's <a href="Roll%20call%20%28policing%29">roll call</a>, the guards find Andy's cell empty. An irate Norton throws a rock at a poster of <a href="Raquel%20Welch">Raquel Welch</a> hanging on the cell wall, revealing a tunnel that Andy dug with his rock hammer over the last 19 years. The previous night, Andy used the rope to escape through the tunnel and prison sewage pipe, taking Norton's suit, shoes, and <a href="ledger">ledger</a>, containing proof of the money laundering. While guards search for him, Andy poses as Randall Stephens, withdraws the laundered money from several banks, and mails the ledger and other evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper. State police arrive at Shawshank and take Hadley into custody, while Norton commits suicide to avoid arrest.

After serving 40 years, Red is finally paroled. He struggles to adapt to life outside prison and fears that he never will. Remembering his promise to Andy, he visits Buxton and finds a cache containing money and a letter asking him to come to Zihuatanejo. Red violates his parole by traveling to <a href="Fort%20Hancock%2C%20Texas">Fort Hancock, Texas</a>, and crossing the border into Mexico, admitting that he finally feels hope. He finds Andy on a beach in Zihuatanejo, and the two friends are happily reunited.


The cast also includes: <a href="Mark%20Rolston">Mark Rolston</a> as Bogs Diamond, the head of "The Sisters" gang and a prison rapist; <a href="Jeffrey%20DeMunn">Jeffrey DeMunn</a> as the prosecuting attorney in Dufresne's trial; <a href="Alfonso%20Freeman">Alfonso Freeman</a> as Fresh Fish Con; <a href="Ned%20Bellamy">Ned Bellamy</a> and <a href="Don%20McManus">Don McManus</a> as, respectively, prison guards Youngblood and Wiley; and Dion Anderson as Head Bull Haig. Renee Blaine portrays Andy's wife, and Scott Mann portrays her golf-instructor lover Glenn Quentin. Frank Medrano plays Fat Ass, one of Andy's fellow new inmates who is beaten to death by Hadley, and <a href="Bill%20Bolender">Bill Bolender</a> plays Elmo Blatch, a convict who may actually be responsible for the crimes of which Andy is accused. James Kisicki portrays a bank manager.

The film has been interpreted as being grounded in <a href="Christian%20mysticism">Christian mysticism</a>. Andy is offered as a messianic, Christ-like figure, with Red describing him early in the film as having an aura that engulfs and protects him from Shawshank. The scene in which Andy and several inmates tar the prison roof can be seen as a recreation of the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a>, with Andy obtaining beer/wine for the twelve inmates/disciples as Freeman describes them as the "lords of all creation" invoking Jesus' blessing. Director <a href="Frank%20Darabont">Frank Darabont</a> responded that this was not his deliberate intention, but he wanted people to find their own meaning in the film. The discovery of "The Marriage of Figaro" record is described in the screenplay as akin to finding the <a href="Holy%20Grail">Holy Grail</a>, bringing the prisoners to a halt, and causing the sick to rise up in their beds.

Early in the film, Warden Norton quotes Jesus Christ to describe himself to Andy, saying, "I am the light of the world", declaring himself Andy's savior. But this description can also reference Lucifer, the bearer of light. Indeed, the warden does not enforce the general rule of law, but chooses to enforce his own rules and punishments as he sees fit, becoming a law unto himself, like the behavior of Satan. The warden has also been compared to former United States President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>. Norton's appearance and public addresses can be seen to mirror Nixon's. Similarly, Norton projects an image of a Holy man, speaking down sanctimoniously to the servile masses while running corrupt scams, like those which made Nixon infamous.
Zihuatanejo has been interpreted as an <a href="Analogue%20%28literature%29">analogue</a> for heaven or paradise. In the film, Andy describes it as a place with no memory, offering absolution from his sins by forgetting about them or allowing them to be washed away by the Pacific Ocean, whose name means "peace". The possibility of escaping to Zihuatanejo is only raised after Andy admits that he feels responsible for his wife's death. Similarly, Red's freedom is only earned once he accepts he cannot save himself or atone for his sins. Freeman has described Red's story as one of salvation as he is not innocent of his crimes, unlike Andy who finds redemption. While some Christian viewers interpret Zihuatanejo as heaven, it can also be interpreted as a <a href="Philosophy%20of%20Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Nietzschean</a> form of guiltlessness achieved outside traditional notions of good and evil, where the amnesia offered is the destruction rather than forgiveness of sin, meaning Andy's aim is secular and atheistic. Just as Andy can be interpreted as a Christ-like figure, he can be seen as a <a href="Thus%20Spoke%20Zarathustra">Zarathustra</a>-like prophet offering escape through education and the experience of freedom. Ebert argued that "The Shawshank Redemption" is an allegory for maintaining one's feeling of self-worth when placed in a hopeless position. Andy's integrity is an important theme in the story line, especially in prison, where integrity is lacking.

Robbins himself believes that the concept of Zihuatanejo resonates with audiences because it represents a form of escape that can be achieved after surviving for many years within whatever "jail" someone finds themselves, from a bad relationship, job, or environment. Robbins said that it is important that such a place exists for us. Isaac M. Morehouse suggests that the film provides a great illustration of how characters can be free, even in prison, or unfree, even in freedom, based on their outlooks on life. Philosopher <a href="Jean-Paul%20Sartre">Jean-Paul Sartre</a> described freedom as an ongoing project that requires attention and resilience, without which a person begins to be defined by others or institutions, mirroring Red's belief that inmates become dependent on the prison to define their lives. Andy displays resilience through rebellion, by playing music over the prison loudspeaker, and refusing to continue with the money laundering scam.

Many elements can be considered as tributes to the power of cinema. In the prison theater, the inmates watch the film "<a href="Gilda">Gilda</a>" (1946), but this scene was originally intended to feature "<a href="The%20Lost%20Weekend%20%28film%29">The Lost Weekend</a>" (1945). The interchangeability of the films used in the prison theater suggests that it is the cinematic experience and not the subject which is key to the scene, allowing the men to escape the reality of their situation. Immediately following this scene, Andy is assaulted by the Sisters in the projector room and uses a <a href="film%20reel">film reel</a> to help fight them off. Then in the end of the film, Andy passes through a hole in his cell hidden by a movie poster to escape both his cell and ultimately Shawshank.

Andy's and Red's relationship has been described as a non-sexual story between two men, that few other films offer, where the friendship is not built on conducting a caper, car chases, or developing a relationship with women. Philosopher Alexander Hooke argued that Andy's and Red's true freedom is their friendship, being able to share joy and humor with each other.

Darabont first collaborated with author <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> in 1983 on the short film adaptation of "<a href="The%20Woman%20in%20the%20Room">The Woman in the Room</a>", buying the rights from him for $1 – a <a href="Dollar%20Baby">Dollar Deal</a> that King used to help new directors build a résumé by adapting his short stories. After receiving his first screenwriting credit in 1987 for "", Darabont returned to King with $5,000 to purchase the rights to adapt "<a href="Rita%20Hayworth%20and%20Shawshank%20Redemption">Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption</a>", a 96-page novella from King's 1982 collection "<a href="Different%20Seasons">Different Seasons</a>", written to explore genres other than the horror stories for which he was commonly known. Although King did not understand how the story, largely focused on Red contemplating his fellow prisoner Andy, could be turned into a feature film, Darabont believed it was "obvious".

Five years later, Darabont wrote the script over an eight-week period. He expanded on elements of King's story. Brooks, who in the novella is a minor character who dies in a retirement home, became a tragic character who eventually hanged himself. Tommy, who in the novella trades his evidence exonerating Andy for transfer to a nicer prison, in the screenplay is murdered on the orders of Warden Norton, who is a composite of several warden characters in King's story. Darabont opted to create a single warden character to serve as the primary antagonist. Among his inspirations, Darabont listed the works of director <a href="Frank%20Capra">Frank Capra</a>, including "<a href="Mr.%20Smith%20Goes%20to%20Washington">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a>" (1939) and "<a href="It%27s%20a%20Wonderful%20Life">It's a Wonderful Life</a>" (1946), describing them as <a href="tall%20tale">tall tale</a>s; Darabont likened "The Shawshank Redemption" to a tall tale more than a prison movie. He also cited "<a href="Goodfellas">Goodfellas</a>" (1990) as an inspiration on the use of dialogue to illustrate the passage of time in the script. King never cashed the $5,000 cheque from Darabont for the rights to "The Shawshank Redemption"; he later framed it and returned it to Darabont accompanied by a note which read: "In case you ever need bail money. Love, Steve."

At the time, prison-based films were not considered likely box office successes, but Darabont's script was read by then-<a href="Castle%20Rock%20Entertainment">Castle Rock Entertainment</a> producer Liz Glotzer, whose interest in prison stories, and reaction to the script, led her to threaten to quit if Castle Rock did not produce "The Shawshank Redemption". Director and Castle Rock co-founder <a href="Rob%20Reiner">Rob Reiner</a> also liked the script. He offered Darabont between $2.4 million and $3 million to allow him to direct it himself. Reiner, who had previously adapted King's 1982 novella "<a href="The%20Body%20%28novella%29">The Body</a>" into the 1986 film "<a href="Stand%20by%20Me%20%28film%29">Stand by Me</a>", planned to cast <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> as Andy and <a href="Harrison%20Ford">Harrison Ford</a> as Red.

Castle Rock offered to finance any other film Darabont wanted to develop. Darabont seriously considered the offer, citing growing up poor in Los Angeles, believing it would elevate his standing in the industry, and that Castle Rock could have contractually fired him and given the film to Reiner anyway. But, he chose to remain the director, saying in a 2014 "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" interview, "you can continue to defer your dreams in exchange for money and, you know, die without ever having done the thing you set out to do". Reiner served as Darabont's mentor on the project instead. Within two weeks of showing the script to Castle Rock, Darabont had a $25 million budget to make his film (taking a $750,000 screenwriting and directing salary plus a percentage of the net profits), and pre-production began in January 1993.

Freeman was cast at the suggestion of producer Liz Glotzer, who ignored the novella's character description of a white Irishman, nicknamed "Red". Freeman's character alludes to the choice when queried by Andy on why he is called Red, replying "Maybe it's because I'm Irish." Freeman opted not to research his role, saying "acting the part of someone who's incarcerated doesn't require any specific knowledge of incarceration ... because men don't change. Once you're in that situation, you just toe whatever line you have to toe."

Darabont looked initially at some of his favorite actors like <a href="Gene%20Hackman">Gene Hackman</a> and <a href="Robert%20Duvall">Robert Duvall</a> for the role of Andy Dufresne, but they were unavailable; <a href="Clint%20Eastwood">Clint Eastwood</a> and <a href="Paul%20Newman">Paul Newman</a> were also considered. Tom Cruise, <a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>, and <a href="Kevin%20Costner">Kevin Costner</a> were offered, and passed on the role —Hanks due to his starring role in "<a href="Forrest%20Gump">Forrest Gump</a>", and Costner because he had the lead in "<a href="Waterworld">Waterworld</a>". <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a>, <a href="Nicolas%20Cage">Nicolas Cage</a>, and <a href="Charlie%20Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a> were also considered for the role at different stages. Cruise attended table readings of the script, but declined to work for the inexperienced Darabont. Darabont said he cast Robbins after seeing his performance in the 1990 psychological horror "<a href="Jacob%27s%20Ladder%20%281990%20film%29">Jacob's Ladder</a>". When Robbins was cast, he insisted that Darabont use experienced cinematographer <a href="Roger%20Deakins">Roger Deakins</a>, who had worked with him on "<a href="The%20Hudsucker%20Proxy">The Hudsucker Proxy</a>". To prepare for the role, Robbins observed caged animals at a zoo, spent an afternoon in solitary confinement, spoke with prisoners and guards, and had his arms and legs shackled for a few hours.

Cast initially as young convict Tommy, <a href="Brad%20Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> dropped out following his success in "<a href="Thelma%20%26amp%3B%20Louise">Thelma & Louise</a>" (the role went to a debuting Gil Bellows); <a href="James%20Gandolfini">James Gandolfini</a> passed on portraying prison rapist Bogs. Bob Gunton was filming "<a href="Demolition%20Man%20%28film%29">Demolition Man</a>" (1993) when he went to audition for the role of Warden Norton. To convince the studio that Gunton was right for the part, Darabont and producer <a href="Niki%20Marvin">Niki Marvin</a> arranged for him to record a screen test on a day off from "Demolition Man". They had a wig made for him as his head was shaved for his "Demolition Man" role. Gunton wanted to portray Norton with hair as this could then be grayed to convey his on-screen aging as the film progressed. Gunton performed his screen test with Robbins, which was filmed by Deakins. After being confirmed for the role, he used the wig in the film's early scenes until his hair re-grew. Gunton said that Marvin and Darabont saw that he understood the character which went in his favor, as did the fact his height was similar to Robbins' allowing Andy to believably use the warden's suit.

Portraying the head guard Byron Hadley, Clancy Brown was given the opportunity to speak with former guards by the production's liaison officer, but declined believing it would not be a good thing to say that his brutal character was in any way inspired by Ohio state correctional officers. William Sadler, who portrays Heywood, said that Darabont had approached him in 1989 on the set of the "<a href="Tales%20from%20the%20Crypt%20%28TV%20series%29">Tales from the Crypt</a>" television series where he was a writer, about starring in the adaptation he was intending to make. Freeman's son Alfonso has a cameo as a young Red in <a href="mug%20shot">mug shot</a> photos, and as a prisoner shouting "fresh fish" as Andy arrives at Shawshank. Among the extras used in the film were the former warden and former inmates of the Reformatory, and active guards from a nearby incarceration facility. The novella's original title attracted several people to audition for the non-existent role of Rita Hayworth, including a man in <a href="Drag%20queen">drag clothing</a>.

On a $25 million budget, <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> took place over three months between June and August 1993. Filming regularly required up to 18-hour workdays, six days a week. Freeman described filming as tense, saying, "Most of the time, the tension was between the cast and director. I remember having a bad moment with the director, had a few of those." Freeman referred to Darabont's requiring multiple takes of scenes which he considered had no discernible differences. For example, the scene where Andy first approaches Red to procure a rock hammer took nine hours to film, and featured Freeman throwing and catching a baseball with another inmate throughout it. The number of takes that were shot resulted in Freeman turning up to filming the following day with his arm in a sling. Freeman sometimes simply refused to do the additional takes. Robbins said that the long days were difficult. Darabont felt that making the film taught him a lot, "A director really needs to have an internal barometer to measure what any given actor needs." He found his most frequent struggles were with Deakins. Darabont favored more scenic shots, while Deakins felt that not showing the outside of the prison added a sense of claustrophobia, and it meant that when a wide scenic shot was used, it had more impact.

Marvin spent five months scouting prisons across the United States and Canada, looking for a site that had a timeless aesthetic, and was completely abandoned, hoping to avoid the complexity of filming the required footage, for hours each day, in an active prison with the security difficulties that would entail. Marvin eventually chose the <a href="Ohio%20State%20Reformatory">Ohio State Reformatory</a> in <a href="Mansfield%2C%20Ohio">Mansfield, Ohio</a> to serve as the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in Maine, citing its Gothic-style stone and brick buildings. After nearly a century of use, the facility had been closed three years earlier on New Year's Eve, 1990, due to inhumane living conditions.

The 15-acre reformatory, housing its own power plant and farm, was partially torn down shortly after filming was completed, leaving the main administration building and two cell blocks. Several of the interior shots of the specialized prison facilities, such as the admittance rooms and the warden's office, were shot in the reformatory. The interior of the boarding room used by Brooks and Red was in the administration building; exterior shots of the boarding house were taken elsewhere. Internal scenes in the prison cellblocks were filmed on a soundstage built inside a nearby shuttered <a href="Westinghouse%20Electric%20Corporation">Westinghouse Electric</a> factory. Since Darabont wanted the inmates' cells to face each other, almost all the cellblock scenes were shot on a purpose-built <a href="Set%20construction">set</a> housed in the Westinghouse factory except for the scene featuring Elmo Blatch's admission of guilt for the crimes for which Andy was convicted. It was filmed in one of the actual prison's more confined cells. Scenes were also filmed in Mansfield, as well as neighboring <a href="Ashland%2C%20Ohio">Ashland, Ohio</a>. The <a href="Shawshank%20tree">oak tree</a> under which Andy buries his letter to Red was located near <a href="Malabar%20Farm%20State%20Park">Malabar Farm State Park</a>, in <a href="Lucas%2C%20Ohio">Lucas, Ohio</a>; it was destroyed by winds in 2016.
Just as a prison in Ohio stood in for a fictional one in Maine, the beach scene showing Andy and Red's reunion in Zihuatanejo, Mexico, was actually shot in the Caribbean on the island of <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Croix</a>, one of the <a href="U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a>. The beach at 'Zihuatanejo' is the <a href="Sandy%20Point%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Sandy Point National Wildlife Refuge</a>, a protected area for <a href="leatherback%20sea%20turtle">leatherback sea turtle</a>s. Scenes shot in <a href="Upper%20Sandusky%2C%20Ohio">Upper Sandusky</a> included the prison <a href="wood%20working">wood shop</a> scene where Red and his fellow inmates hear "The Marriage of Figaro" (the woodshop is now called the Shawshank Woodshop), and the opening court scene which was shot at the <a href="Wyandot%20County%2C%20Ohio">Wyandot County</a> Courthouse. Other shooting locations included <a href="Malabar%20Farm%20State%20Park">Pugh Cabin</a> in Malabar Farm State Park, where Andy sits outside as his wife engages in an affair, <a href="Butler%2C%20Ohio">Butler, Ohio</a> which stood in for Buxton, Maine, and The Bissman Building in Mansfield, which served as the hotel where Brooks stayed following his release.

While the film portrays Andy escaping to freedom through a sewer pipe described as a "river of shit", Robbins crawls through a mixture of water, chocolate syrup, and sawdust. The stream into which Robbins emerges was actually certified toxic by a chemist according to production designer <a href="Terence%20Marsh">Terence Marsh</a>. Of the scene, Robbins said, "when you're doing a film, you want to be a good soldier—you don't want to be the one that gets in the way. So you will do things as an actor that are compromising to your physical health and safety." As for the scene where Andy rebelliously plays music over the prison announcement system, it was Robbins' idea for Andy to turn the music up and not shut it off. While in the finished film the inmates watch Rita Hayworth in "Gilda" (1946), they were originally intended to be watching <a href="Billy%20Wilder">Billy Wilder</a>'s "The Lost Weekend" (1945), a film about the dangers of alcohol. As the footage was too costly to procure from <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, producer Niki Marvin approached "The Shawshank Redemption"s domestic distribution rights-holder <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>, who offered a list of lower-priced titles, one of which was "Gilda".
The final cut of the theatrically released film runs for 142 minutes, and was dedicated to Allen Greene, Darabont's former agent who died during filming from <a href="HIV/AIDS">AIDS</a>. The film's first edit ran for nearly two and a half hours, which Glotzer considered "long", and several scenes were cut including a longer sequence of Red adjusting to life post incarceration; Darabont said that in test screenings the audience seemed to be getting impatient with the scene as they were already convinced that Red would not make it. Another scene cut for time showed a prison guard investigating Andy's escape tunnel; it was thought this slowed down the action. The film originally had a <a href="cold%20open">cold open</a> that played out Andy's crime, with his trial playing throughout the opening credits, but these scenes were edited together to create a more "punchy" opening. One scripted scene, which Darabont described as his best work, was left unfilmed because of the shooting schedule. In the scene, a dreaming Red is sucked into the poster of Rita Hayworth to find himself alone and insignificant on the Pacific shore, saying "I am terrified, there is no way home." Darabont said that he regretted being unable to capture the scene.

In Darabont's original vision for the end of the film Red is seen riding a bus towards the Mexican border, leaving his fate ambiguous. Glotzer insisted on including the scene of Red and Andy reuniting in Zihuatanejo. She said Darabont felt this was a "commercial, sappy" ending, but Glotzer wanted the audience to see them together. Castle Rock agreed to finance filming for the scene without requiring its inclusion, guaranteeing Darabont the final decision. The scene originally featured a longer reunion in which Andy and Red recited dialogue from their first meeting, but Darabont said it had a "golly-gee-ain't-we-cute" quality and excised it. The beach reunion was test audiences' favorite scene; both Freeman and Robbins felt it provided the necessary closure. Darabont agreed to include the scene after seeing the test audience reactions, saying: "I think it's a magical and uplifting place for our characters to arrive at the end of their long saga..."

The film's score was composed by <a href="Thomas%20Newman">Thomas Newman</a>. He felt that it already elicited such strong emotions without music that he found it difficult to compose one that would elevate scenes without distracting from them. The piece, "Shawshank Redemption", plays during Andy's escape from Shawshank and originally had a three-note motif, but Darabont felt it had too much of a "triumphal flourish" and asked that it be toned down to a single-note motif. "So Was Red", played following Red's release from prison, and leading to his discovery of Andy's cache, became one of Newman's favorite pieces. The piece was initially written for a solo oboe, until Newman reluctantly agreed to add harmonica—a reference to the harmonica Red receives from Andy to continue his message of hope. According to Darabont, harmonica player <a href="Tommy%20Morgan">Tommy Morgan</a> "casually delivered something dead-on perfect on the first take", and this is heard in the finished film. Newman's score was so successful that excerpts from it were used in movie trailers for years afterwards.

Leading up to its release, the film was <a href="Test%20screening">test screened</a> with the public. These were described as "through the roof", and Glotzer said they were some of the best she had seen. It was decided to mostly omit Stephen King's name from any advertising, as the studio wanted to attract a "more prestigious audience" who might reject a film from a writer known mostly for <a href="Pulp%20magazine">pulp fiction</a> works like "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28novel%29">The Shining</a>" and "<a href="Cujo">Cujo</a>".

Following early September premieres at the <a href="Renaissance%20Theatre%20%28Mansfield%2C%20Ohio%29">Renaissance Theatre</a> in Mansfield, and the <a href="Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">Toronto International Film Festival</a>, "The Shawshank Redemption" began a limited North American release on September 23, 1994. During its opening weekend, the film earned $727,000 from 33 theaters—an average of $22,040 per theater. Following a Hollywood tradition of visiting different theaters on opening night to see the audiences view their film live, Darabont and Glotzer went to the <a href="Cinerama%20Dome">Cinerama Dome</a>, but found no one there. Glotzer claimed that the pair actually sold two tickets outside the theater with the promise that if the buyers did not like the film, they could ask Castle Rock for a refund. While critics praised the film, Glotzer believed that a lackluster review from the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" pushed crowds away. It received a wide release on October 14, 1994, expanding to a total of 944 theaters to earn $2.4 million—an average of $2,545 per theater—finishing as the number nine film of the weekend, behind sex-comedy "<a href="Exit%20to%20Eden%20%28film%29">Exit to Eden</a>" ($3 million), and just ahead of the historical drama "<a href="Quiz%20Show%20%28film%29">Quiz Show</a>" ($2.1 million), which was in its fifth week at the cinemas. "The Shawshank Redemption" closed in late November 1994, after 10 weeks with an approximate total gross of $16 million. It was considered a <a href="box%20office%20bomb">box office bomb</a>, failing to recoup its $25 million budget, not including marketing costs and the cinema exhibitors' cuts.

The film was also competing with "<a href="Pulp%20Fiction">Pulp Fiction</a>" ($108 million), which also premiered October 14 following its <a href="Palme%20d%27Or">Palme d'Or</a> award win, and "Forrest Gump" ($330 million) which was in the middle of a successful 42-week theatrical run. Both films would become quotable cultural phenomena. A general audience trend towards action films starring the likes of <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a> and <a href="Arnold%20Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> was also considered to work against the commercial success of "The Shawshank Redemption". Freeman blamed the title, saying it was unmemorable, while Robbins recalled fans asking: "What was that "Shinkshonk Reduction" thing?". Several alternative titles had been posited before the release due to concerns that it was not a marketable title. The low box office was also blamed on a lack of female characters to broaden the audience demographic, and the general unpopularity of prison films.

After being nominated for several Oscars in early 1995, the film was re-released between February and March. In total, the film made about $28.3 million in North American theaters, and about $30 million from other markets for a worldwide total of $58.3 million. In the United States, it became the 51st-highest-grossing film of 1994, and the 21st-highest grossing <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system">R-rated</a> film of 1994.

Despite its disappointing box-office returns, in what was then considered a risky move, <a href="Warner%20Home%20Video">Warner Home Video</a> shipped 320,000 rental video copies throughout the United States in 1995. It went on to become one of the top rented films of the year. Positive recommendations and repeat customer viewings, and being well-received by both male and female audiences, were considered key to the film's rental success.

<a href="Ted%20Turner">Ted Turner</a>'s <a href="Turner%20Broadcasting%20System">Turner Broadcasting System</a> had acquired Castle Rock in 1993, which enabled his TV channel, <a href="TNT%20%28U.S.%20TV%20network%29">TNT</a>, to obtain the cable-broadcast rights to the film. According to Glotzer, because of the low box office numbers, TNT could air the film at a very low cost, but still charge premium advertising rates. The film began airing regularly on the network in June 1997. TV airings of the film accrued record-breaking numbers, and its repeated broadcast was considered essential to turning the film into a cultural phenomenon after its poor box office performance. Darabont felt the turning point for the film's success was the Academy Award nominations, saying "nobody had heard of the movie, and that year on the Oscar broadcast, they were mentioning this movie seven times". In 1996, the rights to "The Shawshank Redemption" were passed to <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a>, following the merger of its parent company <a href="Time%20Warner">Time Warner</a> with the Turner Broadcasting System.

By 2013, "The Shawshank Redemption" had aired on fifteen basic cable networks, and in that year occupied 151 hours of airtime, rivaling "<a href="Scarface%20%281983%20film%29">Scarface</a>" (1983), and behind only "<a href="Mrs.%20Doubtfire">Mrs. Doubtfire</a>" (1993). It was in the top 15 percent of movies among adults between the ages of 18 and 49 on the <a href="Spike%20%28TV%20channel%29">Spike</a>, <a href="Up%20%28TV%20channel%29">Up</a>, <a href="SundanceTV">SundanceTV</a>, and <a href="Lifetime%20%28TV%20network%29">Lifetime</a> channels. Despite its mainly male cast it was the most watched movie on the female-targeted <a href="Oprah%20Winfrey%20Network%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">OWN network</a>. In a 2014 "<a href="Wall%20Street%20Journal">Wall Street Journal</a>" article, it was estimated that based on the margins studios take from box office returns, home media sales, and television licensing, "The Shawshank Redemption" had made $100 million. Jeff Baker, then-executive vice president and general manager of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, said that the home video sales had earned about $80 million. While Warner Bros. does not report what it earns in licensing the film for TV, in 2014 current and former executives at the studio confirmed that it was one of the highest valued assets in Warner Bros. $1.5 billion library. That same year, Gunton said that by its tenth anniversary in 2004, he was still earning six-figure <a href="Residual%20%28entertainment%20industry%29">residual payments</a>, and was still earning a "substantial income" from it, which was considered unusual so many years after its release.

"The Shawshank Redemption" opened to generally positive reviews. Some reviewers compared the film to other well-received prison dramas, including: "<a href="Birdman%20of%20Alcatraz%20%28film%29">Birdman of Alcatraz</a>", "<a href="One%20Flew%20Over%20the%20Cuckoo%27s%20Nest%20%28film%29">One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</a>", "<a href="Cool%20Hand%20Luke">Cool Hand Luke</a>", and "<a href="Riot%20in%20Cell%20Block%2011">Riot in Cell Block 11</a>". <a href="Gene%20Siskel">Gene Siskel</a> said that like "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest", "The Shawshank Redemption" is an inspirational drama about overcoming overbearing authority.

"<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>"s <a href="Owen%20Gleiberman">Owen Gleiberman</a> said that Freeman makes the Red character feel genuine and "lived-in". <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" said that Freeman was quietly impressive, but lamented that Red's role in the film had limited range, restricted to observing Andy. She considered Freeman's commanding performance made him a much stronger figure than simply an observer. Maslin said that Freeman's performance was especially moving when describing how dependent Red had become on living within the prison walls. "Variety"s Leonard Klady suggested that Freeman had the "showier" role, allowing him "a grace and dignity that come naturally", without ever becoming banal, and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s <a href="Desson%20Thomson">Desson Howe</a> called Freeman a "master" of comedic and poignant cadence. Even Kenneth Turan's "Los Angeles Times" review, which Glotzer credited with derailing the film's box office success, praised Freeman, saying his "effortless screen presence lends "Shawshank" the closest thing to credibility it can manage".

Of Robbins' performance, Gleiberman said that in his "laconic-good-guy, neo-<a href="Gary%20Cooper">Gary Cooper</a> role, [Robbins] is unable to make Andy connect with the audience". Conversely, Maslin said that Andy has the more subdued role, but that Robbins portrays him intensely, and effectively depicts the character as he transitions from new prisoner to aged father figure, and Klady stated that his "riveting, unfussy ... precise, honest, and seamless" performance anchors the film. Howe said that while the character is "cheesily messianic" for easily charming everyone to his side, comparing him to "Forrest Gump goes to jail", Robbins exudes the perfect kind of innocence to sell the story. "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" stated that both Freeman and Robbins gave outstanding, layered performances that imbued their characters with individuality, and "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s <a href="Peter%20Travers">Peter Travers</a> said that the pair create something "undeniably powerful and moving". Gunton and Brown were deemed by Klady as "extremely credible in their villainy”, Howe countered that Gunton's warden was a clichéd character who extols religious virtues while having people murdered.

Maslin called the film an impressive directorial debut that tells a gentle tale with a surprising amount of loving care, and Klady saying the only failings came when Darabont focused for too long on supporting characters, or embellished a secondary story. "The Hollywood Reporter" said that both the directing and writing were crisp, while criticizing the film's long running time. Klady said that the length and tone, while tempered by humor and unexpected events, would dampen the film's mainstream appeal, but the story offered a fascinating portrait of the innate humanity of the inmates. Gleiberman disliked that the prisoners' crimes were overlooked to portray them more as good guys. Turan similarly objected to what he perceived as extreme violence and rape scenes, and making most of the prisoners seem like a "bunch of swell and softhearted guys" to cast the prison experience in a "rosy glow". Klady summarized the film as "estimable and haunting entertainment", comparing it to a rough diamond with small flaws, but Howe criticized it for deviating with multiple subplots, and pandering by choosing to resolve the story with Andy's and Red's reunion, rather than leaving the mystery. Ebert noted that the story works because it is not about Andy as the hero, but how Red perceives him.

Deakins's cinematography was routinely praised, with "The Hollywood Reporter" calling it "foreboding" and "well-crafted", and Travers saying "the everyday agonies of prison life are meticulously laid out ... you can almost feel the frustration and rage seeping into the skin of the inmates". Gleiberman praised the choice of scenery, writing "the moss-dark, saturated images have a redolent sensuality; you feel as if you could reach out and touch the prison walls". "The Hollywood Reporter" said of Newman's score, "at its best moments, alights with radiant textures and sprightly grace notes, nicely emblematic of the film's central theme", and Klady describing it as "the right balance between the somber and the absurd".

The film was nominated for seven <a href="67th%20Academy%20Awards">Academy Awards in 1995</a>, the most for a Stephen King film adaptation: <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Best Picture</a> (Marvin), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actor">Best Actor</a> (Freeman), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Writing%20%28Adapted%20Screenplay%29">Best Adapted Screenplay</a> (Darabont), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Cinematography">Best Cinematography</a> (Deakins), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film%20Editing">Best Editing</a> (<a href="Richard%20Francis-Bruce">Richard Francis-Bruce</a>), <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Sound">Best Sound Mixing</a> (<a href="Robert%20J.%20Litt">Robert J. Litt</a>, <a href="Elliot%20Tyson">Elliot Tyson</a>, <a href="Michael%20Herbick">Michael Herbick</a>, and <a href="Willie%20D.%20Burton">Willie D. Burton</a>), and <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Original%20Score">Best Original Score</a> (Newman, his first Academy Award nomination). It did not win in any category. It received two <a href="52nd%20Golden%20Globe%20Awards">Golden Globe Award</a> nominations for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture for Freeman, and Best Screenplay for Darabont.

Robbins and Freeman were both nominated for <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Male%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Leading Role</a> at the inaugural <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Awards">Screen Actors Guild Awards</a> in 1995. Darabont was nominated for a <a href="Directors%20Guild%20of%20America">Directors Guild of America</a> award in 1994 for Best Director of a feature film, and a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Writers Guild of America Award</a> for Best Adapted Screenplay. Deakins won the <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Cinematographers">American Society of Cinematographers</a> award for <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Cinematographers%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Achievement%20in%20Cinematography%20in%20Theatrical%20Releases">Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography</a>, while producer Niki Marvin was nominated for a 1994 <a href="Producers%20Guild%20of%20America%20Award">Golden Laurel Award</a> by the <a href="Producers%20Guild%20of%20America">Producers Guild of America</a>.

Darabont later adapted and directed two other King stories, "<a href="The%20Green%20Mile%20%28film%29">The Green Mile</a>" (1999) and "<a href="The%20Mist%20%28film%29">The Mist</a>" (2007). In a 2016 interview, King said that "The Shawshank Redemption" was his favorite adaptation of his work, alongside "Stand by Me".

The oak tree, under which Andy leaves a note for Red directing him to Zihuatanejo, became a symbol of hope for its role in the film, and is considered iconic. In 2016, "The New York Times" reported that the tree attracted thousands of visitors annually. The tree was partially destroyed on July 29, 2011, when it was split by lightning; news of the damage was reported across the United States on newscasts, in newspapers, and on websites as far away as India. The tree was completely felled by strong winds on or around July 22, 2016, and its vestiges were cut down in April 2017. The remains were turned into "The Shawshank Redemption" memorabilia including rock hammers and magnets.

The prison site became a tourist attraction, with many of the rooms and props remaining including the false pipe through which Andy escapes, and a portion of the oak tree from the finale, after it was damaged in 2011. The surrounding area is also visited by fans, while local businesses market "Shawshanwiches" and <a href="Bundt%20cake">Bundt cake</a>s in the shape of the prison. The prison itself was to be torn down completely following filming, but was eventually sold to enthusiasts for $1. According to the Mansfield/Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau (later renamed Destination Mansfield), tourism in the area had increased every year since "The Shawshank Redemption" premiered, and in 2013 drew in 18,000 visitors and over $3 million to the local economy. In late August that year, a series of events were held in Mansfield to celebrate the film's 20th anniversary including a screening of the film at the Renaissance Theatre, a bus tour of certain filming locations, and a cocktail party at the Reformatory. Cast from the film attended some of the events including Gunton, Scott Mann, Renee Blaine, and James Kisicki. As of 2017, Destination Mansfield operates the Shawshank Trail, a series of 15 marked stops around locations related to the film across Mansfield, Ashland, Upper Sandusky, and St. Croix.

Contemporary review aggregation website <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> offers a 91% approval rating from 67 critics, with an <a href="weighted%20mean">average</a> rating of 8.18/10. The consensus reads, ""The Shawshank Redemption" is an uplifting, deeply satisfying prison drama with sensitive direction and fine performances." The film also has a score of 80 out of 100 on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> based on 20 critics indicating "generally favorable reviews".

In 1999, film critic Roger Ebert listed "Shawshank" on his list of "<a href="The%20Great%20Movies">The Great Movies</a>". The film has been nominated for, or appeared on, the <a href="American%20Film%20Institute">American Film Institute</a>'s lists celebrating the top 100 film or film-related topics. In 1998, it was nominated for <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Movies">AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies</a> list, and was No. 72 on the 2007 <a href="AFI%27s%20100%20Years...100%20Movies%20%2810th%20Anniversary%20Edition%29">revised list</a>, outranking "Forrest Gump" (No. 76) and "Pulp Fiction" (No. 94).

In 2005, the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> listed Darabont's screenplay at No. 22 on its list of the 101 Greatest Screenplays, and in 2014, "The Shawshank Redemption" was named Hollywood's fourth favorite film, based on a survey of 2,120 Hollywood-based entertainment industry members; entertainment lawyers skewed the most towards the film. In 2017, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" named it the seventeenth-best prison film ever made. "The Shawshank Redemption" appeared on several lists of the greatest films of the 1990s, by outlets including: "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" and "<a href="NME">NME</a>" (2012), "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" (2013), <a href="CHUD.com">CHUD.com</a> (2014), <a href="MSN">MSN</a> (2015), "<a href="TheWrap">TheWrap</a>", "<a href="Maxim%20%28magazine%29">Maxim</a>", and "Rolling Stone" (2017).

In November 2014, the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> celebrated the film's 20th anniversary with a special one-night screening at the <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn%20Theater">Samuel Goldwyn Theater</a> in <a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California">Beverly Hills, California</a>. In 2015, the film was selected by the United States <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> to be preserved in the <a href="National%20Film%20Registry">National Film Registry</a> for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". Darabont responded: "I can think of no greater honor than for "The Shawshank Redemption" to be considered part of our country's cinematic legacy." "Variety" said that the word "Shawshank" could be used to instantly convey images of a prison.

Critics have sometimes struggled to define the immense public appreciation for the film. In an interview, Freeman said, "About everywhere you go, people say, "The Shawshank Redemption"—greatest movie I ever saw" and that such praise "Just comes out of them". Robbins said, "I swear to God, all over the world—all over the world—wherever I go, there are people who say, 'That movie changed my life' ". In a separate interview, Stephen King said, "If that isn't the best [adaptation of my works], it's one of the two or three best, and certainly, in moviegoers' minds, it's probably the best because it generally rates at the top of these surveys they have of movies. ... I never expected anything to happen with it." In a 2014 "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" article, Robbins claimed that South African politician <a href="Nelson%20Mandela">Nelson Mandela</a> told him about his love for the film, while it has been cited as a source of inspiration by several sportsmen including <a href="Jonny%20Wilkinson">Jonny Wilkinson</a> (UK), <a href="Agust%C3%ADn%20Pichot">Agustín Pichot</a> (Argentina), <a href="Al%20Charron">Al Charron</a> (Canada), and <a href="Dan%20Lyle">Dan Lyle</a> (USA), and <a href="Sarah%2C%20Duchess%20of%20York">Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York</a>. Gunton said he had encountered fans in Morocco, Australia, South America, Germany, France, and <a href="Bora%20Bora">Bora Bora</a>. Director <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> said that the film was "a chewing-gum movie—if you step on it, it sticks to your shoe".

It has been the number 1 film on <a href="IMDb">IMDb</a>'s <a href="User-generated%20content">user-generated</a> <a href="IMDb%23Rankings">Top 250</a> since 2008, when it surpassed "<a href="The%20Godfather">The Godfather</a>", having remained at or near the top since the late 1990s. In the United Kingdom, readers of "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine voted the film as the best of the 1990s, the greatest film of all time in 2006, and it placed number four on "Empire"s 2008 list of "The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time" and their 2017 list of "The 100 Greatest Movies". In March 2011, the film was voted by <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> and <a href="BBC%20Radio%201Xtra">BBC Radio 1Xtra</a> listeners as their favorite film of all time. It regularly appears on "Empire"s top 100 films, was named the greatest film to not win the Academy Award for Best Picture in a 2013 poll by <a href="Sky%20UK">Sky UK</a> (it lost to "Forrest Gump"), and ranked as Britain's favorite film in a 2015 <a href="YouGov">YouGov</a> poll. When the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> analyzed the demographic breakdown of the YouGov poll, it noted that "The Shawshank Redemption" was not the top-ranked film in any group, but was the only film to appear in the top 15 of every age group, suggesting it is able to connect with every polled age group, unlike "Pulp Fiction" which fared better with younger voters, and "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" (1939) with older voters. A 2017 poll conducted by <a href="Gatwick%20Airport">Gatwick Airport</a> also identified the film as the fourth-best to watch while in flight. When film critic <a href="Mark%20Kermode">Mark Kermode</a> interviewed a host of United States moviegoers, they compared it to a "religious experience". It was also voted as New Zealand's favorite film in a 2015 poll.

Triangulum

Triangulum is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the northern sky. Its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "<a href="triangle">triangle</a>", derived from its three brightest stars, which form a long and narrow triangle. Known to the ancient Babylonians and Greeks, Triangulum was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd century astronomer <a href="Ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>. The celestial cartographers <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> and <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> catalogued the constellation's stars, giving six of them <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s.

The white stars <a href="Beta%20Trianguli">Beta</a> and <a href="Gamma%20Trianguli">Gamma Trianguli</a>, of <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a>s 3.00 and 4.00, respectively, form the base of the triangle and the yellow-white <a href="Alpha%20Trianguli">Alpha Trianguli</a>, of magnitude 3.41, the apex. <a href="Iota%20Trianguli">Iota Trianguli</a> is a notable double star system, and there are three <a href="star%20system">star system</a>s with known <a href="exoplanet">planets</a> located in Triangulum. The constellation contains several galaxies, the brightest and nearest of which is the <a href="Triangulum%20Galaxy">Triangulum Galaxy</a> or Messier 33—a member of the <a href="Local%20Group">Local Group</a>. The first <a href="quasar">quasar</a> ever observed, <a href="3C%2048">3C 48</a>, also lies within the boundaries of Triangulum.

In the <a href="Babylonian%20star%20catalogues">Babylonian star catalogues</a>, Triangulum, together with <a href="Gamma%20Andromedae">Gamma Andromedae</a>, formed the constellation known as APIN () "The Plough". It is notable as the first constellation presented on (and giving its name to) a pair of tablets containing canonical star lists that were compiled around 1000 BC, the <a href="MUL.APIN">MUL.APIN</a>. The Plough was the first constellation of the "Way of <a href="Enlil">Enlil</a>"—that is, the northernmost quarter of the Sun's path, which corresponds to the 45 days on either side of <a href="summer%20solstice">summer solstice</a>. Its first appearance in the pre-dawn sky (<a href="heliacal%20rising">heliacal rising</a>) in February marked the time to begin spring ploughing in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>.

The Ancient Greeks called Triangulum "Deltoton" (Δελτωτόν), as the constellation resembled an upper-case Greek letter delta (Δ). It was transliterated by Roman writers, then later <a href="Latin">Latin</a>ised as Deltotum. <a href="Eratosthenes">Eratosthenes</a> linked it with the <a href="Nile%20Delta">Nile Delta</a>, while the Roman writer <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Hyginus">Hyginus</a> associated it with the triangular island of <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, formerly known as Trinacria due to its shape. It was also called "Sicilia", because the Romans believed <a href="Ceres%20%28Roman%20mythology%29">Ceres</a>, patron goddess of Sicily, begged <a href="Jupiter%20%28mythology%29">Jupiter</a> to place the island in the heavens. Greek astronomers such as Hipparchos and Ptolemy called it "Trigonon" (Τρίγωνον), and later, it was Romanized as Trigonum. Other names referring to its shape include Tricuspis and Triquetrum. <a href="Alpha%20Trianguli">Alpha</a> and <a href="Beta%20Trianguli">Beta Trianguli</a> were called "Al Mīzān", which is <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a> for "The Scale Beam". In Chinese astronomy, Gamma Andromedae and neighbouring stars including Beta, Gamma and Delta Trianguli were called "<a href="Teen%20Ta%20Tseang%20Keun">Teen Ta Tseang Keun</a>" (天大将军, "Heaven's great general"), representing honour in astrology and a great general in mythology.

Later, the 17th-century German celestial cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> called the constellation Triplicitas and Orbis terrarum tripertitus, for the three regions Europe, Asia, and Africa. Triangulus Septentrionalis was a name used to distinguish it from <a href="Triangulum%20Australe">Triangulum Australe</a>, the Southern Triangle. Polish astronomer <a href="Johannes%20Hevelius">Johannes Hevelius</a> excised three faint stars—<a href="6%20Trianguli">6</a>, <a href="10%20Trianguli">10</a> and <a href="12%20Trianguli">12 Trianguli</a>—to form the new constellation of <a href="Triangulum%20Minus">Triangulum Minus</a> in his 1690 "Firmamentum Sobiescianum", renaming the original as Triangulum Majus. The smaller constellation was not recognised by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> (IAU) when the constellations were <a href="Constellation%23IAU%20constellations">established in the 1920s</a>.

A small constellation, Triangulum is bordered by Andromeda to the north and west, <a href="Pisces%20%28constellation%29">Pisces</a> to the west and south, <a href="Aries%20%28constellation%29">Aries</a> to the south, and <a href="Perseus%20%28constellation%29">Perseus</a> to the east. The centre of the constellation lies halfway between Gamma Andromedae and <a href="Alpha%20Arietis">Alpha Arietis</a>. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the IAU in 1922, is 'Tri'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined as a polygon of 14 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between 25.60° and 37.35°. Covering 132 square degrees and 0.320% of the night sky, Triangulum ranks 78th of the 88 constellations in size.

Bayer catalogued five stars in the constellation, giving them the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s Alpha to Epsilon. <a href="John%20Flamsteed">John Flamsteed</a> added Eta, Iota and four Roman letters; of these, only Iota is still used as the others were dropped in subsequent catalogues and star charts. Flamsteed gave 16 stars <a href="Flamsteed%20designation">Flamsteed designation</a>s, of which numbers 1 and 16 are not used—1's coordinates were in error as there was no star present at the location that corresponds to any star in his "Catalogus Britannicus"; Baily presumed that the coordinates were mistranscribed 32 in error by Flamsteed and in fact referred to 7.4 magnitude HD 10407. Baily also noted that 16 Trianguli was closer to Aries and included it in the latter constellation.

Three stars make up the long narrow triangle that gives the constellation its name. The brightest member is the white <a href="Giant%20star">giant</a> star Beta Trianguli of <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> 3.00, lying 127 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s distant from Earth. It is actually a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> system; the primary is a white star of spectral type A5IV with 3.5 times the mass of our sun that is beginning to expand and evolve off the main sequence. The secondary is poorly known, but calculated to be a yellow-white <a href="F-type%20main-sequence%20star">F-type main-sequence star</a> around 1.4 solar masses. The two orbit around a common <a href="Center%20of%20mass">centre of gravity</a> every 31 days, and are surrounded by a <a href="debris%20disk">ring of dust</a> that extends from 50 to 400 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> away from the stars.

The second-brightest star, the yellow-white <a href="subgiant">subgiant</a> star Alpha Trianguli (3.41) with a close dimmer companion, is also known as Caput Trianguli or Ras al Muthallath, and is at the apex of the <a href="triangle">triangle</a>. It lies around 7 degrees north-northwest of <a href="Alpha%20Arietis">Alpha Arietis</a>. Making up the triangle is <a href="Gamma%20Trianguli">Gamma Trianguli</a>, a <a href="A-type%20main%20sequence%20star">white main sequence star</a> of spectral type A1Vnn of apparent magnitude 4.00 about 112 light-years from Earth. It is around double the size of and around 33 times as luminous as the sun and rotates rapidly. Like Beta, it is surrounded by a dusty debris disk, which has a radius 80 times the distance of the Earth from the Sun. Lying near Gamma and forming an optical triple system with it are <a href="Delta%20Trianguli">Delta</a> and <a href="7%20Trianguli">7 Trianguli</a>. Delta is a <a href="binary%20star%23Spectroscopic%20binaries">spectroscopic binary</a> system composed of two <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">yellow main sequence stars</a> of similar dimensions to the Sun that lies 35 light-years from Earth. The two stars orbit each other every ten days and are a mere 0.1 AU apart. This system is the closest in the constellation to the Earth. Only of magnitude 5.25, 7 Trianguli is much further away at around 280 light-years distant from Earth.

<a href="Iota%20Trianguli">Iota Trianguli</a> is a double star whose components can be separated by medium-sized telescopes into a strong yellow and a contrasting pale blue star. Both of these are themselves close binaries. <a href="X%20Trianguli">X Trianguli</a> is an <a href="binary%20star%23Eclipsing%20binaries">eclipsing binary</a> system that ranges between magnitudes 8.5 and 11.2 over a period of 0.97 days. <a href="RW%20Trianguli">RW Trianguli</a> is a <a href="cataclysmic%20variable%20star">cataclysmic variable star</a> system composed of a <a href="white%20dwarf">white dwarf</a> primary and an <a href="K-type%20main-sequence%20star">orange main sequence star</a> of spectral type K7 V. The former is drawing off matter from the latter, forming a prominent <a href="accretion%20disc">accretion disc</a>. The system is around 1075 light-years distant.

<a href="R%20Trianguli">R Trianguli</a> is a <a href="Mira%20variable">long period (Mira) variable</a> that ranges from magnitude 6.2 to 11.7 over a period of 267 days. It is a <a href="red%20giant">red giant</a> of spectral type M3.5-8e, lying around 960 light-years away. <a href="HD%2012545">HD 12545</a>, also known as XX Trianguli, is
an orange giant of spectral type K0III around 520 light-years distant with a visual magnitude of 8.42. A huge <a href="starspot">starspot</a> larger than the diameter of the sun was detected on its surface in 1999 by astronomers using <a href="Doppler%20imaging">Doppler imaging</a>.

Two <a href="star%20system">star system</a>s appear to have <a href="exoplanet">planets</a>. <a href="HD%209446">HD 9446</a> is a sun-like star around 171 light-years distant that has two planets of masses 0.7 and 1.8 times that of <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, with orbital periods of 30 and 193 days respectively. <a href="HD%2013189">HD 13189</a> is an orange giant of spectral type K2II about 2–7 times as massive as the sun with a planetary or <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> companion between 8 and 20 times as massive as Jupiter, which takes 472 days to complete an orbit. It is one of the largest stars discovered to have a planetary companion.

The <a href="Triangulum%20Galaxy">Triangulum Galaxy</a>, also known as Messier 33, was discovered by <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Hodierna">Giovanni Battista Hodierna</a> in the 17th century. A distant member of the <a href="Local%20Group">Local Group</a>, it is about 2.3 million light-years away, and at magnitude 5.8 it is bright enough to be seen by the naked eye under dark skies. Being a diffuse object, it is challenging to see under <a href="Light%20pollution">light-polluted</a> skies, even with a small telescope or binoculars, and low power is required to view it. It is a <a href="spiral%20galaxy">spiral galaxy</a> with a diameter of 46,000 light-years and is thus smaller than both the <a href="Andromeda%20Galaxy">Andromeda Galaxy</a> and the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. A distance of less than 300 <a href="parsec">kiloparsecs</a> between it and Andromeda supports the hypothesis that it is a satellite of the larger galaxy. Within the constellation, it lies near the border of Pisces, 3.5 degrees west-northwest of Alpha Trianguli and 7 degrees southwest of <a href="Beta%20Andromedae">Beta Andromedae</a>. Within the galaxy, <a href="NGC%20604">NGC 604</a> is an <a href="H%20II%20region">H II region</a> where star formation takes place.

In addition to M33, there are several NGC galaxies of visual magnitudes 12 to 14. The largest of these include the 10 <a href="minute%20of%20arc">arcminute</a> long magnitude 12 <a href="NGC%20925">NGC 925</a> spiral galaxy and the 5 arcminute long magnitude 11.6 <a href="NGC%20672">NGC 672</a> barred spiral galaxy. The latter is close by and appears to be interacting with <a href="IC%201727">IC 1727</a>. The two are 88,000 light-years apart and lie around 18 million light-years away. These two plus another four nearby dwarf irregular galaxies constitute the NGC 672 group, and all six appear to have had a burst of star formation in the last ten million years. The group is thought connected to another group of six galaxies known as the NGC 784 group, named for its principal galaxy, the barred spiral <a href="NGC%20784">NGC 784</a>. Together with two isolated dwarf galaxies, these fourteen appear to be moving in a common direction and constitute a group possibly located on a <a href="dark%20matter">dark matter</a> <a href="Galaxy%20filament">filament</a>. <a href="3C%2048">3C 48</a> was the first <a href="quasar">quasar</a> ever to be observed, although its true identity was not uncovered until after that of <a href="3C%20273">3C 273</a> in 1963. It has an apparent magnitude of 16.2 and is located about 5 degrees northwest of Alpha Trianguli.

Both Plancius and Bayer depict it as a <a href="toucan">toucan</a>. De Houtman included it in his southern star catalogue the same year under the Dutch name "Den Indiaenschen Exster, op Indies Lang ghenaemt" "the Indian magpie, named Lang in the Indies", by this meaning a particular bird with a long beak—a <a href="hornbill">hornbill</a>, a bird native to the East Indies. A 1603 celestial globe by <a href="Willem%20Blaeu">Willem Blaeu</a> depicts it with a <a href="wikt%3Acasque">casque</a>.

Irregular in shape, Tucana is bordered by <a href="Hydrus">Hydrus</a> to the east, Grus and Phoenix to the north, <a href="Indus%20%28constellation%29">Indus</a> to the west and <a href="Octans">Octans</a> to the south. Covering 295 square degrees, it ranks 48th of the 88 constellations in size. The recommended three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is 'Tuc'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 10 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −56.31° and −75.35°. As one of the deep southern constellations, it remains below the horizon at latitudes north of the <a href="30th%20parallel%20north">30th parallel</a> in the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">Northern Hemisphere</a>, and is <a href="Circumpolar%20star">circumpolar</a> at latitudes south of the <a href="50th%20parallel%20south">50th parallel</a> in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>.

Although he depicted Tucana on his chart, Bayer did not assign its stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s. French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> labelled them Alpha to Rho in 1756, but omitted Omicron and Xi, and labelled a pair of stars close together Lambda Tucanae, and a group of three stars Beta Tucanae. In 1879, American astronomer <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Benjamin Gould</a> designated a star Xi Tucanae—this had not been given a designation by Lacaille who had recognized it as nebulous, and it is now known as the globular cluster 47 Tucanae. Mu Tucanae was dropped by <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a>, who felt the star was too faint to warrant a designation, and Kappa's two components came to be known as Kappa and Kappa.

The layout of the brighter stars of Tucana has been likened to a kite. Within the constellation's boundaries are around 80 stars brighter than an apparent magnitude of 7. At an apparent magnitude of 2.86, <a href="Alpha%20Tucanae">Alpha Tucanae</a> is the brightest star in the constellation and marks the toucan's head. It is an orange subgiant of <a href="stellar%20classification">spectral type</a> K3III around 199 <a href="light-year">light-year</a>s distant from the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>. A cool star with a surface temperature of 4300 K, it is 424 times as luminous as the sun and 37 times its diameter. It is 2.5 to 3 times as massive. Alpha Tucanae is a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a>, which means that the two stars have not been individually resolved using a telescope, but the presence of the companion has been inferred from measuring changes in the <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a> of the primary. The orbital period of the <a href="binary%20system">binary system</a> is 4197.7 days (11.5 years). Nothing is known about the companion. Two degrees southeast of Alpha is the red-hued <a href="Nu%20Tucanae">Nu Tucanae</a>, of spectral type M4III and lying around 290 light-years distant. It is classified as a <a href="semiregular%20variable%20star">semiregular variable star</a> and its brightness varies from magnitude +4.75 to +4.93. Described by Richard Hinckley Allen as bluish, <a href="Gamma%20Tucanae">Gamma Tucanae</a> is a yellow-white sequence star of spectral type F4V and an apparent magnitude of 4.00 located around 75 light-years from Earth. It also marks the toucan's beak.

<a href="Beta%20Tucanae">Beta</a>, <a href="Delta%20Tucanae">Delta</a> and <a href="Kappa%20Tucanae">Kappa</a> are multiple <a href="star%20system">star system</a>s containing six, two and four stars respectively. Located near the tail of the toucan, Beta Tucanae's two brightest components, Beta and Beta are separated by an angle of 27 <a href="arcsecond">arcsecond</a>s and have apparent magnitudes of 4.4 and 4.5 respectively. They can be separated in small telescopes. A third star, Beta Tucanae, is separated by 10 <a href="arcminute">arcminute</a>s from the two, and able to be seen as a separate star with the unaided eye. Each star is itself a binary star, making six in total. Lying in the southwestern corner of the constellation around 251 light-years away from Earth, Delta Tucanae consists of a blue-white primary contrasting with a yellowish companion. Delta Tucanae A is a <a href="main%20sequence">main sequence</a> star of spectral type B9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. The companion has an apparent magnitude of 9.3. The Kappa Tucanae system shines with a combined apparent magnitude of 4.25, and is located around 68 light-years from the Solar System. The brighter component is a yellowish star, known as Kappa Tucanae A with an apparent magnitude of 5.33 and spectral type F6V, while the fainter lies 5 arcseconds to the northwest. Known as Kappa Tucanae B, it has an apparent magnitude of 7.58 and spectral type K1V. Five arcminutes to the northwest is a fainter star of apparent magnitude 7.24 —actually a pair of orange main sequence stars of spectral types K2V and K3V, which can be seen individually as stars one arcsecond apart with a telescope such as a <a href="Dobsonian%20telescope">Dobsonian</a> with high power.
<a href="Lambda%20Tucanae">Lambda Tucanae</a> is an optical double—that is, the name is given to two stars (Lambda and Lambda) which appear close together from our viewpoint, but are in fact far apart in space. Lambda is itself a binary star, with two components—a yellow-white star of spectral type F7IV-V and an apparent magnitude of 6.22, and a yellow main sequence star of spectral type G1V and an apparent magnitude of 7.28. The system is 186 light-years distant. Lambda is an orange subgiant of spectral type K2III that is expanding and cooling and has left the main sequence. Of apparent magnitude 5.46, it is approximately 220 light-years distant from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>.

<a href="Epsilon%20Tucanae">Epsilon Tucanae</a> traditionally marks the toucan's left leg. A B-type <a href="subgiant">subgiant</a>, it has a spectral type B9IV and an apparent magnitude of 4.49. It is approximately 373 light-years from <a href="Earth">Earth</a>. It is around four times as massive as our Sun.

<a href="Theta%20Tucanae">Theta Tucanae</a> is a white <a href="stellar%20classification">A-type</a> star around 423 light-years distant from Earth, which is actually a close binary system. The main star is classified as a <a href="Delta%20Scuti%20variable">Delta Scuti variable</a>—a class of short period (six hours at most) pulsating stars that have been used as <a href="Cosmic%20distance%20ladder%23Standard%20candles">standard candles</a> and as subjects to study <a href="asteroseismology">asteroseismology</a>. It is around double the Sun's mass, having siphoned off one whole <a href="solar%20mass">solar mass</a> from its companion, now a hydrogen-depleted dwarf star of around only 0.2 solar masses. The system shines with a combined light that varies between magnitudes 6.06 to 6.15 every 70 to 80 minutes.

<a href="Zeta%20Tucanae">Zeta Tucanae</a> is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9.5V and an apparent magnitude of 4.20 located 28 light-years away from the Solar System. Despite having a slightly lower mass, this star is more luminous than the Sun. The composition and mass of this star are very similar to the Sun, with a slightly lower mass and an estimated age of three billion years. The solar-like qualities make it a target of interest for investigating the possible existence of a life-bearing planet. It appears to have a <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a> orbiting it at a minimum radius of 2.3 <a href="astronomical%20unit">astronomical unit</a>s. As of 2009, no planet has been discovered in orbit around this star.

Five star systems have been found to have planets, four of which have been discovered by the <a href="High%20Accuracy%20Radial%20Velocity%20Planet%20Searcher">High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher</a> (HARPS) in Chile. <a href="HD%204308">HD 4308</a> is a star with around 83% of the Sun's mass located 72 light-years away with a <a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a> planet with an orbital period of around 15 days. <a href="HD%20215497">HD 215497</a> is an orange star of spectral type K3V around 142 light-years distant. It is orbited by a hot super-Earth every 3 days and a second planet around the size of Saturn with a period of around 567 days. <a href="HD%20221287">HD 221287</a> has a spectral type of F7V and lies 173 light-years away, and has a <a href="super-Jupiter">super-Jovian</a> planet. <a href="HD%207199">HD 7199</a> has spectral type KOIV/V and is located 117 light-years away. It has a planet with around 30% the mass of Jupiter that has an orbital period of 615 days. <a href="HD%20219077">HD 219077</a> has a planet around 10 times as massive as Jupiter in a highly eccentric orbit.

The second-brightest <a href="globular%20cluster">globular cluster</a> in the sky after <a href="Omega%20Centauri">Omega Centauri</a>, <a href="47%20Tucanae">47 Tucanae</a> (NGC 104) lies just west of the <a href="Small%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Small Magellanic Cloud</a>. Only 14,700 light-years distant from Earth, it is thought to be around 12 billion years old. Mostly composed of old, yellow stars, it does possess a contingent of <a href="blue%20stragglers">blue stragglers</a>, hot stars that are hypothesized to form from <a href="binary%20star%20merger">binary star merger</a>s. 47 Tucanae has an apparent magnitude of 3.9, meaning that it is visible to the naked eye; it is a Shapley class III cluster, which means that it has a clearly defined nucleus. Near to 47 Tucana on the sky, and often seen in wide-field photographs showing it, are two much more distant globular clusters associated with the SMC: <a href="NGC%20121">NGC 121</a>, 10 arcminutes away from the bigger cluster's edge, and <a href="Lindsay%208">Lindsay 8</a>.

<a href="NGC%20362">NGC 362</a> is another globular cluster in Tucana with an apparent magnitude of 6.4, 27,700 light-years from Earth. Like neighboring 47 Tucanae, NGC 362 is a Shapley class III cluster and among the brightest globular clusters in the sky. Unusually for a globular cluster, its orbit takes it very close to the center of the Milky Way—approximately 3,000 light-years. It was discovered in the 1820s by <a href="James%20Dunlop">James Dunlop</a>. Its stars become visible at 180x magnification through a telescope.

Located at the southern end of Tucana, the Small Magellanic Cloud is a <a href="dwarf%20galaxy">dwarf galaxy</a> that is one of the nearest neighbors to the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy at a distance of 210,000 light-years. Though it probably formed as a disk shape, <a href="tidal%20forces">tidal forces</a> from the Milky Way have distorted it. Along with the <a href="Large%20Magellanic%20Cloud">Large Magellanic Cloud</a>, it lies within the <a href="Magellanic%20Stream">Magellanic Stream</a>, a cloud of gas that connects the two galaxies. <a href="NGC%20346">NGC 346</a> is a star-forming region located in the Small Magellanic Cloud. It has an apparent magnitude of 10.3. Within it lies the triple star system <a href="HD%205980">HD 5980</a>, each of its members among the most luminous stars known.

The <a href="Tucana%20Dwarf">Tucana Dwarf</a> galaxy, which was discovered in 1990, is a <a href="dwarf%20spheroidal%20galaxy">dwarf spheroidal galaxy</a> of <a href="Galaxy%20morphological%20classification">type dE5</a> that is an isolated member of the <a href="Local%20Group">Local Group</a>. It is located from the Solar System and around from the barycentre of the Local Group—the second most remote of all member galaxies after the <a href="Sagittarius%20Dwarf%20Irregular%20Galaxy">Sagittarius Dwarf Irregular Galaxy</a>.

The <a href="barred%20spiral%20galaxy">barred spiral galaxy</a> <a href="NGC%207408">NGC 7408</a> is located 3 degrees northwest of Delta Tucanae, and was initially mistaken for a planetary nebula.

In 1998, part of the constellation was the subject of a two-week observation program by the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, which resulted in the <a href="Hubble%20Deep%20Field%20South">Hubble Deep Field South</a>. The potential area to be covered needed to be at the poles of the telescope's orbit for continuous observing, with the final choice resting upon the discovery of a <a href="quasar">quasar</a>, QSO J2233-606, in the field.

Triangulum Australe

Triangulum Australe is a small <a href="constellation">constellation</a> in the far <a href="Southern%20Celestial%20Hemisphere">Southern Celestial Hemisphere</a>. Its name is <a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "the southern triangle", which distinguishes it from <a href="Triangulum">Triangulum</a> in the northern sky and is derived from the almost <a href="equilateral%20triangle">equilateral pattern</a> of its three brightest <a href="star">star</a>s. It was first depicted on a celestial globe as Triangulus Antarcticus by <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> in 1589, and later with more accuracy and its current name by <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a> in his 1603 "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>". The French explorer and astronomer <a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> charted and gave the brighter stars their <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s in 1756.

<a href="Alpha%20Trianguli%20Australis">Alpha Trianguli Australis</a>, known as Atria, is a <a href="apparent%20magnitude">second-magnitude</a> orange <a href="bright%20giant">giant</a> and the brightest star in the constellation, as well as the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. Completing the triangle are the two <a href="A-type%20main%20sequence%20star">white main sequence</a> stars <a href="Beta%20Trianguli%20Australis">Beta</a> and <a href="Gamma%20Trianguli%20Australis">Gamma Trianguli Australis</a>. Although the constellation lies in the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> and contains many stars, <a href="deep-sky%20object">deep-sky object</a>s are not prominent. Notable features include the <a href="open%20cluster">open cluster</a> <a href="NGC%206025">NGC 6025</a> and <a href="planetary%20nebula">planetary nebula</a> <a href="NGC%205979">NGC 5979</a>.

Italian navigator <a href="Amerigo%20Vespucci">Amerigo Vespucci</a> explored the New World at the beginning of the 16th century. He learnt to recognize the stars in the southern hemisphere and made a catalogue for his patron king <a href="Manuel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Manuel I of Portugal</a>, which is now lost. As well as the catalogue, Vespucci wrote descriptions of the southern stars, including a triangle which may be either Triangulum Australe or <a href="Apus">Apus</a>. This was sent to his patron in Florence, <a href="Lorenzo%20di%20Pierfrancesco%20de%27%20Medici">Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici</a>, and published as "Mundus Novus" in 1504. The first depiction of the constellation was provided in 1589 by Flemish astronomer and clergyman <a href="Petrus%20Plancius">Petrus Plancius</a> on a -cm diameter <a href="globe%23Celestial">celestial globe</a> published in Amsterdam by Dutch cartographer <a href="Jacob%20Floris%20van%20Langren">Jacob Floris van Langren</a>, where it was called Triangulus Antarcticus and incorrectly portrayed to the south of <a href="Argo%20Navis">Argo Navis</a>. His student <a href="Pieter%20Dirkszoon%20Keyser">Petrus Keyzer</a>, along with Dutch explorer <a href="Frederick%20de%20Houtman">Frederick de Houtman</a>, coined the name Den Zuyden Trianghel. Triangulum Australe was more accurately depicted in <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s celestial atlas "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" in 1603, where it was also given its current name.

<a href="Nicolas%20Louis%20de%20Lacaille">Nicolas Louis de Lacaille</a> portrayed the constellations of <a href="Norma%20%28constellation%29">Norma</a>, <a href="Circinus%20%28constellation%29">Circinus</a> and Triangulum Australe as a set square and ruler, a compass, and a surveyor's level respectively in a set of draughtsman's instruments in his 1756 map of the southern stars. Also depicting it as a surveyor's level, German <a href="Johann%20Bode">Johann Bode</a> gave it the alternate name of Libella in his "Uranographia".

German poet and author <a href="Philipp%20von%20Zesen">Philippus Caesius</a> saw the three main stars as representing the <a href="Patriarchs%20%28Bible%29">Three Patriarchs</a>, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (with Atria as Abraham). The <a href="Wardaman%20people">Wardaman people</a> of the Northern Territory in Australia perceived the stars of Triangulum Australe as the tail of the <a href="Rainbow%20Serpent">Rainbow Serpent</a>, which stretched out from near <a href="Crux">Crux</a> across to <a href="Scorpius">Scorpius</a>. Overhead in October, the Rainbow Serpent "gives Lightning a nudge" to bring on the wet season rains in November.

Triangulum Australe is a small constellation bordered by Norma to the north, Circinus to the west, Apus to the south and <a href="Ara%20%28constellation%29">Ara</a> to the east. It lies near the Pointers (<a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha</a> and <a href="Beta%20Centauri">Beta Centauri</a>), with only Circinus in between. The constellation is located within the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, and hence has many stars. A roughly equilateral triangle, it is easily identifiable. Triangulum Australe lies too far south in the celestial southern hemisphere to be visible from Europe, yet is <a href="Circumpolar%20star">circumpolar</a> from most of the southern hemisphere. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the <a href="International%20Astronomical%20Union">International Astronomical Union</a> in 1922, is "TrA". The official constellation boundaries, as set by <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Joseph%20Delporte">Eugène Delporte</a> in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 18 segments. In the <a href="equatorial%20coordinate%20system">equatorial coordinate system</a>, the <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> coordinates of these borders lie between and , while the <a href="declination">declination</a> coordinates are between −60.26° and −70.51°. Triangulum Australe <a href="Culmination">culminates</a> each year at 9 p.m. on 23 August.

In defining the constellation, Lacaille gave twelve stars <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a>s of Alpha through to Lambda, with two close stars called Eta (one now known by its <a href="Star%20catalogue%23HD/HDE">Henry Draper catalogue</a> number), while Lambda was later dropped due to its dimness. The three brightest stars, Alpha, Beta and Gamma, make up the triangle. Readily identified by its orange hue, <a href="Alpha%20Trianguli%20Australis">Alpha Trianguli Australis</a> is a <a href="bright%20giant">bright giant</a> star of <a href="stellar%20classification">spectral type</a> K2 IIb-IIIa with an <a href="apparent%20magnitude">apparent magnitude</a> of +1.91 that is the 42nd-brightest star in the night sky. It lies away and has an <a href="absolute%20magnitude">absolute magnitude</a> of −3.68 and is 5,500 times more luminous than our <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. With a diameter 130 times that of our Sun, it would almost reach the orbit of Venus if placed at the centre of the Solar System. The proper name Atria is a contraction of its Bayer designation. <a href="Beta%20Trianguli%20Australis">Beta Trianguli Australis</a> is a <a href="double%20star">double star</a>, the primary being a <a href="F-type%20main-sequence%20star">F-type main-sequence star</a> with a stellar classification of F1V, and an apparent magnitude of 2.85. Lying only away, it has an absolute magnitude of 2.38. Its companion, almost 3 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc%23Symbols%20and%20abbreviations">arcminutes</a> away, is a 13th-magnitude star which may or may not be in orbit around Beta. The remaining member of the triangle is <a href="Gamma%20Trianguli%20Australis">Gamma Trianguli Australis</a> with an apparent magnitude of 2.87. It is an <a href="A-type%20main%20sequence%20star">A-type main sequence star</a> of spectral class A1 V, which lies away.

Located outside the triangle near Beta, <a href="Delta%20Trianguli%20Australis">Delta Trianguli Australis</a> is the fourth-brightest star at apparent magnitude +3.8. It is a yellow giant of spectral type G2Ib-II and lies away. A <a href="binary%20star">binary star</a>, it has a 12th-magnitude companion star separated by 30 <a href="Minute%20and%20second%20of%20arc%23Symbols%20and%20abbreviations">arcseconds</a> from the primary. Lying halfway between Beta and Gamma, <a href="Epsilon%20Trianguli%20Australis">Epsilon Trianguli Australis</a> is an optical double. The brighter star, Epsilon Trianguli Australis A, is an orange <a href="stellar%20classification">K-type</a> sub-<a href="giant%20star">giant</a> of spectral type K1.5III with an apparent magnitude of +4.11. The optical companion, Epsilon Trianguli Australis B (or HD 138510), is a white main sequence star of spectral type A9IV/V which has an apparent magnitude of +9.32. <a href="Zeta%20Trianguli%20Australis">Zeta Trianguli Australis</a> appears as a star of apparent magnitude +4.91 and spectral class F9V, but is actually a <a href="spectroscopic%20binary">spectroscopic binary</a> with a near companion, probably a <a href="red%20dwarf">red dwarf</a>. The pair orbit each other once every 13 days. A young star, its proper motion indicates it is a member of the <a href="Ursa%20Major%20moving%20group">Ursa Major moving group</a>. <a href="Iota%20Trianguli%20Australis">Iota Trianguli Australis</a> shows itself to be a multiple star system composed of a yellow and a white star when seen though a 7.5 cm telescope. The brighter star has a spectral type of F4IV and is a spectroscopic binary whose components are two yellow-white stars which orbit each other every 39.88 days. The primary is a <a href="Gamma%20Doradus%20variable">Gamma Doradus variable</a>, pulsating over a period of 1.45 days. The fainter star is not associated with the system, hence the system is an <a href="Double%20star">optical double</a>. <a href="HD%20147018">HD 147018</a> is a Sun-like star of apparent magnitude 8.3 and spectral type G9V, which was found to have two exoplanets, <a href="HD%20147018%20b">HD 147018 b</a> and <a href="HD%20147018%20c">HD 147018 c</a>, in 2009.

Of apparent magnitude 5.11, the yellow bright giant <a href="Kappa%20Trianguli%20Australis">Kappa Trianguli Australis</a> of spectral type G5IIa lies around distant from the Solar System. <a href="Eta%20Trianguli%20Australis">Eta Trianguli Australis</a> (or Eta1 Trianguli Australis) is a <a href="Be%20star">Be star</a> of spectral type B7IVe which is from Earth, with an apparent magnitude of 5.89. Lacaille named a close-by star as Eta as well, which was inconsistently followed by <a href="Francis%20Baily">Francis Baily</a>, who used the name for the brighter or both stars in two different publications. Despite their faintness, <a href="Benjamin%20Apthorp%20Gould">Benjamin Gould</a> upheld their Bayer designation as they were closer than 25 degrees to the south celestial pole. The second Eta is now designated as HD 150550. It is a variable star of average magnitude 6.53 and spectral type A1III.

Triangulum Australe contains several <a href="cepheid%20variable">cepheid variable</a>s, all of which are too faint to be seen with the naked eye: <a href="R%20Trianguli%20Australis">R Trianguli Australis</a> ranges from apparent magnitude 6.4 to 6.9 over a period of 3.389 days, <a href="S%20Trianguli%20Australis">S Trianguli Australis</a> varies from magnitude 6.1 to 6.8 over 6.323 days, and <a href="U%20Trianguli%20Australis">U Trianguli Australis</a>' brightness changes from 7.5 to 8.3 over 2.568 days. All three are yellow-white giants of spectral type F7Ib/II, F8II, and F8Ib/II respectively. <a href="RT%20Trianguli%20Australis">RT Trianguli Australis</a> is an unusual cepheid variable which shows strong <a href="absorption%20band">absorption band</a>s in <a href="molecule">molecular</a> fragments of <a href="Diatomic%20carbon">C</a>, <a href="methylidyne%20radical">⫶CH</a> and <a href="cyano%20radical">⋅CN</a>, and has been classified as a carbon cepheid of spectral type R. It varies between magnitudes 9.2 and 9.97 over 1.95 days. Lying nearby Gamma, <a href="X%20Trianguli%20Australis">X Trianguli Australis</a> is a variable <a href="carbon%20star">carbon star</a> with an average magnitude of 5.63. It has two periods of around 385 and 455 days, and is of spectral type C5, 5(Nb).

The Thing (1982 film)

The Thing is a 1982 American <a href="Science%20fiction%20film">science fiction</a> <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a> directed by <a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a> and written by <a href="Bill%20Lancaster">Bill Lancaster</a>. Based on the 1938 <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell%20Jr.">John W. Campbell Jr.</a> novella "<a href="Who%20Goes%20There%3F">Who Goes There?</a>", it tells the story of a group of American researchers in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> who encounter the eponymous "Thing", a <a href="Parasitism">parasitic</a> extraterrestrial life-form that assimilates, then imitates other <a href="organism">organism</a>s. The group is overcome by paranoia and conflict as they learn that they can no longer trust each other and that any one of them could be the Thing. The film stars <a href="Kurt%20Russell">Kurt Russell</a> as the team's helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and features <a href="Wilford%20Brimley">A. Wilford Brimley</a>, <a href="T.%20K.%20Carter">T. K. Carter</a>, <a href="David%20Clennon">David Clennon</a>, <a href="Keith%20David">Keith David</a>, <a href="Richard%20Dysart">Richard Dysart</a>, <a href="Charles%20Hallahan">Charles Hallahan</a>, <a href="Peter%20Maloney%20%28actor%29">Peter Maloney</a>, <a href="Richard%20Masur">Richard Masur</a>, <a href="Donald%20Moffat">Donald Moffat</a>, <a href="Joel%20Polis">Joel Polis</a>, and <a href="Thomas%20Waites">Thomas Waites</a> in supporting roles.

Production began in the mid-1970s as a faithful adaptation of the novella, following 1951's popular "<a href="The%20Thing%20from%20Another%20World">The Thing from Another World</a>". "The Thing" went through several directors and writers, each with different ideas on how to approach the story. Filming lasted roughly 12 weeks, beginning in August 1981, and took place on refrigerated sets in Los Angeles as well as in <a href="Juneau%2C%20Alaska">Juneau, Alaska</a>, and <a href="Stewart%2C%20British%20Columbia">Stewart, British Columbia</a>. Of the film's $15 million budget, $1.5 million was spent on <a href="Rob%20Bottin">Rob Bottin</a>'s creature effects, a mixture of chemicals, food products, rubber, and mechanical parts turned by his large team into an alien capable of taking on any form.

"The Thing" was released in 1982 to very negative reviews. It was described as "instant junk", "a wretched excess", and proposed as the most hated film of all time. Reviews both praised the special effects achievements and criticized their visual repulsiveness, while others focused on poor characterization. The film earned $19.6 million during its theatrical run. Many reasons have been cited for its failure to impress audiences: competition from films such as "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a>", which offered an optimistic take on alien visitation; a summer that had been filled with successful science fiction and fantasy films; and an audience, living through a recession, diametrically opposed to "The Thing"s <a href="nihilism">nihilistic</a> tone.

The film found an audience when released on home video and television. In the years since, it has been reappraised as one of the best science fiction or horror films ever made, and has gained a <a href="cult%20following">cult following</a>. Filmmakers have noted its influence on their work, and it has been referred to in other media such as television and video games. "The Thing" has spawned a variety of merchandise, including a 1982 <a href="novelization">novelization</a>, <a href="Haunted%20attraction%20%28simulated%29">haunted houses</a>, board games, and sequels in comic books, <a href="The%20Thing%20%28video%20game%29">a video game of the same name</a>, and a 2011 prequel film <a href="The%20Thing%20%282011%20film%29">of the same name</a>.

In Antarctica, a Norwegian helicopter pursues a <a href="sled%20dog">sled dog</a> to an American research station. The Americans witness the Norwegian passenger accidentally blow up the helicopter and himself. The Norwegian pilot fires a rifle and shouts at the Americans, but they cannot understand him and he is shot dead in self-defense by station commander Garry. The American helicopter pilot, R.J. MacReady, and Dr. Copper leave to investigate the Norwegian base. Among the charred ruins and frozen corpses, they find the burned remains of a malformed humanoid which they recover to the American station. Their biologist, Blair, performs autopsies on the remains and finds a normal set of human organs.

Clark kennels the sled dog, and it soon metamorphoses and absorbs the station dogs. This disturbance alerts the team and Childs uses a flamethrower to incinerate the creature. Blair autopsies the new creature and learns that it can perfectly imitate other organisms. Recovered Norwegian data leads the Americans to a large excavation site containing a partially buried alien spacecraft, and a smaller, human-sized dig site. Norris estimates that the alien ship has been buried for at least 100,000 years. Blair grows paranoid that the creature could assimilate all life on Earth in a matter of years. The station implements controls to reduce the risk of assimilation.

The "dead", malformed humanoid creature assimilates an isolated Bennings, but Windows interrupts the process and MacReady burns the Bennings-Thing. Blair sabotages all the vehicles, kills the remaining sled dogs, and destroys the radio to prevent escape. The team imprison him in a tool shed. Copper suggests a test to compare each member's blood against uncontaminated blood held in storage, but after learning that the blood stores have been destroyed, the men lose faith in Garry, and MacReady takes command.

MacReady, Windows and Nauls find Fuchs's burnt corpse and surmise he committed suicide to avoid assimilation. Windows returns to base while MacReady and Nauls investigate MacReady's shack. On their return, Nauls abandons MacReady in a snowstorm, believing he has been assimilated after finding his torn clothes in the shack. The team debate whether to allow MacReady inside, but he breaks in and holds the group at bay with dynamite. During the encounter, Norris appears to suffer a heart attack.

As Copper attempts to <a href="Defibrillation">defibrillate</a> Norris, his chest transforms into a large mouth and bites off Copper's arms, killing him. MacReady incinerates the Norris-Thing, but its head separates from the body and attempts to escape before also being burnt. MacReady is forced to kill Clark in self-defense when the latter lunges at him from behind with a knife. He hypothesizes that the Norris-Thing's head demonstrated that every part of the Thing is an individual life form with its own survival instinct. He sequentially tests blood samples with a heated piece of wire. Everyone passes the test except Palmer, whose blood jumps from the heat. Palmer transforms and infects Windows, forcing MacReady to burn them both.

Childs is left on guard while the others go to test Blair. They find that Blair has escaped, and has been using vehicle components to assemble a small spacecraft. On their return, Childs is missing and the power generator is destroyed. MacReady speculates that the Thing intends to return to hibernation until a rescue team arrives. MacReady, Garry, and Nauls decide to detonate the entire station to destroy the Thing. As they set explosives, Blair kills Garry and Nauls disappears. Blair transforms into an enormous creature and destroys the detonator. MacReady triggers the explosives using a stick of dynamite, destroying the base.

MacReady sits nearby as the station burns. Childs returns, saying he became lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted, they acknowledge the futility of their situation. MacReady passes Childs his bottle of <a href="Justerini%20%26amp%3B%20Brooks">J&B scotch</a> as the camp burns.

Development of the film began in the mid-1970s when producers David Foster and Lawrence Turman suggested an adaptation of the 1938 <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell">John W. Campbell</a> novella "<a href="Who%20Goes%20There%3F">Who Goes There?</a>" to <a href="Universal%20Pictures">Universal Pictures</a>. It had been loosely adapted once before in <a href="Howard%20Hawks">Howard Hawks</a>'s and <a href="Christian%20Nyby">Christian Nyby</a>'s 1951 film "<a href="The%20Thing%20from%20Another%20World">The Thing from Another World</a>", but Foster and Turman wanted to develop a project that stuck more closely to the source material. Screenwriters <a href="Hal%20Barwood">Hal Barwood</a> and <a href="Matthew%20Robbins%20%28screenwriter%29">Matthew Robbins</a> held the rights to make an adaptation, but passed on the opportunity to make a new film, so Universal obtained the rights from them. In 1976, <a href="Wilbur%20Stark">Wilbur Stark</a> had purchased the remake rights to 23 <a href="RKO%20Pictures">RKO Pictures</a> films, including "The Thing from Another World", from three <a href="Wall%20Street">Wall Street</a> financiers who did not know what to do with them, in exchange for a return when the films were produced. Universal in turn acquired the rights to remake the film from Stark, resulting in him being given an executive producer credit on all print advertisements, posters, television commercials, and studio press material.

<a href="John%20Carpenter">John Carpenter</a> was first approached about the project in 1976 by co-producer and friend Stuart Cohen, but Carpenter was mainly an independent film director, so Universal chose "<a href="The%20Texas%20Chain%20Saw%20Massacre">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>" (1974) director <a href="Tobe%20Hooper">Tobe Hooper</a> as they already had him under contract. The producers were ultimately unhappy with Hooper and his writing partner <a href="Kim%20Henkel">Kim Henkel</a>'s concept. After several more failed <a href="pitch%20%28filmmaking%29">pitches</a> by different writers, and attempts to bring on other directors, such as <a href="John%20Landis">John Landis</a>, the project was put on hold. Even so, the success of <a href="Ridley%20Scott">Ridley Scott</a>'s 1979 science fiction horror film "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>" helped revitalize the project, at which point Carpenter became loosely attached following his success with his influential <a href="slasher%20film">slasher film</a> "<a href="Halloween%20%281978%20film%29">Halloween</a>" (1978).

Carpenter was reluctant to join the project as he thought Hawks's adaptation would be difficult to surpass, although he considered the film's monster to be unnotable. Cohen suggested that he read the original novella. Carpenter found the "creepiness" of the imitations conducted by the creature, and the questions it raised, interesting. Carpenter drew parallels between the novella and <a href="Agatha%20Christie">Agatha Christie</a>'s mystery novel "<a href="And%20Then%20There%20Were%20None">And Then There Were None</a>" (1939), and noted that the story of "Who Goes There?" was "timely" for him, meaning he could make it "true to [his] day" as Hawks had in his time. Carpenter, a fan of Hawks's adaptation, paid homage to it in "Halloween", and he watched "The Thing from Another World" several times for inspiration before filming began. Carpenter and cinematographer <a href="Dean%20Cundey">Dean Cundey</a> first worked together on "Halloween", and "The Thing" was their first big-budget project for a <a href="major%20film%20studio">major film studio</a>.

After securing the writer and crew, the film was stalled again when Carpenter nearly quit, believing that a passion project of his, "<a href="El%20Diablo%20%281990%20film%29">El Diablo</a>" (1990), was on the verge of being made by <a href="EMI%20Films">EMI Films</a>. The producers discussed various replacements including <a href="Walter%20Hill">Walter Hill</a>, <a href="Sam%20Peckinpah">Sam Peckinpah</a> and <a href="Michael%20Ritchie%20%28film%20director%29">Michael Ritchie</a>, but the development of "El Diablo" was not as imminent as Carpenter believed, and he remained with "The Thing".

Universal initially set a budget of $10 million, with a modest $200,000 for "creature effects," which at the time was more than the studio had ever allocated to a monster film. Filming was scheduled to be completed within 98 days. Universal's production studios estimated that it would require at least $17 million before marketing and other costs, as the plan involved more set construction, including external sets and a large set piece for the original scripted death of Bennings, which was estimated to cost $1.5 million alone. As <a href="storyboard">storyboard</a>ing and designs were finalized, the crew estimated they would need at least $750,000 for creature effects, a figure Universal executives agreed to after seeing the number of workers employed under <a href="Rob%20Bottin">Rob Bottin</a>, the <a href="special%20make-up%20effects">special make-up effects</a> designer. Associate producer Larry Franco was responsible for making the budget work for the film; he cut the filming schedule by a third, eliminated the exterior sets for on-site shooting, and removed Bennings's more extravagant death scene. Cohen suggested reusing the destroyed American camp as the ruined Norwegian camp, saving a further $250,000. When filming began in August, "The Thing" had a budget of $11.4 million, and indirect costs brought it to $14 million. The effects budget eventually ran over by $1.5 million, forcing the elimination of some scenes, including Nauls's confrontation of a creature dubbed the "box Thing". By the end of production, Carpenter had to make a personal appeal to executive <a href="Ned%20Tanen">Ned Tanen</a> for $100,000 to complete a simplified version of the Blair-Thing. The final cost was $12.4 million, and overhead costs brought it to $15 million.

Several writers developed drafts for "The Thing" before Carpenter became involved, including "<a href="Logan%27s%20Run">Logan's Run</a>" (1967) writer <a href="William%20F.%20Nolan">William F. Nolan</a>, novelist <a href="David%20Wiltse">David Wiltse</a>, and Hooper and Henkel, whose draft was set at least partially underwater, and which Cohen described as a "<a href="Moby-Dick">Moby-Dick</a>"-like story in which "The Captain" did battle with a large, non-shapeshifting creature. As Carpenter said in a 2014 interview, "they were just trying to make it work". The writers left before Carpenter joined the project. He said the scripts were "awful," as they changed the story into something it was not, and ignored the chameleon-like aspect of the Thing. Carpenter did not want to write the project himself, after recently completing work on "<a href="Escape%20from%20New%20York">Escape from New York</a>" (1981), and having struggled to complete a screenplay for "<a href="The%20Philadelphia%20Experiment%20%28film%29">The Philadelphia Experiment</a>" (1984). He was wary of taking on writing duties, preferring to let someone else do it. Once Carpenter was confirmed as the director, several writers were asked to script "The Thing", including <a href="Richard%20Matheson">Richard Matheson</a>, <a href="Nigel%20Kneale">Nigel Kneale</a>, and <a href="Deric%20Washburn">Deric Washburn</a>.

<a href="Bill%20Lancaster">Bill Lancaster</a> initially met with Turman, Foster and Cohen in 1977, but he was given the impression that they wanted to closely replicate "The Thing from Another World", and he did not want to remake the film. In August 1979, Lancaster was contacted again. By this time he had read the original "Who Goes There?" novella, and Carpenter had become involved in the project. Lancaster was hired to write the script after describing his vision for the film, and his intention to stick closely to the original story, to Carpenter, who was a fan of Lancaster's work on "<a href="The%20Bad%20News%20Bears">The Bad News Bears</a>" (1976). Lancaster conceived several key scenes in the film, including the Norris-Thing biting Dr. Copper, and the use of blood tests to identify the Thing, which Carpenter cited as the reason he wanted to work on the film. Lancaster said he found some difficulty in translating "Who Goes There?" to film, as it features very little action. He also made some significant changes to the story, such as reducing the number of characters from 37 to 12. Lancaster said that 37 was excessive and would be difficult for audiences to follow, leaving little screen time for characterization. He also opted to alter the story's structure, choosing to open his <a href="In%20medias%20res">in the middle of the action</a>, instead of using a <a href="Flashback%20%28narrative%29">flashback</a> as in the novella. Several characters were modernized for contemporary audiences; MacReady, originally a meteorologist, became a tough loner described in the script as "35. Helicopter pilot. Likes chess. Hates the cold. The pay is good." Lancaster aimed to create an ensemble piece where one person emerged as the hero, instead of having a <a href="Doc%20Savage">Doc Savage</a>-type hero from the start.

Lancaster wrote approximately 30 to 40 pages, but eventually struggled writing the film's second act and it took him several months to complete the script. After it was finished, Lancaster and Carpenter spent a weekend in Northern California refining the script, each having different takes on how a character should sound, and comparing their ideas for scenes. Lancaster's script opted to keep the creature largely concealed throughout the film, and it was Bottin who convinced Carpenter to make it more visible to have a greater impact on the audience. Lancaster's original ending had both MacReady and Childs turn into the Thing. In the spring, the characters are rescued by helicopter, greeting their saviors with "Hey, which way to a hot meal?" Carpenter thought this ending was too shallow. In total, Lancaster completed four drafts of the screenplay. The novella concludes with the humans clearly victorious, but concerned that birds they see flying toward the mainland may have been infected by the Thing. Carpenter opted to end the film with the survivors slowly freezing to death to save humanity from infection, believing this to be the ultimate heroic act. Lancaster wrote this ending, which eschews a "<a href="The%20Twilight%20Zone">The Twilight Zone</a>"-style twist or the destruction of the monster, as he wanted to instead have an ambiguous moment between the pair, of trust and mistrust, fear and relief.

<a href="Kurt%20Russell">Kurt Russell</a> was involved in the production before being cast, helping Carpenter develop his ideas. Russell was the last actor to be cast, in June 1981, by which point <a href="second%20unit">second unit</a> filming was starting in <a href="Juneau%2C%20Alaska">Juneau, Alaska</a>. Carpenter had worked with Russell twice before, but wanted to keep his options open. Discussions with the studio involved using actors <a href="Christopher%20Walken">Christopher Walken</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Bridges">Jeff Bridges</a>, or <a href="Nick%20Nolte">Nick Nolte</a>, who were either unavailable or declined, and <a href="Sam%20Shepard">Sam Shepard</a>, who showed interest but was never pursued. <a href="Tom%20Atkins%20%28actor%29">Tom Atkins</a> and <a href="Jack%20Thompson%20%28actor%29">Jack Thompson</a> were strong early and late contenders for the role of MacReady, but the decision was made to go with Russell. In part, Carpenter cited the practicality of choosing someone he had found reliable before, and who would not balk at the difficult filming conditions. It took Russell about a year to grow his hair and beard out for the role. At various points, the producers met with <a href="Brian%20Dennehy">Brian Dennehy</a>, <a href="Kris%20Kristofferson">Kris Kristofferson</a>, <a href="John%20Heard%20%28actor%29">John Heard</a>, <a href="Ed%20Harris">Ed Harris</a>, <a href="Tom%20Berenger">Tom Berenger</a>, Jack Thompson, <a href="Scott%20Glenn">Scott Glenn</a>, <a href="Fred%20Ward">Fred Ward</a>, <a href="Peter%20Coyote">Peter Coyote</a>, Tom Atkins, and <a href="Tim%20McIntyre">Tim McIntyre</a>. Some passed on the idea of starring in a monster film, while Dennehy became the choice to play Copper. Each actor was to be paid $50,000, but after the more-established Russell was cast, his salary increased to $400,000.

<a href="Geoffrey%20Holder">Geoffrey Holder</a>, <a href="Carl%20Weathers">Carl Weathers</a>, and <a href="Bernie%20Casey">Bernie Casey</a> were considered for the role of Childs, and Carpenter also looked at <a href="Isaac%20Hayes">Isaac Hayes</a>, having worked with him on "Escape from New York". <a href="Ernie%20Hudson">Ernie Hudson</a> was the front-runner and was almost cast until they met with <a href="Keith%20David">Keith David</a>. "The Thing" was David's first significant film role, and coming from a theater background, he had to learn on set how to hold himself back and not show every emotion his character was feeling, with guidance from <a href="Richard%20Masur">Richard Masur</a> and <a href="Donald%20Moffat">Donald Moffat</a> in particular. Masur and David discussed their characters in rehearsals and decided that they would not like each other. For Blair, the team chose the then-unknown <a href="Wilford%20Brimley">Wilford Brimley</a>, as they wanted an <a href="everyman">everyman</a> whose absence would not be questioned by the audience until the appropriate time. The intent with the character was to have him become infected early on off-screen, so that his status would be unknown to the audience, concealing his intentions. Carpenter wanted to cast <a href="Donald%20Pleasence">Donald Pleasence</a>, but it was decided that he was too recognizable to accommodate the role. <a href="T.%20K.%20Carter">T. K. Carter</a> was cast as Nauls, but comedian <a href="Franklyn%20Ajaye">Franklyn Ajaye</a> also came in to read for the role. Instead, he delivered a lengthy speech about the character being a stereotype, after which the meeting ended.
Bottin lobbied hard to play Palmer, but it was deemed impossible for him to do so alongside his existing duties. As the character has some comedic moments, Universal brought in comedians <a href="Jay%20Leno">Jay Leno</a>, <a href="Garry%20Shandling">Garry Shandling</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Fleischer">Charles Fleischer</a>, among others, but opted to go with actor <a href="David%20Clennon">David Clennon</a>, who was better suited to play the dramatic elements. Clennon had read for the Bennings character, but he preferred the option of playing Palmer's "blue-collar stoner" to a "white collar science man". <a href="Powers%20Boothe">Powers Boothe</a>, <a href="Lee%20Van%20Cleef">Lee Van Cleef</a>, <a href="Jerry%20Orbach">Jerry Orbach</a>, and <a href="Kevin%20Conway%20%28actor%29">Kevin Conway</a> were considered for the role of Garry, and <a href="Richard%20Mulligan">Richard Mulligan</a> was also considered when the production experimented with the idea of making the character closer to MacReady in age. Masur also read for Garry, but he asked to play Clark instead, as he liked the character's dialogue and was also a fan of dogs. Masur worked daily with the <a href="wolfdog">wolfdog</a> <a href="Jed%20%28wolfdog%29">Jed</a> and his handler, Clint Rowe, during rehearsals, as Rowe was familiarizing Jed with the sounds and smells of people. This helped Masur's and Jed's performance on-screen, as the dog would stand next to him without looking for his handler. Masur described his character as one uninterested in people, but who loves working with dogs. He went to a survivalist store and bought a flip knife for his character, and used it in a confrontation with David's character. Masur turned down a role in "<a href="E.T.%20the%20Extra-Terrestrial">E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial</a>" to play Clark. <a href="William%20Daniels">William Daniels</a> and Dennehy were both interested in playing Dr. Copper, and it was a last-second decision by Carpenter to go with <a href="Richard%20Dysart">Richard Dysart</a>.

In early drafts, Windows was called Sanchez, and later Sanders. The name Windows came when the actor for the role, <a href="Thomas%20G.%20Waites">Thomas Waites</a>, was in a costume fitting and tried on a large pair of dark glasses, which the character wears in the film. <a href="Norbert%20Weisser">Norbert Weisser</a> portrays one of the Norwegians, and Jed appears uncredited as the Dog-Thing. The only female presence in the film is the voice of MacReady's chess computer, voiced by Carpenter's then-wife <a href="Adrienne%20Barbeau">Adrienne Barbeau</a>. Russell described the all-male story as interesting, since the men had no one to posture for without women. Foster, Franco, and Lancaster, along with other members of the crew, make a <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a> in a recovered photograph of the Norwegian team. Camera operator Ray Stella stood in for the shots where needles were used to take blood, telling Carpenter that he could do it all day. Franco also played the Norwegian wielding a rifle and hanging out of the helicopter during the opening sequence. Anita Dann served as casting director.

"The Thing" was storyboarded extensively by <a href="Mike%20Ploog">Mike Ploog</a> and <a href="Mentor%20Huebner">Mentor Huebner</a> before filming began. Their work was so detailed that many of the film's shots replicate the image layout completely. Cundey pushed for the use of <a href="anamorphic%20format">anamorphic format</a> aspect ratio, believing that it allowed for placing several actors in an environment, and making use of the scenic vistas available, while still creating a sense of confinement within the image. It also enabled the use of <a href="negative%20space">negative space</a> around the actors to imply something may be lurking just off-screen.
<a href="Principal%20photography">Principal photography</a> began on August 24, 1981, in Juneau, Alaska. Filming lasted approximately 12 weeks. Carpenter insisted on two weeks of rehearsals before filming as he wanted to see how scenes would play out. This was unusual at the time because of the expense involved. Filming then moved to the <a href="Universal%20Studios%20Lot">Universal lot</a>, where the outside heat was over . The internal sets were climate-controlled to to facilitate their work. The team considered building the sets inside an existing refrigerated structure, but were unable to find one large enough. Instead they collected as many portable air conditioners as they could, closed off the stage, and used <a href="humidifier">humidifier</a>s and <a href="Spray%20bottle">misters</a> to add moisture to the air. After watching a roughly assembled cut of filming to date, Carpenter was unhappy that the film seemed to feature too many scenes of men standing around talking. He rewrote some already completed scenes to take place outdoors to be shot on location when principal photography moved to <a href="Stewart%2C%20British%20Columbia">Stewart, British Columbia</a>.

Carpenter was determined to use authentic locations instead of studio sets, and his successes on "Halloween" and "<a href="The%20Fog">The Fog</a>" (1980) gave him the credibility to take on the much bigger-budget production of "The Thing". A film scout located an area just outside Stewart, along the Canadian coast, which offered the project both ease of access and scenic value during the day. On December 2, 1981, roughly 100 American and Canadian crew members moved to the area to begin filming. During the journey there, the crew bus slid in the snow toward the unprotected edge of the road, nearly sending it down a embankment. Some of the crew stayed in the small mining town during filming, while others lived on residential barges on the <a href="Portland%20Canal">Portland Canal</a>. They would make the drive up a small, winding road to the filming location in Alaska where the exterior outpost sets were built.

The sets had been built in Alaska during the summer, atop a rocky area overlooking a glacier, in preparation for snow to fall and cover them. They were used for both interior and exterior filming, meaning they could not be heated above freezing inside to ensure there was always snow on the roof. Outside, the temperature was so low that the camera lenses would freeze and break. The crew had to leave the cameras in the freezing temperatures, as keeping them inside in the warmth resulted in foggy lenses that took hours to clear. Filming, greatly dependent on the weather, took three weeks to complete, with heavy snow making it impossible to film on some days. It took eight hours to rig the explosives necessary to destroy the set in the film's finale.

Keith David broke his hand in a car accident the day before he was to begin shooting. David attended filming the next day, but when Carpenter and Franco saw his swollen hand, they sent him to the hospital where it was punctured with two pins. He returned wearing a surgical glove beneath a black glove that was painted to resemble his complexion. His left hand is not seen for the first half of the film. Carpenter filmed the Norwegian camp scenes after the end scenes, using the damaged American base as a stand-in for the charred Norwegian camp. The explosive destruction of the base required the camera assistants to stand inside the set with the explosives, which were activated remotely. The assistants then had to run to a safe distance while seven cameras captured the base's destruction. Filmed when the heavy use of <a href="special%20effect">special effect</a>s was rare, the actors had to adapt to having Carpenter describe to them what their characters were looking at, as the effects would not be added until post-production. There were some puppets used to create the impression of what was happening in the scene, but in other cases the cast would be looking at a wall or an object marked with an "X".

Art director <a href="John%20J.%20Lloyd">John J. Lloyd</a> oversaw the design and construction of all the sets, as there were no existing locations used in the film. Cundey suggested that the sets should have ceilings and pipes seen on camera to make the spaces seem more claustrophobic.

Several scenes in the script were omitted from the film, sometimes because there was too much dialogue that slowed the pace and undermined the suspense. Carpenter blamed some of the issues on his directorial method, noting that several scenes appeared to be repeating events or information. Another scene featuring a snowmobile chase pursuing dogs was removed from the shooting script as it would have been too expensive to film. One scene present in the film, but not the script, features a monologue by MacReady. Carpenter added this partly to establish what was happening in the story, and because he wanted to highlight Russell's heroic character after taking over the camp. Carpenter said that Lancaster's experience writing ensemble pieces did not emphasize single characters. Since "Halloween," several horror films had replicated many of the scare elements of that film, something Carpenter wanted to move away from for "The Thing." He removed scenes from Lancaster's script that had been filmed, such as a body suddenly falling into view at the Norwegian camp, which he felt were too clichéd. Approximately three minutes of scenes were filmed from Lancaster's script that elaborated on the characters' backgrounds.

A scene with MacReady absentmindedly inflating a <a href="Sex%20doll">blow-up doll</a> while watching the Norwegian tapes was filmed but was not in the finished film. The doll would later appear as a <a href="jump%20scare">jump scare</a> with Nauls. Other scenes featured expanded or alternate deaths for various characters. In the finished film, Fuchs's charred bones are discovered, revealing he has died off -screen, but an alternate take sees his corpse impaled on a wall with a shovel. Nauls was scripted to appear in the finale as a partly assimilated mass of tentacles, but in the film he simply disappears. Carpenter struggled with a method of conveying to the audience what assimilation by the creature actually meant. Lancaster's original set piece of Bennings's death had him pulled beneath a sheet of ice by the Thing, before resurfacing in different areas in various stages of assimilation. The scene called for a set to be built on one of Universal's largest stages, with sophisticated hydraulics, dogs, and flamethrowers, but it was deemed too costly to produce. A scene was filmed with Bennings being murdered by an unknown assailant, but it was felt that assimilation, leading to his death, was not explained enough. Short on time, and with no interior sets remaining, a small set was built, Maloney was covered with <a href="K-Y%20Jelly">K-Y Jelly</a>, orange dye, and rubber tentacles. Monster gloves for a different creature were repurposed to demonstrate partial assimilation.

Carpenter filmed multiple endings for "The Thing", including a "happier" ending because editor Todd Ramsay thought that the bleak, <a href="nihilism">nihilistic</a> conclusion would not test well with audiences. In the alternate take, MacReady is rescued and given a blood test that proves he is not infected. Carpenter said that stylistically this ending would have been "cheesy". Editor <a href="Verna%20Fields">Verna Fields</a> was tasked with reworking the ending to add clarity and resolution. It was finally decided to create an entirely new scene, which omitted the suspicion of Childs being infected by removing him completely, leaving MacReady alone. This new ending tested only slightly better with audiences than the original, and the production team agreed to the studio's request to use it. It was set to go to print for theaters when the producers, Carpenter, and executive Helena Hacker decided that the film was better left with ambiguity instead of nothing at all. Carpenter gave his approval to restore the ambiguous ending, but a scream was inserted over the outpost explosion to posit the monster's death. Universal executive <a href="Sidney%20Sheinberg">Sidney Sheinberg</a> disliked the ending's nihilism and, according to Carpenter, said, "Think about how the audience will react if we see the [Thing] die with a giant orchestra playing". Carpenter later noted that both the original ending and the ending without Childs tested poorly with audiences, which he interpreted as the film simply not being heroic enough.

<a href="Ennio%20Morricone">Ennio Morricone</a> composed the film's score, as Carpenter wanted "The Thing" to have a European musical approach. Carpenter flew to Rome to speak with Morricone to convince him to take the job. By the time Morricone flew to Los Angeles to record the score, he had already developed a tape filled with an array of synthesizer music because he was unsure what type of score Carpenter wanted. Morricone wrote complete separate orchestral and synthesizer scores and a combined score, which he knew was Carpenter's preference. Carpenter picked a piece, closely resembling his own scores, that became the main theme used throughout the film. He also played the score from "Escape from New York" for Morricone as an example. Morricone made several more attempts, bringing the score closer to Carpenter's own style of music. In total, Morricone produced a score of approximately one hour that remained largely unused, but was later released as part of the film's soundtrack. Carpenter and his longtime collaborator <a href="Alan%20Howarth%20%28composer%29">Alan Howarth</a> separately developed some synth-styled pieces used in the film. In 2012, Morricone recalled:

I've asked [Carpenter], as he was preparing some electronic music with an assistant to edit on the film, "Why did you call me, if you want to do it on your own?" He surprised me, he said – "I got married to your music. This is why I've called you." ... Then when he showed me the film, later when I wrote the music, we didn't exchange ideas. He ran away, nearly ashamed of showing it to me. I wrote the music on my own without his advice. Naturally, as I had become quite clever since 1982, I've written several scores relating to my life. And I had written one, which was electronic music. And [Carpenter] took the electronic score.

Carpenter said:

[Morricone] did all the orchestrations and recorded for me 20 minutes of music I could use wherever I wished but without seeing any footage. I cut his music into the film and realized that there were places, mostly scenes of tension, in which his music would not work... I secretly ran off and recorded in a couple of days a few pieces to use. My pieces were very simple electronic pieces – it was almost tones. It was not really music at all but just background sounds, something today you might even consider as sound effects.

"The Thing"s special effects were largely designed by Bottin, who had previously worked with Carpenter on "The Fog" (1980). When Bottin joined the project in mid-1981, pre-production was in progress, but no design had been settled on for the alien. Artist Dale Kuipers had created some preliminary paintings of the creature's look, but he left the project after being hospitalized following a traffic accident before he could develop them further with Bottin. Carpenter conceived the Thing as a single creature, but Bottin suggested that it should be constantly changing and able to look like anything. Carpenter initially considered Bottin's description of his ideas as "too weird", and had him work with Ploog to sketch them instead. As part of the Thing's design, it was agreed anyone assimilated by it would be a perfect imitation and would not know they were the Thing. The actors spent hours during rehearsals discussing whether they would know they were the Thing when taken over. Clennon said that it did not matter, because everyone acted, looked and smelled exactly the same before being taken over. At its peak, Bottin had a 35-person crew of artists and technicians, and he found it difficult to work with so many people. To help manage the team, he hired Erik Jensen, a special effects line producer who he had worked with on "<a href="The%20Howling%20%28film%29">The Howling</a>" (1981), to be in charge of the special make-up effects unit. Bottin's crew also included mechanical aspect supervisor Dave Kelsey, make-up aspect coordinator Ken Diaz, <a href="moldmaker">moldmaker</a> Gunnar Ferdinansen, and Bottin's longtime friend Margaret Beserra, who managed painting and hair work.
In designing the Thing's different forms, Bottin explained that the creature had been all over the galaxy. This allowed it to call on different attributes as necessary, such as stomachs that transform into giant mouths and spider legs sprouting from heads. Bottin said the pressure he experienced caused him to dream about working on designs, some of which he would take note of after waking. One abandoned idea included a series of dead baby monsters, which was deemed "too gross". Bottin admitted he had no idea how his designs would be implemented practically, but Carpenter did not reject them. Carpenter said, "what I didn't want to end up with in this movie was a guy in a suit ... I grew up as a kid watching science-fiction monster movies, and it was always a guy in a suit." According to Cundey, Bottin was very sensitive about his designs, and worried about the film showing too many of them. At one point, as a preemptive move against any censorship, Bottin suggested making the creature's violent transformations and the appearance of the internal organs more fantastical using colors. The decision was made to tone down the color of the blood and viscera, although much of the filming had been completed by that point. The creature effects used a variety of materials including mayonnaise, creamed corn, microwaved bubble gum, and K-Y Jelly.

During filming, then-21-year-old Bottin was hospitalized for exhaustion, <a href="double%20pneumonia">double pneumonia</a>, and a bleeding ulcer, caused by his extensive workload. Bottin himself explained he would "hoard the work", opting to be directly involved in many of the complicated tasks. His dedication to the project saw him spend over a year living on the Universal lot. Bottin said he did not take a day off during that time, and slept on the sets or in locker rooms. To take some pressure off his crew, Bottin enlisted the aid of special effects creator <a href="Stan%20Winston">Stan Winston</a> to complete some of the designs, primarily the Dog-Thing. With insufficient time to create a sophisticated mechanical creature, Winston opted to create a <a href="hand%20puppet">hand puppet</a>. A cast was made of makeup artists <a href="Lance%20Anderson">Lance Anderson</a>'s arm and head, around which the Dog-Thing was sculpted in oil-based clay. The final foam-latex puppet, worn by Anderson, featured radio-controlled eyes and cable-controlled legs, and was operated from below a raised set on which the kennel was built. Slime from the puppet would leak onto Anderson during the two days it took to film the scene, and he had to wear a helmet to protect himself from the <a href="Squib%20%28explosive%29">explosive squibs</a> simulating gunfire. Anderson pulled the tentacles into the Dog-Thing and <a href="reverse%20motion">reverse motion</a> was used to create the effect of them slithering from its body. Winston refused to be credited for his work, insisting that Bottin deserved sole credit; Winston was given a "thank you" in the credits instead.
In the "chest chomp" scene, Dr. Copper attempts to revive Norris with a defibrillator. Revealing himself as the Thing, Norris-Thing's chest transforms into a large mouth that severs Copper's arms. Bottin accomplished this scene by recruiting a double amputee and fitting him with prosthetic arms filled with wax bones, rubber veins and Jell-O. The arms were then placed into the practical stomach mouth where the mechanical jaws clamped down on them, at which point the actor pulled away, severing the false arms. The effect of the Norris-Thing's head detaching from the body to save itself took many months of testing before Bottin was satisfied enough to film it. The scene involved a fire effect, but the crew were unaware that fumes from the rubber foam chemicals inside the puppet were flammable. The fire ignited the fumes, creating a large fireball that engulfed the puppet. It suffered only minimal damage after the fire had been put out, and the crew successfully filmed the scene. <a href="Stop-motion">Stop-motion</a> expert <a href="Randall%20William%20Cook">Randall William Cook</a> developed a sequence for the end of the film where MacReady is confronted by the gigantic Blair-Thing. Cook created a miniature model of the set and filmed wide-angle shots of the monster in stop motion, but Carpenter was not convinced by the effect and used only a few seconds of it. It took 50 people to operate the actual Blair-Thing puppet.

The production intended to use a camera centrifuge—a rotating drum with a fixed camera platform—for the Palmer-Thing scene, allowing him to seem to run straight up the wall and across the ceiling. Again, the cost was too high and the idea abandoned for a stuntman falling into frame onto a floor made to look like the outpost's ceiling. Stuntman Anthony Cecere stood in for the Palmer-Thing after MacReady sets it on fire and it crashes through the outpost wall.

Cundey worked with Bottin to determine the appropriate lighting for each creature. He wanted to show off Bottin's work because of its detailing, but he was conscious that showing too much would reveal its artificial nature, breaking the illusion. Each encounter with the creature was planned for areas where they could justify using a series of small lights to highlight the particular creature-model's surface and textures. Cundey would illuminate the area behind the creature to detail its overall shape. He worked with <a href="Panasonic">Panasonic</a> and a few other companies to develop a camera capable of automatically adjusting light exposure at different film speeds. He wanted to try filming the creature at fast and slow speeds thinking this would create a more interesting visual effect, but they were unable to accomplish this at the time. For the rest of the set, Cundey created a contrast by lighting the interiors with warmer lights hung overhead in conical shades so that they could still control the lighting and have darkened areas on set. The outside was constantly bathed in a cold, blue light that Cundey had discovered being used on airport runways. The reflective surface of the snow and the blue light helped create the impression of coldness. The team also made use of the flamethrowers and magenta-hued flares used by the actors to create dynamic lighting.

The team originally wanted to shoot the film in <a href="black%20and%20white">black and white</a>, but Universal was reluctant as it could affect their ability to sell the television rights for the film. Instead, Cundey suggested muting the colors as much as possible. The inside of the sets was painted in neutral colors such as gray, and many of the props were also painted gray, while the costumes were a mix of somber browns, blues, and grays. They relied on the lighting to add color. <a href="Albert%20Whitlock">Albert Whitlock</a> provided <a href="matte%20%28filmmaking%29">matte</a>-painted backdrops, including the scene in which the Americans discover the giant alien spaceship buried in the ice. A scene where MacReady walks up to a hole in the ice where the alien had been buried was filmed at Universal, while the surrounding area including the alien spaceship, helicopter, and snow were all painted.

Carpenter's friend John Wash, who developed the opening computer simulation for "Escape from New York", designed the computer program showing how the Thing assimilates other organisms. Model maker Susan Turner built the alien ship approaching Earth in the pre-credits sequence, which featured 144 <a href="Strobe%20light">strobing lights</a>. <a href="Drew%20Struzan">Drew Struzan</a> designed the film's poster. He completed it in 24 hours, based only on a briefing, knowing little about the film.

The lack of information about the film's special effects drew the attention of film exhibitors in early 1982. They wanted reassurance that "The Thing" was a first-rate production capable of attracting audiences. Cohen and Foster, with a specially employed editor and Universal's archive of music, put together a 20-minute <a href="showreel">showreel</a> emphasizing action and suspense. They used available footage, including alternate and extended scenes not in the finished film, but avoided revealing the special effects as much as possible. The reaction from the exclusively male exhibitors was generally positive, and Universal executive <a href="Robert%20Rehme">Robert Rehme</a> told Cohen that the studio was counting on "The Thing"s success, as they expected "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" to appeal only to children. While finalizing the film, Universal sent Carpenter a demographic study showing that the audience appeal of horror films had declined by 70% over the previous six months. Carpenter considered this a suggestion that he lower his expectations of the film's performance. After one market research screening, Carpenter queried the audience on their thoughts, and one audience member asked, "Well what happened in the very end? Which one was the Thing...?" When Carpenter responded that it was up to their imagination, the audience member responded, "Oh, God. I hate that."

After returning from a screening of "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", the audience's silence at a "The Thing" trailer caused Foster to remark, "We're dead". The response to public pre-screenings of "The Thing" resulted in the studio changing the somber, black-and-white advertising approved by the producers to a color image of a person with a glowing face. The tagline was also changed from "Man is the warmest place to hide"—written by Stephen Frankfort, who wrote the "Alien" tagline, "In space, no one can hear you scream"—to "The ultimate in alien terror", trying to capitalize on "Alien"s audience. Carpenter attempted to make a last-minute change of the film's title to "Who Goes There?", to no avail. The week before its release, Carpenter promoted the film with clips on "<a href="Late%20Night%20with%20David%20Letterman">Late Night with David Letterman</a>". In 1981, horror magazine "<a href="Fangoria">Fangoria</a>" held a contest encouraging readers to submit drawings of what the Thing would look like. Winners were rewarded with a trip to Universal Studios. On its opening day, a special screening was held at the <a href="Hollywood%20Pacific%20Theatre">Hollywood Pacific Theatre</a>, presided over by <a href="Cassandra%20Peterson">Elvira, Mistress of the Dark</a>, with free admission for those in costume as monsters.

"The Thing" was released in the United States on June 25, 1982. During its opening weekend, the film earned $3.1 million from 840 theaters—an average of $3,699 per theater—finishing as the number eight film of the weekend behind supernatural horror "<a href="Poltergeist%20%281982%20film%29">Poltergeist</a>" ($4.1 million), which was in its fourth weekend of release, and ahead of action film "<a href="Megaforce">Megaforce</a>" ($2.3 million). It dropped out of the top 10 grossing films after three weeks. It ended its run earning a total of $19.6 million against its $15 million budget, making it only the 42nd highest-grossing film of 1982. It was not a <a href="box%20office%20bomb">box office failure</a>, nor was it a hit.

Since its release, cultural historians and critics have attempted to understand what led to "The Thing"s initial failure to connect with audiences. In a 1999 interview, Carpenter said audiences rejected "The Thing" for its nihilistic, depressing viewpoint at a time when the United States was in the midst of a recession. When it opened, it was competing against the critically and commercially successful "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" ($619 million), a more family-friendly film released two weeks earlier that offered a more optimistic take on alien visitation. Carpenter described it as the complete opposite of his film. "The Thing" opened on the same day as the <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>", which debuted as the number two film that weekend with a take of $6.1 million and went on to earn $33.8 million. It was also regarded as a critical and commercial failure at the time. Others blamed an oversaturation of science fiction and fantasy films released that year, including "<a href="Conan%20the%20Barbarian%20%281982%20film%29">Conan the Barbarian</a>" ($130 million), "Poltergeist" ($121.7 million), "<a href="The%20Road%20Warrior">The Road Warrior</a>" ($34.5 million), "" ($97 million), and "<a href="Tron">Tron</a>" ($33 million). Some analysts blamed Universal's poor marketing, which did not compete with the deluge of promotion for prominent films released that summer.

Another factor was the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America%20film%20rating%20system">R rating</a> it was given, restricting the audience to those over the age of 17 unless accompanied by an adult. "Poltergeist" received a PG rating, allowing families and younger children to view it.

The film received negative reviews on its release, and hostility for its cynical, anti-authoritarian tone and graphic special effects. "<a href="Cinefantastique">Cinefantastique</a>" printed an issue with "The Thing" on its cover asking, "Is this the most hated movie of all time?" Some reviewers were dismissive of the film, calling it the "quintessential moron movie of the 80's", "instant junk", and a "wretched excess". "<a href="Starlog">Starlog</a>"s Alan Spencer called it a "cold and sterile" horror movie attempting to cash in on the genre audience, against the "optimism of "E.T.", the reassuring return of "Star Trek II", the technical perfection of "Tron", and the sheer integrity of "Blade Runner"".

The plot was criticized as "boring", and undermined by the special effects. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>"s Linda Gross said that "The Thing" was "bereft, despairing, and nihilistic", and lacking in feeling, meaning the characters' deaths did not matter. Spencer said it featured sloppy continuity, lacked pacing, and was devoid of warmth or humanity. David Ansen of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" felt the film confused the use of effects with creating suspense, and that it lacked drama by "sacrificing everything at the altar of gore". The "<a href="Chicago%20Reader">Chicago Reader</a>"s Dave Kehr considered the dialogue to be banal and interchangeable, making the characters seem and sound alike. "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s Gary Arnold said it was a witty touch to open with the Thing having already overcome the Norwegian base, defeating the type of traps seen in the 1951 version, while "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>"s <a href="David%20Denby">David Denby</a> lamented that the Thing's threat is only shown externally, without focusing on what it is like for someone who thinks they have been taken over. <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> considered the film to be scary, but offering nothing original beyond the special effects, while "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>"s <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> said it was entertaining only if the viewer needed to see spider-legged heads and dog autopsies.

Reviews of the actors' performances were generally positive, while criticizing the depictions of the characters they portrayed. Ebert said they lacked characterization, offering basic stereotypes that existed just to be killed, and Spencer called the characters bland even though the actors do the best they can with the material. "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"s <a href="Richard%20Schickel">Richard Schickel</a> singled Russell out as the "stalwart" hero, where other characters were not as strongly or wittily characterized, and "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" said that Russell's heroic status was undercut by the "suicidal" attitude adopted toward the film's finale. Other reviews criticized implausibilities such as characters wandering off alone. Kehr did not like that the men did not band together against the Thing, and several reviews noted a lack of camaraderie and romance, which Arnold said reduced any interest beyond the special effects.

The film's special effects were simultaneously lauded and lambasted for being technically brilliant but visually repulsive and excessive. Reviews called Bottin's work "genius", noting the designs were novel, unforgettable, "colorfully horrific", and called him a "master of the macabre". Arnold said that the "chest chomp" scene demonstrated "appalling creativity" and the subsequent severed head scene was "madly macabre", comparing them to "Alien"s chest burster and severed head scenes. "Variety" called it "the most vividly gruesome horror film to ever stalk the screens". Conversely, Denby called them more disgusting than frightening, and lamented that the trend of horror films to open the human body more and more bordered on obscenity, Spencer said that Bottin's care and pride in his craft was shown in the effects, but both they and Schickel found them to be overwhelming and "squandered" without strong characters and story Even so, Canby said that the effects were too "phony looking to be disgusting". Canby and Arnold said the creature's lack of a single, discernible shape was to its detriment, and hiding it inside humans made it hard to follow. Arnold said that the 1951 version was less versatile, but easier to keep in focus.

Gross and Spencer praised the film's technical achievements, particularly Cundey's "frostbitten" cinematography, the sound, editing, and Morricone's score. Spencer was critical of Carpenter's direction, saying it was his "futile" attempt to give the audience what he thinks they want and that Carpenter was not meant to direct science fiction, but was instead suited to direct "traffic accidents, train wrecks, and public floggings". Ansen said that "atrocity for atrocity's sake" was ill-becoming of Carpenter.

"The Thing" was often compared to similar films, particularly "Alien", "<a href="Invasion%20of%20the%20Body%20Snatchers%20%281978%20film%29">Invasion of the Body Snatchers</a>" (1978), and "The Thing from Another World". Ebert and Denby said that "The Thing" seemed derivative compared to those films, which had portrayed the story in a better way. "Variety" called it inferior to the 1951 version. Arnold considered "The Thing" as the end result of "Alien" raising the requirement for horrific spectacle.

"The Thing from Another World" actor <a href="Kenneth%20Tobey">Kenneth Tobey</a> and director Christian Nyby also criticized the film. Nyby said, "If you want blood, go to the slaughterhouse ... All in all, it’s a terrific commercial for <a href="Justerini%20%26amp%3B%20Brooks">J&B Scotch</a>". Tobey singled out the visual effects, saying they "were so explicit that they actually destroyed how you were supposed to feel about the characters ... They became almost a movie in themselves, and were a little too horrifying." In his book "Science Fiction" (1984), <a href="Phil%20Hardy%20%28journalist%29">Phil Hardy</a> described the film as a "surprising failure" and called it "Carpenter's most unsatisfying film to date". The review noted that the narrative "seems little more than an excuse for the various set-pieces of special effects and Russell's hero is no more than a cypher compared to Tobey's rounded character in Howard Hawks' "The Thing"". Clennon said that introductory scenes for the characters, omitted from the film, made it hard for audiences to connect with them, robbing it of some of the broader appeal of "Alien".

"The Thing" received nominations from the <a href="Academy%20of%20Science%20Fiction%2C%20Fantasy%20and%20Horror%20Films">Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Films</a> for <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Horror%20Film">Best Horror Film</a> and <a href="Saturn%20Award%20for%20Best%20Special%20Effects">Best Special Effects</a>, but lost to "Poltergeist" and "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial", respectively. The film was nominated in the <a href="Razzie%20Awards">Razzie Awards</a> for <a href="Golden%20Raspberry%20Award%20for%20Worst%20Musical%20Score">Worst Musical Score</a>.

The impact on Carpenter was immediate—he lost the job of directing the 1984 science fiction horror film "<a href="Firestarter%20%28film%29">Firestarter</a>" because of "The Thing"s poor performance. His previous success had gained him a multiple-film contract at Universal, but the studio opted to buy him out of it instead. He continued making films afterward but lost confidence, and did not openly talk about "The Thing"s failure until a 1985 interview with "Starlog", where he said, "I was called 'a pornographer of violence' ... I had no idea it would be received that way ... "The Thing" was just too strong for that time. I knew it was going to be strong, but I didn't think it would be too strong ... I didn't take the public's taste into consideration." Shortly after its release, Wilbur Stark sued Universal for $43 million for "slander, breach of contract, fraud and deceit", alleging he incurred a financial loss by Universal failing to credit him properly in its marketing and by showing his name during the end credits, a less prestigious position. Stark also said that he "contributed greatly to the [screenplay]". David Foster responded that Stark was not involved with the film's production in any way, and received proper credit in all materials. Stark later sued for a further $15 million over Foster's comments. The outcome of the lawsuits is unknown.

While "The Thing" was not initially successful, it was able to find new audiences and appreciation on <a href="home%20video">home video</a>, and later on television. Sidney Sheinberg edited a version of the film for network television broadcast, which added narration and a different ending, where the Thing imitates a dog and escapes the ruined camp. Carpenter disowned this version, and theorized that Sheinberg had been mad at him for not taking his creative ideas on board for the theatrical cut.

"The Thing" was released on <a href="DVD">DVD</a> in 1998 and featured additional content, such as "The Thing: Terror Takes Shape"—a detailed documentary on the production, deleted and alternate scenes, and commentary by Carpenter and Russell. An <a href="HD%20DVD">HD DVD</a> version followed in 2006 containing the same features, and a <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> version in 2008 featuring just the Carpenter and Russell commentary, and some behind-the-scenes videos available via <a href="picture-in-picture">picture-in-picture</a> during the film. A 2016 Blu-ray release featured a <a href="2K%20resolution">2K resolution</a> restoration of the film, overseen by Dean Cundey. As well as including previous features such as the commentary and "Terror Takes Shape", it added interviews with the cast and crew, and segments that focus on the music, writing, editing, Ploog's artwork, an interview with <a href="Alan%20Dean%20Foster">Alan Dean Foster</a>, who wrote the film's <a href="novelization">novelization</a>, and the television broadcast version of "The Thing" that runs 15 minutes shorter than the theatrical cut. A <a href="4K%20resolution">4K resolution</a> restoration was released in 2017 on Blu-ray, initially as a United Kingdom exclusive with a limited run of 8,000 units. The restoration was created using the original <a href="film%20negative">film negative</a>, and was overseen by Carpenter and Cundey.

MCA released the soundtrack for "The Thing" in 1982. <a href="Var%C3%A8se%20Sarabande">Varèse Sarabande</a> re-released it in 1991 on <a href="compact%20disc">compact disc</a> and <a href="Compact%20Cassette">Compact Cassette</a>. These versions eventually ceased being manufactured. In 2011, Howarth and Larry Hopkins restored Morricone's score using updated digital techniques, and arranged each track in the order it appears in the film. The album also includes tracks composed by Carpenter and Howarth for the film. A remastered version of the score was released on <a href="Phonograph%20record">vinyl</a> on February 23, 2017; a deluxe edition included an exclusive interview with Carpenter.

The central theme of "The Thing" concerns paranoia and mistrust. Fundamentally, the film is about the erosion of trust in a small community, instigated by different forms of paranoia caused by the possibility of someone not being who they say they are, or that your best friend may be your enemy. It represents the distrust that humans always have for somebody else and the fear of betrayal by those we know and, ultimately, our bodies. The theme remains timely because the subject of paranoia adapts to the age. "The Thing" focuses on being unable to trust one's peers, but this can be interpreted as distrust of entire institutions.

Developed in an era of <a href="cold-war">cold-war</a> tensions between the United States and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, the film refers to the threat of nuclear annihilation by <a href="Mutual%20assured%20destruction">mutually assured destruction</a>. "Diabolique"s Daniel Clarkson Fisher notes that MacReady destroys the chess computer after being <a href="checkmate">checkmate</a>d, and similarly vows to destroy the Thing, even at the expense of the team. The Cold War-style isolationism hurts the group, while a lack of trust destroys it. <a href="Screen%20Rant">Screen Rant</a>s Michael Edward Taylor draws allusions between "The Thing" and the accusatory <a href="Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a>s and <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a>, as the film conveys an anti-communist fear of infection of civilized areas that will lead to assimilation and imitation. "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"s John Lingsan said the men display a level of post-<a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> (1955-1975) "fatigued counterculturalism"—the rejection of conventional <a href="social%20norm">social norm</a>s, each defined by their own eccentricities.

Lancaster's script eschews female characters because he believed that a female character was a love interest who inevitably gets in the way. "<a href="The%20Atlantic">The Atlantic</a>"s Noah Berlatsky said that unlike typical horror genre films, females are excluded, allowing the Thing to be identified as a fear of not being a man, or being homosexual. Indeed, several assimilations involve penetration, tentacles, and in Norris's case, opened up at the stomach to birth his own replica. The slasher genre favors female stars as they are perceived as weaker and therefore more empathetic, providing a cathartic release when they defeat the villain, but in "The Thing" the men are not meant to survive. "<a href="Vice%20%28magazine%29">Vice</a>"s Patrick Marlborough considered "The Thing" to be a critical take on masculinity. Identifying the Thing requires intimacy, confession, and empathy to out the creature, but masculinity prevents this as an option. Trapped by pride and stunted emotional growth, the men are unable to confront the truth out of fear of embarrassment or exposure. Berlatsky noted that MacReady avoids emotional attachments and is the most paranoid, allowing him to be the hero. This detachment works against him in the finale, which leaves MacReady locked in a futile mistrust with Childs, each not really knowing the other.

<a href="Nerdist%20Industries">Nerdist</a>'s Kyle Anderson and "<a href="Strange%20Horizons">Strange Horizons</a>"s Orrin Grey analyzed "The Thing" as an example of author <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>'s <a href="cosmic%20horror">cosmic horror</a>, the notion that ancient, inhuman beings exist that do not care about humanity in any way. This also includes the fear of losing one's humanity, and being consumed, figuratively or literally, by these ancient eldritch behemoths. The Thing is a being beyond our understanding and possesses the ability to destroy all life on Earth quickly. Just as Lovecraft left his creatures undescribed, the Thing can be seen, but its shape is mostly indescribable, beyond the realm of human knowledge. Grey said that MacReady represents a more traditional Hollywood film protagonist, but Blair represents the Lovecraftian protagonist, who succumbs to his fear of the creature, is driven insane by the implications of its nature, and eventually becomes what he fears.

The Thing never speaks or gives a motive for its actions, and ruthlessly pursues its goal. Grey describes the creature as fear of the loss of self. It attacks, consumes and imitates an individual perfectly with memories and behaviors. The original is subsumed by an alien copy that is virtually impossible to identify. "<a href="Dennis%20Publishing">Den of Geek!</a>"s Mark Harrison and Ryan Lambie said that the essence of humanity is free will, which is stripped away by the Thing, possibly without the individual being aware that they have been taken over. In a 1982 interview, when given the option to describe "The Thing" as "pro-science" like "Who Goes There?" or "anti-science" like "The Thing from Another World", Carpenter chose "pro-human", stating, "It's better to be a human being than an imitation, or let ourselves be taken over by this creature who's not necessarily evil, but whose nature it is to simply imitate, like a chameleon." Further allusions have been drawn between the blood-test scene and the <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20the%20United%20States">epidemic of HIV</a> at the time, which could only be identified by a blood test.

Many theories have been developed to explain the film's ambiguous ending. Dean Cundey deliberately provided a subtle illumination to the eyes of the uninfected characters. In an interview with <a href="Blumhouse%20Productions">Blumhouse</a> he said, "There's always an eye light, we call it, a little gleam in the eye of the actor. It gives life." Other theories seize on the lack of visible breath from Childs in the Antarctic air, although this has been explained as an issue with the scene lighting. Keith David said, "When I watched it again, I wouldn’t doubt — I’ve never asked, I haven’t seen John [Carpenter], but the next time I see John I want to ask him, ‘How much of that was put in post?’ Everything [Kurt] says, you see some smoke. Of course, now I see it. Conspicuously, there’s none coming out of mine.” Another theory postulates that the bottle that MacReady gives to Childs is actually a leftover molotov cocktail and thus contains gasoline. Regarding this theory, Kurt Russell has said, “John Carpenter and I worked on the ending of that movie together a long time. We were both bringing the audience right back to square one. At the end of the day, that was the position these people were in. They just didn’t know anything." Carpenter summarised, "Now, I do know, in the end, who the Thing is, but I cannot tell you."

In the years following its release, critics and fans have reevaluated "The Thing" as a milestone of the horror genre. A prescient review by <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a> in 1992, called "The Thing" "a black, memorable film [that] may yet be seen as a classic". It has been called one of, if not the best film directed by Carpenter. <a href="John%20Kenneth%20Muir">John Kenneth Muir</a> called it "Carpenter's most accomplished and underrated directorial effort," and critic <a href="Matt%20Zoller%20Seitz">Matt Zoller Seitz</a> said it "is one of the greatest and most elegantly constructed B-movies ever made".

Trace Thurman described it as one of the best films ever, and in 2008, "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine selected it as one of The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time, calling it "a peerless masterpiece of relentless suspense, retina-wrecking visual excess and outright, nihilistic terror". It is now considered to be one of the greatest horror films ever made, and a classic of the genre. Several publications have called it one of the best films of 1982, including <a href="Filmsite.org">Filmsite.org</a>, <a href="Film.com">Film.com</a>, and "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>". Muir called it "the best science fiction-horror film of 1982, an incredibly competitive year, and perhaps even the best genre motion picture of the decade". "<a href="Complex%20%28magazine%29">Complex</a>" named it the ninth-best of the decade, calling it the "greatest genre remake of all time". Numerous publications have ranked it as one of the best science fiction films, including number four by <a href="IGN">IGN</a> (2016); number 12 by "<a href="Thrillist">Thrillist</a>" (2018); number 17 by "<a href="GamesRadar%2B">GamesRadar+</a>" (2018); number 31 by "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" (2018); number 32 by "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>" (2015) and "<a href="Popular%20Mechanics">Popular Mechanics</a>" (2017); and number 76 by <a href="Rotten%20Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> (2017) based on its average review score.

Similarly, "The Thing" has appeared on several lists of the top horror films, including number one by "<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>"; number two by <a href="Bloody%20Disgusting">Bloody Disgusting</a> (2018); number four by "Empire" (2016); and number six by "<a href="Time%20Out%20%28magazine%29">Time Out</a>" (2016). "Empire" listed its poster as the 43rd best film poster ever. In 2016, the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a> named it one of 10 great films about aliens visiting Earth. It was voted the ninth best horror film of all time in a "Rolling Stone" readers poll, and is considered one of the best examples of <a href="body%20horror">body horror</a>. Contemporary review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes offers an 84% approval rating from 61 critics—an average rating of 7.4/10, which provides the consensus, "Grimmer and more terrifying than the 1950s take, John Carpenter's "The Thing" is a tense sci-fi thriller rife with compelling tension and some remarkable make-up effects." The film also has a score of 57 out of 100 on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a> based on 13 critical reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".

In a 2011 interview, Carpenter remarked that it was close to, if not, his favorite film from his own filmography. He lamented that it took a long time for "The Thing" to find a wider audience, saying, "If "The Thing" had been a hit, my career would have been different. I wouldn't have had to make the choices that I made. But I needed a job. I'm not saying I hate the movies I did. I loved making "<a href="Christine%20%281983%20film%29">Christine</a>" (1983) and "<a href="Starman%20%28film%29">Starman</a>" (1984) and "<a href="Big%20Trouble%20In%20Little%20China">Big Trouble In Little China</a>" (1986), all those films. But my career would have been different."

The film has had a significant impact on popular culture, and by 1998, "The Thing" was already considered a <a href="Cult%20film">cult classic</a>. It has been referred to in a variety of media, from television (including "<a href="Stranger%20Things">Stranger Things</a>", "<a href="The%20X-Files">The X-Files</a>", and "<a href="Futurama">Futurama</a>") to video games ("<a href="Resident%20Evil%204">Resident Evil 4</a>" and "<a href="Tomb%20Raider%20III">Tomb Raider III</a>") and films ("<a href="The%20Faculty">The Faculty</a>" (1998), "<a href="Slither%20%282006%20film%29">Slither</a>" (2006), "<a href="The%20Mist%20%28film%29">The Mist</a>" (2007)). It is listed in the film reference book "<a href="1001%20Movies%20You%20Must%20See%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die</a>", which says "one of the most influential horror movies of the 1980s, much imitated but rarely bettered... It is one of the first films to unflinchingly show the rupture and warp of flesh and bone into grotesque tableaus of surreal beauty, forever raising the bar of cinematic horror."
Several filmmakers have spoken of their appreciation for "The Thing" or cited its influence on their own work, including <a href="Guillermo%20del%20Toro">Guillermo del Toro</a>, <a href="James%20DeMonaco">James DeMonaco</a>, <a href="J.%20J.%20Abrams">J. J. Abrams</a>, <a href="Neill%20Blomkamp">Neill Blomkamp</a>, <a href="David%20Robert%20Mitchell">David Robert Mitchell</a>, <a href="Rob%20Hardy">Rob Hardy</a>, <a href="Steven%20S.%20DeKnight">Steven S. DeKnight</a>, and <a href="Quentin%20Tarantino">Quentin Tarantino</a>. In 2011, "The New York Times" asked prominent horror filmmakers what film they had found the scariest. Two, <a href="John%20Sayles">John Sayles</a> and <a href="Edgar%20Wright">Edgar Wright</a>, cited "The Thing". The 2015 Tarantino film "<a href="The%20Hateful%20Eight">The Hateful Eight</a>" takes numerous cues from "The Thing", from featuring Russell in a starring role, to replicating themes of paranoia and mistrust between characters restricted to a single location, and even duplicating certain angles and layouts used by Carpenter and Cundey. Pieces of Morricone's unused score for "The Thing" were repurposed for "The Hateful Eight". Tarantino also cited "The Thing" as an inspiration for his 1992 film "<a href="Reservoir%20Dogs">Reservoir Dogs</a>".

The film is screened annually in February to mark the beginning of winter at the <a href="Amundsen%E2%80%93Scott%20South%20Pole%20Station">Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station</a>. In January 2010, "<a href="Clarkesworld%20Magazine">Clarkesworld Magazine</a>" published "The Things", a short story by <a href="Peter%20Watts%20%28author%29">Peter Watts</a> told from the Thing's point of view; it is unable to understand why humans are hostile toward it. The story received a 2011 <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Short%20Story%23Winners%20and%20nominees">nomination</a>. In 2017, a 400-page art book was released featuring art inspired by "The Thing", with contributions from 350 artists, a foreword by director <a href="Eli%20Roth">Eli Roth</a>, and an afterword by Carpenter. An excursion of fans to the filming location in Alaska is currently scheduled to take place in 2022, to celebrate the film's 40th anniversary.

The 2007 <a href="Halloween%20Horror%20Nights">Halloween Horror Nights</a> event at Universal Studios in Orlando, Florida, featured "The Thing: Assimilation", a <a href="haunted%20attraction%20%28simulated%29">haunted attraction</a> based on the film. The attraction included MacReady and Childs, both held in stasis, the Blair-Thing and the outpost kennel.

A novelization of the film was published by Alan Dean Foster in 1982. It is based on an earlier draft of the script and features some differences from the finished film. A scene in which MacReady, Bennings, and Childs chase infected dogs out into the snow is included, and Nauls's disappearance is explained: Cornered by the Blair-Thing, he chooses suicide over assimilation.

In 2000, <a href="McFarlane%20Toys">McFarlane Toys</a> released two "Movie Maniacs" figures: the Blair-Thing and the Norris-Thing, including its spider-legged, disembodied head. <a href="SOTA%20Toys">SOTA Toys</a> released a set featuring a MacReady figure and the Dog-Thing based on the film's kennel scene, and a bust of the Norris-Thing's spider-head. In 2017, <a href="Mondo%20%28American%20company%29">Mondo</a> and the Project Raygun division of <a href="USAopoly">USAopoly</a> released "The Thing: Infection at Outpost 31", a board game. Players take on the role of characters from the film or the Thing, each aiming to defeat the other through subterfuge and sabotage.

<a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a> published four comic book sequels starring MacReady, beginning in December 1991 with the two-part "The Thing from Another World" by <a href="Chuck%20Pfarrer">Chuck Pfarrer</a>, which is set 24 hours after the film. Pfarrer was reported to have pitched his comic tale to Universal as a sequel in the early 1990s. This was followed by the four-part "The Thing from Another World: Climate of Fear" in July 1992, the four-part "The Thing from Another World: Eternal Vows" in December 1993, and "The Thing from Another World: Questionable Research".

In 1999, Carpenter said that no serious discussions had taken place for a sequel, but he would be interested in basing one on Pfarrer's adaptation, calling the story a worthy sequel. A 2002 <a href="The%20Thing%20%28video%20game%29">video game of the same name</a> was released for <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a>, <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>, and <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a> to generally favorable reviews. The game's plot follows a team of U.S. soldiers investigating the aftermath of the film's events.

In 2005, the <a href="Syfy">Syfy</a> channel planned a four-hour miniseries sequel produced by <a href="Frank%20Darabont">Frank Darabont</a> and written by <a href="David%20Leslie%20Johnson">David Leslie Johnson</a>. The story follows a Russian team who recover the corpses of MacReady and Childs, and remnants of the Thing. The story moves forward 23 years, where the Thing escapes in New Mexico, and follows the attempts at containment. The project never proceeded, and Universal opted to continue with a feature film sequel. A prequel film, "<a href="The%20Thing%20%282011%20film%29">The Thing</a>", was released in October 2011 to a $27.4 million worldwide box office gross and mixed reviews. The story follows the events after the Norwegian team discovers the Thing.

Although released years apart, and unrelated in terms of plot, characters, crew, or even production studios, Carpenter considers "The Thing" to be the first installment in his "Apocalypse Trilogy", a series of films based around <a href="Cosmicism">cosmic horror</a>, entities unknown to man, that are threats to both human life and the sense of self. "The Thing" was followed by "<a href="Prince%20of%20Darkness%20%28film%29">Prince of Darkness</a>" in 1987, and "<a href="In%20the%20Mouth%20of%20Madness">In the Mouth of Madness</a>" in 1995. All three films are heavily influenced by Carpenter's appreciation for the works of <a href="H.%20P.%20Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a>.

Toledo War

The Toledo War (1835–36), also known as the Michigan–Ohio War, was an almost bloodless <a href="territorial%20dispute">boundary dispute</a> between the U.S. state of <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and the adjoining territory of <a href="Michigan%20Territory">Michigan</a>. 

Poor geographical understanding of the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a> helped produce conflicting state and federal legislation between 1787 and 1805, and varying interpretations of the laws led the governments of Ohio and Michigan to both claim <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a> over a region along the border, now known as the Toledo Strip. The situation came to a head when Michigan petitioned for <a href="U.S.%20state">statehood</a> in 1835 and sought to include the disputed territory within its boundaries. Both sides passed legislation attempting to force the other side's capitulation, while Ohio's <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Ohio">Governor</a> <a href="Robert%20Lucas%20%28governor%29">Robert Lucas</a> and Michigan's 24-year-old "Boy <a href="Governors%20of%20Michigan%20Territory">Governor</a>" <a href="Stevens%20T.%20Mason">Stevens T. Mason</a> helped institute criminal penalties for citizens submitting to the other's authority. Both states deployed militias on opposite sides of the <a href="Maumee%20River">Maumee River</a> near <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo</a>, but besides mutual taunting, there was little interaction between the two forces. The single military confrontation of the "war" ended with a report of shots being fired into the air, incurring no casualties.

During the summer of 1836, Congress proposed a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and about three-quarters of the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a>. The compromise was considered a poor outcome for Michigan. Voters in a state convention in September soundly rejected the proposal. But in December, the Michigan government, facing a dire financial crisis and pressure from Congress and President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, called another convention (called the "Frostbitten Convention") which accepted the compromise that resolved the Toledo War.

In 1787, the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederation">Congress of the Confederation</a> enacted the <a href="Northwest%20Ordinance">Northwest Ordinance</a>, which created the <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a> in what is now the upper <a href="Midwestern%20United%20States">Midwestern United States</a>. The Ordinance specified that the territory was eventually to be divided into "not less than three nor more than five" future states. It was determined that the north-south boundary for three of these states was to be "an east and west line drawn through the southerly bend or extreme of <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a>" (now known to be approximately 41.62° N, near <a href="Marquette%20Park%20%28Gary%29">Marquette Park</a>, Gary, Indiana).
At the time, the actual location of this extreme was unknown. The most highly regarded map of the time, the "<a href="Mitchell%20Map">Mitchell Map</a>", placed it at a latitude near the mouth of the <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit River</a> (approximately 42.05° N). This meant that the entire shoreline of <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a> west of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> would have belonged to the state that was to become Ohio. When Congress passed the <a href="Enabling%20Act%20of%201802">Enabling Act of 1802</a>, which authorized Ohio to begin the process of becoming a <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a>, the language defining Ohio's northern boundary differed slightly from that used in the Northwest Ordinance: the border was to be "an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan, running east ... until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line [with <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a>], and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid".

Because the territorial boundary line between the U.S. and British North America (specifically, the <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763%E2%80%9391%29">province of Quebec</a> until 1791 and <a href="Upper%20Canada">Upper Canada</a> thereafter) ran through the middle of Lake Erie and then up the Detroit River, combined with the prevailing belief regarding the location of the southern tip of Lake Michigan, the framers of the 1802 <a href="Ohio%20Constitution">Ohio Constitution</a> believed it was the intent of Congress that Ohio's northern boundary should certainly be north of the mouth of the <a href="Maumee%20River">Maumee River</a>, and possibly even of the <a href="Detroit%20River">Detroit River</a>. Ohio would thus be granted access to most or all of the Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania, and any other new states carved out of the Northwest Territory would have access to the Great Lakes only via Lakes Michigan, <a href="Lake%20Huron">Huron</a>, and <a href="Lake%20Superior">Superior</a>.

During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, the delegates allegedly received reports from a <a href="fur%20trapping">fur trapper</a> that Lake Michigan extended significantly farther south than had previously been believed (or mapped). Thus, it was possible that an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of <a href="Maumee%20Bay">Maumee Bay</a>, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the farther south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.

Addressing this contingency, the Ohio delegates included a provision in the draft Ohio constitution that if the trapper's report about Lake Michigan's position was correct, the state boundary line would be angled slightly northeast so as to intersect Lake Erie at the "most northerly cape of the Miami [Maumee] Bay." This provision would guarantee that most of the <a href="Maumee%20River">Maumee River</a> <a href="Drainage%20basin">watershed</a> and all of the southern shore of Lake Erie west of Pennsylvania would fall in Ohio. The draft constitution with this proviso was accepted by the United States Congress, but before Ohio's admission to the Union in February 1803, the proposed constitution was referred to a <a href="United%20States%20Congressional%20committee">Congressional committee</a>. The committee's report stated that the clause defining the northern boundary depended on "a fact not yet ascertained" (the latitude of the southern extreme of Lake Michigan), and the members "thought it unnecessary to take it [the provision], at the time, into consideration."

When Congress created the <a href="Michigan%20Territory">Michigan Territory</a> in 1805, it used the Northwest Ordinance's language to define the territory's southern boundary, which therefore differed from that in Ohio's state constitution. This difference, and its potential ramifications, apparently went unnoticed at the time, but it established the legal basis for the conflict that would erupt 30 years later.

The location of the border was contested throughout the early 19th century. Residents of the <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Port of Miami</a>—which would later become Toledo—urged the Ohio government to resolve the border issue. The Ohio legislature, in turn, passed repeated resolutions and requests asking Congress to take up the matter. In 1812, Congress approved a request for an official survey of the line. Delayed because of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>, it was only after <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>'s admission to the Union in 1816 that work on the survey commenced. U.S. Surveyor General <a href="Edward%20Tiffin">Edward Tiffin</a>, who was in charge of the survey, was a former Ohio governor. As a result, Tiffin employed surveyor William Harris to survey not the Ordinance Line, but the line as described in the Ohio Constitution of 1802. When completed, the "Harris Line" placed the mouth of the Maumee River completely in Ohio. When the results of the survey were made public, Michigan territorial governor <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> was unhappy, since it was not based on the Congressionally approved Ordinance Line. In a letter to Tiffin, Cass stated that the Ohio-biased survey "is only adding strength to the strong, and making the weak still weaker."

In response, Michigan commissioned a second survey that was carried out by John A. Fulton. The Fulton survey was based upon the original 1787 Ordinance Line, and after measuring the line eastward from Lake Michigan to Lake Erie, it found the Ohio boundary to lie south of the mouth of the Maumee River. The region between the Harris and Fulton survey lines formed what is now known as the "Toledo Strip". This ribbon of land between northern Ohio and southern Michigan spanned a region wide, over which both jurisdictions claimed sovereignty. While Ohio refused to cede its claim, Michigan quietly <a href="Prescription%20%28sovereignty%20transfer%29">occupied it</a> for the next several years, setting up local governments, building roads, and collecting taxes throughout the area.

The land known as the Toledo Strip was and still is a commercially important area. Prior to the rise of the <a href="History%20of%20rail%20transport">railroad</a> industry, rivers and <a href="canal">canal</a>s were the major "highways of commerce" in the American Midwest. A small but important part of the Strip—the area around present day Toledo and Maumee Bay—fell within the <a href="Great%20Black%20Swamp">Great Black Swamp</a>, and this area was nearly impossible to navigate by road, especially after spring and summer rains. Draining into Lake Erie, the Maumee River was not necessarily well-suited for large ships, but it did provide an easy connection to Indiana's <a href="Forts%20of%20Fort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana">Fort Wayne</a>. At the time, there were plans to connect the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and the Great Lakes through a series of canals. One such canal system approved by the Ohio legislature in 1825 was the <a href="Miami%20and%20Erie%20Canal">Miami and Erie Canal</a> that included a connection to the Ohio River and an outflow into Lake Erie via the Maumee River.

During the conflict over the Toledo Strip, the <a href="Erie%20Canal">Erie Canal</a> was built, linking <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> and the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">Eastern seaboard</a> to the Great Lakes at <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a>. The canal, finished in 1825, immediately became a major route for trade and migration. Corn and other farm products (from the Midwest) could be shipped to eastern markets for much less expense than the older route along the Mississippi River. In addition, the migration of settlers to the Midwest increased sharply after the canal was finished, turning Buffalo and other port cities into <a href="boomtown">boomtown</a>s.

The success of the Erie Canal inspired many other canal projects. Because the western end of Lake Erie offered the shortest overland route to the frontiers of Indiana and <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, Maumee Harbor was seen as a site of immediate importance and great value. Detroit was up the Detroit River from Lake Erie, and faced the difficult barrier of the Great Black Swamp to the south. Because of this, Detroit was less suited to new transportation projects such as canals, and later railroads, than was Toledo. From this perspective on the rapidly developing Midwest of the 1820s and 1830s, both states had much to gain by controlling the land in the Toledo Strip.

In addition, the Strip west of the Toledo area is a prime location for <a href="agriculture">agriculture</a>, because of its well-drained, fertile <a href="loam">loam</a> soil. The area had for many years produced large amounts of <a href="maize">corn</a> and <a href="wheat">wheat</a> per acre. Michigan and Ohio both wanted what seemed strategically and economically destined to become an important port and a prosperous region.

In 1820–21, the <a href="Public%20Land%20Survey%20System">federal land surveys</a> had reached the disputed area from two directions, progressing southward from a baseline in Michigan and northward from one in Ohio. For unknown reasons, Surveyor General Tiffin ordered the two surveys to close on the Northwest Ordinance (Fulton) line, rather than Harris' line, perhaps lending implicit support to Michigan's claims over Ohio's. Thus, townships that were established north of the line assumed they were part of the Michigan Territory. By the early 1820s, the growing territory reached the minimum population threshold of 60,000 to qualify for statehood. When Michigan sought to hold a state constitutional convention in 1833, Congress rejected the request because of the still-disputed Toledo Strip.
Ohio asserted that the boundary was firmly established in its constitution and thus Michigan's citizens were simply intruders; the state government refused to negotiate the issue with the Michigan Territory. The Ohio Congressional delegation was active in blocking Michigan from attaining statehood, lobbying other states to vote against Michigan. In January 1835, frustrated by the political stalemate, Michigan's acting territorial Governor <a href="Stevens%20T.%20Mason">Stevens T. Mason</a> called for a <a href="Constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">constitutional convention</a> to be held in May of that year despite Congress' refusal to approve an <a href="enabling%20act%20%28United%20States%29">enabling act</a> authorizing such a state constitution.

In February 1835, Ohio passed legislation that set up county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after <a href="incumbent">incumbent</a> Governor <a href="Robert%20Lucas%20%28governor%29">Robert Lucas</a>, a move that further exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan. Also, during this period, Ohio attempted to use its power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set the state border to be the Harris Line.

Michigan, led by the young and hot-headed Mason, responded with the passage of the Pains and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it a criminal offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip, under penalty of a <a href="Fine%20%28penalty%29">fine</a> up to $1,000, up to five years <a href="prison">imprisonment</a> at <a href="hard%20labor">hard labor</a>, or both. Acting as <a href="commander-in-chief">commander-in-chief</a> of the territory, Mason appointed <a href="Brigadier-General">Brigadier-General</a> <a href="Joseph%20W.%20Brown">Joseph W. Brown</a> of the <a href="Iron%20Brigade">Third U.S. Brigade</a> to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio <a href="trespass">trespass</a>ers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.

Former United States President <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>, who at the time represented <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> in Congress, backed Michigan's claim. In 1833, when Congress rejected Michigan's request for a convention, Adams summed up his opinion on the dispute: "Never in the course of my life have I known a controversy of which all the right was so clearly on one side and all the power so overwhelmingly on the other."

Acting as commander-in-chief of Ohio's militia, Governor Lucas—along with General <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Ohio%20politician%29">John Bell</a> and about 600 other fully armed militiamen—arrived in <a href="Perrysburg%2C%20Ohio">Perrysburg, Ohio</a>, southwest of Toledo, on March 31, 1835. Shortly thereafter, Governor Mason and General Brown arrived to occupy the city of Toledo proper with around 1,000 armed men, intending to prevent Ohio advances into the Toledo area as well as stopping further border marking from taking place.

In a desperate attempt to prevent armed battle and to avert the resulting political crisis, U.S. President <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> consulted his <a href="U.S.%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin%20Butler%20%28lawyer%29">Benjamin Butler</a>, for his legal opinion on the border dispute. At the time, Ohio was a growing political power in the Union, with nineteen <a href="U.S.%20representative">U.S. representative</a>s and two senators. In contrast, Michigan, still being a territory, had only a single non-voting delegate. Ohio was a crucial <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a> in presidential elections, and it would have been devastating to the fledgling <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> to lose Ohio's electoral votes. Therefore, Jackson calculated that his party's best interest would be served by keeping the Toledo Strip a part of Ohio.

The response that Jackson received from Butler was unexpected: the Attorney General held that until Congress dictated otherwise, the land rightfully belonged to Michigan. This presented a political dilemma for Jackson that spurred him to take action that would greatly influence the outcome of the "war".
On April 3, 1835, Jackson sent two representatives from <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, <a href="Richard%20Rush">Richard Rush</a> of <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="Benjamin%20Chew%20Howard">Benjamin Chew Howard</a> of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, to Toledo to arbitrate the conflict and present a compromise to both governments. The proposal, presented on April 7, recommended that the re-survey to mark the Harris Line commence without further interruption by Michigan, and that the residents of the affected region be allowed to choose their own state or territorial governments until the Congress could definitively settle the matter.

Lucas reluctantly agreed to the proposal, and began to disband his militia, believing the debate to be settled. Three days later, elections in the region were held under Ohio law. Mason refused the deal and he continued to prepare for possible armed conflict.

During the elections, Ohio officials were harassed by Michigan authorities and the area residents were threatened with arrest if they submitted to Ohio's authority. On April 8, 1835, the <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Michigan">Monroe County, Michigan</a> sheriff arrived at the home of Major Benjamin F. Stickney, an Ohio <a href="partisan%20%28political%29">partisan</a>. In the first contact between Michigan partisans and the Stickney family, the sheriff arrested two Ohioans under the Pains and Penalties Act on the basis that the men had voted in the Ohio elections.

Following the election, Lucas believed that the commissioners' actions had alleviated the situation and he once again sent out surveyors to mark the Harris Line. The project went without serious incident until April 26, 1835, when the surveying group was attacked by fifty to sixty members of General Brown's militia in what is now called the "Battle of Phillips Corners". The battle's name is sometimes used as a <a href="synonym">synonym</a> for the entire Toledo War.
Surveyors wrote to Lucas afterwards that while observing "the blessings of the <a href="Sabbath%20in%20Christianity">Sabbath</a>", Michigan militia forces advised them to retreat. In the ensuing chase, "nine of our men, who did not leave the ground in time after being fired upon by the enemy, from thirty to fifty shots, were taken prisoners and carried away into <nowiki>[</nowiki><a href="Tecumseh%2C%20Michigan">Tecumseh</a><nowiki>]</nowiki>." While the details of the attack are disputed—Michigan claimed it fired no shots and had only discharged a few <a href="musket">musket</a> rounds in the air as the Ohio group retreated—the battle further infuriated both Ohioans and Michiganders and brought the two sides to the brink of all-out war.

In response to allegations that Michigan's militia fired upon Ohioans, Lucas called a special session of Ohio's legislature on June 8, 1835 to pass several more controversial acts, including the establishment of Toledo as the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of Lucas County, the establishment of a Court of Common Pleas in the city, a <a href="law">law</a> to prevent the forcible abduction of Ohio citizens from the area, and a budget of $300,000 to implement the legislation. Michigan's territorial legislature responded with a budget appropriation of $315,000.00 to fund "its" militia.

In May and June 1835, Michigan drafted a State Constitution, with provisions for a <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a> legislature, a <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Michigan">supreme court</a>, and other components of a functional state government. Congress was still not willing to allow Michigan's entry into the Union, and President Jackson vowed to reject Michigan's statehood until the border issue and "war" were resolved.

Lucas ordered his <a href="adjutant%20general">adjutant general</a>, Samuel C. Andrews, to conduct a count of the militia, and was told that 10,000 volunteers were ready to fight. That news became exaggerated as it traveled north, and soon thereafter the Michigan territorial press dared the Ohio "million" to enter the Strip as they "welcomed them to hospitable graves."

In June 1835, Lucas dispatched a delegation consisting of U.S. Attorney <a href="Noah%20Haynes%20Swayne">Noah Haynes Swayne</a>, former Congressman <a href="William%20Allen%20%28governor%29">William Allen</a>, and <a href="David%20T.%20Disney">David T. Disney</a> to Washington D.C. to confer with President Andrew Jackson. The delegation presented Ohio's case and urged the President to act swiftly to address the situation.

Throughout mid-1835, both governments continued their practice of <a href="one-upmanship">one-upmanship</a>, and constant skirmishes and arrests occurred. Citizens of Monroe County joined together in a posse to make arrests in Toledo. Partisans from Ohio, angered by the harassment, targeted the offenders with criminal prosecutions. Lawsuits were not only rampant, they served as a basis for retaliatory lawsuits from the opposite side. Partisans from both sides organized <a href="espionage">spying</a> parties to keep track of the sheriffs of <a href="Wood%20County%2C%20Ohio">Wood County, Ohio</a> and Monroe County, Michigan who were entrusted with the security of the border.

On July 15, 1835, tensions and emotions finally overflowed and blood was spilled. Monroe County, Michigan, Deputy Sheriff Joseph Wood went into Toledo to arrest Major Benjamin Stickney, but when Stickney and his three sons resisted, the whole family was subdued and taken into custody. During the scuffle, Two Stickney, son of the major, stabbed Wood with a <a href="pen%20knife">pen knife</a> and fled south into Ohio. Wood's injuries were not life-threatening. When Lucas refused Mason's demand to extradite Two Stickney back to Michigan for trial, Mason wrote to President Jackson for help, suggesting that the matter be referred to the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a>. At the time of the conflict it was not established that the Supreme Court could resolve state boundary disputes, and Jackson declined the offer. Looking for peace, Lucas began making his own efforts to end the conflict, again through federal intervention via Ohio's congressional delegation.
In August 1835, at the strong urging of Ohio's Congressmen, President Jackson removed Mason as Michigan's Territorial Governor and appointed <a href="John%20S.%20Horner">John S. ("Little Jack") Horner</a> in his stead. Before his replacement arrived, Mason ordered 1,000 Michigan militiamen to enter Toledo and prevent the symbolically important first session of the Ohio Court of Common Pleas. While the idea was popular with Michigan residents, the effort failed: the judges held a midnight court before quickly retreating south of the Maumee River, where Ohio forces were positioned.

Mason's successor Horner proved to be extremely unpopular as governor and his tenure was very short. Residents disliked him so much they burned him in <a href="effigy">effigy</a> and pelted him with vegetables upon his entry into the territorial capital. In the October 1835 elections, voters approved the draft constitution and elected the popular Mason as state governor. The same election saw <a href="Isaac%20E.%20Crary">Isaac E. Crary</a> chosen as Michigan's first <a href="United%20States%20Representative">U.S. Representative</a> to Congress. Because of the dispute Congress refused to accept his credentials and seated him as a non-voting delegate. The two <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senators</a> chosen by the state legislature in November, <a href="Lucius%20Lyon">Lucius Lyon</a> and <a href="John%20Norvell">John Norvell</a>, were treated with even less respect, being allowed to sit only as spectators in the Senate gallery.
On June 15, 1836, Jackson signed a bill that allowed Michigan to become a state, but only after it ceded the Toledo Strip. In exchange for this concession, Michigan would be granted the western three-quarters of what is now known as the Upper Peninsula (the easternmost portion had already been included in the state boundaries). Because of the perceived worthlessness of the Upper Peninsula's remote wilderness, a September 1836 special convention in <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>, rejected the offer.

As the year wore on, Michigan found itself deep in a financial crisis and was nearly bankrupt, because of the high militia expenses. The government was spurred to action by the realization that a $400,000 surplus ($ in ) in the <a href="United%20States%20Treasury">United States Treasury</a> was about to be distributed to the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20by%20date%20of%20admission%20to%20the%20Union%23Admissions%20of%20new%20states%20beyond%20the%20thirteen%20original%20colonies">25 states</a>, but not to territorial governments. Michigan would have been ineligible to receive a share of the money.

The "war" unofficially ended on December 14, 1836, at a second convention in Ann Arbor. Delegates passed a resolution to accept the terms set forth by the Congress. The calling of the convention was itself controversial. It had only come about because of an upswelling of private summonses, petitions, and public meetings. Since the legislature did not approve a call to convention, some said the convention was illegal. <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whigs</a> boycotted the convention. As a consequence, the resolution was rejected and ridiculed by many Michigan residents. Congress questioned the legality of the convention, but accepted the results of the convention regardless of its concerns. Because of these factors, as well as because of the notable cold spell at the time, the event later became known as the Frostbitten Convention.

On January 26, 1837, Michigan was finally admitted to the Union as the 26th state, without the Toledo Strip.

The Toledo strip became a permanent part of Ohio, while the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula">Upper Peninsula</a> was considered a worthless wilderness by almost all familiar with the area. The vast <a href="mineral">mineral</a> riches of the land were unknown to the settlers until the discovery of copper in the <a href="Keweenaw%20Peninsula">Keweenaw Peninsula</a> and <a href="iron">iron</a> in the Central Upper Peninsula; this discovery led to a <a href="mining">mining</a> boom that lasted long into the 20th century. Michigan's loss of of agricultural land and the port of Toledo was balanced by the gain of of timber and ore-rich land.

Differences of opinion about the exact boundary location continued until a definitive re-survey was performed in 1915. Re-survey protocol would ordinarily require the surveyors to follow the Harris line exactly, but in this case, the surveyors deviated from the line in places. This prevented the situation of certain residents near the border being subject to changes in state residence, or land owners having parcels on both sides of the border. The 1915 survey was delineated by 71 <a href="granite">granite</a> markers, wide by high. Upon completion, the two states' governors, <a href="Woodbridge%20N.%20Ferris">Woodbridge N. Ferris</a> of Michigan and <a href="Frank%20B.%20Willis">Frank B. Willis</a> of Ohio, shook hands at the border.
Traces of the original Ordinance Line can still be seen in northwestern Ohio and northern Indiana. The northernmost boundaries of <a href="Ottawa%20County%2C%20Ohio">Ottawa</a> and <a href="Wood%20County%2C%20Ohio">Wood</a> counties follow it, as well as many township boundaries in <a href="Fulton%20County%2C%20Ohio">Fulton</a> and <a href="Williams%20County%2C%20Ohio">Williams</a> counties. Many old north–south roads are offset as they cross the line, forcing traffic to jog east while traveling north. The line is identified on <a href="United%20States%20Geological%20Survey">United States Geological Survey</a> <a href="topographical%20map">topographical map</a>s as the "South [Boundary] Michigan Survey", and on Lucas County and Fulton County road maps as "Old State Line Road".

While the border on land was firmly set in the early 20th century, the two states were still in disagreement on the path of the border to the east, in Lake Erie. In 1973, the two states finally obtained a hearing before the United States Supreme Court on their competing claims to the Lake Erie waters. In "<a href="Michigan%20v.%20Ohio">Michigan v. Ohio</a>", the court upheld a <a href="special%20master">special master</a>'s report and ruled that the boundary between the two states in Lake Erie was angled to the northeast, as described in Ohio's state constitution, and not a straight east–west line. One consequence of the court decision was that tiny <a href="Turtle%20Island%20%28Lake%20Erie%29">Turtle Island</a> just outside Maumee Bay and originally treated as being wholly in Michigan, was split between the two states.

This decision was the last border adjustment, putting an end to years of debate over the official boundary line. In modern times, although a general rivalry between Michiganders and Ohioans persists, overt conflict between the states is restricted primarily to the <a href="Michigan%E2%80%93Ohio%20State%20rivalry">Michigan–Ohio State rivalry</a> in <a href="American%20football">American football</a> and to a lesser degree to the rivalry between the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> and <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a> in <a href="American%20League">American League</a> baseball; the Toledo War is cited as the origins of the animosity represented in today's rivalry.

Jupiter trojan

The Jupiter trojans, commonly called Trojan asteroids or simply <a href="Trojan_%28celestial_body%29">Trojans</a>, are a large group of <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s that share the planet <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>'s orbit around the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>. Relative to Jupiter, each Trojan <a href="libration">librates</a> around one of Jupiter's two stable <a href="Lagrangian%20point">Lagrange points</a>: ', lying 60° ahead of the planet in its orbit, and ', 60° behind. Jupiter trojans are distributed in two elongated, curved regions around these Lagrangian points with an average <a href="semi-major%20axis">semi-major axis</a> of about 5.2 AU.

The first Jupiter trojan discovered, <a href="588%20Achilles">588 Achilles</a>, was spotted in 1906 by German astronomer <a href="Max%20Wolf">Max Wolf</a>. A total of 7,040 Jupiter trojans have been found . By convention, they are each named from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> after a figure of the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a>, hence the name "Trojan". The total number of Jupiter trojans larger than 1 km in diameter is believed to be about , approximately equal to the number of asteroids larger than 1 km in the <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a>. Like main-belt asteroids, Jupiter trojans form <a href="Asteroid%20family%23All%20families">families</a>.

Jupiter trojans are dark bodies with reddish, featureless <a href="spectrum">spectra</a>. No firm evidence of the presence of water, or any other specific compound on their surface has been obtained, but it is thought that they are coated in <a href="tholin">tholin</a>s, organic polymers formed by the Sun's radiation. The Jupiter trojans' densities (as measured by studying <a href="binary%20star">binaries</a> or rotational lightcurves) vary from 0.8 to 2.5 g·cm. Jupiter trojans are thought to have been captured into their orbits during the early stages of the <a href="Formation%20and%20evolution%20of%20the%20Solar%20System">Solar System's formation</a> or slightly later, during the <a href="planetary%20migration">migration</a> of giant planets.

The term "Trojan Asteroid" specifically refers to the asteroids co-orbital with Jupiter, but the general term "<a href="trojan%20%28astronomy%29">trojan</a>" is sometimes more generally applied to other <a href="Small%20Solar%20System%20body">small Solar System bodies</a> with similar relationships to larger bodies: for example, there are both <a href="Mars%20trojan">Mars trojan</a>s and <a href="Neptune%20trojan">Neptune trojan</a>s, as well as a recently-discovered <a href="Earth%20trojan">Earth trojan</a>. The term "Trojan asteroid" is normally understood to specifically mean the Jupiter trojans because the first Trojans were discovered near Jupiter's orbit and Jupiter currently has by far the most known Trojans.

In 1772, Italian-born mathematician <a href="Joseph-Louis%20Lagrange">Joseph-Louis Lagrange</a>, in studying the <a href="restricted%20three-body%20problem">restricted three-body problem</a>, predicted that a small body sharing an orbit with a planet but lying 60° ahead or behind it will be trapped near these points. The trapped body will <a href="libration">librate</a> slowly around the point of equilibrium in a <a href="tadpole%20orbit">tadpole</a> or <a href="horseshoe%20orbit">horseshoe orbit</a>. These leading and trailing points are called the and <a href="Lagrange%20point">Lagrange point</a>s. The first asteroids trapped in Lagrange points were observed more than a century after Lagrange's hypothesis. Those associated with Jupiter were the first to be discovered.

<a href="Edward%20Emerson%20Barnard">E. E. Barnard</a> made the first recorded observation of a trojan, (identified as A904 RD at the time), in 1904, but neither he nor others appreciated its significance at the time. Barnard believed he had seen the recently discovered <a href="Moons%20of%20Saturn">Saturnian satellite</a> <a href="Phoebe%20%28moon%29">Phoebe</a>, which was only two <a href="arc-minute">arc-minute</a>s away in the sky at the time, or possibly an asteroid. The object's identity was not understood until its orbit was calculated in 1999.

The first accepted discovery of a trojan occurred in February 1906, when astronomer <a href="Max%20Wolf">Max Wolf</a> of <a href="Heidelberg-K%C3%B6nigstuhl%20State%20Observatory">Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory</a> discovered an <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> at the <a href="Lagrangian%20point">Lagrangian point</a> of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>–<a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a> system, later named <a href="588%20Achilles">588 Achilles</a>. In 1906–1907 two more Jupiter trojans were found by fellow German astronomer <a href="August%20Kopff">August Kopff</a> (<a href="624%20Hektor">624 Hektor</a> and <a href="617%20Patroclus">617 Patroclus</a>). Hektor, like Achilles, belonged to the swarm ("ahead" of the planet in its orbit), whereas Patroclus was the first asteroid known to reside at the Lagrangian point ("behind" the planet). By 1938, 11 Jupiter trojans had been detected. This number increased to 14 only in 1961. As instruments improved, the rate of discovery grew rapidly: by January 2000, a total of 257 had been discovered; by May 2003, the number had grown to 1,600. there are 4,601 known Jupiter trojans at and 2,439 at .

The custom of naming all asteroids in Jupiter's and points after famous heroes of the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a> was suggested by <a href="Johann%20Palisa">Johann Palisa</a> of <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, who was the first to accurately calculate their orbits. 

Asteroids in the leading () orbit are named after <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> heroes (the "Greek node or camp" or "<a href="Achilles">Achilles</a> group"), and those at the trailing () orbit are named after the heroes of <a href="Troy">Troy</a> (the "Trojan node or camp"). The asteroids 617 Patroclus and 624 Hektor were named before the Greece/Troy rule was devised, resulting in a <a href="Patroclus">Greek spy</a> in the Trojan node and a <a href="Hector">Trojan spy</a> in the Greek node.

Estimates of the total number of Jupiter trojans are based on deep surveys of limited areas of the sky. The swarm is believed to hold between 160–240,000 asteroids with diameters larger than 2 km and about 600,000 with diameters larger than 1 km. If the swarm contains a comparable number of objects, there are more than Jupiter trojans 1 km in size or larger. For the objects brighter than <a href="Absolute%20magnitude%23Solar%20System%20bodies%20%28H%29">absolute magnitude</a> 9.0 the population is probably complete. These numbers are similar to that of comparable asteroids in the asteroid belt. The total mass of the Jupiter trojans is estimated at 0.0001 of the mass of Earth or one-fifth of the mass of the asteroid belt.

Two more recent studies indicate that the above numbers may overestimate the number of Jupiter trojans by several-fold. This overestimate is caused by (1) the assumption that all Jupiter trojans have a low <a href="albedo">albedo</a> of about 0.04, whereas small bodies may have an average albedo as high as 0.12; (2) an incorrect assumption about the distribution of Jupiter trojans in the sky. According to the new estimates, the total number of Jupiter trojans with a diameter larger than 2 km is and in the L4 and L5 swarms, respectively. These numbers would be reduced by a factor of 2 if small Jupiter trojans are more reflective than large ones.

The number of Jupiter trojans observed in the swarm is slightly larger than that observed in . Because the brightest Jupiter trojans show little variation in numbers between the two populations, this disparity is probably due to observational bias. Some models indicate that the swarm may be slightly more stable than the swarm.

The largest Jupiter trojan is <a href="624%20Hektor">624 Hektor</a>, which has an average diameter of 203 ± 3.6 km. There are few large Jupiter trojans in comparison to the overall population. With decreasing size, the number of Jupiter trojans grows very quickly down to 84 km, much more so than in the asteroid belt. A diameter of 84 km corresponds to an absolute magnitude of 9.5, assuming an <a href="albedo">albedo</a> of 0.04. Within the 4.4–40 km range the Jupiter trojans' size distribution resembles that of the main-belt asteroids. Nothing is known about the masses of the smaller Jupiter trojans. The size distribution suggests that the smaller Trojans may be the products of collisions by larger Jupiter trojans.

Jupiter trojans have orbits with radii between 5.05 and 5.35 AU (the mean semi-major axis is 5.2 ± 0.15 AU), and are distributed throughout elongated, curved regions around the two Lagrangian points; each swarm stretches for about 26° along the orbit of Jupiter, amounting to a total distance of about 2.5 AU. The width of the swarms approximately equals two <a href="Hill%20radius">Hill's radii</a>, which in the case of Jupiter amounts to about 0.6 AU. Many of Jupiter trojans have large <a href="orbital%20inclination">orbital inclination</a>s relative to Jupiter's orbital plane—up to 40°.

Jupiter trojans do not maintain a fixed separation from Jupiter. They slowly librate around their respective equilibrium points, periodically moving closer to Jupiter or farther from it. Jupiter trojans generally follow paths called <a href="tadpole%20orbit">tadpole orbit</a>s around the Lagrangian points; the average period of their libration is about 150 years. The amplitude of the libration (along the Jovian orbit) varies from 0.6° to 88°, with the average being about 33°. Simulations show that Jupiter trojans can follow even more complicated trajectories when moving from one Lagrangian point to another—these are called <a href="horseshoe%20orbit">horseshoe orbit</a>s (currently no Jupiter Trojan with such an orbit is known).

Discerning <a href="collisional%20family">dynamical families</a> within the Jupiter trojan population is more difficult than it is in the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical families were identified. Jupiter-trojan families are much smaller in size than families in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.

In 2001, <a href="617%20Patroclus">617 Patroclus</a> was the first Jupiter trojan to be identified as a <a href="Minor-planet%20moon">binary asteroid</a>. The binary's orbit is extremely close, at 650 km, compared to 35,000 km for the primary's <a href="Hill%20sphere">Hill sphere</a>. The largest Jupiter trojan—<a href="624%20Hektor">624 Hektor</a>— is probably a <a href="contact%20binary%20%28asteroid%29">contact binary</a> with a moonlet.

Jupiter trojans are dark bodies of irregular shape. Their <a href="geometric%20albedo">geometric albedo</a>s generally vary between 3 and 10%. The average value is 0.056 ± 0.003 for the objects larger than 57 km, and 0.121 ± 0.003 (R-band) for those smaller than 25 km. The asteroid <a href="4709%20Ennomos">4709 Ennomos</a> has the highest albedo (0.18) of all known Jupiter trojans. Little is known about the masses, chemical composition, rotation or other physical properties of the Jupiter trojans.

The rotational properties of Jupiter trojans are not well known. Analysis of the rotational <a href="light%20curve">light curve</a>s of 72 Jupiter trojans gave an average rotational period of about 11.2 hours, whereas the average period of the control sample of asteroids in the asteroid belt was 10.6 hours. The distribution of the rotational periods of Jupiter trojans appeared to be well approximated by a <a href="Maxwell%20distribution">Maxwellian function</a>, whereas the distribution for main-belt asteroids was found to be non-Maxwellian, with a deficit of periods in the range 8–10 hours. The Maxwellian distribution of the rotational periods of Jupiter trojans may indicate that they have undergone a stronger collisional evolution compared to the asteroid belt.

In 2008 a team from <a href="Calvin%20College">Calvin College</a> examined the <a href="light%20curve">light curve</a>s of a debiased sample of ten Jupiter trojans, and found a <a href="median">median</a> spin period of 18.9 hours. This value was significantly higher than that for main-belt asteroids of similar size (11.5 hours). The difference could mean that the Jupiter trojans possess a lower average density, which may imply that they formed in the <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a> (see below).

<a href="Spectroscopy">Spectroscopically</a>, the Jupiter trojans mostly are <a href="D-type%20asteroid">D-type asteroid</a>s, which predominate in the outer regions of the asteroid belt. A small number are classified as <a href="P-type%20asteroid">P</a> or <a href="C-type%20asteroid">C-type asteroid</a>s. Their spectra are red (meaning that they reflect more light at longer wavelengths) or neutral and featureless. No firm evidence of water, organics or other chemical compounds has been obtained . <a href="4709%20Ennomos">4709 Ennomos</a> has an albedo slightly higher than the Jupiter-trojan average, which may indicate the presence of water ice. Some other Jupiter Trojans, such as <a href="911%20Agamemnon">911 Agamemnon</a> and <a href="617%20Patroclus">617 Patroclus</a>, have shown very weak absorptions at 1.7 and 2.3 μm, which might indicate the presence of organics. The Jupiter trojans' spectra are similar to those of the <a href="Moons%20of%20Jupiter%23Irregular%20satellites">irregular moons of Jupiter</a> and, to a certain extent, <a href="comet%20nuclei">comet nuclei</a>, though Jupiter trojans are spectrally very different from the redder Kuiper belt objects. A Jupiter trojan's spectrum can be matched to a mixture of water ice, a large amount of carbon-rich material (<a href="charcoal">charcoal</a>), and possibly <a href="magnesium">magnesium</a>-rich <a href="silicate">silicate</a>s. The composition of the Jupiter trojan population appears to be markedly uniform, with little or no differentiation between the two swarms.

A team from the <a href="Keck%20Observatory">Keck Observatory</a> in Hawaii announced in 2006 that it had measured the density of the binary Jupiter trojan <a href="617%20Patroclus">617 Patroclus</a> as being less than that of water ice (0.8 g/cm), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble <a href="comet">comet</a>s or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice with a layer of dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480 g/cm) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.

Two main theories have emerged to explain the formation and evolution of the Jupiter trojans. The first suggests that the Jupiter trojans formed in the same part of the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> as Jupiter and entered their orbits while it was forming. The last stage of Jupiter's formation involved runaway growth of its mass through the accretion of large amounts of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="helium">helium</a> from the <a href="protoplanetary%20disk">protoplanetary disk</a>; during this growth, which lasted for only about 10,000 years, the mass of Jupiter increased by a factor of ten. The <a href="planetesimal">planetesimal</a>s that had approximately the same orbits as Jupiter were caught by the increased gravity of the planet. The capture mechanism was very efficient—about 50% of all remaining planetesimals were trapped. This hypothesis has two major problems: the number of trapped bodies exceeds the observed population of Jupiter trojans by four <a href="order%20of%20magnitude">orders of magnitude</a>, and the present Jupiter trojan asteroids have larger orbital inclinations than are predicted by the capture model. Simulations of this scenario show that such a mode of formation also would inhibit the creation of similar trojans for <a href="Saturn">Saturn</a>, and this has been borne out by observation: to date no trojans have been found near Saturn.

The second theory proposes that the Jupiter trojans were captured during the migration of the giant planets described in the <a href="Nice%20model">Nice model</a>. In the Nice model the orbits of the giant planets became unstable years after the Solar System's formation when Jupiter and Saturn crossed their 1:2 mean-motion <a href="orbital%20resonance">resonance</a>. Encounters between planets resulted in <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> and <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> being scattered outward into the primordial <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a>, disrupting it and throwing millions of objects inward. When Jupiter and Saturn were near their 1:2 resonance the orbits of pre-existing Jupiter trojans became unstable during a secondary resonance with Jupiter and Saturn. This occurred when the period of the trojans' libration about their Lagrangian point had a 3:1 ratio to the period at which the position where Jupiter passes Saturn circulated relative to its perihelion. This process was also reversible allowing a fraction of the numerous objects scattered inward by Uranus and Neptune to enter this region and be captured as Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits separated. These new trojans had a wide range of inclinations, the result of multiple encounters with the giant planets before being captured. This process can also occur later when Jupiter and Saturn cross weaker resonances.

In a <a href="Jumping-Jupiter%20scenario">revised version</a> of the Nice model Jupiter trojans are captured when Jupiter encounters an ice giant during the instability. In this version of the Nice model one of the ice giants (Uranus, Neptune, or a lost <a href="Five-planet%20Nice%20model">fifth planet</a>) is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is scattered outward by Jupiter causing the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to quickly separate. When Jupiter's semi-major axis jumps during these encounters existing Jupiter trojans can escape and new objects with semi-major axes similar to Jupiter's new semi-major axis are captured. Following its last encounter the ice giant can pass through one of the libration points and perturb their orbits leaving this libration point depleted relative to the other. After the encounters end some of these Jupiter trojans are lost and others captured when Jupiter and Saturn are near weak mean motion resonances such as the 3:7 resonance via the mechanism of the original Nice model.

The long-term future of the Jupiter trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time. Collisional shattering slowly depletes the Jupiter trojan population as fragments are ejected. Ejected Jupiter trojans could become temporary satellites of Jupiter or <a href="Jupiter-family%20comet">Jupiter-family comet</a>s. Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable over the age of the Solar System. Levison et al. believe that roughly 200 ejected Jupiter trojans greater than 1 km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits. Some of the escaped Jupiter trojans may become Jupiter-family comets as they approach the Sun and their surface ice begins evaporating.

On 4 January 2017 NASA announced that <a href="Lucy%20%28spacecraft%29">Lucy</a> was selected as one of their next two <a href="Discovery%20Program">Discovery Program</a> missions. Lucy is set to explore six Jupiter trojans. It is scheduled for launch in 2021 and will arrive at the Trojan cloud in 2027 after a fly-by of a main-belt asteroid. It will then return to the vicinity of Earth for a gravity assist to take it to Jupiter's Trojan cloud where it will visit 617 Patroclus.

The Japanese space agency has proposed the <a href="OKEANOS">OKEANOS</a> <a href="solar%20sail">solar sail</a> for the late 2020s to either analyse a Trojan asteroid "in situ" or to perform a sample-return mission.

Tool (band)

Tool is an American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band from <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up includes drummer <a href="Danny%20Carey">Danny Carey</a>, guitarist <a href="Adam%20Jones%20%28musician%29">Adam Jones</a>, and vocalist <a href="Maynard%20James%20Keenan">Maynard James Keenan</a>. <a href="Justin%20Chancellor">Justin Chancellor</a> has been the band's bassist since 1995, replacing their original bassist <a href="Paul%20D%27Amour">Paul D'Amour</a>. Tool has won three <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.

The band emerged with a <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> sound on their first studio album, "<a href="Undertow%20%28Tool%20album%29">Undertow</a>" (1993), and later became a dominant act in the <a href="alternative%20metal">alternative metal</a> movement, with the release of their second album, "<a href="%C3%86nima">Ænima</a>" in 1996. Their efforts to unify musical experimentation, <a href="visual%20arts">visual arts</a>, and a message of personal evolution continued, with "<a href="Lateralus">Lateralus</a>" (2001) and the most recent album, "<a href="10%2C000%20Days%20%28Tool%20album%29">10,000 Days</a>" (2006), gaining the band critical acclaim, and commercial success around the world.

Due to Tool's incorporation of visual arts and very long and complex releases, the band is generally described as a style-transcending act and part of <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a>, <a href="psychedelic%20rock">psychedelic rock</a>, and <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a>. The relationship between the band and today's <a href="music%20industry">music industry</a> is ambivalent, at times marked by <a href="censorship">censorship</a>, and the band's insistence on privacy.

During the 1980s, each of the future members of Tool moved to Los Angeles. Both Paul D'Amour and Adam Jones wanted to enter the film industry, while Maynard James Keenan found employment remodeling pet stores after having studied visual arts in Michigan. Danny Carey and Keenan performed for <a href="Green%20Jell%C3%BF">Green Jellÿ</a>, and Carey played with <a href="Carole%20King">Carole King</a> and <a href="Pigmy%20Love%20Circus">Pigmy Love Circus</a>.

Keenan and Jones met through a mutual friend in 1989. After Keenan played a tape recording for Jones of his previous band project, Jones was so impressed by his voice that he eventually talked his friend into forming their own band. They started <a href="jam%20session">jamming</a> together and were on the lookout for a drummer and a bass player. Carey happened to live above Keenan and was introduced to Jones by <a href="Tom%20Morello">Tom Morello</a>, an old high school friend of Jones and former member of Electric Sheep. Carey began playing in their sessions because he "felt kinda sorry for them," as other invited musicians were not showing up. Tool's lineup was completed when a friend of Jones introduced them to bassist D'Amour. Early on, the band fabricated the story that they formed because of the <a href="pseudophilosophy">pseudophilosophy</a> "lachrymology". Although "lachrymology" was also cited as an inspiration for the band's name, Keenan later explained their intentions differently: "Tool is exactly what it sounds like: It's a big dick. It's a wrench. ... we are ... your tool; use us as a catalyst in your process of finding out whatever it is you need to find out, or whatever it is you're trying to achieve."

After almost two years of practicing and performing locally in the Los Angeles area, the band was approached by record companies, and eventually signed a record deal with <a href="Zoo%20Entertainment%20%28record%20label%29">Zoo Entertainment</a>. In March 1992, Zoo released the band's first effort, "<a href="Opiate%20%28album%29">Opiate</a>". Described by the band as "slam and bang" heavy music and the "hardest sounding" six songs they had written to that point, the <a href="Extended%20play">EP</a> included the singles "<a href="Hush%20%28Tool%20song%29">Hush</a>" and "<a href="Opiate%20%28song%29">Opiate</a>". The band's first music video, "Hush", promoted their dissenting views about the then-prominent <a href="Parents%20Music%20Resource%20Center">Parents Music Resource Center</a> and its advocacy of the <a href="censorship%20of%20music">censorship of music</a>. The video featured the band members naked with their genitalia covered by <a href="Parental%20Advisory">Parental Advisory</a> stickers and their mouths covered by duct tape. The band began touring with <a href="Rollins%20Band">Rollins Band</a>, <a href="Fishbone">Fishbone</a>, <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a>, <a href="White%20Zombie%20%28band%29">White Zombie</a>, and <a href="Corrosion%20of%20Conformity">Corrosion of Conformity</a>, to positive responses, which Janiss Garza of "RIP Magazine" summarized in September 1992 as a "buzz" and "a strong start".

The following year, at a time when <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> and <a href="grunge">grunge</a> was at its height, Tool released their first full-length album, "<a href="Undertow%20%28Tool%20album%29">Undertow</a>" (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than "Opiate" and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound. The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to the <a href="Church%20of%20Scientology">Church of Scientology</a>, which was perceived as a clash with "the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being." Keenan "spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience."

Tool later played several concerts during the <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> festival tour, and were moved from the second stage to the main stage by their manager and the festival co-founder <a href="Ted%20Gardner">Ted Gardner</a>. At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown Los Angeles, comedian <a href="Bill%20Hicks">Bill Hicks</a> introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in "Undertow"'s liner notes. He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens. The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped "Undertow" to be certified <a href="RIAA%20certification">gold</a> by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a> in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995, despite being sold with a <a href="Corporate%20censorship">censored</a> album cover by distributors such as <a href="Wal-Mart">Wal-Mart</a>. The single "<a href="Sober%20%28Tool%20song%29">Sober</a>" became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band Billboard's "Best Video by a New Artist" award for the accompanying <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion</a> music video.

With the release of Tool's follow-up single "<a href="Prison%20Sex%20%28song%29">Prison Sex</a>", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with <a href="child%20abuse">child abuse</a>, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: "It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open." The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his "surrealistic interpretation" of the subject matter. While some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as "metaphoric", the American branch of <a href="MuchMusic">MuchMusic</a> asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings.

In September 1995, the band started writing and recording their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. According to Carey, D'Amour left the band because he wanted to play guitar rather than bass. <a href="Justin%20Chancellor">Justin Chancellor</a>, a member of former tourmates <a href="Peach%20%28band%29">Peach</a>, eventually replaced D'Amour, having been chosen over competitors such as <a href="Kyuss">Kyuss</a>'s <a href="Scott%20Reeder%20%28bassist%29">Scott Reeder</a>, <a href="Filter%20%28band%29">Filter</a>'s Frank Cavanaugh, <a href="Pigmy%20Love%20Circus">Pigmy Love Circus</a>'s E. Shepherd Stevenson, <a href="Jane%27s%20Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a>'s <a href="Eric%20Avery">Eric Avery</a> and <a href="ZAUM">ZAUM</a>'s Marco Fox.

On September 17, 1996, Tool released their second full-length album, "<a href="%C3%86nima">Ænima</a>" ("ON-ima"). It was certified <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">triple platinum</a> by the RIAA on March 4, 2003. D'Amour left Tool and Chancellor came on board during the recording of the album. The band enlisted the help of producer <a href="David%20Bottrill">David Bottrill</a>, who had produced some of <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a>'s albums, while Jones collaborated with <a href="Cam%20de%20Leon">Cam de Leon</a> to create "Ænima"'s Grammy-nominated artwork.

The album was dedicated to <a href="Stand-up%20comedy">stand-up comedian</a> <a href="Bill%20Hicks">Bill Hicks</a>, who died two and a half years earlier. The band intended to raise awareness about Hicks's material and ideas, because they felt that Tool and Hicks "were resonating similar concepts". In particular, "Ænima"'s final track "Third Eye" is preceded by a clip of Hicks' performances, and the <a href="Lenticular%20printing">lenticular</a> casing of the "Ænima" album packaging as well as the chorus of the title track "<a href="%C3%86nema">Ænema</a>" make reference to a sketch from Hicks's "<a href="Arizona%20Bay">Arizona Bay</a>", in which he contemplates the idea of Los Angeles falling into the Pacific Ocean.

The first single, "<a href="Stinkfist">Stinkfist</a>", garnered limited airplay. It was shortened by radio programmers, MTV (U.S.) renamed the music video of "Stinkfist" to "Track No. 1" due to offensive connotations, and the lyrics of the song were altered. Responding to fan complaints about censorship, <a href="Matt%20Pinfield">Matt Pinfield</a> of MTV's "<a href="120%20Minutes">120 Minutes</a>" expressed regret on air by waving his fist in front of his face while introducing the video and explaining the name change.

A tour began in October 1996, two weeks after "Ænima"'s release. Following numerous appearances in the United States and Europe, Tool headed for Australia and New Zealand in late March 1997. April 1 of that year saw the first of several <a href="April%20Fools%27%20Day">April Fools'</a> pranks related to the band. <a href="Kabir%20Akhtar">Kabir Akhtar</a>, webmaster of the band's semi-official fanpage, The Tool Page, wrote that "at least three of the band are listed in critical condition" after a tour bus accident on a highway. This hoax gained wide attention and was eventually exposed on radio and MTV. Akhtar later posted an apology, claiming that The Tool Page "will not indulge itself in such outlandish pranks in the future"—a claim that would be belied by later April Fools' pranks.

Eventually returning to the United States, Tool appeared at Lollapalooza '97 in July, this time as a headliner, where they gained critical praise from "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>":

"Ænima" eventually matched Tool's successful debut album in sales, and the progressive-influenced album landed the band at the head of the <a href="alternative%20metal">alternative metal</a> genre. It featured the Grammy Award-winning "Ænema" and appeared on several "Best Albums of 1996" lists, with notable examples being those of "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" and "<a href="Terrorizer%20%28magazine%29">Terrorizer</a>".

A legal battle that began the same year interfered with the band's working on another release. <a href="Volcano%20Entertainment">Volcano Entertainment</a>—the successor of Tool's by-then defunct label Zoo Entertainment—alleged contract violations by Tool and filed a lawsuit. According to Volcano, Tool had violated their contract when the band looked at offers from other record labels. After Tool filed a countersuit stating that Volcano had failed to use a renewal option in their contract, the parties settled out of court. In December 1998 Tool agreed to a new contract, a three-record joint venture deal. In 2000, the band dismissed their long-time manager Ted Gardner, who then sued the band over his commission on this lucrative agreement.

During this time, Keenan joined the band <a href="A%20Perfect%20Circle">A Perfect Circle</a>, which was founded by long-time Tool guitar tech <a href="Billy%20Howerdel">Billy Howerdel</a>, while Jones joined The Melvins' <a href="Buzz%20Osborne">Buzz Osborne</a> and Carey drummed with Dead Kennedys' <a href="Jello%20Biafra">Jello Biafra</a> on side projects. Although there were rumors that Tool was breaking up, Chancellor, Jones, and Carey were working on new material while waiting for Keenan to return. In 2000, the "<a href="Salival">Salival</a>" <a href="box%20set">box set</a> (CD/VHS or CD/DVD) was released, effectively putting an end to the rumors. The CD contained one new original track, a <a href="Cover%20version">cover</a> of Led Zeppelin's "<a href="No%20Quarter%20%28song%29">No Quarter</a>", a live version of Peach's "<a href="You%20Lied">You Lied</a>", and revised versions of old songs. The VHS and the DVD each contained four music videos, plus a bonus music video for "Hush" on the DVD. Although "Salival" did not yield any singles, the hidden track "Maynard's Dick" (which dates back to the "Opiate" era) briefly found its way to <a href="FM%20broadcasting">FM radio</a> when several DJs chose to play it on air under the title "Maynard's Dead".

In January 2001, Tool announced a new album, "Systema Encéphale", along with a 12-song track list containing titles such as "Riverchrist", "Numbereft", "Encephatalis", "Musick", and "Coeliacus". File-sharing networks such as <a href="Napster">Napster</a> were flooded with bogus files bearing the titles' names. At the time, Tool members were outspokenly critical of file-sharing networks in general due to their impact on artists that are dependent on record sales to continue their careers. Keenan said during an interview with "NY Rock" in 2000, "I think there are a lot of other industries out there that might deserve being destroyed. The ones who get hurt by MP3s are not so much companies or the business, but the artists, people who are trying to write songs."

A month later, the band revealed that the new album was actually titled "<a href="Lateralus">Lateralus</a>"; the name "Systema Encéphale" and the track list had been a ruse. "Lateralus" and the corresponding tours would take Tool a step further toward <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a> and <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> territory. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" wrote in an attempt to summarize the album that "Drums, bass and guitars move in jarring cycles of hyperhowl and near-silent <a href="death%20march">death march</a> ... The prolonged running times of most of "Lateralus" thirteen tracks are misleading; the entire album rolls and stomps with <a href="suite%20%28music%29">suite</a>like purpose." Joshua Klein of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" expressed his opinion that "Lateralus", with its 79 minutes and relatively complex and long songs—topped by the ten-and-a-half-minute music video for "<a href="Parabola%20%28song%29">Parabola</a>"—posed a challenge to fans and music programming alike.

The album became a worldwide success, reaching No.1 on the U.S. <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> albums chart in its debut week. Tool received their second Grammy Award for the best metal performance of 2001 for the song "<a href="Schism%20%28song%29">Schism</a>". During the band's acceptance speech, Carey stated that he would like to thank his parents (for putting up with him) and <a href="Satan">Satan</a>, and bassist Chancellor concluded: "I want to thank my dad for doing my mom."

Extensive touring throughout 2001 and 2002 supported "Lateralus" and included a personal highlight for the band: a 10-show joint mini-tour with <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a> in August 2001. Comparisons between the two were made, MTV describing the bands as "the once and future kings of progressive rock". Keenan stated of the minitour: "For me, being on stage with King Crimson is like <a href="Lenny%20Kravitz">Lenny Kravitz</a> playing with <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, or <a href="Britney%20Spears">Britney Spears</a> onstage with <a href="Debbie%20Gibson">Debbie Gibson</a>."

Although the end of the tour in November 2002 seemed to signal the start of another hiatus for the band, they did not become completely inactive. While Keenan recorded and toured with <a href="A%20Perfect%20Circle">A Perfect Circle</a>, the other band members released an interview and a recording of new material, both exclusive to the fan club. On April 1, 2005, the official Tool website announced that "Maynard has found Jesus" and would be abandoning the recording of the new Tool album temporarily and possibly permanently. <a href="Kurt%20Loder">Kurt Loder</a> of MTV contacted Keenan via email to ask for a confirmation and received a nonchalant confirmation. When Loder asked again, Keenan's response was simply "heh heh." On April 7 the official site announced, "Good news, April fools fans. The writing and recording is back under way."

Work continued on the follow-up to "Lateralus"; meanwhile, a "Lateralus" vinyl edition and two DVD singles were released, and the band's official website received a new splash intro by artist <a href="Joshua%20Davis%20%28web%20designer%29">Joshua Davis</a>. The "double <a href="Gramophone%20record">vinyl</a> four-picture disc" edition of "Lateralus" was first released as a limited autographed edition exclusively available to fan club members and publicly released on August 23, 2005. On December 20 the two DVDs were released, one containing the single "<a href="Schism%20%28song%29">Schism</a>" and the other "<a href="Parabola%20%28song%29">Parabola</a>", a remix by <a href="Lustmord">Lustmord</a>, and a music video with commentary by <a href="David%20Yow">David Yow</a> and <a href="Jello%20Biafra">Jello Biafra</a>.

Fifteen years into the band's career, Tool had acquired what Dan Epstein of "<a href="Revolver%20%28magazine%29">Revolver</a>" described as a devoted "<a href="Cult%20following">cult</a>" following, and as details about the band's next album emerged, such as the influence of "Lateralus" tourmates <a href="Fant%C3%B4mas%20%28band%29">Fantômas</a> and <a href="Meshuggah">Meshuggah</a>, controversy surrounding the new Tool album surfaced with speculation over song titles and pre-release rumors of leaked songs. Speculation over possible album titles was dismissed with a news item on the official Tool website, announcing that the new album's name was "<a href="10%2C000%20Days%20%28Tool%20album%29">10,000 Days</a>". Nevertheless, speculation continued, with allegations that "10,000 Days" was merely a "decoy" album to fool audiences. The rumor was proven false when a <a href="internet%20leak">leaked</a> copy of the album was distributed via <a href="filesharing">filesharing</a> networks a week prior to its official release.

The album opener, "<a href="Vicarious%20%28Tool%20song%29">Vicarious</a>", premiered on U.S. radio stations on April 17, 2006. The album premiered on May 2 in the U.S. and debuted at the top spots of various international charts. "10,000 Days" sold 564,000 copies in its opening week in the U.S. and was number one on the "Billboard" 200 charts, doubling the sales of <a href="Pearl%20Jam">Pearl Jam</a>'s <a href="Pearl%20Jam%20%28album%29">self-titled album</a>, its closest competitor. However, "10,000 Days" was received less favorably by critics than its predecessor "<a href="Lateralus">Lateralus</a>" had been.

Prior to the release of "10,000 Days", a tour kicked off at <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella</a> on April 30. The touring schedule was similar to the "Lateralus" tour of 2001; supporting acts were <a href="Isis%20%28band%29">Isis</a> and <a href="Mastodon%20%28band%29">Mastodon</a>. During a short break early the next year, after touring Australia and New Zealand, drummer Carey suffered a <a href="Biceps%20brachii%20muscle">biceps</a> tear during a skirmish with his girlfriend's dog, casting uncertainty on the band's upcoming concerts in North America. Carey underwent surgery on February 21 and several performances had to be postponed. Back on tour by April, Tool appeared on June 15 as a headliner at the <a href="Bonnaroo%20Music%20Festival">Bonnaroo Music Festival</a> with a guest appearance from <a href="Rage%20Against%20the%20Machine">Rage Against the Machine</a>'s <a href="Tom%20Morello">Tom Morello</a> on "<a href="Lateralus%20%28song%29">Lateralus</a>". Meanwhile, "Vicarious" was a nominee for <a href="Best%20Hard%20Rock%20Performance">Best Hard Rock Performance</a> and "10,000 Days" won <a href="Best%20Recording%20Package">Best Recording Package</a> at the <a href="49th%20Grammy%20Awards">49th Grammy Awards</a>. The music video for "Vicarious" was released on DVD on December 18.

Chancellor stated in May 2007 that the band would probably continue their tour until early 2008 and then "take some time off". He added that the band had already written some new material and would surely release another album at some point. He speculated about the possibility of a "band movie", something the band has considered for a long time. Ideas ranged from "a narrative story in a surreal fashion with as much money and special effects as possible" to "pockets of all of that or something that's live or the band playing". Although Carey stated that the necessary know-how was at hand due to the band's connections to artists working in the movie business, Jones dismissed the idea, saying "It's just talk right now."

The band's 2009 summer tour began on July 18 in <a href="Commerce%20City%2C%20Colorado">Commerce City, Colorado</a>, at the <a href="Mile%20High%20Music%20Festival">Mile High Music Festival</a>. They headlined Lollapalooza 2009 and a show on August 22 for the <a href="Epicenter%20%28music%20festival%29">Epicenter Festival</a> in Pomona, California. Their <a href="Tool%20Winter%20Tour">Tool Winter Tour</a> played dates across the U.S. and Canada in January and February 2012. The band played at <a href="Ozzfest">Ozzfest Japan</a> on May 12, 2013. Meanwhile, Tool members have pursued their own musical projects. Keenan has toured extensively with <a href="Puscifer">Puscifer</a>, which he describes as involving a series of musical ideas he did not have an opportunity to explore with Tool or A Perfect Circle.

Keenan and Carey offered conflicting reports on whether or not their next album would surface in 2013, though Carey later conceded that "early 2014" seemed more likely. By May 2013, Keenan stated that he had actively joined the writing process as enough instrumental material had been written. On March 6, 2014, <a href="Crave%20Online">Crave Online</a> reported that Jones had said the new album was complete and on track for a 2014 release. The following day, Tool released an official statement to "Rolling Stone", explaining that Jones was joking.

On July 15, 2014, Carey and Jones informed "Rolling Stone" that family commitments and an ongoing lawsuit are the key reasons for the delayed fifth album. Carey said to the music publication that one untitled track is "pretty much done". 

In March 2015, Jones revealed that the lawsuit had been settled in the band's favor, and as such, the band was turning their focus towards recording the album. He said that he hoped the album would be finished before the end of 2015 but emphasized that the band would not rush their work to meet an arbitrary deadline.

In January 2016, Tool undertook a tour of the United States.

While it was reported in February 2017 that Keenan had entered the studio to work on vocals for the fifth Tool album, it was later reported that the album was not scheduled for release in 2017. Still, the band announced a North American tour starting in May. A month later, Chancellor revealed that the new Tool album was "about 90-percent there", while Carey claimed in separate interviews that it would "definitely" be released in 2018. In February 2018, Jones revealed that Keenan was working on lyrics for the album, and that the band would begin recording in March. In June 2018, during his acceptance speech for the Icon Award at the <a href="Metal%20Hammer%20Golden%20Gods%20Awards">Metal Hammer Golden Gods Awards</a>, Keenan stated "I'll go on record now saying you're gonna see some new music next year."

On September 11, 2018, Keenan announced via Twitter that production on the record was progressing and that vocals had been written, before suggesting a 2019 release. In January 2019, Keenan announced that he had completed recording his vocals for the album "months ago." While Carey mentioned aiming for a mid-April release date, Keenan later explained that between May and July was a more realistic timeframe to wrap up production and release the album.

Tool was described by Patrick Donovan of "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" as "the thinking person's metal band. Cerebral and visceral, soft and heavy, melodic and abrasive, tender and brutal, familiar and strange, western and eastern, beautiful and ugly, taut yet sprawling and epic, they are a tangle of contradictions." Tool has gained critical praise from the "<a href="International%20Herald%20Tribune">International Herald Tribune</a>"s C.B. Liddell for their complex and ever-evolving sound. Describing their general sound, <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> refers to them as "grinding, post-<a href="Jane%27s%20Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a> heavy metal", and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" sees similarities to "Led Zeppelin's heaving, battering guitar riffs and Middle Eastern modes". Their 2001 work "Lateralus" was compared by Allmusic to <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "<a href="Meddle">Meddle</a>" (1971), but thirty years later and altered by "Tool's impulse to cram every inch of infinity with hard guitar meat and absolute dread". Tool had been labelled as <a href="post-metal">post-metal</a> in 1993 and 1996, as well as in 2006, after the term came into popularity.

A component of Tool's song repertoire relies on the use of unusual <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>s. For instance, Chancellor describes the time signature employed on the first single from "Lateralus", "<a href="Schism%20%28song%29">Schism</a>", as "six" and "six-and-a-half" and that it later "goes into all kinds of other times". Further examples include the album's title track, which also displays shifting rhythms, as do "10,000 Days": "Wings for Marie (Pt 1)" and "10,000 Days (Wings Pt 2)"."

Beyond this aspect of the band's sound, each band member experiments within his wide musical scope. <a href="Bass%20Player%20%28magazine%29">"Bass Player" magazine</a> described Chancellor's bass playing as having a "thick midrange tone, guitar-style techniques, and elastic versatility". As an example of this, the magazine mentioned the use of a <a href="Wah-wah%20%28music%29">wah effect</a> by <a href="Hammer-on">hammering</a> "the notes with the left hand and using the bass's tone controls to get a tone sweep", such as on the song "The Patient", from "Lateralus".

Completing the band's <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a>, drummer Carey uses <a href="polyrhythm">polyrhythm</a>s, <a href="tabla">tabla</a>-style techniques, and the incorporation of custom <a href="Electronic%20drum">electronic drum pads</a> to trigger samples, such as prerecorded tabla and <a href="octoban">octoban</a> sounds.

Keenan's ability as a vocalist has been characterized more subjectively by the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>": After his performance during an <a href="Alice%20in%20Chains">Alice in Chains</a> reunion concert in 2005, freelancer Travis Hay saw him as "a natural fit at replacing <a href="Layne%20Staley">Layne Staley</a>". Regarding his role in A Perfect Circle and Tool, "The New York Times" wrote that "both groups rely on Mr. Keenan's ability to dignify emotions like lust, anger and disgust, the honey in his voice adding a touch of profundity".

According to "Guitar Player" magazine, Jones does not rely on any one particular guitar-playing technique but rather combines many techniques. For example, Allmusic wrote that he "alternately utiliz[es] power chords, scratchy noise, chiming arpeggios, and a quiet minimalism" in "<a href="Sober%20%28Tool%20song%29">Sober</a>". Additionally, the band uses forms of instrumental experimentation, like the use of a "pipe bomb microphone" (a <a href="Pick%20up%20%28music%20technology%29">guitar pickup</a> mounted inside a brass cylinder) and a <a href="talk%20box">talk box</a> guitar solo on "Jambi".

The band puts an emphasis on the sound of their songs and attempts to reduce the effect lyrics can have on the perception of songs by not releasing song lyrics with any album. Lyrical arrangements are often given special attention, such as in "Lateralus". The number of syllables per line in the lyrics to "Lateralus" correspond to an arrangement of the <a href="Fibonacci%20number">Fibonacci number</a>s and the song "Jambi" uses and makes a reference to the common metrical foot <a href="Iamb%20%28foot%29">iamb</a>. The lyrics on "Ænima" and "Lateralus" focus on philosophy and spirituality—specific subjects range from organized religion in "Opiate", to <a href="evolution">evolution</a> and <a href="Jungian">Jungian</a> psychology in "<a href="Forty-Six%20%26amp%3B%202">Forty-Six & 2</a>" and <a href="transcendence%20%28philosophy%29">transcendence</a> in "Lateralus". On "10,000 Days", Keenan wanted to explore issues more personal to him: the album name and title track refer to the twenty-seven years during which his mother suffered from complications of a stroke until her death in 2003.

The band has named the group <a href="Melvins">Melvins</a> as an influence on its development, but the most-publicized influence is progressive rock pioneer group <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a>. Longtime King Crimson member <a href="Robert%20Fripp">Robert Fripp</a> has downplayed any influence his band had on Tool. In an interview, Fripp touched on how the two bands relate to each other, stating "Do you hear the influence? There's just one figure where I hear an influence, just one. It was a piece we were developing that we dropped. And it's almost exactly the same figure: three note arpeggio with a particular accent from the guitar. So I do not think you could have heard it. That's the only thing." He also said, "I happen to be a Tool fan. The members of Tool have been generous enough to suggest that Crimson has been an influence on them. Adam Jones asked me if I could detect it in their music, and I said I couldn’t. I can detect more Tool influence in King Crimson, than I can hear King Crimson in Tool." In describing their wide range of styles, critics have noted that they are "influenced as much by <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> as by the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>". Other reported influences of the band include <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a>, <a href="Helmet%20%28band%29">Helmet</a>, <a href="Faith%20No%20More">Faith No More</a> and <a href="Jane%27s%20Addiction">Jane's Addiction</a>. In a 1993 interview, Adam Jones named <a href="Joni%20Mitchell">Joni Mitchell</a>, King Crimson, <a href="Depeche%20Mode">Depeche Mode</a> and <a href="country%20music">country music</a> as being among their influences.

Writers HP Newquist and Rich Maloof attribute to Tool an influence on modern metal in their book "The New Metal Masters". Sean Richardson of "<a href="The%20Phoenix%20%28newspaper%29">The Boston Phoenix</a>" sees <a href="System%20of%20a%20Down">System of a Down</a>, <a href="Deftones">Deftones</a>, and <a href="Korn">Korn</a> as examples of Tool's "towering influence" on the genre. Keenan's unique style of singing has been seen as heavily influencing artists such as <a href="Pete%20Loeffler">Pete Loeffler</a> of <a href="Chevelle%20%28band%29">Chevelle</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Burnley">Benjamin Burnley</a> of <a href="Breaking%20Benjamin">Breaking Benjamin</a>, Will Martin of <a href="Earshot">Earshot</a>, and <a href="Fred%20Durst">Fred Durst</a> of <a href="Limp%20Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>.

Part of Tool's work as a band is to incorporate influences of other works of art in their music videos, live shows, and album packaging. Adam Jones doubles as the band's art director and director of their music videos. Another expression of this is an official website "dedicated to the arts and influences" on the band.

The band has released eight music videos but made personal appearances in only the first two, which the band states is to prevent people from "latching onto the personalities involved rather than listening to the music." With the exception of "<a href="Hush%20%28Tool%20song%29">Hush</a>" and "<a href="Vicarious%20%28Tool%20song%29">Vicarious</a>" all of Tool's music videos feature <a href="stop%20motion">stop motion animation</a> to some extent. The videos are created primarily by Adam Jones, often in collaboration with artists such as <a href="Chet%20Zar">Chet Zar</a>, <a href="Alex%20Grey">Alex Grey</a>, and <a href="Osseus%20Labyrint">Osseus Labyrint</a>.

The "<a href="Sober%20%28Tool%20song%29">Sober</a>" music video in particular attracted much attention. Jones explained that it does not contain a storyline, but that his intentions were to summon personal emotions with its imagery. "Rolling Stone" described this imagery as "evil little men dwell in a dark dungeon with meat coursing through pipes in the wall" and called it a "groundbreaking", "epic" clip. "Billboard" voted it "Best Video by a New Artist".

The video for "<a href="Vicarious%20%28song%29">Vicarious</a>" was released on DVD on December 18, 2007. The video is the first by Tool to be produced entirely through the use of <a href="Computer-generated%20imagery">CGI</a>.

Jones is responsible for most of the band's artwork concepts. Their album "Undertow" features a ribcage sculpture by Jones on its cover and photos contributed by the band members. Later albums included artwork by collaborating artists: "Ænima" and "Salival" featured works by <a href="Cam%20de%20Leon">Cam de Leon</a>; "Lateralus" and "10,000 Days" were created with the help of <a href="Alex%20Grey">Alex Grey</a>. The releases garnered positive critical reception, with a music journalist of the <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> attributing to the band a reputation for innovative album packaging.

Both "Ænima" and "10,000 Days" were nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Recording%20Package">Grammy Award for Best Recording Package</a>, but while the former failed to win in 1997, the latter did win in 2007. Jones created packaging for "10,000 Days" that features a pair of <a href="stereoscopic">stereoscopic</a> lenses for viewing 3-D artwork and photos. Jones, a lifelong fan of stereoscopic photography, wanted the packaging to be unique and to reflect the 1970s artwork he appreciates.

Following their first tours in the early 1990s, Tool has performed as a headline act in world tours and major festivals such as <a href="Lollapalooza">Lollapalooza</a> (1997 and 2009), <a href="Coachella%20Valley%20Music%20and%20Arts%20Festival">Coachella</a> (1999 and 2006), <a href="Voodoo%20Experience">Voodoo Fest</a> (2001 and 2016), <a href="Download%20Festival">Download Festival</a> (2006), <a href="Roskilde%20Festival">Roskilde</a> (2001 and 2006), <a href="Big%20Day%20Out">Big Day Out</a> (2007 and 2011), <a href="Bonnaroo">Bonnaroo</a> (2007), <a href="All%20Points%20West%20Music%20%26amp%3B%20Arts%20Festival">All Points West Music & Arts Festival</a> (2009), and <a href="Epicenter%20%28music%20festival%29">Epicenter</a> (2009). They have been joined on stage by numerous artists such as <a href="Buzz%20Osborne">Buzz Osborne</a> and <a href="Scott%20Reeder%20%28bassist%29">Scott Reeder</a> on several occasions; <a href="Tom%20Morello">Tom Morello</a> and <a href="Zack%20de%20la%20Rocha">Zack de la Rocha</a> during their 1991 tour; <a href="Layne%20Staley">Layne Staley</a> in Hawaii, 1993; <a href="Tricky%20%28musician%29">Tricky</a>, <a href="Robert%20Fripp">Robert Fripp</a>, <a href="Mike%20Patton">Mike Patton</a>, <a href="Dave%20Lombardo">Dave Lombardo</a>, <a href="Brann%20Dailor">Brann Dailor</a> of <a href="Mastodon%20%28band%29">Mastodon</a>, and experimental arts duo <a href="Osseus%20Labyrint">Osseus Labyrint</a> during their 2001–02 "Lateralus" tour; and <a href="Kirk%20Hammett">Kirk Hammett</a>, <a href="Phil%20Campbell%20%28musician%29">Phil Campbell</a>, <a href="Serj%20Tankian">Serj Tankian</a>, and Tom Morello during their 2006–07 tour. They have covered songs by Led Zeppelin, <a href="Ted%20Nugent">Ted Nugent</a>, <a href="Peach%20%28band%29">Peach</a>, <a href="Kyuss">Kyuss</a>, the <a href="Dead%20Kennedys">Dead Kennedys</a>, and the <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a>.

Live shows on Tool's headline tour incorporate an unorthodox stage setting and video display. Keenan and Carey line up in the back on elevated platforms, while Jones and Chancellor stand in the front, toward the sides of the stage. Keenan often faces the backdrop or the sides of the stage rather than the audience. No <a href="followspot">followspot</a>s or live cameras are used; instead, the band employs extensive backlighting to direct the focus away from the band members and toward large screens in the back and the crowd. Breckinridge Haggerty, the band's live video designer, says that the resulting dark spaces on stage "are mostly for Maynard". He explains, "[a] lot of the songs are a personal journey for him and he has a hard time with the glare of the lights when he's trying to reproduce these emotions for the audience. He needs a bit of personal space, and he feels more comfortable in the shadows." The big screens are used to play back "looped clips that aren't tracked to a song like a music video. The band has never used any sort of timecode. They’ve always made sure the video can change on-the-fly, in a way that can be improvised. ... The show is never the same twice." During the "10,000 Days" tour, the video material consisted of over six hours of material, created by Jones, his wife Camella Grace, <a href="Chet%20Zar">Chet Zar</a>, Meats Meier, and Haggerty. Some of the material created by Zar has been released on his DVD "Disturb the Normal".

The Age of Reason

The Age of Reason; Being an Investigation of True and Fabulous Theology is a work by English and American political activist <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>, arguing for the philosophical position of <a href="Deism">Deism</a>. It follows in the tradition of eighteenth-century British deism, and challenges institutionalized religion and the legitimacy of the <a href="Bible">Bible</a>. It was published in three parts in 1794, 1795, and 1807.

It was a best-seller in the United States, where it caused a short-lived deistic <a href="revival%20meeting">revival</a>. British audiences, fearing increased <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29%23United%20Kingdom">political radicalism</a> as a result of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>, received it with more hostility. "The Age of Reason" presents common deistic arguments; for example, it highlights what Paine saw as corruption of the <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> Church and criticizes its efforts to acquire political power. Paine advocates reason in the place of <a href="revelation">revelation</a>, leading him to reject <a href="miracle">miracle</a>s and to view the Bible as an ordinary piece of literature rather than as a divinely inspired text. It promotes <a href="natural%20theology">natural religion</a> and argues for the existence of a creator-god.

Most of Paine's arguments had long been available to the <a href="educated">educated</a> <a href="elite">elite</a>, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism appealing and accessible to <a href="common%20people">the masses</a>. Originally distributed as unbound <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>s, the book was also cheap, putting it within the reach of a large number of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many <a href="Freethought">free thinkers</a>.

Paine's book followed in the tradition of <a href="deism%23The%20rise%20of%20British%20deism%20%281690%E2%80%931740%29">early eighteenth-century British deism</a>. These deists, while maintaining individual positions, still shared several sets of assumptions and arguments that Paine articulated in "The Age of Reason". The most important position that united the early deists was their call for "free rational inquiry" into all subjects, especially religion. Saying that early Christianity was founded on <a href="freedom%20of%20conscience">freedom of conscience</a>, they demanded <a href="religious%20toleration">religious toleration</a> and an end to religious persecution. They also demanded that debate rest on reason and rationality. Deists embraced a <a href="Isaac%20Newton%23Effect%20on%20religious%20thought">Newtonian</a> worldview, and they believed that all things in the universe, even God, must obey the laws of nature. Without a concept of <a href="physical%20law">natural law</a>, the deists argued, explanations of the workings of nature would descend into irrationality. This belief in natural law drove their skepticism of <a href="miracle">miracle</a>s. Because miracles had to be observed to be validated, deists rejected the accounts laid out in the Bible of God's miracles and argued that such evidence was neither sufficient nor necessary to prove the existence of God. Along these lines, deistic writings insisted that God, as the <a href="first%20cause">first cause</a> or <a href="Cosmological%20argument">prime mover</a>, had created and designed the universe with natural laws as part of his plan. They held that God does not repeatedly alter his plan by suspending natural laws to (miraculously) intervene in human affairs. Deists also rejected the claim that there was only one revealed religious truth or "one true faith"; religion could only be "simple, apparent, ordinary, and universal" if it was to be the logical product of a benevolent God. They therefore distinguished between "revealed religions" (which they rejected), such as Christianity, and "natural religion", a set of universal beliefs derived from the natural world that demonstrated God's existence (they were, thus, not <a href="atheism">atheists</a>).

While some deists accepted <a href="revelation">revelation</a>, most argued that revelation's restriction to small groups or even a single person limited its explanatory power. Moreover, many found the Christian revelations in particular to be contradictory and irreconcilable. According to these writers, revelation could reinforce the evidence for God's existence already apparent in the natural world, but more often it led to superstition among the masses. Most deists argued that priests had deliberately corrupted Christianity for their own gain by promoting the acceptance of miracles, unnecessary rituals, and illogical and dangerous doctrines (these accusations were typically referred to as "<a href="Deism%23History%20of%20religion%20and%20the%20deist%20mission">priestcraft</a>"). The worst of these doctrines was <a href="original%20sin">original sin</a>. By convincing people that they required a priest's help to overcome their innate sinfulness, deists argued, religious leaders had enslaved the human population. Deists therefore typically viewed themselves as intellectual liberators.

By the time Part I of "The Age of Reason" was published in 1794, many British and French citizens had become disillusioned by the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. The <a href="Reign%20of%20Terror">Reign of Terror</a> had begun, <a href="Louis%20XVI">Louis XVI</a> and <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a> had been tried and executed and <a href="First%20Coalition">Britain was at war with France</a>. Those few British radicals who still supported the French revolution and its ideals were viewed with deep suspicion by their countrymen. "The Age of Reason" belongs to this later, more radical stage of the <a href="Radicalism%20%28historical%29%23United%20Kingdom">British political reform movement</a>, one that openly embraced <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a> and atheism and is exemplified by such texts as <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin's</a> "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>" (1793). By the middle of the decade, the moderate voices had disappeared: <a href="Richard%20Price">Richard Price</a>, the <a href="English%20Dissenters">Dissenting</a> minister whose sermon on political liberty had prompted <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke's</a> "<a href="Reflections%20on%20the%20Revolution%20in%20France">Reflections on the Revolution in France</a>" (1790), had died in 1791, and <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> had been forced to flee to America after a <a href="Priestley%20Riots">Church–and–King mob burned down his home and church</a>.

The conservative government, headed by <a href="William%20Pitt%20the%20Younger">William Pitt</a>, responded to this increasing radicalization by prosecuting several reformers for <a href="seditious%20libel">seditious libel</a> and <a href="treason">treason</a> in the famous <a href="1794%20Treason%20Trials">1794 Treason Trials</a>. Following the trials and an attack on <a href="George%20III">George III</a>, conservatives were successful in passing the <a href="Seditious%20Meetings%20Act%201795">Seditious Meetings Act</a> and the <a href="Treasonable%20Practices%20Act">Treasonable Practices Act</a> (also known as the "Two Acts" or the "gagging acts"). These acts prohibited <a href="freedom%20of%20assembly">freedom of assembly</a> for groups such as the radical <a href="London%20Corresponding%20Society">London Corresponding Society</a> (LCS) and encouraged indictments against radicals for "libelous and seditious" statements. Afraid of prosecution and disenchanted with the French revolution, many reformers drifted away from the cause. The LCS, which had previously unified religious Dissenters and political reformers, fractured when <a href="Francis%20Place">Francis Place</a> and other leaders helped Paine publish "The Age of Reason"; the society's more religious members withdrew in protest and the LCS lost around one-fifth of its membership.

In December 1792, Paine's "<a href="Rights%20of%20Man%20%28book%20written%20by%20Thomas%20Paine%29">Rights of Man, part II</a>" was declared <a href="seditious%20libel">seditious</a> in Britain and he was forced to flee to France in order to avoid arrest. Dismayed by the French revolution's turn toward secularism and atheism, he composed Part I of "The Age of Reason" in 1792 and 1793:

Although Paine wrote "The Age of Reason" for the French, he dedicated it to his "Fellow Citizens of the United States of America", alluding to his bond with the American revolutionaries.

It is unclear when exactly Paine drafted Part I although he says in the preface to Part II:

According to Paine scholars Edward Davidson and William Scheick, he probably wrote the first draft of Part I in late 1793, but Paine biographer David Hawke argues for a date of early 1793. It is also unclear whether or not a French edition of Part I was published in 1793. François Lanthenas, who translated "The Age of Reason" into French in 1794, wrote that it was first published in France in 1793, but no book fitting his description has been positively identified. Barlow published the first English edition of "The Age of Reason, Part I" in 1794 in London, selling it for a mere three <a href="pence">pence</a>.

Meanwhile, Paine, considered too moderate by the powerful <a href="Jacobin%20Club">Jacobin</a> wing of the French revolutionaries, was imprisoned for ten months in France. He only escaped the <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a> by accident: the sign marking him out for execution was improperly placed on his cell door. When <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>, at that time the new American Minister to France, secured his release in 1794, Paine immediately began work on Part II of "The Age of Reason", despite his poor health. Part II was first published in a pirated edition by H.D. Symonds in London in October 1795. In 1796 <a href="Daniel%20Isaac%20Eaton">Daniel Isaac Eaton</a> published Parts I and II, and sold them at a cost of one <a href="shilling">shilling</a> and six pence. (<a href="1794%20Treason%20Trials%23Daniel%20Isaac%20Eaton">Eaton</a> was later forced to flee to America after being convicted of seditious libel for publishing other radical works.) Paine himself financed the shipping of 15,000 copies of his work to America. Later, <a href="Francis%20Place">Francis Place</a> and Thomas Williams collaborated on an edition which sold about 2,000 copies. Williams also produced his own edition, but the British government indicted him and confiscated the pamphlets.

In the late 1790s, Paine fled from France to the United States, where he wrote Part III of "The Age of Reason": "An Examination of the Passages in the New Testament, Quoted from the Old and Called Prophecies Concerning Jesus Christ". Fearing unpleasant and even violent reprisals, <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> convinced him not to publish it in 1802; five years later Paine decided to publish despite the backlash he knew would ensue.

Following Thomas Williams's sentence of one year's hard labor for publishing "The Age of Reason" in 1797, no editions were sold openly in Britain until 1818 when <a href="Richard%20Carlile">Richard Carlile</a> included it in an edition of Paine's complete works. Carlile charged one shilling and sixpence for the work, and the first run of 1,000 copies sold out in a month. He immediately published a second edition of 3,000 copies. Like Williams, he was prosecuted for seditious libel and <a href="Blasphemy%20law%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Common%20law%20treatment">blasphemous libel</a>. The prosecutions surrounding the printing of "The Age of Reason" in Britain continued for thirty years after its initial release and encompassed numerous publishers as well as over a hundred booksellers.

"The Age of Reason" is divided into three sections. In Part I, Paine outlines his major arguments and personal creed. In Parts II and III he analyzes specific portions of the Bible in order to demonstrate that it is not the revealed word of God.

At the beginning of Part I of the "Age of Reason", Paine lays out his personal belief:

Paine's creed encapsulates many of the major themes of the rest of his text: a firm belief in a creator-God; a skepticism regarding most supernatural claims (miracles are specifically mentioned later in the text); a conviction that virtues should be derived from a consideration for others rather than oneself; an animus against corrupt religious institutions; and an emphasis on the individual's right of conscience.

Paine begins "The Age of Reason" by attacking <a href="revelation">revelation</a>. <a href="Revelation">Revelation</a>, he maintains, can only be verified by the individual receivers of the message and is therefore weak evidence for God's existence. Paine rejects prophecies and miracles, writing: "it is revelation to the first person only, and hearsay to every other, and consequently they are not obliged to believe it". He also points out that the Christian revelations appear to have altered over time to adjust for changing political circumstances. Urging his readers to employ reason rather than to rely on revelation, Paine argues that the only reliable, unchanging and universal evidence of God's existence is the natural world. "The Bible of the Deist", he contends, should not be a human invention such as the Bible, but rather a divine invention—it should be "creation". Paine takes this argument even further, maintaining that the same rules of logic and standards of evidence that govern the analysis of secular texts should be applied to the Bible. In Part II of "The Age of Reason", he will do just this, pointing out numerous contradictions in the Bible. For example Thomas Paine notes, " The most extraordinary of all the things called miracles, related in the New Testament, is that of the devil flying away with Jesus Christ, and carrying him to the top of a high mountain, and to the top of the highest pinnacle of the temple, and showing him and promising to him all the kingdoms of the World. How happened it that he did not discover America, or is it only with kingdoms that his sooty highness has any interest? "

After establishing that he would refrain from using extra-Biblical sources to inform his criticism, but would instead apply the Bible's own words against itself, Paine questions the sacredness of the Bible, analyzing it as one would any other book. For example, in his analysis of the <a href="Book%20of%20Proverbs">Book of Proverbs</a> he argues that its sayings are "inferior in keenness to the proverbs of the Spaniards, and not more wise and economical than those of the American <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Franklin</a>". Describing the Bible as "fabulous mythology", Paine questions whether or not it was revealed to its writers and doubts that the original writers can ever be known (he dismisses the idea that <a href="Moses">Moses</a> wrote the <a href="Pentateuch">Pentateuch</a> or that the Gospel's authors are known, for example).

Using methods that would not become common in Biblical scholarship until the nineteenth century, Paine tested the Bible for internal consistency and questioned its historical accuracy, concluding that it was not divinely inspired.

Paine also argues that the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> must be false because it depicts a tyrannical God. The "history of wickedness" pervading the Old Testament convinced Paine that it was simply another set of human-authored myths. He deplores people's credulity: "Brought up in habits of superstition," he wrote, "people in general know not how much wickedness there is in this pretended word of God." Citing <a href="Book%20of%20Numbers">Numbers</a> 31:13–47 as an example, in which Moses orders the slaughter of thousands of boys and women, and sanctions the rape of thousands of girls, at God's behest, Paine calls the Bible a "book of lies, wickedness, and blasphemy; for what can be greater blasphemy than to ascribe the wickedness of man to the orders of the Almighty!"

Paine also attacks religious <a href="Institution">institutions</a>, indicting priests for their lust for power and wealth and the Church's opposition to scientific investigation. He presents the history of Christianity as one of corruption and oppression. Paine criticizes the tyrannical actions of the Church as he had those of governments in the "<a href="Rights%20of%20Man">Rights of Man</a>" and "<a href="Common%20Sense%20%28pamphlet%29">Common Sense</a>", stating that "the Christian theory is little else than the idolatry of the ancient Mythologists, accommodated to the purposes of power and revenue." This kind of attack distinguishes Paine's book from other deistic works, which were less interested in challenging social and political hierarchies. He argues that the Church and the State are a single corrupt institution which does not act in the best interests of the people—both must be radically altered:

As Jon Mee, a scholar of British radicalism, writes: "Paine believed ... a revolution in religion was the natural corollary, even prerequisite, of a fully successful political revolution." Paine lays out a vision of, in Davidson and Scheick's words, "an age of intellectual freedom, when reason would triumph over superstition, when the natural liberties of humanity would supplant priestcraft and kingship, which were both secondary effects of politically managed foolish legends and religious superstitions." It is this vision that scholars have called Paine's "secular <a href="millennialism">millennialism</a>" and it appears in all of his works—he ends the "Rights of Man", for example, with the statement: "From what we now see, nothing of reform in the political world ought to be held improbable. It is an age of <a href="Revolution">revolutions</a>, in which everything may be looked for." Paine "transformed the millennial Protestant vision of the rule of Christ on earth into a secular image of utopia," emphasizing the possibilities of "progress" and "human perfectibility" that could be achieved by humankind, without God's aid.

Although Paine liked to say that he read very little, his writings belie this statement; "The Age of Reason" has intellectual roots in the traditions of <a href="David%20Hume">David Hume</a>, <a href="Spinoza">Spinoza</a>, and <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>. Since Hume had already made many of the same "moral attacks upon Christianity" that Paine popularized in "The Age of Reason", scholars have concluded that Paine probably read Hume's works on religion or had at least heard about them through the <a href="Joseph%20Johnson%20%28publisher%29">Joseph Johnson</a> circle. Paine would have been particularly drawn to Hume's description of religion as "a positive source of harm to society" that "led men to be factious, ambitious and intolerant". More of an influence on Paine than Hume was Spinoza's "<a href="Theologico-Political%20Treatise">Tractatus Theologico-politicus</a>" (1678). Paine would have been exposed to Spinoza's ideas through the works of other eighteenth-century deists, most notably <a href="Conyers%20Middleton">Conyers Middleton</a>.

Though these larger philosophical traditions are clear influences on "The Age of Reason", Paine owes the greatest intellectual debt to the <a href="deism%23The%20rise%20of%20British%20deism%20%281690%E2%80%931740%29">English deists of the early eighteenth century</a>, such as <a href="Peter%20Annet">Peter Annet</a>. <a href="John%20Toland%20%28Irish%20Philosopher%29">John Toland</a> had argued for the use of reason in interpreting scripture, <a href="Matthew%20Tindal">Matthew Tindal</a> had argued against revelation, Middleton had described the Bible as mythology and questioned the existence of miracles, <a href="Thomas%20Morgan%20%28deist%29">Thomas Morgan</a> had disputed the claims of the Old Testament, <a href="Thomas%20Woolston">Thomas Woolston</a> had questioned the believability of miracles and <a href="Thomas%20Chubb">Thomas Chubb</a> had maintained that Christianity lacked morality. All of these arguments appear in "The Age of Reason", albeit less coherently.

The most distinctive feature of "The Age of Reason", like all of Paine's works, is its linguistic style. Historian <a href="Eric%20Foner">Eric Foner</a> argues that Paine's works "forged a new political language" designed to bring politics to the people, using a "clear, simple and straightforward" style. Paine outlined "a new vision—a utopian image of an egalitarian republican society" and his language reflected these ideals. He originated such phrases as "the rights of man", "the age of reason", "the age of revolution", and "the times that try men's souls". Foner also maintains that with "The Age of Reason" Paine "gave deism a new, aggressive, explicitly anti-Christian tone".

He did this by employing "<a href="wikt%3Avulgar">vulgar</a>" (that is, "low" or "popular") language, an irreverent tone, and even religious rhetoric. In a letter to <a href="Elihu%20Palmer">Elihu Palmer</a>, one of his most loyal followers in America, Paine describes part of his rhetorical philosophy:

Paine's rhetoric had broad appeal; his "pithy" lines were "able to bridge working-class and middle-class cultures" and become common quotations.

Part of what makes Paine's style so memorable is his effective use of repetition and rhetorical questions in addition to the profusion of "anecdote, irony, parody, satire, feigned confusion, folk matter, concrete vocabulary, and ... appeals to common sense". Paine's conversational style draws the reader into the text. His use of "we" conveys an "illusion that he and the readers share the activity of constructing an argument". By thus emphasizing the presence of the reader and leaving images and arguments half-formed, Paine encourages his readers to complete them independently.

The most distinctive element of Paine's style in "The Age of Reason" is its "<a href="wikt%3Avulgar">vulgarity</a>". In the eighteenth century "vulgarity" was associated with the middling and lower classes and not with obscenity; thus, when Paine celebrates his "vulgar" style and his critics attack it, the dispute is over class accessibility, not profanity. For example, Paine describes <a href="The%20Fall%20of%20Man">the Fall</a> this way:

The irreverent tone that Paine combined with this vulgar style set his work apart from its predecessors. It took "deism out of the hands of the aristocracy and intellectuals and [brought] it to the people".

Paine's rhetorical appeal to "the people" attracted almost as much criticism as his ridicule of the Bible. <a href="Richard%20Watson%20%28bishop%29">Bishop Richard Watson</a>, forced to address this new audience in his influential response to Paine, "An Apology for the Bible", writes: "I shall, designedly, write this and the following letters in a popular manner; hoping that thereby they may stand a chance of being perused by that class of readers, for whom your work seems to be particularly calculated, and who are the most likely to be injured by it." But it was not only the style that concerned Watson and others, it was also the cheapness of Paine's book. At one <a href="seditious%20libel">sedition</a> trial in the early 1790s, the Attorney–General tried to prohibit Thomas Cooper from publishing his response to Burke's "Reflections on the Revolution in France", arguing that "although there was no exception to be taken to his pamphlet when in the hands of the upper classes, yet the government would not allow it to appear at a price which would insure its circulation among the people."

Paine's style is not only "vulgar", it is also irreverent. For example, he says that once one dismisses the false idea of Moses being the author of Genesis, "The story of Eve and the serpent, and of Noah and his ark, drops to a level with the Arabian tales, without the merit of being entertaining." Although many early English deists had relied on ridicule to attack the Bible and Christianity, theirs was a <a href="wit">refined wit</a> rather than the broad humor Paine employed. It was the early Deists of the middling ranks, and not the educated elite, who initiated the kind of ridicule Paine would make famous.

It was Paine's "ridiculing" tone that most angered Churchmen. As John Redwood, a scholar of deism, puts it: "the age of reason could perhaps more eloquently and adequately be called the age of ridicule, for it was ridicule, not reason, that endangered the Church." Significantly, Watson's "Apology" directly chastises Paine for his mocking tone:
Paine's <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> upbringing predisposed him to <a href="deist">deist</a>ic thinking at the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious <a href="English%20dissenters">Dissent</a>. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the <a href="Simplicity%20in%20speech">Quakers' esteem for plain speaking</a>, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in "The Age of Reason", influenced his writing even more. As the historian <a href="E.%20P.%20Thompson">E. P. Thompson</a> has put it, Paine "ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country girl could understand". His description of the story of the <a href="virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus">virgin birth of Jesus</a> demystifies biblical language: it is "an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost". Quaker <a href="conversion%20narrative">conversion narrative</a>s also influenced the style of "The Age of Reason"; Davidson and Scheick argue that its "introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others" resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.

Paine takes advantage of several religious rhetorics beyond those associated with Quakerism in "The Age of Reason", most importantly a <a href="millenarianism">millennial</a> language that appealed to his lower-class readers. Claiming that true religious language is universal, Paine uses elements of the Christian rhetorical tradition to undermine the hierarchies perpetuated by religion itself. The <a href="sermon">sermon</a>ic quality of Paine's writing is one of its most recognizable traits. <a href="Sacvan%20Bercovitch">Sacvan Bercovitch</a>, a scholar of the sermon, argues that Paine's writing often resembles that of the <a href="jeremiad">jeremiad</a> or "political sermon". He contends that Paine draws on the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> tradition in which "theology was wedded to politics and politics to the progress of the kingdom of God". One reason Paine may have been drawn to this style is because he may have briefly been a <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> preacher, although this suspicion cannot be verified.

"The Age of Reason" provoked a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although the intensity of that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.

Paine's "Age of Reason" sparked enough anger in Britain to initiate not only a series of <a href="government">government</a> prosecutions but also a pamphlet war. Around 50 unfavorable replies appeared between 1795 and 1799 alone and refutations were still being published in 1812. Many of these responded specifically to Paine's attack on the Bible in Part II (when Thomas Williams was prosecuted for printing Part II, it became clear its circulation had far exceeded that of Part I). Although critics responded to Paine's analysis of the Bible, they did not usually address his specific arguments. Instead, they advocated a <a href="Biblical%20literalism">literal reading of the Bible</a>, citing the Bible's long history as evidence of its authority. They also issued "<a href="ad%20hominem">ad hominem</a>" attacks against Paine, describing him "as an enemy of proper thought and of the morality of decent, enlightened people". <a href="English%20dissenters">Dissenters</a> such as <a href="Joseph%20Priestley">Joseph Priestley</a> who had endorsed the arguments of the "<a href="Rights%20of%20Man">Rights of Man</a>" turned away from those presented in "The Age of Reason". Even the liberal "<a href="Analytical%20Review">Analytical Review</a>" was skeptical of Paine's claims and distanced itself from the book. Paine's deism was simply too radical for these more moderate reformers and they feared being tarred with the brush of extremism.

Despite the outpouring of antagonistic replies to "The Age of Reason", some scholars have argued that <a href="Constantin%20Volney">Constantin Volney's</a> deistic "The Ruins" (translations of excerpts from the French original appeared in radical papers such as <a href="Thomas%20Spence">Thomas Spence's</a> "Pig's Meat" and <a href="Daniel%20Isaac%20Eaton">Daniel Isaac Eaton's</a> "Politics for the People") was actually more influential than "The Age of Reason". According to David Bindman, "The Ruins" "achieved a popularity in England comparable to "Rights of Man" itself". One minister complained that "the mischief arising from the spreading of such a pernicious publication [as "The Age of Reason"] was infinitely greater than any that could spring from limited suffrage and septennial parliaments" (other popular reform causes).

It was not until <a href="Richard%20Carlile">Richard Carlile's</a> 1818 trial for publishing "The Age of Reason" that Paine's text became "the anti-Bible of all lower-class nineteenth-century infidel agitators". Although the book had been selling well before the trial, once Carlile was arrested and charged, 4,000 copies were sold in just a few months. At the trial itself, which created a media frenzy, Carlile read the entirety of "The Age of Reason" into the court record, ensuring it an even wider publication. Between 1818 and 1822, Carlile claimed to have "sent into circulation near 20,000 copies of the "Age of Reason"". Just as in the 1790s, it was the language that most angered the authorities in 1818. As Joss Marsh, in her study of blasphemy in the nineteenth century, points out, "at these trials plain English was reconfigured as itself 'abusive' and 'outrageous.' The "Age of Reason" struggle almost tolled the hour when the words 'plain,' 'coarse,' 'common,' and 'vulgar' took on a pejorative meaning." Carlile was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to one year in prison, but spent six years instead because he refused any "legal conditions" on his release.

Paine's new rhetoric came to dominate popular nineteenth-century radical journalism, particularly that of <a href="Freethought">freethinkers</a>, <a href="Chartism">Chartists</a> and <a href="Robert%20Owen">Owenites</a>. Its legacy can be seen in <a href="Thomas%20Jonathan%20Wooler">Thomas Wooler's</a> radical periodical "<a href="The%20Black%20Dwarf">The Black Dwarf</a>", <a href="Richard%20Carlile">Richard Carlile's</a> numerous newspapers and journals, the radical works of <a href="William%20Cobbett">William Cobbett</a>, <a href="Henry%20Hetherington">Henry Hetherington's</a> periodicals the "Penny Papers" and the "<a href="Poor%20Man%27s%20Guardian">Poor Man's Guardian</a>", the works of the Chartist <a href="William%20Lovett">William Lovett</a>, <a href="George%20Holyoake">George Holyoake's</a> newspapers and books on <a href="Robert%20Owen">Owenism</a>, and freethinker <a href="Charles%20Bradlaugh">Charles Bradlaugh's</a> "New Reformer". A century after the publication of "The Age of Reason", Paine's rhetoric was still being used: <a href="George%20William%20Foote">George Foote's</a> ""Bible Handbook" (1888) ... systematically manhandles chapters and verses to bring out 'Contradictions,' 'Absurdities,' 'Atrocities,' and 'Obscenities,' exactly in the manner of Paine's "Age of Reason"." The periodical "<a href="The%20Freethinker%20%28journal%29">The Freethinker</a>" (founded in 1881 by George Foote) argued, like Paine, that the "absurdities of faith" could be "slain with laughter".

"The Age of Reason", despite having been written for the French, made very little, if any, impact on revolutionary France. Paine wrote that "the people of France were running headlong into atheism and I had the work translated into their own language, to stop them in that career, and fix them to the first article ... of every man's creed who has any creed at all – "I believe in God"" (emphasis Paine's). Paine's arguments were already common and accessible in France; they had, in a sense, already been rejected.

While still in France, Paine formed the <a href="Theophilanthropy">Church of Theophilanthropy</a> with five other families; this civil religion held as its central dogma that man should worship God's wisdom and benevolence and imitate those divine attributes as much as possible. The church had no priest or minister, and the traditional Biblical sermon was replaced by scientific lectures or homilies on the teachings of philosophers. It celebrated four festivals honoring <a href="Vincent%20de%20Paul">St. Vincent de Paul</a>, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>, <a href="Socrates">Socrates</a>, and <a href="Rousseau">Rousseau</a>. <a href="Samuel%20Adams">Samuel Adams</a> articulated the goals of this church when he wrote that Paine aimed "to renovate the age by inculcating in the minds of youth the fear and love of the Deity and universal philanthropy". The church closed in 1801, when <a href="Napoleon%20I%20of%20France">Napoleon</a> concluded a <a href="Concordat%20of%201801">concordat</a> with the <a href="Pope">Vatican</a>.

In the United States, "The Age of Reason" initially caused a deistic "revival", but was then viciously attacked and largely forgotten. Paine became so reviled that he could still be maligned as a "filthy little atheist" by <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> over one hundred years later.

At the end of the eighteenth century, America was ripe for Paine's arguments. <a href="Ethan%20Allen">Ethan Allen</a> published the first American defense of deism, "Reason, The Only Oracle of Man" (1784), but deism remained primarily a philosophy of the educated elite. Men such as <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> espoused its tenets, while at the same time arguing that religion served the useful purpose of "social control". It was not until the publication of Paine's more entertaining and popular work that deism reached into the middling and lower classes in America. The public was receptive, in part, because they approved of the secular ideals of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a>. "The Age of Reason" went through seventeen editions and sold thousands of copies in the United States. <a href="Elihu%20Palmer">Elihu Palmer</a>, "a blind renegade minister" and Paine's most loyal follower in America, promoted deism throughout the country. Palmer published what became "the bible of American deism", "The Principles of Nature", established deistic societies from Maine to Georgia, built Temples of Reason throughout the nation, and founded two deistic newspapers for which Paine eventually wrote seventeen essays. Foner writes that ""The Age of Reason" became the most popular deist work ever written. ... Before Paine it had been possible to be both a Christian and a deist; now such a religious outlook became virtually untenable." Paine presented deism to the masses and, as in Britain, educated elites feared the consequences of such material in the hands of so many. Their fear helped to drive the backlash which soon followed.

Almost immediately after this deistic upsurge, the <a href="Second%20Great%20Awakening">Second Great Awakening</a> began. George Spater explains that "the revulsion felt for Paine's "Age of Reason" and for other anti-religious thought was so great that a major counter-revolution had been set underway in America before the end of the eighteenth century." By 1796 every student at <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a> was given a copy of Bishop Watson's rebuttal of "The Age of Reason". In 1815, <a href="Parson%20Weems">Parson Weems</a>, an early American novelist and moralist, published "God's Revenge Against Adultery", in which one of the major characters "owed his early downfall to reading 'PAINE'S AGE OF REASON'". Paine's "libertine" text leads the young man to "bold slanders of the bible", even to the point that he "threw aside his father's good old family bible, and for a surer guide to pleasure took up the AGE OF REASON!"

Paine could not publish part III of "The Age of Reason" in America until 1807 because of the deep antipathy against him. Hailed only a few years earlier as a hero of the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>, Paine was now lambasted in the press and called "the scavenger of faction", a "lilly-livered sinical rogue", a "loathsome reptile", a "demi-human archbeast", "an object of disgust, of abhorrence, of absolute loathing to every decent man except the President of the United States [Thomas Jefferson]". In October 1805 <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a> wrote to his friend <a href="Benjamin%20Waterhouse">Benjamin Waterhouse</a>, an American physician and scientist:

Adams viewed Paine's "Age of Reason" not as the embodiment of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> but as a "betrayal" of it. Despite all of these attacks, Paine never wavered in his beliefs; when he was dying, a woman came to visit him, claiming that God had instructed her to save his soul. Paine dismissed her in the same tones that he had used in "The Age of Reason": "pooh, pooh, it is not true. You were not sent with any such impertinent message. ... Pshaw, He would not send such a foolish ugly old woman as you about with His message."

"The Age of Reason" was largely ignored after 1820, except by radical groups in Britain and freethinkers in America, among them <a href="Robert%20G.%20Ingersoll">Robert G. Ingersoll</a> and the American <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> <a href="Moncure%20Daniel%20Conway">Moncure Daniel Conway</a>, who edited his works and wrote the first biography of Paine, favorably reviewed by "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>". Not until the publication of <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin's</a> "<a href="The%20Origin%20of%20Species">The Origin of Species</a>" in 1859, and the large-scale abandonment of the literal reading of the Bible that it caused in Britain, did many of Paine's ideas take hold. As writer <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a> said, "It took a brave man before the Civil War to confess he had read the "Age of Reason"...I read it first when I was a cub pilot, read it with fear and hesitation, but marveling at its fearlessness and wonderful power." Paine's criticisms of the church, the monarchy, and the aristocracy appear most clearly in Twain's "<a href="A%20Connecticut%20Yankee%20in%20King%20Arthur%27s%20Court">A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</a>" (1889).

Paine's text is still published today, one of the few eighteenth-century religious texts to be widely available. Its message still resonates, evidenced by <a href="Christopher%20Hitchens">Christopher Hitchens's</a> statement that "if the rights of man are to be upheld in a dark time, we shall require an age of reason". His ends with the claim that "in a time ... when both rights and reason are under several kinds of open and covert attack, the life and writing of Thomas Paine will always be part of the arsenal on which we shall need to depend."

Tau Ceti

Tau Ceti, <a href="Latinized">Latinized</a> from τ Ceti, is a single <a href="star">star</a> in the <a href="constellation">constellation</a> <a href="Cetus">Cetus</a> that is <a href="Stellar%20classification">spectrally</a> similar to the <a href="Sun">Sun</a>, although it has only about 78% of the <a href="Solar%20mass">Sun's mass</a>. At a distance of just under from the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>, it is a <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">relatively nearby star</a> and the closest solitary <a href="G-type%20main-sequence%20star">G-class</a> star. The star appears stable, with little <a href="stellar%20variation">stellar variation</a>, and is <a href="metallicity">metal-deficient</a>.

Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in the Solar System. Since December 2012, there has been evidence of possibly five planets orbiting Tau Ceti, with two of these being potentially in the <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>. Because of its <a href="debris%20disk">debris disk</a>, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more <a href="impact%20event">impact event</a>s than Earth. Despite this hurdle to <a href="Planetary%20habitability">habitability</a>, its <a href="solar%20analog">solar analog</a> (Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in the star. Given its stability, similarity and relative proximity to the Sun, Tau Ceti is consistently listed as a target for the <a href="SETI">Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence</a> (SETI) and appears in <a href="Tau%20Ceti%20in%20fiction">some science fiction</a> literature.

It can be seen with the unaided eye as a third-<a href="Apparent%20magnitude">magnitude</a> star. As seen from Tau Ceti, the Sun would be a third-magnitude star in the northern hemisphere constellation <a href="Bo%C3%B6tes">Boötes</a>.

The name "Tau Ceti" is the <a href="Bayer%20designation">Bayer designation</a> for this star, established in 1603 as part of German celestial cartographer <a href="Johann%20Bayer">Johann Bayer</a>'s "<a href="Uranometria">Uranometria</a>" star catalogue: it is "number T" in Bayer's sequence of constellation Cetus. In the catalogue of stars in the "Calendarium" of <a href="Al%20Achsasi%20al%20Mouakket">Al Achsasi al Mouakket</a>, written at <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> about 1650, this star was designated "Thālith al Naʽāmāt" (ثالث النعامات - "thālith al-naʽāmāt"), which was translated into <a href="Latin">Latin</a> as "Tertia Struthionum", meaning "the third of the ostriches". This star, along with <a href="Eta%20Ceti">η Cet</a> (Deneb Algenubi), <a href="Theta%20Ceti">θ Cet</a> (Thanih Al Naamat), <a href="Zeta%20Ceti">ζ Cet</a> (Baten Kaitos), and <a href="Upsilon%20Ceti">υ Cet</a>, were "Al Naʽāmāt" (النعامات), the Hen Ostriches.

In Chinese, the "<a href="Bond%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Square Celestial Granary</a>" () refers to an <a href="asterism%20%28astronomy%29">asterism</a> consisting of τ Ceti, <a href="Iota%20Ceti">ι Ceti</a>, <a href="Eta%20Ceti">η Ceti</a>, <a href="Zeta%20Ceti">ζ Ceti</a>, <a href="Theta%20Ceti">θ Ceti</a> and <a href="57%20Ceti">57 Ceti</a>. Consequently, τ Ceti itself is known as the "Fifth Star of Square Celestial Granary" ().

The <a href="proper%20motion">proper motion</a> of a star is its rate of movement across the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>, determined by comparing its position relative to more distant background objects. Tau Ceti is considered to be a high-proper-motion star, although it only has an annual traverse of just under 2 <a href="arc%20second">arc second</a>s. Thus it will require about 2000 years before the location of this star shifts by more than a degree. A high proper motion is an indicator of closeness to the Sun. Nearby stars can traverse an angle of arc across the sky more rapidly than the distant background stars and are good candidates for <a href="parallax">parallax</a> studies. In the case of Tau Ceti, the parallax measurements indicate a distance of . This makes it <a href="List%20of%20nearest%20stars">one of the closest</a> star systems to the Sun and the next-closest <a href="Stellar%20classification%23Class%20G">spectral class-G star</a> after <a href="Alpha%20Centauri">Alpha Centauri A</a>.

The <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> of a star is the component of its motion that is toward or away from the Sun. Unlike proper motion, a star's radial velocity cannot be directly observed, but can be determined by measuring its <a href="stellar%20spectrum">spectrum</a>. Due to the <a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler shift</a>, the <a href="absorption%20line">absorption line</a>s in the spectrum of a star will be shifted slightly toward the red (or longer wavelengths) if the star is moving away from the observer, or toward blue (or shorter wavelengths) when it moves toward the observer. In the case of Tau Ceti, the radial velocity is about −17 km/s, with the negative value indicating that it is moving toward the Sun. The star will make its closest approach to the Sun in about 43,000 years, when it comes to within .

The distance to Tau Ceti, along with its proper motion and radial velocity, together give the motion of the star through space. The <a href="stellar%20kinematics">space velocity</a> relative to the Sun is . This result can then be used to compute an orbital path of Tau Ceti through the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>. It has a mean galacto-centric distance of () and an <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a> of 0.22.

The Tau Ceti system is believed to have only one stellar component. A dim optical companion has also been observed with magnitude 13.1. As of 2000, it was distant from the primary. It may be gravitationally bound, but it is considered more likely to be a line-of-sight coincidence.

Most of what is known about the physical properties of Tau Ceti and its system has been determined through <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopic</a> measurements. By comparing the spectrum to computed models of <a href="stellar%20evolution">stellar evolution</a>, the age, mass, radius and luminosity of Tau Ceti can be estimated. However, using an <a href="astronomical%20interferometer">astronomical interferometer</a>, measurements of the radius of the star can be made directly to an accuracy of 0.5%. Through such means, the radius of Tau Ceti has been measured to be of the <a href="solar%20radius">solar radius</a>. This is about the size that is expected for a star with somewhat lower mass than the Sun.

The <a href="rotation%20period">rotation period</a> for Tau Ceti was measured by periodic variations in the classic H and K absorption lines of singly <a href="ion">ion</a>ized <a href="calcium">calcium</a> (Ca II). These lines are closely associated with surface <a href="magnetism">magnetic</a> activity, so the period of variation measures the time required for the activity sites to complete a full rotation about the star. By this means the rotation period for Tau Ceti is estimated to be . Due to the <a href="Doppler%20effect">Doppler effect</a>, the <a href="Stellar%20rotation">rotation rate of a star</a> affects the width of the absorption lines in the spectrum (light from the side of the star moving away from the observer will be shifted to a longer wavelength; light from the side moving towards the observer will be shifted toward a shorter wavelength). By analyzing the width of these lines, the rotational velocity of a star can be estimated. The projected rotation velocity for Tau Ceti is

where "v" is the velocity at the <a href="equator">equator</a>, and "i" is the <a href="inclination">inclination</a> angle of the <a href="Rotation%20around%20a%20fixed%20axis">rotation axis</a> to the <a href="Line-of-sight%20propagation">line of sight</a>. For a typical G8 star, the rotation velocity is about . The relatively low rotational velocity measurements may indicate that Tau Ceti is being viewed from nearly the direction of its pole.

The chemical composition of a star provides important clues to its evolutionary history, including the age at which it formed. The <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> of dust and gas from which stars form is primarily composed of <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> and <a href="helium">helium</a> with trace amounts of heavier elements. As nearby stars continually evolve and die, they seed the interstellar medium with an increasing portion of heavier elements. Thus younger stars tend to have a higher portion of heavy elements in their atmospheres than do the older stars. These heavy elements are termed "metals" by astronomers, and the portion of heavy elements is the <a href="metallicity">metallicity</a>. The amount of metallicity in a star is given in terms of the ratio of <a href="iron">iron</a> (Fe), an easily observed heavy element, to hydrogen. A <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a> of the relative iron abundance is compared to the Sun. In the case of Tau Ceti, the atmospheric metallicity is

equivalent to about a third the solar abundance. Past measurements have varied from −0.13 to −0.60.

This lower abundance of iron indicates that Tau Ceti is almost certainly older than the Sun. Its age had previously been estimated to be about , but is now thought to be around half that, at . This compares with for the Sun. However, computed age estimates for Tau Ceti can range from 4.4 to , depending on the model adopted.

Besides rotation, another factor that can widen the absorption features in the spectrum of a star is <a href="pressure%20broadening">pressure broadening</a>. The presence of nearby particles affects the radiation emitted by an individual particle. So the line width is dependent on the surface pressure of the star, which in turn is determined by the temperature and surface gravity. This technique was used to determine the surface gravity of Tau Ceti. The , or <a href="logarithm">logarithm</a> of the star's surface gravity, is about 4.4, very close to the for the Sun.

The <a href="luminosity">luminosity</a> of Tau Ceti is equal to only 55% of the <a href="solar%20luminosity">Sun's luminosity</a>. A <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a> would need to orbit this star at a distance of about in order to match the solar <a href="insolation">insolation</a> level of Earth. This is approximately the same as the average distance between <a href="Venus">Venus</a> and the Sun.

The <a href="chromosphere">chromosphere</a> of Tau Ceti—the portion of a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting <a href="photosphere">photosphere</a>—currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One 9-year study of temperature, <a href="Granule%20%28solar%20physics%29">granulation</a>, and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K <a href="Infrared%20astronomy">infrared bands</a> show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively it has been suggested that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a <a href="Maunder%20minimum">Maunder minimum</a>—a historical period, associated with the <a href="Little%20Ice%20Age">Little Ice Age</a> in Europe, when <a href="sunspot">sunspot</a>s became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. <a href="Spectral%20line">Spectral line</a> profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The star's oscillations have an amplitude about half that of the Sun and a lower mode lifetime.

Principal factors driving research interest in Tau Ceti are its proximity, its Sun-like characteristics and their implications for possible planets and life. For categorization purposes, Hall and Lockwood report that "the terms 'solarlike star', '<a href="solar%20analog">solar analog</a>', and 'solar twin' [are] progressively restrictive descriptions". Tau Ceti fits the second category, given its similar mass and low variability, but relative lack of metals. The similarities have inspired <a href="Tau%20Ceti%20in%20fiction">popular culture references</a> for decades, as well as scientific examination.

Tau Ceti has been a target of radial-velocity planetary searches. As of 1988, observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11 m/s measured over a 5-year time span. This result excludes the presence of <a href="hot%20Jupiter">hot Jupiter</a>s and probably excludes any planets with minimal mass greater than or equal to Jupiter's mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>'s <a href="Wide%20Field%20and%20Planetary%20Camera">Wide Field and Planetary Camera</a> was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope's resolving power.

These searches only excluded larger <a href="brown%20dwarf">brown dwarf</a> bodies and giant planets, so smaller, Earth-like planets in orbit around the star were not precluded. If "hot Jupiters" did exist in close orbit, they would likely disrupt the star's <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>; their exclusion was thus considered positive for the possibility of Earth-like planets. General research has shown a positive correlation between the presence of planets and a relatively high-metallicity parent star, suggesting that stars with lower metallicity such as Tau Ceti have a lower chance of having planets. Primitive life on Tau Ceti's planets might reveal itself through an atmospheric composition unlikely to be abiotic, just as oxygen on Earth is indicative of life.

The most optimistic search project to date was <a href="Project%20Ozma">Project Ozma</a>, which was intended to "search for <a href="extraterrestrial%20intelligence">extraterrestrial intelligence</a>" (<a href="SETI">SETI</a>) by examining selected stars for indications of artificial radio signals. It was run by the astronomer <a href="Frank%20Drake">Frank Drake</a>, who selected Tau Ceti and <a href="Epsilon%20Eridani">Epsilon Eridani</a> as the initial targets. Both are located near the Solar System and are physically similar to the Sun. No artificial signals were found despite 200 hours of observations. Subsequent radio searches of this star system have also turned up negative.

This lack of results has not dampened interest in observing the Tau Ceti system for biosignatures. In 2002, astronomers <a href="Margaret%20Turnbull">Margaret Turnbull</a> and <a href="Jill%20Tarter">Jill Tarter</a> developed the <a href="Catalog%20of%20Nearby%20Habitable%20Systems">Catalog of Nearby Habitable Systems</a> (HabCat) under the auspices of <a href="Project%20Phoenix%20%28SETI%29">Project Phoenix</a>, another SETI endeavour. The list contained more than theoretically habitable systems, approximately 10% of the original sample. The next year, Turnbull would further refine the list to the 30 most promising systems out of within 100 light-years from the Sun, including Tau Ceti; this will form part of the basis of radio searches with the <a href="Allen%20Telescope%20Array">Allen Telescope Array</a>. She also chose Tau Ceti for a final shortlist of just five stars suitable for searches by the (indefinitely postponed) <a href="Terrestrial%20Planet%20Finder">Terrestrial Planet Finder</a> telescope system, commenting that "these are places I'd want to live if God were to put our planet around another star".

On December 19, 2012, evidence was presented that suggest a system of five planets orbiting Tau Ceti. The planets' estimated minimal masses are between 2 and 6 <a href="Earth%20mass">Earth mass</a>es, and their orbital periods range from 14 to 640 days. One of them, tentatively named Tau Ceti e, appears to orbit about half as far from Tau Ceti as Earth does from the Sun. With Tau Ceti's luminosity of 52% that of the Sun and a distance from the star of 0.552 AU, the planet would receive 1.71 times as much stellar radiation as Earth does, slightly less than Venus with 1.91 times Earth's. Nevertheless, some research places it within the star's habitable zone. The Planetary Habitability Laboratory has estimated that Tau Ceti f, which would receive 28.5% as much starlight as Earth, would be narrowly within the habitable zone of the star as well.

The team that made the discovery in 2013 went on to refine and improve their methodology, and with updated radial-velocity measurements, published new results in August 2017. They confirmed Tau Ceti e and f as candidates, but failed to detect Tau Ceti b and c (which had appeared to orbit the star at a suspicious 0.4 and 1 times the star's rotation period, which would have suggested that their apparent signal is related to stellar rotation rather than an orbiting planet, although this can be <a href="false%20negative">false negative</a>). Instead they found two new planetary candidates, Tau Ceti g and h, with orbits of 20 and 49 days. They did find some evidence for the existence of Tau Ceti d, but, because it did not show up in all data sets, they were unable to confirm it as a candidate planet.

The updated 4-planet model is dynamically packed and potentially stable for billions of years, but with further refinements more planet candidates could still be detected (including b and c). The signals detected from the candidate planets have radial velocities as low as 30 cm/s, and the experimental method used in their detection, as it was applied to HARPS, could in theory have detected down to around 20 cm/s. In order to detect an Earth-sized planet candidate between Tau Ceti e and f, in the system's habitable zone, a radial velocity precision of approximately 10 cm/s would need to be achieved.

The <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a> for this star, defined as the locations where liquid water could be present on an Earth-sized planet, is at a radius of 0.55–1.16 <a href="Astronomical%20Units">AU</a>, where 1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun.

If Tau Ceti is aligned in such a way that it is nearly pole-on to Earth (as its rotation could indicate), that would mean that the planets would be, rather than slightly larger to a few times Earth's mass, they would be on the leagues of tens of Earth masses to even hundreds. For example, if Tau Ceti f's orbit was inclined 70 degrees from being head-on to Earth, its mass would be Earth masses, making it a mini-Neptune or mega-Earth on the middle-to-high end, and a larger super-Earth on the lower end. However, this scenario isn't necessarily true; since Tau Ceti's debris disk has an inclination of , though, this could mean that the planets' orbits are similarly inclined. This would put f from to Earth masses, which means it's less likely to be a mini-Neptune even at the higher threshold, if it is assumed that the debris disk and f's orbits are equal.

Tau Ceti e is a candidate <a href="planet">planet</a> orbiting Tau Ceti that was detected by statistical analyses of the data of the star's variations in <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a> that were obtained using <a href="HIRES">HIRES</a>, <a href="Anglo-Australian%20Planet%20Search">AAPS</a>, and <a href="High%20Accuracy%20Radial%20Velocity%20Planet%20Searcher">HARPS</a>. Its possible properties were refined in 2017: it orbits at a distance of 0.552 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> (between the orbits of <a href="Venus">Venus</a> and <a href="Mercury%20%28planet%29">Mercury</a> in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>) with an orbital period of 168 days and has a <a href="minimum%20mass">minimum mass</a> of 3.93 <a href="Earth%20mass">Earth mass</a>es. If Tau Ceti e possesses an Earth-like atmosphere, the surface temperature would be around . Based upon the incident flux upon the planet, a study by Güdel et al. (2014) speculated that the planet may lie outside the habitable zone and closer to a Venus-like world.

Tau Ceti f is a candidate <a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a> orbiting Tau Ceti that was discovered in 2012 by statistical analyses of the star's variations in <a href="radial%20velocity">radial velocity</a>, based on data obtained using <a href="HIRES">HIRES</a>, <a href="Anglo-Australian%20Planet%20Search">AAPS</a>, and <a href="High%20Accuracy%20Radial%20Velocity%20Planet%20Searcher">HARPS</a>. It is of interest because its orbit places it in Tau Ceti's extended <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>. However, a 2015 study implies that it has been in the temperate zone for less than one billion years, so there may not be a detectable <a href="biosignature">biosignature</a>.

Few properties of the planet are known other than its orbit and mass. It orbits Tau Ceti at a distance of 1.35 <a href="Astronomical%20unit">AU</a> (near <a href="Mars">Mars</a>'s orbit in the <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a>) with an orbital period of 642 days and has a <a href="minimum%20mass">minimum mass</a> of 2.66 <a href="Earth%20mass">Earth mass</a>es, which means it may be either a <a href="super-Earth">super-Earth</a> or <a href="terrestrial%20planet">terrestrial planet</a>.

In 2004, a team of UK <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a>s led by Jane Greaves discovered that Tau Ceti has more than ten times the amount of <a href="comet">comet</a>ary and <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>al material orbiting it than does the Sun. This was determined by measuring the disk of cold dust orbiting the star produced by collisions between such small bodies. This result puts a damper on the possibility of complex life in the system, because any planets would suffer from large <a href="impact%20event">impact event</a>s roughly ten times more frequently than Earth. Greaves noted at the time of her research that "it is likely that [any planets] will experience constant bombardment from asteroids of the kind believed to have wiped out the <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s". Such bombardments would inhibit the development of <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a> between impacts. However, it is possible that a large <a href="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>-sized <a href="gas%20giant">gas giant</a> could deflect comets and asteroids.

The debris disk was discovered by measuring the amount of radiation emitted by the system in the <a href="far%20infrared%20astronomy">far infrared</a> portion of the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">spectrum</a>. The disk forms a symmetric feature that is centered on the star, and its outer radius averages . The lack of infrared radiation from the warmer parts of the disk near Tau Ceti imply an inner cut-off at a radius of . By comparison, the Solar System's <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a> extends from 30 to . To be maintained over a long period of time, this ring of dust must be constantly replenished through collisions by larger bodies. The bulk of the disk appears to be orbiting Tau Ceti at a distance of 35–, well outside the orbit of the <a href="habitable%20zone">habitable zone</a>. At this distance, the dust belt may be analogous to the <a href="Kuiper%20belt">Kuiper belt</a> that lies outside the orbit of <a href="Neptune">Neptune</a> in the Solar System.

Tau Ceti shows that stars need not lose large disks as they age, and such a thick belt may not be uncommon among Sun-like stars. Tau Ceti's belt is only 1/20 as dense as the belt around its young neighbor, <a href="Epsilon%20Eridani">Epsilon Eridani</a>. The relative lack of debris around the Sun may be the unusual case: one research-team member suggests the Sun may have passed close to another star early in its history and had most of its comets and asteroids stripped away. Stars with large debris disks have changed the way astronomers think about planet formation because debris disk stars, where dust is continually generated by collisions, appear to form planets readily.

Thomas R. Marshall

Thomas Riley Marshall (March 14, 1854 – June 1, 1925) was an American politician who served as the 28th <a href="vice%20president%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president of the United States</a> from 1913 to 1921. A prominent lawyer in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, he became an active and well known member of the <a href="Indiana%20Democratic%20Party">Democratic Party</a> by <a href="Stump%20speech%20%28politics%29">stumping</a> across the state for other candidates and organizing party rallies that later helped him win election as the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Indiana">27th governor of Indiana</a>. In office, he proposed a controversial <a href="Progressive%20Era">progressive</a> change to the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Indiana">Constitution of Indiana</a>; the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> used the state courts to block the constitutional reform attempt.

Marshall's popularity as Indiana Governor, and the state's status as a critical <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a>, helped him secure the Democratic vice presidential nomination on a ticket with Wilson in 1912 and win the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201912">subsequent general election</a>. An ideological rift developed between the two men during their first term, leading Wilson to limit Marshall's influence in the administration, and his brand of humor caused Wilson to move Marshall's office away from the <a href="White%20House">White House</a>. During Marshall's second term he delivered morale-boosting speeches across the nation during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and became the first U.S. Vice President to hold cabinet meetings, which he did while Wilson was in Europe. As he was President of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senate</a>, a small number of anti-war Senators kept it deadlocked by refusing to end debate. To enable critical wartime legislation to be passed, Marshall had the body adopt its first procedural rule allowing <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a>s to be ended by a two-thirds majority vote—a variation of this rule remains in effect.

Marshall's vice presidency is most remembered for a leadership crisis following a stroke that incapacitated Wilson in October 1919. Because of their personal dislike for him, Wilson's advisers and wife <a href="Edith%20Wilson">Edith</a> sought to keep Marshall uninformed about the president's condition to prevent him from assuming presidential powers and duties. Many people, including cabinet officials and Congressional leaders, urged Marshall to become acting president, but he refused to forcibly assume Wilson's powers and duties for fear of setting a precedent. Without strong leadership in the executive branch, the administration's opponents defeated the ratification of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> treaty and effectively returned the United States to an <a href="isolationist">isolationist</a> foreign policy. Marshall is also the only known Vice President of the United States to have been exclusively targeted in an assassination attempt while in office. Marshall was the first Vice President since <a href="Daniel%20D.%20Tompkins">Daniel D. Tompkins</a>, nearly a century earlier, to serve two full terms.

Marshall was known for his wit and sense of humor; one of his most enduring jokes, which provoked widespread laughter from his colleagues, came during a Senate debate in which, in response to Senator <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Bristow">Joseph Bristow</a>'s catalog of the nation's needs, Marshall quipped the often-repeated phrase, "What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar." After his terms as vice president, he opened an <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> law practice, where he authored several legal books and his memoir, "Recollections". He continued to travel and speak publicly. Marshall died while on a trip after suffering a heart attack in 1925.

Thomas Marshall's paternal grandfather, Riley Marshall, immigrated to Indiana in 1817 and settled on a farm in present-day <a href="Whitley%20County%2C%20Indiana">Whitley County</a>. He became wealthy when a moderate deposit of oil and natural gas was discovered on his farm; when he sold the property in 1827 it earned $25,000, $ in 2015 <a href="chained%20dollars">chained dollars</a>. The money allowed him to purchase a modest estate and spend the rest of his life as an active member of the <a href="Indiana%20Democratic%20Party">Indiana Democratic Party</a>, serving as an <a href="Indiana%20State%20Senator">Indiana State Senator</a>, party chairman, and financial contributor. He was also able to send his only child, Daniel, to medical school.

Marshall's mother, Martha Patterson, was orphaned at age thirteen while living in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and moved to Indiana to live with her sister on a farm near the Marshalls' home. Martha was known for her wit and humor, as her son later would be. Martha and Daniel met and married in 1848.

Thomas Riley Marshall was born in <a href="North%20Manchester%2C%20Indiana">North Manchester</a>, <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>, on March 14, 1854. Two years later, a sister was born, but she died in infancy. Martha had contracted <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, which Daniel believed to be the cause of their infant daughter's poor health. While Marshall was still a young boy, his family moved several times in search of a good climate for Daniel to attempt different "outdoor cures" on Martha. They moved first to <a href="Quincy%2C%20Illinois">Quincy, Illinois</a> in 1857. While the family was living in Illinois, Daniel Marshall, a supporter of the American Union and a staunch Democrat, took his four-year-old son, Thomas, to the <a href="Lincoln-Douglas%20debates%20of%201858">Lincoln and Douglas debate</a> in <a href="Freeport%2C%20Illinois">Freeport</a> in 1858. Marshall later recalled that during the rally he sat on the laps of <a href="Stephen%20Douglas">Stephen Douglas</a> and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, alternating between the two candidates when they were not speaking, and remembered it as one of his earliest and most cherished memories.

The family moved to <a href="Osawatomie%2C%20Kansas">Osawatomie, Kansas</a>, in 1859, but the frontier violence caused them to move to <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> in 1860. Eventually, Daniel succeeded in curing Martha's disease. As the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> neared, violence spread into Missouri during the <a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">Bleeding Kansas</a> incidents. In October 1860 several men led by <a href="Duff%20Green">Duff Green</a> demanded that Daniel Marshall provide medical assistance to the pro-slavery faction, but he refused, and the men left. When the Marshalls' neighbors warned that Green was planning to return and murder them, the family quickly packed their belongings and escaped by steamboat to Illinois. The Marshalls remained in Illinois only briefly, before relocating to Indiana, which was even farther from the volatile border region.

On settling in <a href="Pierceton%2C%20Indiana">Pierceton, Indiana</a>, Marshall began to attend public school. His father and grandfather became embroiled in a dispute with their <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> minister when they refused to vote Republican in the 1862 election. The minister threatened to expel them from the church, to which Marshall's grandfather replied that he would "take his risk on hell, but not the Republican Party". The dispute prompted the family to move again, to <a href="Fort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana">Fort Wayne</a>, and convert to the <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> church. In Fort Wayne, Marshall attended high school, graduating in 1869. At age fifteen his parents sent him to <a href="Wabash%20College">Wabash College</a>, in <a href="Crawfordsville%2C%20Indiana">Crawfordsville</a>, where he received a classical education. His father advised him to study medicine or become a minister, but neither interested him; he entered the school without knowing which profession he would take upon graduation.

During college Marshall joined the <a href="Phi%20Gamma%20Delta">Phi Gamma Delta</a> fraternity, participated in literary and debating societies, and founded a Democratic Club. He secured a position on the staff of the college newspaper, the "Geyser", and began writing political columns defending Democratic policies. In 1872 he wrote an unfavorable column about a female lecturer at the school, accusing her of "seeking liberties" with the young boys in their boarding house. She hired lawyer <a href="Lew%20Wallace">Lew Wallace</a>, the author of "", and filed a suit demanding that Marshall pay her $20,000 for <a href="libel">libel</a>. Marshall traveled to <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> in search of a defense lawyer and employed future <a href="United%20States%20President">United States President</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, then a prominent lawyer in the area. Harrison had the suit dropped by showing that the charges made by Marshall were probably true. In Marshall's memoir, he wrote that when he approached Harrison to pay his bill, his lawyer informed him that he would not charge him for the service, but instead gave him a lecture on ethics.

Marshall was elected to <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a> during his final year at college. He graduated in June 1873, receiving the top grade in fourteen of his thirty-six courses in a class of twenty-one students. As a result of his libel case, he had become increasingly interested in law and began seeking someone to teach him. At that time, the only way to become a lawyer in Indiana was to apprentice under a member of the Indiana bar association. His great-uncle Woodson Marshall began to help him, but the younger Marshall soon moved to <a href="Columbia%20City%2C%20Indiana">Columbia City, Indiana</a>, to live with his parents. Marshall <a href="reading%20law">read law</a> in the Columbia City law office of <a href="Walter%20Olds">Walter Olds</a>, a <a href="List%20of%20Justices%20of%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20of%20Indiana">future member</a> of the <a href="Indiana%20Supreme%20Court">Indiana Supreme Court</a>, for more than a year and was admitted to the Indiana bar on April 26, 1875.

Marshall opened a law practice in Columbia City in 1876, taking on many minor cases. After gaining prominence, he accepted William F. McNagny as a partner in 1879 and began taking many criminal defense cases. The two men functioned well as partners. McNagny was better educated in law and worked out their legal arguments. Marshall, the superior orator, argued the cases before the judge and jury. Their firm became well known in the region after they handled a number of high-profile cases. In 1880 Marshall ran for public office for the first time as the Democratic candidate for his district's prosecuting attorney. The district was a Republican stronghold, and he was defeated. About the same time, he met and began to court Kate Hooper, and the two became engaged to marry. Kate died of an illness in 1882, one day before they were to be wed. Her death was a major emotional blow to Marshall, leading him to become an alcoholic.

Marshall lived with his parents into his thirties. His father died in the late 1880s and his mother died in 1894, leaving him with the family estate and business. In 1895, while working on a case, Marshall met <a href="Lois%20Irene%20Marshall">Lois Kimsey</a> who was working as a clerk in her father's law firm. Despite their nineteen-year age difference, the couple fell in love and married on October 2. The Marshalls had a close marriage and were nearly inseparable, and spent only two nights apart during their nearly thirty-year marriage.

Marshall's alcoholism had begun to interfere with his busy life prior to his marriage. He arrived at court <a href="hang%20over">hung-over</a> on several occasions and was unable to keep his addiction secret in his small hometown. His wife helped him to overcome his drinking problem and give up liquor after she locked him in their home for two weeks to undergo a treatment regimen. Thereafter, he became active in <a href="temperance%20movement%20in%20Indiana">temperance</a> organizations and delivered several speeches about the dangers of liquor. Although he had stopped drinking, his past alcoholism was later raised by opponents during his gubernatorial election campaign.

Marshall remained active in the Democratic party after his 1880 defeat and began stumping on behalf of other candidates and helping to organize party rallies across the state. His speeches were noted for their partisanship, but his rhetoric gradually shifted away from a conservative viewpoint in the 1890s as he began to identify himself with the growing <a href="progressive%20movement">progressive movement</a>. He became a member of the state Democratic Central Committee in 1904, a position that raised his popularity and influence in the party.

Marshall and his wife were involved in several private organizations. He was active in the Presbyterian Church, taught Sunday school, and served on the county fair board. As he grew wealthy from his law firm he became involved in local charities. An enthusiastic <a href="Freemasonry">Mason</a> in Columbia City Lodge No. 189 in the <a href="Grand%20Lodge%20of%20Indiana">Grand Lodge of Indiana</a>, he was a governing member of the state's <a href="York%20Rite">York Rite</a> bodies, awarded the thirty-third degree of the <a href="Scottish%20Rite">Scottish Rite</a> in 1898, and became an Active member of the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction's Supreme Council in 1911. He remained a passionate Freemason until his death and served on several Masonic charitable boards. After his death, the $25,000 cost of erecting his mausoleum in Indianapolis' Crown Hill Cemetery was gratefully paid for by the Scottish Rite NMJ Supreme Council.

In 1906, Marshall declined his party's nomination to run for Congress. He hinted, however, to state party leaders that he would be interested in running for Indiana governor in the 1908 election. He soon gained the support of several key <a href="labor%20union">labor union</a>s, and was endorsed by Louis Ludlow, a reporter for the "<a href="Indianapolis%20Star">Indianapolis Star</a>". Despite this support, Marshall was a <a href="dark%20horse%20candidate">dark horse candidate</a> at the state convention. Initially, <a href="Thomas%20Taggart">Thomas Taggart</a>, Indiana Democratic Party boss, did not support him because of Marshall's support of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition</a>. Taggart wanted the party to nominate anti-prohibitionist <a href="Samuel%20Ralston">Samuel Ralston</a>, but the prohibitionist and anti-Taggart factions united with Marshall's supporters. Taggart swung Ralston's delegates in support of Marshall to oppose L. Ert Slack, a temperance candidate, giving Marshall the votes he needed to win the nomination.

Marshall's opponent in the general election was Republican Congressman <a href="James%20E.%20Watson">James E. Watson</a>, and the campaign focused on temperance and prohibition. Just as it began, the Republican-controlled state government passed a local-option law that allowed counties to ban the sale of liquor. The law became the central point of debate between the parties and their gubernatorial candidates. The Democrats proposed that the local-option law be changed so that the decision to ban liquor sales could be made at the city and township level. This drew support from anti-prohibitionists, who saw it as an opportunity to roll back prohibition in some areas, and as the only alternative available to the total prohibition which the Republican Party advocated. The Democratic position also helped to retain prohibitionists' support by allowing prohibition to remain enacted in communities where a majority supported it. The Republican Party was in the midst of a period of instability, splitting along progressive and conservative lines. Their internal problems proved to be the deciding factor in the election, giving Marshall a narrow victory: he received 48.1 percent of the vote to Watson's 48.0 percent. He was the first Democratic governor in two decades. Democrats also came to power in the <a href="Indiana%20House%20of%20Representatives">Indiana House of Representatives</a> by a small margin, though Republicans retained control of the <a href="Indiana%20Senate">Indiana Senate</a>.

Marshall was inaugurated as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party had been out of power for many years, its initial objective was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming directly involved in the patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.

During his term, Marshall focused primarily on advancing the progressive agenda. He successfully advocated the passage of a <a href="child%20labor%20law">child labor law</a> and <a href="Political%20corruption">anti-corruption</a> legislation. He supported popular election of U.S. Senators, and the <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">constitutional amendment to allow it</a> was ratified by the <a href="Indiana%20General%20Assembly">Indiana General Assembly</a> during his term. He also overhauled the state auditing agencies and claimed to have saved the government millions of dollars. He was unsuccessful in passing the rest of the progressive platform agenda items or persuading the legislature to call a convention to rewrite the state constitution to expand the government's regulatory powers.

Marshall was a strong opponent of Indiana's recently passed <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> and <a href="Compulsory%20sterilization">sterilization laws</a>, and ordered state institutions not to follow them. He was an early, high-profile opponent of eugenics laws, and he carried his opposition into the vice-presidency. His governorship was the first in which no state executions took place, due to his opposition to <a href="capital%20punishment">capital punishment</a> and his practice of pardoning and commuting the sentences of people condemned to execution. He regularly attacked corporations and used recently created anti-trust laws to attempt to break several large businesses. He participated in a number of ceremonial events, including personally laying the final <a href="gold">gold</a>en brick to complete the <a href="Indianapolis%20Motor%20Speedway">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a> in 1909.

Rewriting the state constitution became Marshall's central focus as governor, and after the General Assembly refused to call a constitutional convention he began to seek alternative means by which to have a new constitution adopted. He and <a href="Jacob%20Piatt%20Dunn">Jacob Piatt Dunn</a>, a close friend and civic leader, wrote a new constitution that increased the state's regulatory powers considerably, set minimum wages, and gave constitutional protections to unions. Many of these reforms were also in the <a href="Socialist%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Party</a> platform under its leader, <a href="Terre%20Haute">Terre Haute</a> native <a href="Eugene%20V.%20Debs">Eugene V. Debs</a>. Republicans believed Marshall's constitution was an attempt to win over Debs' supporters, who had a strong presence in Indiana. The constitution also allowed direct-democracy <a href="initiative">initiative</a>s and <a href="referendum">referendum</a>s to be held. The Democratic controlled assembly agreed to the request and put the measure on the ballot. His opponents attacked the direct-democracy provisions, claiming they were a violation of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>, which required states to operate <a href="republic">republic</a>an forms of government. The 1910 <a href="mid-term%20election">mid-term election</a>s gave the Democrats control of the Indiana Senate, increasing the constitution's chances of being adopted. Marshall presented it to the General Assembly in 1911 and recommended that they submit it to voters in the 1912 election.

Republicans opposed the ratification process, and were infuriated that the Democrats were attempting to revise the entire constitution without calling a <a href="Constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">constitutional convention</a>, as had been called for in the state's two previous constitutions. Marshall argued that no convention was needed because the existing constitution did not call for one. Republicans took the issue to court and the Marion County Circuit Court granted an injunction removing the constitution from the 1912 ballot. Marshall appealed, but the <a href="Charles%20E.%20Cox%23Indiana%20Supreme%20Court">Indiana Supreme Court</a> upheld the decision in a judgment which stated that the <a href="Constitution%20of%20Indiana">Constitution of Indiana</a> could not be replaced in total without a constitutional convention, based on the precedent set by Indiana's first two constitutions. Marshall was angry with the decision and delivered a speech attacking the court and accusing it of overstepping its authority. He launched a final appeal to the <a href="United%20States%20Supreme%20Court">United States Supreme Court</a> but left office in January 1913 while the case was still pending. Later that year, the court declined the appeal, finding that the issue was within the sole jurisdiction of the state courts. Marshall was disappointed with the outcome. Subsequent scholars such as Linda Gugin and legal expert James St. Claire have called the process and the document "seriously flawed" and argued that had the constitution been adopted, large parts would probably have been ruled unconstitutional by the federal courts.

The Indiana constitution prevented Marshall from serving a consecutive term as governor. He made plans to run for a United States Senate seat after his term ended, but another opportunity presented itself during his last months as governor. Although he did not attend the <a href="1912%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1912 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a>, his name was put forward as Indiana's choice for president. He was suggested as a compromise nominee, but <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> and his delegates endorsed Woodrow Wilson over <a href="Champ%20Clark">Champ Clark</a>, securing the nomination for Wilson. Indiana's delegates lobbied to have Marshall named the vice presidential candidate in exchange for supporting Wilson. Indiana was an important <a href="swing%20state">swing state</a>, and Wilson hoped that Marshall's popularity would help him carry it in the general election. He had his delegates support Marshall, giving him the vice presidential nomination. Marshall privately turned down the nomination, assuming the job would be boring given its limited role. He changed his mind after Wilson assured him that he would be given plenty of responsibilities. During the campaign, Marshall traveled across the United States delivering speeches. The Wilson–Marshall ticket easily won the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201912">1912 election</a> because of the division between the Republican Party and the <a href="Progressive%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201912%29">Progressive Party</a>.

Marshall was not fond of Wilson, as he disagreed with him on a number of issues. Although Wilson invited Marshall to cabinet meetings, Marshall's ideas were rarely considered for implementation, and Marshall eventually stopped attending them regularly. In 1913 Wilson took the then unheard-of step of meeting personally with members of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">Senate</a> to discuss policy. Before this, presidents used the vice president (who serves as president of the senate) as a go-between; Wilson used the opportunity to show that he did not trust Marshall with delicate business. In his memoir, Marshall's only negative comment towards Wilson was, "I have sometimes thought that great men are the bane of civilization, they are the real cause of all the bitterness and contention which amounts to anything in the world". Their relationship was described as one of "functioning animosity".

Marshall was not offended by Wilson's lack of interest in his ideas, and considered his primary constitutional duty to be in the Senate. He viewed the vice presidential office as being in the legislative branch, not the executive. While he presided in the Senate, emotions sometimes ran high, including during a debate on the <a href="United%20States%20involvement%20in%20the%20Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican border crisis</a> in 1916. During that debate Marshall threatened to expel certain senators from the chamber for their raucous behavior, but did not carry through on the threat. On several occasions, he ordered the Senate gallery cleared. He voted eight times to <a href="List%20of%20tie-breaking%20votes%20cast%20by%20Vice%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">break tie votes</a>.

In the debates leading up to <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, a number of <a href="isolationist">isolationist</a> senators <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a>ed bills that Wilson considered important. The filibusters lasted for weeks and twice lasted for over three months. Wilson and the bills' supporters requested that Marshall put a <a href="gag-order">gag-order</a> in place to cut off debate, but he refused on ethical grounds, allowing a number of bills to be defeated in hopes that opposition would eventually end their filibuster. Among the defeated bills was one allowing merchant ships to arm themselves, and another allowing the US government to make direct arms sales to the allies. Despite their victories, the small group of senators continued to lock up the senate to prevent any pro-war legislation from passing. In response, Marshall led the Senate to adopt a new rule on March 8, 1917, allowing filibusters to be broken by two-thirds of voting Senators. This replaced the previous rule that allowed any senator to prolong debate as long as he desired. The rule has been modified several times, most prominently that the current rule requires three-fifths of "all" Senators, not only the ones voting.

As Marshall made little news and was viewed as a somewhat comic figure in Washington because of his sense of humor, a number of Democratic party leaders wanted him removed from the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201916">1916 reelection ticket</a>. Wilson, after deliberating, decided keeping Marshall on would demonstrate party unity; thus in 1916 Marshall won reelection over the still divided Republican Party and became the first vice president re-elected since <a href="John%20C.%20Calhoun">John C. Calhoun</a> in 1828, and Wilson and Marshall became the first president and vice president team to be re-elected since <a href="James%20Monroe">Monroe</a> and <a href="Daniel%20D.%20Tompkins">Tompkins</a> in 1820.

On the evening of July 2, 1915, <a href="Eric%20Muenter">Eric Muenter</a>, a onetime German professor at <a href="Harvard">Harvard</a> and <a href="Cornell">Cornell</a> universities, who opposed American support of the allied war effort, broke into the U.S. Senate and, finding the door to the Senate chamber locked, laid dynamite outside the reception room, which happened to be next to Marshall's office door. Although the bomb was set with a timer, it exploded prematurely just before midnight, while no one was in the office. (Muenter may not have been specifically targeting the vice president.).

On July 3, Muenter (who went under the pseudonym Frank Holt) burst into the <a href="Glen%20Cove%2C%20New%20York">Glen Cove, New York</a> home of <a href="J.%20P.%20Morgan%20Jr.">Jack Morgan</a>, son of financier <a href="J.P.%20Morgan">J.P. Morgan</a>, demanding that he stop the sale of weapons to the allies. Morgan told the man he was in no position to comply with his demand; Muenter shot him twice non-fatally and escaped. Muenter was later apprehended and confessed to attempted assassination of the vice president. Marshall was offered a personal security detachment after the incident, but declined it. Marshall had been receiving written death threats from numerous "cranks" for several weeks. "Some of them were signed," Marshall told the press, "but most were anonymous. I threw them all into the waste basket." Marshall added that he was "more or less a fatalist" and did not notify the Secret Service about the letters, "but that he naturally was startled when he heard of the explosion at the Capitol."

During Marshall's second term, the United States entered World War I. Marshall was a reluctant supporter of the war, believing the country to be unprepared and feared it would be necessary to enact <a href="conscription">conscription</a>. He was pleased with Wilson's strategy to begin a military buildup before the declaration of war, and fully supported the war effort once it had begun. Shortly after the first troops began to assemble for transport to Europe, Marshall and Wilson hosted a delegation from the United Kingdom in which Marshall became privy to the primary war strategy. However, he was largely excluded from war planning and rarely received official updates on the progress of military campaigns. In most instances he received news of the war through the newspapers.

Wilson sent Marshall around the nation to deliver morale-boosting speeches and encourage Americans to buy <a href="war%20bonds">Liberty Bonds</a> in support of the war effort. Marshall was well suited for the job, as he had been earning extra money as a public speaker while vice president, and gladly accepted the responsibility. In his speeches, he cast the war as a "moral crusade to preserve the dignity of the state for the rights of individuals". In his memoir, he recalled that the war seemed to drag on "with leaden feet", and that he was relieved when it finally ended. As the war neared its end, Marshall became the first vice president to conduct <a href="United%20States%20Cabinet">cabinet</a> meetings; Wilson left him with this responsibility while traveling in Europe to sign the <a href="Versailles%20treaty">Versailles treaty</a> and to work on gathering support for his <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a> idea. Wilson became the first president to personally deliver a treaty to be ratified by the Senate, which he presented to Marshall as the presiding officer during a morning session.

Marshall's wife, Lois, was heavily involved in charitable activities in Washington and spent considerable time working at the Diet Kitchen Welfare Center providing free meals to impoverished children. In 1917 she became acquainted with a mother of newborn twins, one of whom was chronically ill. The child's parents were unable to get adequate treatment for their son's condition. Lois formed a close bond with the baby, who was named Clarence Ignatius Morrison, and offered to take him and help him find treatment. She and Marshall had been unable to have children, and when she brought the baby home, Marshall told her that she could "keep him, provided he did not squall". Marshall grew to love the boy and wrote that he "never walked the streets of Washington with as sure a certainty as he walked into my heart", and, as the boy grew older, that he was "beautiful as an angel; brilliant beyond his years; lovable from every standpoint".

The Marshalls never officially adopted Morrison because they believed that to go through the procedure while his parents were still living would appear unusual to the public. Wanting to keep the situation private, they instead made a special arrangement with his parents. President Wilson felt obliged to acknowledge the boy as theirs and sent the couple a note that simply said, "With congratulations to the baby. Wilson". Morrison lived with the Marshalls for the rest of his life. In correspondence they referred to him as Morrison Marshall, but in person they called him Izzy. Lois took him to see many doctors and spent all her available time trying to nurse him back to health, but his condition worsened and he died in February 1920, just before his fourth birthday. His death devastated Marshall, who wrote in his memoir that Izzy "was and is and ever will be so sacred to me".

President Wilson experienced a mild <a href="cerebrovascular%20accident">stroke</a> in September 1919. On October 2, he was struck by a much more severe stroke that left him partially paralyzed and almost certainly incapacitated. Wilson's closest adviser, <a href="Joseph%20Tumulty">Joseph Tumulty</a>, did not believe Marshall would be a suitable acting president and took precautions to prevent him from assuming presidential powers and duties. Wilson's wife <a href="Edith%20Bolling%20Galt%20Wilson">Edith</a> strongly disliked Marshall because of what she called his "uncouthed" disposition, and also opposed his assumption of presidential powers and duties. Tumulty and the First Lady believed that an official communication from Wilson's staff on his condition would allow Marshall to trigger the constitutional mechanism allowing him to become acting president, and made sure no such communication occurred. After Marshall demanded to know Wilson's status so that he could prepare for the possibility of becoming president, they had a reporter from the "<a href="Baltimore%20Sun">Baltimore Sun</a>" brief Marshall and inform him that Wilson was near death. Marshall later said that "it was the first great shock of my life", but without an official communication on Wilson's condition, he didn't believe he could constitutionally assume presidential powers and duties.

On October 5, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Robert%20Lansing">Robert Lansing</a> was the first official to propose that Marshall forcibly assume presidential powers and duties. Other cabinet secretaries backed Lansing's request, as did Congressional leaders, including members of both the Democratic and Republican parties who sent private communications to Marshall. Marshall was cautious in accepting their offers of support. After consulting with his wife and his long-time personal adviser, Mark Thistlethwaite, he privately refused to assume Wilson's duties and become <a href="Acting%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Acting President of the United States</a>. The process for declaring a president incapacitated was unclear at that time, and he feared the precedent that might be set if he forcibly removed Wilson from his powers and duties. Marshall wanted the president to voluntarily allow his powers to devolve to the vice president, but that was impossible given his condition and unlikely given Wilson's dislike for Marshall. Marshall informed the cabinet that the only cases in which he would assume Wilson's powers and duties were a joint resolution of Congress calling on him to do so, or an official communication from Wilson or his staff asserting his inability to perform his duties.

Wilson was kept secluded by his wife and personal physician and only his close advisers were allowed to see him; none would divulge official information on his condition. Although Marshall sought to meet with Wilson to personally determine his condition, he was unable to do so, and relied on vague updates he received through a few bulletins published by Wilson's physician. Believing that Wilson and his advisers would not voluntarily transfer power to the vice president, a group of Congressional leaders initiated Marshall's requested joint resolution. However, senators that were opposed to the League of Nations treaty blocked the joint resolution in hopes to prevent the treaty's ratification. These senators believed that as acting president Marshall would make several key concessions that would allow the treaty to win ratification. Wilson, in his present condition, was either unwilling or unable to make the concessions, and debate on the bill had resulted in a deadlock.

On December 4, Lansing announced in a Senate committee hearing that no one in the cabinet had spoken with or seen Wilson in over sixty days. The senators seeking to elevate Marshall requested that a committee be sent to check on Wilson's condition, hoping to gain evidence to support their cause. Dubbed the "smelling committee" by several newspapers, the group discovered Wilson was in very poor health, but seemed to have recovered enough of his faculties to make decisions. Their report ended the perceived need for the joint resolution.

At a Sunday church service in mid-December, in what Marshall believed was an attempt by other officials to force him to assume the presidency, a courier brought a message informing him that Wilson had died. Marshall was shocked, and rose to announce the news to the congregation. The ministers held a prayer, the congregation began singing hymns, and many people wept. Marshall and his wife exited the building, and made a call to the White House to determine his next course of action, only to find that he had been the victim of a hoax, and that Wilson was still living.

Marshall performed a few ceremonial functions for the remainder of Wilson's term, such as hosting foreign dignitaries. Among these was <a href="Albert%20I%20of%20Belgium">Albert I</a>, <a href="Monarchy%20of%20Belgium">King of the Belgians</a>, the first European monarch to visit the United States. <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward, Prince of Wales</a>, the future monarch of the United Kingdom, spent two days with Marshall and received a personal tour of Washington from him. <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a> Edith Wilson performed most routine duties of government by reviewing all of Wilson's communications and deciding what he would be presented with and what she would delegate to others. The resulting lack of leadership allowed the administration's opponents to prevent ratification of the League of Nations treaty. They attacked the treaty's tenth article, which they believed would allow the United States to be bound in an alliance to European countries that could force the country return to war without an act of Congress. Marshall personally supported the treaty's adoption, but recommended several changes, including the requirement that all parties to it acknowledge the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> and the United States' sphere of influence, and that the tenth article be made non-binding.

Wilson began to recover by the end of 1919, but remained secluded for the remainder of his term, steadfast in his refusal or inability to accept changes to the treaty. Marshall was prevented from meeting with him to ascertain his true condition until his final day in office. It remains unclear who was making the executive branch's decisions during Wilson's incapacity, but it was likely the first lady with the help of the presidential advisers.

Marshall had his name entered as a candidate for the presidential nomination at the 1920 Democratic National Convention. He made arrangements with Thomas Taggart to have a delegation sent from Indiana to support his bid, but was unable to garner support outside of the Hoosier delegation. Ultimately he endorsed the Democratic nominees, <a href="James%20M.%20Cox">James M. Cox</a> for president and <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> for vice president, but they were defeated by the Republican ticket of <a href="Warren%20G.%20Harding">Warren G. Harding</a> and <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a>. On their election, Marshall sent a note to Coolidge in which he offered him his "sincere condolences" for his misfortune in being elected vice president.

Marshall considered returning to Columbia City after leaving office, but instead bought a home and opened a law practice in Indianapolis, where he believed there would be better business opportunities. Harding nominated him to serve on the Lincoln Memorial Commission in 1921, and then to a more lucrative position on the <a href="Federal%20Coal%20Commission">Federal Coal Commission</a> in 1922; Marshall resigned from both commissions in 1923. He spent over a year writing books on the law and his "Recollections", a humorous memoir. The latter book was completed in May 1925 and subsequent historians have noted it as unusual, even for its time, for not disclosing any secrets or attacking any of Marshall's enemies. Marshall remained a popular public speaker, and continued to travel to give speeches. The last he delivered was to high school students in the town of his birth.
While on a trip to Washington D.C., Marshall was struck by a <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> while reading his Bible in bed on the night of June 1, 1925. His wife called for medical assistance, but he died before it arrived. A service and viewing was held in Washington two days later and was attended by many dignitaries. Marshall's remains were returned to Indianapolis, where he lay in state for two days; thousands visited his <a href="bier">bier</a>. His funeral service was held June 9, and he was interred in <a href="Crown%20Hill%20Cemetery">Crown Hill Cemetery</a>, next to the grave of his adopted son Morrison "Izzy" Marshall. Lois Marshall moved to <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> and remained widowed the rest of her life, living on her husband's pension and the $50,000 she earned by selling his memoir to the <a href="Bobbs-Merrill">Bobbs-Merrill</a> publishing company. She died in 1958 and was interred next to her husband.

Marshall was known for his quick wit and good sense of humor. On hearing of his nomination as vice president, he announced that he was not surprised, as "Indiana is the mother of Vice Presidents; home of more second-class men than any other state". One of his favorite jokes, which he delivered in a speech on the eve of his departure for Washington, D.C., to become vice president, recounted a story of a man with two sons. One of the sons went to sea and drowned and the other was elected vice president; neither son was ever heard from again. On his election as vice president, he sent Woodrow Wilson a book, inscribed "From your only Vice".

Marshall's humor caused him trouble during his time in Washington. He was known to greet citizens walking by his office on the White House tour by saying to them, "If you look on me as a wild animal, be kind enough to throw peanuts at me." This prompted Wilson to move Marshall's office to the Senate Office building, where he would not be disturbed by visitors. In response to a proposal to the board of the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a> to send a team to excavate for ruins in <a href="Guatemala">Guatemala</a>, Marshall suggested that the team instead excavate around Washington. When asked why, he replied that, judging by the looks of the people walking on the street, they should be able to find buried cave-men no more than six feet down. The joke was not well received, and he was shut out of board meetings for nearly a year.

Marshall's wit is best remembered for a phrase he introduced to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator <a href="Joseph%20L.%20Bristow">Joseph L. Bristow</a> in which the senator provided a <a href="Bloviation">long list</a> of what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over and muttered to one of his clerks, "What this country needs is more of this; what this country needs is more of that" and quipped loudly enough for others to overhear, "What this country needs is a really good five-cent cigar." Marshall's remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times and "buckling down to thrift and work."

The situation that arose after the incapacity of Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived the national debate on the process of presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's incapacity during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a> in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, after the assassination of <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution</a> was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.

Historians have varied interpretations of Marshall's vice presidency. Claire Suddath rated Marshall as one of the worst vice presidents in American history in a 2008 "Time" magazine article. <a href="Samuel%20Eliot%20Morison">Samuel Eliot Morison</a> wrote that had Marshall carried out his constitutional duties, assumed the presidential powers and duties, and made the concessions necessary for the passage of the League of Nations treaty in late 1920, the United States would have been much more involved in European affairs and could have helped prevent the rise of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, which began in the following year. Morison and a number of other historians claim that Marshall's decision was an indirect cause of the Second World War. Charles Thomas, one of Marshall's biographers, wrote that although Marshall's assumption of presidential powers and duties would have made <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> much less likely, modern hypothetical speculation on the subject was unfair to Marshall, who made the correct decision in not forcibly removing Wilson from his duties, even temporarily.

University of Michigan

The University of Michigan (UM, U-M, U of M, or UMich), often simply referred to as Michigan, is a <a href="public%20university">public</a> <a href="research%20university">research university</a> in <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor, Michigan</a>. The university is <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>'s oldest; it was founded in 1817 in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, as the "Catholepistemiad", or University of Michigania, 20 years before the <a href="Michigan%20Territory">territory</a> became a state. The school was moved to Ann Arbor in 1837 onto of what is now known as Central Campus. Since its establishment in Ann Arbor, the university campus has expanded to include more than 584 major buildings with a combined area of more than spread out over a Central Campus and North Campus, two regional campuses in <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%E2%80%93Flint">Flint</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%E2%80%93Dearborn">Dearborn</a>, and a <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Detroit%20Center">Center</a> in Detroit. The university is a founding member of the <a href="Association%20of%20American%20Universities">Association of American Universities</a>.

Considered one of the foremost research universities in the United States with annual research expenditures approaching $1.5 billion, Michigan is classified as one of 115 "Doctoral Universities with Very High Research" by the <a href="Carnegie%20Classification%20of%20Institutions%20of%20Higher%20Education">Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education</a>. , <a href="List%20of%20University%20of%20Michigan%20alumni%23MacArthur%20Foundation%20award%20winners">50</a> <a href="MacArthur%20Fellows%20Program">MacArthur Fellows</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Nobel%20laureates%20by%20university%20affiliation">25 Nobel Prize winners</a>, <a href="List%20of%20Turing%20Award%20laureates%20by%20university%20affiliation">6 Turing Award winners</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Fields%20Medal%20winners%20by%20university%20affiliation">1 Fields Medalist</a> have been affiliated with University of Michigan. Its comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and <a href="STEM%20fields">STEM fields</a> (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as well as professional degrees in architecture, business, medicine, law, pharmacy, nursing, social work, public health, and dentistry. Michigan's body of living alumni comprises more than 540,000 people, one of the largest alumni bases of any university in the world.

Michigan's athletic teams compete in <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a> of the <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> and are collectively known as the <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines">Wolverines</a>. They are members of the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a>. More than 250 Michigan athletes or coaches have participated in Olympic events, winning more than 150 medals.

The University of Michigan was established in Detroit on August 26, 1817 as the <a href="History%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Michigan%23The%20Catholepistemiad%20%281817%E2%80%931821%29">"Catholepistemiad"</a>, or University of Michigania, by the governor and judges of <a href="Michigan%20Territory">Michigan Territory</a>. Judge <a href="Augustus%20B.%20Woodward">Augustus B. Woodward</a> specifically invited The <a href="John%20Monteith%20%28minister%29">Rev. John Monteith</a> and Father <a href="Gabriel%20Richard">Gabriel Richard</a>, a Catholic priest, to establish the institution. Monteith became its first president and held seven of the professorships, and Richard was vice president and held the other six professorships. Concurrently, Ann Arbor had set aside in the hopes of being selected as the state capital. But when <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a> was chosen as the state capital, the city offered the land for a university. What would become the university moved to <a href="Ann%20Arbor%2C%20Michigan">Ann Arbor</a> in 1837 thanks to Governor <a href="Stevens%20T.%20Mason">Stevens T. Mason</a>. The original was the basis of the present Central Campus. This land was once inhabited by the Ojibwe (Chippewa), Odawa (Ottawa), and Bodewadimi (Potawatomi) Native tribes and was obtained through the Treaty of Fort Meigs. In 1821, the university was officially renamed the University of Michigan. The first classes in Ann Arbor were held in 1841, with six freshmen and a sophomore, taught by two professors. Eleven students graduated in the first commencement in 1845.

By 1866, enrollment had increased to 1,205 students, many of whom were <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> veterans. Women were first admitted in 1870, although <a href="Alice%20Robinson%20Boise%20Wood">Alice Robinson Boise Wood</a> had become the first woman to attend classes (without matriculating) in 1866-7. <a href="James%20Burrill%20Angell">James Burrill Angell</a>, who served as the university's president from 1871 to 1909, aggressively expanded U-M's curriculum to include professional studies in <a href="dentistry">dentistry</a>, <a href="architecture">architecture</a>, <a href="engineering">engineering</a>, <a href="government">government</a>, and <a href="medicine">medicine</a>. U-M also became the first American university to use the <a href="seminar">seminar</a> method of study. Among the early students in the School of Medicine was <a href="Jose%20Celso%20Barbosa">Jose Celso Barbosa</a>, who in 1880 graduated as valedictorian and the first <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rican</a> to get a university degree in the United States. He returned to Puerto Rico to practice medicine and also served in high-ranking posts in the government.

From 1900 to 1920, the university constructed many new facilities, including buildings for the dental and pharmacy programs, chemistry, natural sciences, <a href="Hill%20Auditorium">Hill Auditorium</a>, large hospital and library complexes, and two residence halls. In 1920 the university reorganized the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20College%20of%20Engineering">College of Engineering</a> and formed an advisory committee of 100 industrialists to guide academic research initiatives. The university became a favored choice for bright Jewish students from New York in the 1920s and 1930s, when the <a href="Ivy%20League">Ivy League</a> schools had quotas restricting the number of Jews to be admitted. Because of its high standards, U-M gained the nickname "Harvard of the West." During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, U-M's research supported military efforts, such as <a href="United%20States%20Navy">U.S. Navy</a> projects in <a href="proximity%20fuze">proximity fuze</a>s, <a href="PT%20boat">PT boat</a>s, and <a href="radar%20jamming">radar jamming</a>.

After the war, enrollment expanded rapidly and by 1950, it reached 21,000, of which more than one third (or 7,700) were veterans supported by the <a href="G.I.%20Bill">G.I. Bill</a>. As the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> and the <a href="Space%20Race">Space Race</a> took hold, U-M received numerous government grants for strategic research and helped to develop peacetime uses for <a href="Nuclear%20power">nuclear energy</a>. Much of that work, as well as research into alternative energy sources, is pursued via the Memorial Phoenix Project.

In the 1960 Presidential campaign, U.S. Senator <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> jokingly referred to himself as "a graduate of the Michigan of the East, Harvard University" in his speech proposing the formation of the <a href="Peace%20Corps">Peace Corps</a> speaking to a crowd from the front steps of the <a href="Michigan%20Union">Michigan Union</a>.
<a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> gave his speech outlining his <a href="Great%20Society">Great Society</a> program as the lead speaker during U-M's 1964 spring commencement ceremony. During the 1960s, the university campus was the site of numerous protests against the Vietnam War and university administration. On March 24, 1965, a group of U-M faculty members and 3,000 students held the nation's first ever faculty-led "<a href="teach-in">teach-in</a>" to protest against American policy in Southeast Asia. In response to a series of <a href="sit-in">sit-in</a>s in 1966 by "Voice", the campus political party of <a href="Students%20for%20a%20Democratic%20Society%20%281960%20organization%29">Students for a Democratic Society</a>, U-M's administration banned sit-ins. In response, 1,500 students participated in a one-hour sit-in inside the Administration Building, now known as the LSA Building. In April 1968 following the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., a group of several dozen black students occupied the Administration Building to demand that the university make public its three-year-old commitment as a federal contractor to affirmative action and to increase its efforts with respect to recruiting more African American students, faculty and staff. At that time there were no African American coaches, for instance, in the Intercollegiate Athletics Department. The occupation was ended by agreement after seven hours.

Former U-M student and noted architect <a href="Alden%20B.%20Dow">Alden B. Dow</a> designed the current Fleming Administration Building, which was completed in 1968. The building's plans were drawn in the early 1960s, before student activism prompted a concern for safety. But the Fleming Building's fortress-like narrow windows, all located above the first floor, and lack of exterior detail at ground level, led to a campus rumor that it was designed to be riot-proof. Dow denied those rumors, claiming the small windows were designed to be energy efficient.

During the 1970s, severe budget constraints slowed the university's physical development; but in the 1980s, the university received increased grants for research in the social and physical sciences. The university's involvement in the anti-missile <a href="Strategic%20Defense%20Initiative">Strategic Defense Initiative</a> and investments in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> caused controversy on campus. During the 1980s and 1990s, the university devoted substantial resources to renovating its massive hospital complex and improving the academic facilities on the North Campus. In its 2011 annual financial report, the university announced that it had dedicated $497 million per year in each of the prior 10 years to renovate buildings and infrastructure around the campus. The university also emphasized the development of computer and information technology throughout the campus.

In the early 2000s, U-M faced declining state funding due to state budget shortfalls. At the same time, the university attempted to maintain its high academic standing while keeping <a href="tuition">tuition</a> costs affordable. There were disputes between U-M's administration and labor unions, notably with the Lecturers' Employees Organization (LEO) and the Graduate Employees Organization (GEO), the union representing graduate student employees. These conflicts led to a series of one-day walkouts by the unions and their supporters. The university is engaged in a $2.5 billion construction campaign.
In 2003, two lawsuits involving U-M's <a href="affirmative%20action%20in%20the%20United%20States">affirmative action</a> admissions policy reached the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. Supreme Court</a> ("<a href="Grutter%20v.%20Bollinger">Grutter v. Bollinger</a>" and "<a href="Gratz%20v.%20Bollinger">Gratz v. Bollinger</a>"). President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> publicly opposed the policy before the court issued a ruling. The court found that race may be considered as a factor in university admissions in all public universities and private universities that accept federal funding. But, it ruled that a point system was unconstitutional. In the first case, the court upheld the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Law%20School">Law School</a> admissions policy, while in the second it ruled against the university's undergraduate admissions policy.

The debate continued because in November 2006, Michigan voters passed <a href="Michigan%20Civil%20Rights%20Initiative">Proposal 2</a>, banning most affirmative action in university admissions. Under that law, race, gender, and national origin can no longer be considered in admissions. U-M and other organizations were granted a stay from implementation of the law soon after that referendum. This allowed time for proponents of affirmative action to decide legal and constitutional options in response to the initiative results. In April 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in "<a href="Schuette%20v.%20Coalition%20to%20Defend%20Affirmative%20Action">Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action</a>" that Proposal 2 did not violate the U.S. Constitution. The admissions office states that it will attempt to achieve a diverse student body by looking at other factors, such as whether the student attended a disadvantaged school, and the level of education of the student's parents.

On May 1, 2014, University of Michigan was named one of 55 higher education institutions under investigation by the Office of Civil Rights "for possible violations of federal law over the handling of sexual violence and harassment complaints." President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a>'s <a href="White%20House%20Task%20Force%20to%20Protect%20Students%20from%20Sexual%20Assault">White House Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault</a> was organized for such investigations.

The University of Michigan's acceptance rate is 23.5% in 2018. The rate of new freshman enrollment has been fairly stable since 2010.

The Ann Arbor campus is divided into four main areas: the North, Central, Medical, and South campuses. The physical <a href="infrastructure">infrastructure</a> includes more than 500 major buildings, with a combined area of more than 34 million square feet or . The Central and South Campus areas are contiguous, while the North Campus area is separated from them, primarily by the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a>. There is also leased space in buildings scattered throughout the city, many occupied by organizations affiliated with the University of Michigan Health System. An East Medical Campus has recently been developed on Plymouth Road, with several university-owned buildings for outpatient care, diagnostics, and outpatient surgery.

In addition to the U-M Golf Course on South Campus, the university operates a second golf course on Geddes Road called Radrick Farms Golf Course. The golf course is only open to faculty, staff and alumni. Another off-campus facility is the Inglis House, which the university has owned since the 1950s. The Inglis House is a mansion used to hold various social events, including meetings of the Board of Regents, and to host visiting dignitaries. The university also operates a large office building called Wolverine Tower in southern Ann Arbor near <a href="Briarwood%20Mall">Briarwood Mall</a>. Another major facility is the <a href="Matthaei%20Botanical%20Gardens">Matthaei Botanical Gardens</a>, which is located on the eastern outskirts of Ann Arbor.

All four campus areas are connected by bus services, the majority of which connect the North and Central campuses. There is a shuttle service connecting the University Hospital, which lies between North and Central campuses, with other medical facilities throughout northeastern Ann Arbor.

Central Campus was the original location of U-M when it moved to Ann Arbor in 1837. It originally had a school and dormitory building (where Mason Hall now stands) and several houses for professors on of land bounded by North University Avenue, South University Avenue, East University Avenue, and State Street. The President's House, located on South University Avenue, is the oldest building on campus as well as the only surviving building from the original campus. Because Ann Arbor and Central Campus developed simultaneously, there is no distinct boundary between the city and university, and some areas contain a mixture of private and university buildings. Residence halls located on Central Campus are split up into two groups: the Hill Neighborhood and Central Campus.

Central Campus is the location of the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20College%20of%20Literature%2C%20Science%2C%20and%20the%20Arts">College of Literature, Science and the Arts</a>, and is immediately adjacent to the medical campus. Most of the graduate and professional schools, including the <a href="Ross%20School%20of%20Business">Ross School of Business</a>, the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20School%20of%20Public%20Policy">Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Law%20School">Law School</a> and the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20School%20of%20Dentistry">School of Dentistry</a>, are on Central Campus. Two prominent libraries, the <a href="Hatcher%20Graduate%20Library">Harlan Hatcher Graduate Library</a> and the <a href="Shapiro%20Undergraduate%20Library">Shapiro Undergraduate Library</a> (which are connected by a <a href="skyway">skywalk</a>), are also on Central Campus. as well as <a href="Museums%20at%20the%20University%20of%20Michigan">museums</a> housing collections in <a href="archaeology">archaeology</a>, <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="paleontology">paleontology</a>, <a href="zoology">zoology</a>, <a href="dentistry">dentistry</a> and art. Ten of the buildings on Central Campus were designed by Detroit-based architect <a href="Albert%20Kahn%20%28architect%29">Albert Kahn</a> between 1904 and 1936. The most notable of the Kahn-designed buildings are the <a href="Burton%20Tower">Burton Memorial Tower</a> and nearby <a href="Hill%20Auditorium">Hill Auditorium</a>.

North Campus is the most contiguous campus, built independently from the city on a large plot of farmland—approximately —that the university bought in 1952. It is newer than Central Campus, and thus has more <a href="modern%20architecture">modern architecture</a>, whereas most Central Campus buildings are classical or gothic in style. The architect <a href="Eero%20Saarinen">Eero Saarinen</a>, based in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Michigan">Birmingham, Michigan</a>, created one of the early master plans for North Campus and designed several of its buildings in the 1950s, including the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20School%20of%20Music%2C%20Theatre%20%26amp%3B%20Dance%23Facilities">Earl V. Moore School of Music Building</a>. North and Central Campuses each have unique bell towers that reflect the predominant architectural styles of their surroundings. Each of the bell towers houses a grand <a href="carillon">carillon</a>. The North Campus tower is called <a href="Lurie%20Tower">Lurie Tower</a>. The University of Michigan's largest residence hall, <a href="Bursley%20Hall">Bursley Hall</a>, is located on North Campus.

North Campus houses the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20College%20of%20Engineering">College of Engineering</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20School%20of%20Music">School of Music, Theatre & Dance</a>, the <a href="Penny%20W.%20Stamps%20School%20of%20Art%20%26amp%3B%20Design">Stamps School of Art & Design</a>, the <a href="Taubman%20College%20of%20Architecture%20and%20Urban%20Planning">Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning</a>, and an annex of the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20School%20of%20Information">School of Information</a>. The campus is served by the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20College%20of%20Engineering%23Laboratories%20and%20facilities">Duderstadt Center</a>, which houses the Art, Architecture and Engineering Library. The Duderstadt Center also contains multiple <a href="computer%20lab">computer lab</a>s, <a href="non-linear%20editing%20system">video editing</a> studios, electronic music studios, an audio studio, a video studio, multimedia workspaces, and a <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a> <a href="virtual%20reality">virtual reality</a> room. Other libraries located on North Campus include the <a href="Gerald%20R.%20Ford%20Presidential%20Library">Gerald R.

South Campus is also the site of the Buhr library storage facility, Revelli Hall, home of the <a href="Michigan%20Marching%20Band">Michigan Marching Band</a>, the Institute for Continuing Legal Education, and the Student Theatre Arts Complex, which provides shop and rehearsal space for student theatre groups. The university's departments of public safety and transportation services offices are located on South Campus.

U-M's golf course is located south of Michigan Stadium and Crisler Arena. It was designed in the late 1920s by <a href="Alister%20MacKenzie">Alister MacKenzie</a>, the designer of <a href="Augusta%20National%20Golf%20Club">Augusta National Golf Club</a> in <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a>, home of the <a href="Masters%20Tournament">Masters Tournament</a>. The course opened to the public in the spring of 1931. The University of Michigan Golf Course was included in a listing of top holes designed by what "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" calls "golf's greatest course architect". The U-M Golf Course's signature No. 6 hole—a par 4, which plays from an elevated tee to a two-tiered, kidney-shaped green protected by four bunkers—is the second hole on the Alister MacKenzie Dream 18 as selected by a five-person panel that includes three-time Masters champion <a href="Nick%20Faldo">Nick Faldo</a> and golf course architect <a href="Tom%20Doak">Tom Doak</a>. The listing of "the best holes ever designed by Augusta National architect Alister MacKenzie" is featured in SI's Golf Plus special edition previewing the Masters on April 4, 2006.

The University of Michigan consists of a flagship campus in Ann Arbor, with two regional campuses in <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%E2%80%93Dearborn">Dearborn</a> and <a href="University%20of%20Michigan-Flint">Flint</a>. The Board of Regents, which governs the university and was established by the Organic Act of March 18, 1837, consists of eight members elected at large in biennial state elections for overlapping eight-year terms. Between the establishment of the University of Michigan in 1837 and 1850, the Board of Regents ran the university directly; although they were, by law, supposed to appoint a Chancellor to administer the university, they never did. Instead, a rotating roster of professors carried out the day-to-day administration duties.

The <a href="President%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Michigan">President of the University of Michigan</a> is the principal executive officer of the university. The office was created by the <a href="Michigan%20Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a> of 1850, which also specified that the president was to be appointed by the Regents of the University of Michigan and preside at their meetings, but without a vote. Today, the president's office is at the Ann Arbor campus, and the president has the privilege of living in the President's House, the university's oldest building, located on Central Campus in Ann Arbor. <a href="Mark%20Schlissel">Mark Schlissel</a> is the 14th and current president of the university and has served since July 2014.

There are thirteen undergraduate schools and colleges. By enrollment, the three largest undergraduate units are the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20College%20of%20Literature%2C%20Science%2C%20and%20the%20Arts">College of Literature, Science, and the Arts</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20College%20of%20Engineering">College of Engineering</a>, and the <a href="Ross%20School%20of%20Business">Ross School of Business</a>. At the graduate level, the <a href="Rackham%20Graduate%20School">Rackham Graduate School</a> serves as the central administrative unit of graduate education at the university. There are 18 graduate schools and colleges, the largest of which are the College of Literature, Science, and the Arts, the College of Engineering, the Law School, and the Ross School of Business. <a href="First%20professional%20degree">Professional degrees</a> are conferred by the Schools of Architecture, Public Health, <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20School%20of%20Dentistry">Dentistry</a>, Law, <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Medical%20School">Medicine</a>, Urban Planning and Pharmacy. The Medical School is partnered with the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Health%20System">University of Michigan Health System</a>, which comprises the university's three hospitals, dozens of outpatient clinics, and many centers for medical care, research, and education.

, U-M's <a href="financial%20endowment">financial endowment</a> (the "University Endowment Fund") was valued at $10.9 billion. The endowment is primarily used according to the donors' wishes, which include the support of teaching and research. In mid-2000, U-M embarked on a fund-raising campaign called "The Michigan Difference", which aimed to raise $2.5 billion, with $800 million designated for the permanent endowment. Slated to run through December 2008, the university announced that the campaign had reached its target 19 months early in May 2007. Ultimately, the campaign raised $3.2 billion over 8 years. Over the course of the capital campaign, 191 additional professorships were endowed, bringing the university total to 471 . Like nearly all colleges and universities, U-M suffered significant realized and unrealized losses in its endowment during the second half of 2008. In February 2009, a university spokesperson estimated losses of between 20 and 30 percent.

In November 2013, the university launched the "Victors for Michigan" campaign with a $4 billion goal. In 2017, the university announced that the campaign had met the goal 18 months ahead of schedule. In 2018, the university announced that the original $4 billion campaign had exceeded its goal by raising $5 billion from 382,000 donors.

Housed in the Michigan Union, the <a href="Student%20governments%20in%20the%20United%20States%23University%20of%20Michigan">Central Student Government</a> (CSG) is the central student government of the University. With representatives from each of the University's colleges and schools, including graduate students, CSG represents students and manages student funds on the campus. CSG is a 501(c)(3) organization, independent from the University of Michigan. In recent years CSG has organized Airbus, a transportation service between campus and the <a href="Detroit%20Metropolitan%20Wayne%20County%20Airport">Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport</a>, and has led the university's efforts to register its student population to vote, with its Voice Your Vote Commission (VYV) registering 10,000 students in 2004. VYV also works to improve access to non-partisan voting-related information and increase student voter turnout. CSG was successful at reviving <a href="Homecoming">Homecoming</a> activities, including a carnival and parade, for students after a roughly eleven-year absence in October 2007, and during the 2013-14 school year, was instrumental in persuading the University to rescind an unpopular change in student football seating policy at Michigan Stadium. In 2017, CSG successfully petitioned the Ann Arbor City Council to create a Student Advisory Council to give student input into Ann Arbor city affairs.

There are student governance bodies in each college and school, independent of Central Student Government. Undergraduate students in the LS&A are represented by the LS&A Student Government (LSA SG). Engineering Student Government (ESG) manages undergraduate student government affairs for the College of Engineering. Graduate students enrolled in the Rackham Graduate School are represented by the Rackham Student Government (RSG), and law students are represented by the Law School Student Senate (LSSS) as is each other college with its own respective government. In addition, the students who live in the residence halls are represented by the University of Michigan Residence Halls Association (RHA), which contains the third most constituents after CSG and LSA SG.

A longstanding goal of the student government is to create a student-designated seat on the Board of Regents, the university's governing body. Such a designation would achieve parity with other Big Ten schools that have student regents. In 2000, students Nick Waun and Scott Trudeau ran for the board on the statewide ballot as third-party nominees. Waun ran for a second time in 2002, along with Matt Petering and Susan Fawcett. Although none of these campaigns has been successful, a poll conducted by the State of Michigan in 1998 concluded that a majority of Michigan voters would approve of such a position if the measure were put before them. A change to the board's makeup would require amending the <a href="Michigan%20Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a>.

The University of Michigan is a large, four-year, residential research university accredited by the <a href="Higher%20Learning%20Commission">Higher Learning Commission</a>. The four-year, full-time undergraduate program comprises the majority of enrollments and emphasizes instruction in the arts, sciences, and professions with a high level of coexistence between graduate and undergraduate programs. The university has "very high" research activity and the comprehensive graduate program offers doctoral degrees in the humanities, social sciences, and <a href="STEM%20fields">STEM fields</a> as well as professional degrees in medicine, law, and dentistry. U-M has been included on <a href="Richard%20Moll%20%28author%29">Richard Moll</a>'s list of <a href="Public%20Ivies">Public Ivies</a>. With over 200 undergraduate majors, and 100 doctoral and 90 master's programs, U-M has conferred 6,490 undergraduate degrees, 4,951 graduate degrees, and 709 first professional degrees in 2011-2012.

National honor societies such as <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>, <a href="Phi%20Kappa%20Phi">Phi Kappa Phi</a>, and <a href="Tau%20Beta%20Pi">Tau Beta Pi</a> have chapters at U-M. Degrees "with Highest Distinction" are recommended to students who rank in the top 3% of their class, "with High Distinction" to the next 7%, and "with Distinction" to the next 15%. Students earning a minimum overall GPA of 3.4 who have demonstrated high academic achievement and capacity for independent work may be recommended for a degree "with Highest Honors," "with High Honors," or "with Honors." Those students who earn all A's for two or more consecutive terms in a calendar year are recognized as <a href="James%20B.%20Angell">James B. Angell</a> Scholars and are invited to attend the annual Honors Convocation, an event which recognizes undergraduate students with distinguished academic achievements.

Out-of-state undergraduate students pay between $36,001.38 and $43,063.38 annually for tuition while in-state undergraduate students pay between $11,837.38 and $16,363.38 annually. U-M provides financial aid in the form of need-based loans, grants, scholarships, work study, and non-need based scholarships, with 77% of undergraduates in 2007 receiving financial aid. For undergraduates in 2008, 46% graduated averaging approximately $25,586 of debt. The university is attempting to increase financial aid availability to students by devoting over $1.53 billion in endowment funds to support financial aid.

Michigan is one of the founding members (1900) of the <a href="Association%20of%20American%20Universities">Association of American Universities</a>. With over 6,200 faculty members, 73 of whom are members of the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Academies">National Academy</a> and 471 of whom hold an endowed chair in their discipline, the university manages one of the largest annual collegiate research budgets of any university in the United States, totaling about $1 billion in 2009. The Medical School spent the most at over $445 million, while the <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20College%20of%20Engineering">College of Engineering</a> was second at more than $160 million. U-M also has a <a href="technology%20transfer">technology transfer</a> office, which is the university conduit between laboratory research and corporate commercialization interests. In 2009, the university consummated a deal to purchase a facility formerly owned by <a href="Pfizer">Pfizer</a>. The acquisition includes over of property, and 30 major buildings comprising roughly of wet laboratory space, and of administrative space. As of the purchase date, the university's intentions for the space were not announced, but the expectation is that the new space will allow the university to ramp up its research and ultimately employ in excess of 2,000 people.
The university is also a major contributor to the medical field with the <a href="Electrocardiogram">EKG</a>, <a href="gastroscope">gastroscope</a>, and the announcement of <a href="Jonas%20Salk">Jonas Salk</a>'s polio vaccine.

The <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Library">U-M library system</a> comprises nineteen individual libraries with twenty-four separate collections—roughly 13.3 million volumes. U-M was the original home of the <a href="JSTOR">JSTOR</a> database, which contains about 750,000 digitized pages from the entire pre-1990 backfile of ten journals of history and economics, and has initiated a book digitization program in collaboration with <a href="Google">Google</a>. The <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20Press">University of Michigan Press</a> is also a part of the U-M library system.

In the late 1960s U-M, together with <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a> and <a href="Wayne%20State%20University">Wayne State University</a>, founded the <a href="Merit%20Network">Merit Network</a>, one of the first university computer networks. The Merit Network was then and remains today administratively hosted by U-M. Another major contribution took place in 1987 when a proposal submitted by the Merit Network together with its partners <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="MCI%20Communications">MCI</a>, and the <a href="State%20of%20Michigan">State of Michigan</a> won a national competition to upgrade and expand the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation%20Network">National Science Foundation Network</a> (NSFNET) backbone from 56,000 to 1.5 million, and later to 45 million bits per second. In 2006, U-M joined with <a href="Michigan%20State%20University">Michigan State University</a> and <a href="Wayne%20State%20University">Wayne State University</a> to create the <a href="University%20Research%20Corridor">University Research Corridor</a>. This effort was undertaken to highlight the capabilities of the state's three leading research institutions and drive the transformation of Michigan's economy. The three universities are electronically interconnected via the Michigan LambdaRail (MiLR, pronounced 'MY-lar'), a high-speed data network providing 10 Gbit/s connections between the three university campuses and other national and international network connection points in Chicago.

The University of Michigan is a participant in the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Academic%20Alliance">Big Ten Academic Alliance</a>. The Big Ten Academic Alliance (BTAA) is the academic consortium of the universities in the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a>. Engaging in $10 billion in research in 2014-2015, BTAA universities provide powerful insight into important issues in medicine, technology, agriculture, and communities. Students at participating schools are also allowed "in-house" borrowing privileges at other schools' libraries. The BTAA uses collective purchasing and licensing, and has saved member institutions $19 million to date. Course sharing, <a href="professional%20development">professional development</a> programs, <a href="study%20abroad">study abroad</a> and international collaborations, and other initiatives are also part of the BTAA.

U-M has finished in the top 10 of the Directors' Cup standings in 14 of the award's 16 seasons and has placed in the top six in nine of the last 10 seasons.

The <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20football">Michigan football</a> program ranks first in NCAA history in total wins (925 through the end of the 2015 season) and first among FBS schools in winning percentage (.731). The team won the first <a href="Rose%20Bowl%20Game">Rose Bowl</a> game in <a href="1902%20Rose%20Bowl">1902</a>. U-M had 40 consecutive winning seasons from 1968 to 2007, including consecutive <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> appearances from 1975 to 2007. The Wolverines have won a record 42 Big Ten championships. The program has 11 <a href="College%20football%20national%20championships%20in%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20FBS">national championships</a>, most recently in 1997, and has produced three <a href="Heisman%20Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> winners: <a href="Tom%20Harmon">Tom Harmon</a>, <a href="Desmond%20Howard">Desmond Howard</a> and <a href="Charles%20Woodson">Charles Woodson</a>.

<a href="Michigan%20Stadium">Michigan Stadium</a> is the largest college football stadium in the nation and one of the largest football-only stadiums in the world, with an official capacity of 107,601 (the extra seat is said to be "reserved" for <a href="Fritz%20Crisler">Fritz Crisler</a>) though attendance—frequently over 111,000 spectators—regularly exceeds the official capacity.

The men's basketball program became involved in a <a href="University%20of%20Michigan%20basketball%20scandal">scandal involving payments from a booster</a> during the 1990s. This led to the program being placed on probation for a four-year period. The program also voluntarily vacated victories from its 1992–1993 and 1995–1999 seasons in which the payments took place, as well as its 1992 and 1993 Final Four appearances.

The <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball">men's basketball team</a> has most recently won back-to-back Big Ten Tournament Championships, against <a href="Wisconsin%20Badgers%20men%27s%20basketball">Wisconsin</a> in 2017 and <a href="Purdue%20Boilermakers%20men%27s%20basketball">Purdue</a> in 2018.

Through the <a href="2008%20Summer%20Olympic%20Games">2008 Summer Olympic Games</a>, 178 U-M students and coaches had participated in the Olympics, winning medals in every <a href="Summer%20Olympic%20Games">Summer Olympics</a> except 1896, and winning gold medals in all but four Olympiads. U-M students have won a total of <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%23Olympians">151 Olympic medals</a>: 72 gold, 39 silver, and 40 bronze.
U-M is also home to a variety of Club Sports, including <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20rugby">men's rugby</a>, men's volleyball, and boxing.

The University of Michigan's <a href="fight%20song">fight song</a>, "<a href="The%20Victors">The Victors</a>," was written by student <a href="Louis%20Elbel">Louis Elbel</a> in 1898 following the last-minute football victory over the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a> that won a league championship. The song was declared by <a href="John%20Philip%20Sousa">John Philip Sousa</a> as "the greatest college fight song ever written." The song refers to the university as being "the Champions of the West." At the time, U-M was part of the Western Conference, which would later become the <a href="Big%20Ten%20Conference">Big Ten Conference</a>. Michigan was considered to be on the Western Frontier when it was founded in the old <a href="Northwest%20Territory">Northwest Territory</a>.

Although mainly used at sporting events, the Michigan fight song is often heard at other events as well. President <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> had it played by the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Band">United States Marine Band</a> as his entrance anthem during his term as president from 1974 to 1977, in preference over the more traditional "<a href="Hail%20to%20the%20Chief">Hail to the Chief</a>", and the <a href="Michigan%20Marching%20Band">Michigan Marching Band</a> performed a slow-tempo variation of the fight song at his funeral. The fight song is also sung during graduation commencement ceremonies. The university's <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a> song is "<a href="The%20Yellow%20and%20Blue">The Yellow and Blue</a>." A common rally cry is "Let's Go Blue!" which had a complementary short musical arrangement written by former students Joseph Carl, a sousaphonist, and Albert Ahronheim, a <a href="drum%20major">drum major</a>.

Before "The Victors" was officially the University's fight song, the song "<a href="There%27ll%20Be%20a%20Hot%20Time%20in%20the%20Old%20Town%20Tonight">There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight</a>" was considered to be the school song. After Michigan temporarily withdrew from the Western Conference in 1907, a new Michigan fight song "<a href="Varsity%20%28fight%20song%29">Varsity</a>" was written in 1911 because the line "champions of the West" was no longer appropriate.

In addition to the late <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. president</a> <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a>, the university has produced twenty-six <a href="Rhodes%20Scholarship">Rhodes Scholars</a>. , the university has almost 500,000 living alumni.

Uranium

Uranium is a <a href="chemical%20element">chemical element</a> with symbol U and <a href="atomic%20number">atomic number</a> 92. It is a silvery-grey <a href="metal">metal</a> in the <a href="actinide">actinide</a> series of the <a href="periodic%20table">periodic table</a>. A uranium atom has 92 <a href="proton">proton</a>s and 92 <a href="electron">electron</a>s, of which 6 are <a href="valence%20electron">valence electron</a>s. Uranium is weakly <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a> because all <a href="isotopes%20of%20uranium">isotopes of uranium</a> are unstable, with <a href="half-lives">half-lives</a> varying between 159,200 years and 4.5 billion years. The most common isotopes in <a href="natural%20uranium">natural uranium</a> are <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> (which has 146 <a href="neutron">neutron</a>s and accounts for over 99%) and <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> (which has 143 neutrons). Uranium has the highest <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a> of the <a href="primordial%20nuclide">primordially</a> occurring elements. Its <a href="density">density</a> is about 70% higher than that of <a href="lead">lead</a>, and slightly lower than that of <a href="gold">gold</a> or <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a>. It occurs naturally in low concentrations of a few <a href="Parts-per%20notation%23Parts-per%20expressions">parts per million</a> in soil, rock and water, and is commercially <a href="uranium%20mining">extracted</a> from uranium-bearing <a href="mineral">mineral</a>s such as <a href="uraninite">uraninite</a>.

In nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752%), uranium-235 (0.7198–0.7202%), and a very small amount of <a href="uranium-234">uranium-234</a> (0.0050–0.0059%). Uranium decays slowly by emitting an <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>. The half-life of uranium-238 is about 4.47 <a href="1000000000%20%28number%29">billion</a> years and that of uranium-235 is 704 <a href="million">million</a> years, making them useful in dating the <a href="age%20of%20the%20Earth">age of the Earth</a>.

Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclear</a> properties. Uranium-235 is the only naturally occurring <a href="fissile">fissile</a> <a href="isotope">isotope</a>, which makes it widely used in <a href="nuclear%20power%20plant">nuclear power plant</a>s and <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s. However, because of the tiny amounts found in nature, uranium needs to undergo <a href="uranium%20enrichment">enrichment</a> so that enough uranium-235 is present. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is <a href="fertile%20material">fertile</a>, meaning it can be <a href="Nuclear%20transmutation">transmuted</a> to fissile <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> in a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>. Another fissile isotope, <a href="uranium-233">uranium-233</a>, can be produced from natural <a href="thorium">thorium</a> and is also important in nuclear technology. Uranium-238 has a small probability for <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a> or even induced fission with fast neutrons; uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. <a href="Depleted%20uranium">Depleted uranium</a> (U) is used in <a href="kinetic%20energy%20penetrator">kinetic energy penetrator</a>s and <a href="vehicle%20armour">armor plating</a>. Uranium is used as a colorant in <a href="uranium%20glass">uranium glass</a>, producing lemon yellow to green colors. Uranium glass fluoresces green in ultraviolet light. It was also used for tinting and shading in early <a href="photography">photography</a>.

The 1789 <a href="discovery%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">discovery</a> of uranium in the mineral <a href="uraninite">pitchblende</a> is credited to <a href="Martin%20Heinrich%20Klaproth">Martin Heinrich Klaproth</a>, who named the new element after the recently discovered planet <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a>. <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne-Melchior%20P%C3%A9ligot">Eugène-Melchior Péligot</a> was the first person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by <a href="Henri%20Becquerel">Henri Becquerel</a>. Research by <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a>, <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a>, <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> and others, such as <a href="J.%20Robert%20Oppenheimer">J. Robert Oppenheimer</a> starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in the nuclear power industry and in "<a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>", the <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">first nuclear weapon used in war</a>. An ensuing <a href="arms%20race">arms race</a> during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> between the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the <a href="Collapse%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29%23Dissolution%20of%20the%20USSR">breakup of the Soviet Union</a> in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety. See <a href="Nuclear%20proliferation">Nuclear proliferation</a>.

When <a href="refining%20%28metallurgy%29">refined</a>, uranium is a silvery white, weakly radioactive <a href="metal">metal</a>. It has a <a href="Hardnesses%20of%20the%20elements%20%28data%20page%29">Mohs hardness</a> of 6, sufficient to scratch glass and approximately equal to that of <a href="titanium">titanium</a>, <a href="rhodium">rhodium</a>, <a href="manganese">manganese</a> and <a href="niobium">niobium</a>. It is <a href="malleability">malleable</a>, <a href="ductility">ductile</a>, slightly <a href="paramagnetism">paramagnetic</a>, strongly <a href="electronegativity">electropositive</a> and a poor <a href="electrical%20conductivity">electrical conductor</a>. Uranium metal has a very high <a href="density">density</a> of 19.1 g/cm, denser than <a href="lead">lead</a> (11.3 g/cm), but slightly less dense than <a href="tungsten">tungsten</a> and <a href="gold">gold</a> (19.3 g/cm).

Uranium metal reacts with almost all non-metal elements (with the exception of the <a href="noble%20gas">noble gas</a>es) and their <a href="chemical%20compound">compounds</a>, with reactivity increasing with temperature. <a href="Hydrochloric%20acid">Hydrochloric</a> and <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a>s dissolve uranium, but non-oxidizing acids other than hydrochloric acid attack the element very slowly. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; in air, uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of <a href="uranium%20oxide">uranium oxide</a>. Uranium in ores is extracted chemically and converted into <a href="uranium%20dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> or other chemical forms usable in industry.

Uranium-235 was the first isotope that was found to be <a href="fissile">fissile</a>. Other naturally occurring isotopes are fissionable, but not fissile. On bombardment with slow neutrons, its uranium-235 <a href="isotope">isotope</a> will most of the time divide into two smaller <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a>, releasing nuclear <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> and more neutrons. If too many of these neutrons are absorbed by other uranium-235 nuclei, a <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a> occurs that results in a burst of heat or (in special circumstances) an explosion. In a nuclear reactor, such a chain reaction is slowed and controlled by a <a href="neutron%20poison">neutron poison</a>, absorbing some of the free neutrons. Such neutron absorbent materials are often part of reactor <a href="control%20rod">control rod</a>s (see <a href="nuclear%20reactor%20physics">nuclear reactor physics</a> for a description of this process of reactor control).

As little as 15 lb (7 kg) of uranium-235 can be used to make an atomic bomb. The first nuclear bomb used in war, "<a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>", relied on uranium fission, but the very first nuclear explosive (the "Gadget" used at <a href="Trinity%20%28nuclear%20test%29">Trinity</a>) and the bomb that destroyed Nagasaki ("<a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>") were both plutonium bombs.

Uranium metal has three <a href="allotropy">allotropic</a> forms:

The major application of uranium in the military sector is in high-density penetrators. This ammunition consists of <a href="depleted%20uranium">depleted uranium</a> (DU) alloyed with 1–2% other elements, such as <a href="titanium">titanium</a> or <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>. At high impact speed, the density, hardness, and <a href="pyrophoricity">pyrophoricity</a> of the projectile enable the destruction of heavily armored targets. Tank armor and other removable <a href="vehicle%20armor">vehicle armor</a> can also be hardened with depleted uranium plates. The use of depleted uranium became politically and environmentally contentious after the use of such munitions by the US, UK and other countries during wars in the Persian Gulf and the Balkans raised questions concerning uranium compounds left in the soil (see <a href="Gulf%20War%20Syndrome">Gulf War Syndrome</a>).

Depleted uranium is also used as a shielding material in some containers used to store and transport radioactive materials. While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than <a href="lead">lead</a> in halting radiation from strong sources such as <a href="radium">radium</a>. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile <a href="atmospheric%20reentry">re-entry vehicles</a> and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in <a href="inertial%20guidance%20system">inertial guidance system</a>s and in <a href="gyroscope">gyroscopic</a> <a href="compass">compass</a>es. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast as well as its relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by <a href="uranium%20oxide">uranium oxide</a> rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak <a href="alpha%20decay">alpha emitter</a>).

During the later stages of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the entire <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, and to a lesser extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a> derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (<a href="thermonuclear%20weapon">thermonuclear weapon</a>) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of <a href="tritium">tritium</a> and <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> to undergo <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by <a href="fast%20neutron">fast neutron</a>s from the nuclear fusion process.

The main use of uranium in the civilian sector is to fuel <a href="nuclear%20power%20plant">nuclear power plant</a>s. One kilogram of uranium-235 can theoretically produce about <a href="orders%20of%20magnitude%20%28energy%29">20 terajoules</a> of energy (2 <a href="joule">joule</a>s), assuming complete fission; as much <a href="energy">energy</a> as 1500 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s of <a href="coal">coal</a>.

Commercial <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a> plants use fuel that is typically enriched to around 3% uranium-235. The <a href="CANDU%20reactor">CANDU</a> and <a href="Magnox">Magnox</a> designs are the only commercial reactors capable of using unenriched uranium fuel. Fuel used for <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> reactors is typically highly enriched in <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> (the exact values are <a href="classified%20information">classified</a>). In a <a href="breeder%20reactor">breeder reactor</a>, uranium-238 can also be converted into <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a> through the following reaction:

Before (and, occasionally, after) the discovery of radioactivity, uranium was primarily used in small amounts for yellow glass and pottery glazes, such as <a href="uranium%20glass">uranium glass</a> and in <a href="Fiesta%20%28dinnerware%29">Fiestaware</a>.

The discovery and isolation of <a href="radium">radium</a> in uranium ore (pitchblende) by <a href="Marie%20Curie">Marie Curie</a> sparked the development of uranium mining to extract the radium, which was used to make glow-in-the-dark paints for clock and aircraft dials. This left a prodigious quantity of uranium as a waste product, since it takes three tonnes of uranium to extract one <a href="gram">gram</a> of radium. This waste product was diverted to the glazing industry, making uranium glazes very inexpensive and abundant. Besides the pottery glazes, <a href="uranium%20tile">uranium tile</a> glazes accounted for the bulk of the use, including common bathroom and kitchen tiles which can be produced in green, yellow, <a href="mauve">mauve</a>, black, blue, red and other colors.
Uranium was also used in <a href="photography">photographic</a> chemicals (especially <a href="uranium%20nitrate">uranium nitrate</a> as a <a href="toner">toner</a>), in lamp filaments for <a href="stage%20lighting">stage lighting</a> bulbs, to improve the appearance of <a href="dentures">dentures</a>, and in the leather and wood industries for stains and dyes. Uranium salts are <a href="mordant">mordant</a>s of silk or wool. Uranyl acetate and uranyl formate are used as electron-dense "stains" in <a href="transmission%20electron%20microscopy">transmission electron microscopy</a>, to increase the contrast of biological specimens in ultrathin sections and in <a href="negative%20staining">negative staining</a> of <a href="virus">virus</a>es, isolated <a href="cell%20organelle">cell organelle</a>s and <a href="macromolecule">macromolecule</a>s.

The discovery of the radioactivity of uranium ushered in additional scientific and practical uses of the element. The long <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of the isotope uranium-238 (4.51 years) makes it well-suited for use in estimating the age of the earliest <a href="igneous%20rock">igneous rock</a>s and for other types of <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a>, including <a href="uranium%E2%80%93thorium%20dating">uranium–thorium dating</a>, <a href="uranium%E2%80%93lead%20dating">uranium–lead dating</a> and <a href="uranium%E2%80%93uranium%20dating">uranium–uranium dating</a>. Uranium metal is used for <a href="X-ray">X-ray</a> targets in the making of high-energy X-rays.

The use of uranium in its natural <a href="oxide">oxide</a> form dates back to at least the year 79 <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a>, when it was used to add a yellow color to <a href="ceramic">ceramic</a> glazes. Yellow glass with 1% uranium oxide was found in a <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> villa on Cape <a href="Posillipo">Posillipo</a> in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Naples">Bay of Naples</a>, Italy, by R. T. Gunther of the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a> in 1912. Starting in the late <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, pitchblende was extracted from the <a href="Habsburg">Habsburg</a> silver mines in <a href="J%C3%A1chymov">Joachimsthal</a>, <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a> (now Jáchymov in the Czech Republic), and was used as a coloring agent in the local <a href="glass">glass</a>making industry. In the early 19th century, the world's only known sources of uranium ore were these mines.

The <a href="discovery%20of%20the%20chemical%20elements">discovery</a> of the element is credited to the German chemist <a href="Martin%20Heinrich%20Klaproth">Martin Heinrich Klaproth</a>. While he was working in his experimental laboratory in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> in 1789, Klaproth was able to precipitate a yellow compound (likely <a href="sodium%20diuranate">sodium diuranate</a>) by dissolving <a href="pitchblende">pitchblende</a> in <a href="nitric%20acid">nitric acid</a> and neutralizing the solution with <a href="sodium%20hydroxide">sodium hydroxide</a>. Klaproth assumed the yellow substance was the oxide of a yet-undiscovered element and heated it with <a href="charcoal">charcoal</a> to obtain a black powder, which he thought was the newly discovered metal itself (in fact, that powder was an oxide of uranium). He named the newly discovered element after the planet <a href="Uranus">Uranus</a> (named after the primordial <a href="Uranus%20%28mythology%29">Greek god of the sky</a>), which had been discovered eight years earlier by <a href="William%20Herschel">William Herschel</a>.

In 1841, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne-Melchior%20P%C3%A9ligot">Eugène-Melchior Péligot</a>, Professor of Analytical Chemistry at the <a href="Conservatoire%20National%20des%20Arts%20et%20M%C3%A9tiers">Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers</a> (Central School of Arts and Manufactures) in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, isolated the first sample of uranium metal by heating <a href="uranium%20tetrachloride">uranium tetrachloride</a> with <a href="potassium">potassium</a>.

<a href="Henri%20Becquerel">Henri Becquerel</a> discovered <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactivity</a> by using uranium in 1896. Becquerel made the discovery in Paris by leaving a sample of a uranium salt, KUO(SO) (potassium uranyl sulfate), on top of an unexposed <a href="photographic%20plate">photographic plate</a> in a drawer and noting that the plate had become "fogged". He determined that a form of invisible light or rays emitted by uranium had exposed the plate.

A team led by <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of <a href="beta%20decay">beta rays</a> (<a href="electron">electron</a>s or <a href="positron">positron</a>s from the elements produced; see <a href="beta%20particle">beta particle</a>). The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements with atomic numbers 93 and 94, which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome, Orso Mario Corbino, christened "<a href="ausonium">ausonium</a>" and "<a href="hesperium">hesperium</a>", respectively. The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium's ability to fission (break apart) into lighter elements and release <a href="binding%20energy">binding energy</a> were conducted by <a href="Otto%20Hahn">Otto Hahn</a> and <a href="Fritz%20Strassmann">Fritz Strassmann</a> in Hahn's laboratory in Berlin. <a href="Lise%20Meitner">Lise Meitner</a> and her nephew, the physicist <a href="Otto%20Robert%20Frisch">Otto Robert Frisch</a>, published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process "<a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a>". Soon after, Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction. Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235. Fermi urged <a href="Alfred%20O.%20C.%20Nier">Alfred O. C. Nier</a> to separate uranium isotopes for determination of the fissile component, and on February 29, 1940, Nier used an instrument he built at the University of Minnesota to separate the world's first <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> sample in the Tate Laboratory. After mailed to <a href="Pupin%20Hall">Columbia University</a>'s <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a>, <a href="John%20R.%20Dunning">John Dunning</a> confirmed the sample to be the isolated fissile material on March 1. Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be <a href="Nuclear%20transmutation">transmuted</a> into plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissile by thermal neutrons. These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and <a href="nuclear%20power">nuclear power</a>.

On 2 December 1942, as part of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, another team led by Enrico Fermi was able to initiate the first artificial self-sustained <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>, <a href="Chicago%20Pile-1">Chicago Pile-1</a>. An initial plan using enriched uranium-235 was abandoned as it was as yet unavailable in sufficient quantities. Working in a lab below the stands of <a href="Stagg%20Field">Stagg Field</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>, the team created the conditions needed for such a reaction by piling together 400 <a href="short%20tons">short tons</a> (360 <a href="metric%20tons">metric tons</a>) of <a href="graphite">graphite</a>, 58 short tons (53 metric tons) of <a href="uranium%20oxide">uranium oxide</a>, and six short tons (5.5 metric tons) of uranium metal, a majority of which was supplied by <a href="Westinghouse%20Lamp%20Plant">Westinghouse Lamp Plant</a> in a makeshift production process.

Two major types of atomic bombs were developed by the United States during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>: a uranium-based device (codenamed "<a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a>") whose fissile material was highly <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a>, and a plutonium-based device (see <a href="Trinity%20test">Trinity test</a> and "<a href="Fat%20Man">Fat Man</a>") whose plutonium was derived from uranium-238. The uranium-based Little Boy device became the first nuclear weapon used in war when it was detonated over the <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese city of <a href="Hiroshima">Hiroshima</a> on 6 August 1945. Exploding with a yield equivalent to 12,500 tonnes of <a href="Trinitrotoluene">TNT</a>, the blast and thermal wave of the bomb destroyed nearly 50,000 buildings and killed approximately 75,000 people (see <a href="Atomic%20bombings%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>). Initially it was believed that uranium was relatively rare, and that <a href="nuclear%20proliferation">nuclear proliferation</a> could be avoided by simply buying up all known uranium stocks, but within a decade large deposits of it were discovered in many places around the world.

The <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> at <a href="Oak%20Ridge%20National%20Laboratory">Oak Ridge National Laboratory</a> (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, formerly known as the Clinton Pile and X-10 Pile, was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor (after Enrico Fermi's Chicago Pile) and was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation. <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a>'s <a href="Experimental%20Breeder%20Reactor%20I">Experimental Breeder Reactor I</a>, located at the Atomic Energy Commission's National Reactor Testing Station near <a href="Arco%2C%20Idaho">Arco, Idaho</a>, became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 December 1951. Initially, four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor, but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility (later, the town of Arco became the first in the world to have all its <a href="electricity">electricity</a> come from nuclear power generated by <a href="BORAX-III">BORAX-III</a>, another reactor designed and operated by <a href="Argonne%20National%20Laboratory">Argonne National Laboratory</a>). The world's first commercial scale nuclear power station, <a href="Obninsk%20Nuclear%20Power%20Plant">Obninsk</a> in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>, began generation with its reactor AM-1 on 27 June 1954. Other early nuclear power plants were <a href="Sellafield">Calder Hall</a> in <a href="England">England</a>, which began generation on 17 October 1956, and the <a href="Shippingport%20Atomic%20Power%20Station">Shippingport Atomic Power Station</a> in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, which began on 26 May 1958. Nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a <a href="submarine">submarine</a>, the <a href="USS%20Nautilus%20%28SSN-571%29">USS "Nautilus"</a>, in 1954.

In 1972, the French physicist <a href="Francis%20Perrin">Francis Perrin</a> discovered fifteen ancient and no longer active natural nuclear fission reactors in three separate ore deposits at the <a href="Oklo">Oklo</a> mine in <a href="Gabon">Gabon</a>, <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a>, collectively known as the <a href="Natural%20nuclear%20fission%20reactor">Oklo Fossil Reactors</a>. The ore deposit is 1.7 billion years old; then, uranium-235 constituted about 3% of the total uranium on Earth. This is high enough to permit a sustained nuclear fission chain reaction to occur, provided other supporting conditions exist. The capacity of the surrounding sediment to contain the <a href="nuclear%20waste">nuclear waste</a> products has been cited by the U.S. federal government as supporting evidence for the feasibility to store spent nuclear fuel at the <a href="Yucca%20Mountain%20nuclear%20waste%20repository">Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository</a>.

Above-ground <a href="nuclear%20testing">nuclear tests</a> by the Soviet Union and the United States in the 1950s and early 1960s and by <a href="France">France</a> into the 1970s and 1980s spread a significant amount of <a href="nuclear%20fallout">fallout</a> from uranium <a href="daughter%20isotope">daughter isotope</a>s around the world. Additional fallout and pollution occurred from several <a href="nuclear%20and%20radiation%20accidents">nuclear accidents</a>.

Uranium miners have a higher incidence of <a href="cancer">cancer</a>. An excess risk of lung cancer among <a href="Navajo%20people">Navajo</a> uranium miners, for example, has been documented and linked to their occupation. The <a href="Radiation%20Exposure%20Compensation%20Act">Radiation Exposure Compensation Act</a>, a 1990 law in the US, required $100,000 in "compassion payments" to uranium miners diagnosed with cancer or other respiratory ailments.

During the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> between the Soviet Union and the United States, huge stockpiles of uranium were amassed and tens of thousands of nuclear weapons were created using enriched uranium and plutonium made from uranium. Since the <a href="Collapse%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985%E2%80%931991%29%23Dissolution%20of%20the%20USSR">break-up of the Soviet Union</a> in 1991, an estimated 600 short tons (540 metric tons) of highly enriched weapons grade uranium (enough to make 40,000 nuclear warheads) have been stored in often inadequately guarded facilities in the <a href="Russia">Russian Federation</a> and several other former Soviet states. Police in <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, and <a href="South%20America">South America</a> on at least 16 occasions from 1993 to 2005 have <a href="nuclear%20espionage">intercepted shipments</a> of smuggled bomb-grade uranium or plutonium, most of which was from ex-Soviet sources. From 1993 to 2005 the Material Protection, Control, and Accounting Program, operated by the <a href="federal%20government%20of%20the%20United%20States">federal government of the United States</a>, spent approximately <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US $</a>550 million to help safeguard uranium and plutonium stockpiles in Russia. This money was used for improvements and security enhancements at research and storage facilities. "Scientific American" reported in February 2006 that in some of the facilities security consisted of chain link fences which were in severe states of disrepair. According to an interview from the article, one facility had been storing samples of enriched (weapons grade) uranium in a broom closet before the improvement project; another had been keeping track of its stock of nuclear warheads using index cards kept in a shoe box.

Along with all elements having <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a>s higher than that of <a href="iron">iron</a>, uranium is only naturally formed in <a href="supernova">supernova</a>e. Primordial thorium and uranium are only produced in the <a href="r-process">r-process</a> (rapid neutron capture), because the <a href="s-process">s-process</a> (slow neutron capture) is too slow and cannot pass the gap of instability after bismuth. Besides the two extant primordial uranium isotopes, U and U, the r-process also produced significant quantities of <a href="uranium-236">U</a>, which has a shorter half-life and has long since decayed completely to Th, which was itself enriched by the decay of <a href="plutonium-244">Pu</a>, accounting for the observed higher-than-expected abundance of thorium and lower-than-expected abundance of uranium. While the natural abundance of uranium has been supplemented by the decay of extinct <a href="plutonium-242">Pu</a> (half-life 0.375 million years) and Cm (half-life 16 million years), producing U and U respectively, this occurred to an almost negligible extent due to the shorter half-lives of these parents and their lower production than U and Pu, the parents of thorium: the Cm:U ratio at the formation of the Solar System was .

Uranium is a <a href="natural%20abundance">naturally occurring</a> element that can be found in low levels within all rock, soil, and water. Uranium is the 51st element in order of <a href="Abundance%20of%20elements%20in%20Earth%27s%20crust">abundance</a> in the Earth's crust. Uranium is also the highest-numbered element to be found naturally in significant quantities on Earth and is almost always found combined with other elements. The decay of uranium, <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, and <a href="potassium-40">potassium-40</a> in the Earth's <a href="mantle%20%28geology%29">mantle</a> is thought to be the main source of heat that keeps the <a href="Structure%20of%20the%20Earth">outer core</a> liquid and drives <a href="mantle%20convection">mantle convection</a>, which in turn drives <a href="plate%20tectonics">plate tectonics</a>.

Uranium's average concentration in the <a href="Earth">Earth</a>'s <a href="crust%20%28geology%29">crust</a> is (depending on the reference) 2 to 4 parts per million, or about 40 times as abundant as <a href="silver">silver</a>. The Earth's crust from the surface to 25 km (15 mi) down is calculated to contain 10 kg (2 lb) of uranium while the <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s may contain 10 kg (2 lb). The concentration of uranium in soil ranges from 0.7 to 11 parts per million (up to 15 parts per million in farmland soil due to use of phosphate <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s), and its concentration in sea water is 3 parts per billion.

Uranium is more plentiful than <a href="antimony">antimony</a>, <a href="tin">tin</a>, <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, <a href="mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, or silver, and it is about as abundant as <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a> or <a href="molybdenum">molybdenum</a>. Uranium is found in hundreds of minerals, including uraninite (the most common uranium <a href="ore">ore</a>), <a href="carnotite">carnotite</a>, <a href="autunite">autunite</a>, <a href="uranophane">uranophane</a>, <a href="torbernite">torbernite</a>, and <a href="coffinite">coffinite</a>. Significant concentrations of uranium occur in some substances such as <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> rock deposits, and minerals such as <a href="lignite">lignite</a>, and <a href="monazite">monazite</a> sands in uranium-rich ores (it is recovered commercially from sources with as little as 0.1% uranium).

Other organisms, such as the lichen "Trapelia involuta" or <a href="microorganism">microorganism</a>s such as the <a href="bacterium">bacterium</a> "<a href="Citrobacter">Citrobacter</a>", can absorb concentrations of uranium that are up to 300 times the level of their environment. "Citrobacter" species absorb <a href="uranyl">uranyl</a> ions when given <a href="glycerol%20phosphate">glycerol phosphate</a> (or other similar organic phosphates). After one day, one gram of bacteria can encrust themselves with nine grams of uranyl phosphate crystals; this creates the possibility that these organisms could be used in <a href="bioremediation">bioremediation</a> to <a href="radioactive%20contamination">decontaminate</a> uranium-polluted water.
The proteobacterium "<a href="Geobacter">Geobacter</a>" has also been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground water. The mycorrhizal fungus <a href="Glomus%20intraradices">Glomus intraradices</a> increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant.

In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH. This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A "Sphingomonas" sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in "E. coli".

<a href="Plant">Plant</a>s absorb some uranium from soil. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in plants range from 5 to 60 parts per billion, and ash from burnt wood can have concentrations up to 4 parts per million. Dry weight concentrations of uranium in <a href="food">food</a> plants are typically lower with one to two micrograms per day ingested through the food people eat.

Worldwide production of UO (yellowcake) in 2013 amounted to 70,015 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s, of which 22,451 t (32%) was mined in <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>. Other important uranium mining countries are <a href="Canada">Canada</a> (9,331 t), <a href="Australia">Australia</a> (6,350 t), <a href="Niger">Niger</a> (4,518 t), <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> (4,323 t) and <a href="Russia">Russia</a> (3,135 t).

Uranium ore is mined in several ways: by <a href="open-pit%20mining">open pit</a>, <a href="underground%20mining%20%28soft%20rock%29">underground</a>, <a href="in-situ%20leach">in-situ leach</a>ing, and <a href="borehole%20mining">borehole mining</a> (see <a href="uranium%20mining">uranium mining</a>). Low-grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides. Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore. High-grade ores found in <a href="Athabasca%20Basin">Athabasca Basin</a> deposits in <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>, Canada can contain up to 23% uranium oxides on average. Uranium ore is crushed and rendered into a fine powder and then leached with either an <a href="acid">acid</a> or <a href="alkali">alkali</a>. The <a href="leachate">leachate</a> is subjected to one of several sequences of precipitation, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. The resulting mixture, called <a href="yellowcake">yellowcake</a>, contains at least 75% uranium oxides UO. Yellowcake is then <a href="calcined">calcined</a> to remove impurities from the milling process before refining and conversion.

Commercial-grade uranium can be produced through the <a href="redox">reduction</a> of uranium <a href="halide">halide</a>s with <a href="alkali%20metal">alkali</a> or <a href="alkaline%20earth%20metal">alkaline earth metal</a>s. Uranium metal can also be prepared through <a href="electrolysis">electrolysis</a> of or
<a href="Uranium%20tetrafluoride"></a>, dissolved in molten <a href="calcium%20chloride">calcium chloride</a> () and <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a> (<a href="sodium">Na</a>Cl) solution. Very pure uranium is produced through the <a href="thermal%20decomposition">thermal decomposition</a> of uranium halides on a hot filament.

It is estimated that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US$59 per lb of uranium, while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction). Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007. This has caused a big increase in spending on exploration, with US$200 million being spent worldwide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year. This trend continued through 2006, when expenditure on exploration rocketed to over $774 million, an increase of over 250% compared to 2004. The <a href="OECD">OECD</a> <a href="Nuclear%20Energy%20Agency">Nuclear Energy Agency</a> said exploration figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006.

Australia has 31% of the world's known uranium ore reserves and the world's largest single uranium deposit, located at the <a href="Olympic%20Dam%2C%20South%20Australia">Olympic Dam</a> Mine in <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>. There is a significant reserve of uranium
in <a href="Bakouma">Bakouma</a> a <a href="sub-prefecture">sub-prefecture</a> in the <a href="prefecture">prefecture</a> of <a href="Mbomou">Mbomou</a> in <a href="Central%20African%20Republic">Central African Republic</a>.

Some nuclear fuel comes from nuclear weapons being dismantled, such as from the <a href="Megatons%20to%20Megawatts%20Program">Megatons to Megawatts Program</a>.

An additional 4.6 billion tonnes of uranium are estimated to be in <a href="sea%20water">sea water</a> (<a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese scientists in the 1980s showed that extraction of uranium from sea water using <a href="ion%20exchange">ion exchange</a>rs was technically feasible). There have been experiments to extract uranium from sea water, but the yield has been low due to the carbonate present in the water. In 2012, <a href="ORNL">ORNL</a> researchers announced the successful development of a new absorbent material dubbed HiCap which performs surface retention of solid or gas molecules, atoms or ions and also effectively removes toxic metals from water, according to results verified by researchers at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

In 2005, seventeen countries produced concentrated uranium oxides: <a href="Canada">Canada</a> (27.9% of world production), <a href="Australia">Australia</a> (22.8%), <a href="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a> (10.5%), <a href="Russia">Russia</a> (8.0%), <a href="Namibia">Namibia</a> (7.5%), <a href="Niger">Niger</a> (7.4%), <a href="Uzbekistan">Uzbekistan</a> (5.5%), the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> (2.5%), <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> (2.1%), <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a> (1.9%) and <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">China</a> (1.7%). Kazakhstan continues to increase production and may have become the world's largest producer of uranium by 2009 with an expected production of 12,826 tonnes, compared to Canada with 11,100 t and Australia with 9,430 t. In the late 1960s, UN geologists also discovered major uranium deposits and other rare mineral reserves in <a href="Somalia">Somalia</a>. The find was the largest of its kind, with industry experts estimating the deposits at over 25% of the world's then known uranium reserves of 800,000 tons.

The ultimate available supply is believed to be sufficient for at least the next 85 years, although some studies indicate underinvestment in the late twentieth century may produce supply problems in the 21st century.
Uranium deposits seem to be log-normal distributed. There is a 300-fold increase in the amount of uranium recoverable for each tenfold decrease in ore grade.
In other words, there is little high grade ore and proportionately much more low grade ore available.

Calcined uranium yellowcake, as produced in many large mills, contains a distribution of uranium oxidation species in various forms ranging from most oxidized to least oxidized. Particles with short residence times in a calciner will generally be less oxidized than those with long retention times or particles recovered in the stack scrubber. Uranium content is usually referenced to , which dates to the days of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> when was used as an analytical chemistry reporting standard.

<a href="Phase%20%28matter%29">Phase relationships</a> in the uranium-oxygen system are complex. The most important oxidation states of uranium are uranium(IV) and uranium(VI), and their two corresponding <a href="oxide">oxide</a>s are, respectively, <a href="uranium%20dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> () and <a href="uranium%20trioxide">uranium trioxide</a> (). Other <a href="uranium%20oxide">uranium oxide</a>s such as uranium monoxide (UO), diuranium pentoxide (), and uranium peroxide () also exist.

The most common forms of uranium oxide are <a href="triuranium%20octoxide">triuranium octoxide</a> () and . Both oxide forms are solids that have low solubility in water and are relatively stable over a wide range of environmental conditions. Triuranium octoxide is (depending on conditions) the most stable compound of uranium and is the form most commonly found in nature. Uranium dioxide is the form in which uranium is most commonly used as a nuclear reactor fuel. At ambient temperatures, will gradually convert to . Because of their stability, uranium oxides are generally considered the preferred chemical form for storage or disposal.

Salts of many <a href="oxidation%20state">oxidation state</a>s of uranium are water-<a href="solubility">soluble</a> and may be studied in <a href="aqueous%20solution">aqueous solution</a>s. The most common ionic forms are (brown-red), (green), (unstable), and (yellow), for U(III), U(IV), U(V), and U(VI), respectively. A few <a href="solid">solid</a> and semi-metallic compounds such as UO and US exist for the formal oxidation state uranium(II), but no simple ions are known to exist in solution for that state. Ions of liberate <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> from <a href="water">water</a> and are therefore considered to be highly unstable. The ion represents the uranium(VI) state and is known to form compounds such as <a href="uranyl%20carbonate">uranyl carbonate</a>, <a href="uranyl%20chloride">uranyl chloride</a> and <a href="uranyl%20sulfate">uranyl sulfate</a>. also forms <a href="complex%20%28chemistry%29">complexes</a> with various <a href="organic%20compound">organic</a> <a href="chelation">chelating</a> agents, the most commonly encountered of which is <a href="uranyl%20acetate">uranyl acetate</a>.

Unlike the uranyl salts of uranium and <a href="polyatomic%20ion">polyatomic ion</a> uranium-oxide cationic forms, the <a href="uranate">uranate</a>s, salts containing a polyatomic uranium-oxide anion, are generally not water-soluble.

The interactions of carbonate anions with uranium(VI) cause the <a href="Pourbaix%20diagram">Pourbaix diagram</a> to change greatly when the medium is changed from water to a carbonate containing solution. While the vast majority of carbonates are insoluble in water (students are often taught that all carbonates other than those of alkali metals are insoluble in water), uranium carbonates are often soluble in water. This is because a U(VI) cation is able to bind two terminal oxides and three or more carbonates to form anionic complexes.

The uranium fraction diagrams in the presence of carbonate illustrate this further: when the pH of a uranium(VI) solution increases, the uranium is converted to a hydrated uranium oxide hydroxide and at high pHs it becomes an anionic hydroxide complex.

When carbonate is added, uranium is converted to a series of carbonate complexes if the pH is increased. One effect of these reactions is increased solubility of uranium in the pH range 6 to 8, a fact that has a direct bearing on the long term stability of spent uranium dioxide nuclear fuels.

Uranium metal heated to reacts with <a href="hydrogen">hydrogen</a> to form <a href="uranium%20hydride">uranium hydride</a>. Even higher temperatures will reversibly remove the hydrogen. This property makes uranium hydrides convenient starting materials to create reactive uranium powder along with various uranium <a href="carbide">carbide</a>, <a href="nitride">nitride</a>, and <a href="halide">halide</a> compounds. Two crystal modifications of uranium hydride exist: an α form that is obtained at low temperatures and a β form that is created when the formation temperature is above 250 °C.

<a href="Uranium%20carbide">Uranium carbide</a>s and <a href="uranium%20nitride">uranium nitride</a>s are both relatively <a href="Chemically%20inert">inert</a> <a href="semimetal">semimetal</a>lic compounds that are minimally soluble in <a href="acid">acid</a>s, react with water, and can ignite in <a href="air">air</a> to form . Carbides of uranium include uranium monocarbide (U<a href="carbon">C</a>), uranium dicarbide (), and diuranium tricarbide (). Both UC and are formed by adding carbon to molten uranium or by exposing the metal to <a href="carbon%20monoxide">carbon monoxide</a> at high temperatures. Stable below 1800 °C, is prepared by subjecting a heated mixture of UC and to mechanical stress. Uranium nitrides obtained by direct exposure of the metal to <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> include uranium mononitride (UN), uranium dinitride (), and diuranium trinitride ().

All uranium fluorides are created using <a href="uranium%20tetrafluoride">uranium tetrafluoride</a> (); itself is prepared by hydrofluorination of uranium dioxide. Reduction of with hydrogen at 1000 °C produces uranium trifluoride (). Under the right conditions of temperature and pressure, the reaction of solid with gaseous <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> () can form the intermediate fluorides of , , and .

At room temperatures, has a high <a href="vapor%20pressure">vapor pressure</a>, making it useful in the <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> process to separate the rare uranium-235 from the common uranium-238 isotope. This compound can be prepared from uranium dioxide and uranium hydride by the following process:

The resulting , a white solid, is highly <a href="chemical%20reaction">reactive</a> (by fluorination), easily <a href="sublimation%20%28chemistry%29">sublimes</a> (emitting a vapor that behaves as a nearly <a href="ideal%20gas">ideal gas</a>), and is the most volatile compound of uranium known to exist.

One method of preparing <a href="uranium%20tetrachloride">uranium tetrachloride</a> () is to directly combine <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> with either uranium metal or uranium hydride. The reduction of by hydrogen produces uranium trichloride () while the higher chlorides of uranium are prepared by reaction with additional chlorine. All uranium chlorides react with water and air.

<a href="Bromide">Bromide</a>s and <a href="iodide">iodide</a>s of uranium are formed by direct reaction of, respectively, <a href="bromine">bromine</a> and <a href="iodine">iodine</a> with uranium or by adding to those element's acids. Known examples include: , , , and . Uranium oxyhalides are water-soluble and include , , , and . Stability of the oxyhalides decrease as the <a href="atomic%20weight">atomic weight</a> of the component halide increases.

<a href="Natural%20uranium">Natural uranium</a> consists of three major <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s: <a href="uranium-238">uranium-238</a> (99.28% <a href="natural%20abundance">natural abundance</a>), uranium-235 (0.71%), and <a href="uranium-234">uranium-234</a> (0.0054%). All three are <a href="radioactive%20decay">radioactive</a>, emitting <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s, with the exception that all three of these isotopes have small probabilities of undergoing <a href="spontaneous%20fission">spontaneous fission</a>, rather than <a href="alpha%20emission">alpha emission</a>. There are also five other trace isotopes: uranium-239, which is formed when U undergoes spontaneous fission, releasing neutrons that are captured by another U atom; uranium-237, which is formed when U captures a neutron but emits two more, which then decays to <a href="neptunium-237">neptunium-237</a>; and finally, uranium-233, which is formed in the <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a> of that neptunium-237. It is also expected that <a href="thorium-232">thorium-232</a> should be able to undergo <a href="double%20beta%20decay">double beta decay</a>, which would produce uranium-232, but this has not yet been observed experimentally.

Uranium-238 is the most stable isotope of uranium, with a <a href="half-life">half-life</a> of about 4.468 years, roughly the <a href="age%20of%20the%20Earth">age of the Earth</a>. Uranium-235 has a half-life of about 7.13 years, and uranium-234 has a half-life of about 2.48 years.
For natural uranium, about 49% of its alpha rays are emitted by each of U atom, and also 49% by U (since the latter is formed from the former) and about 2.0% of them by the U. When the Earth was young, probably about one-fifth of its uranium was uranium-235, but the percentage of U was probably much lower than this.

Uranium-238 is usually an α emitter (occasionally, it undergoes spontaneous fission), decaying through the <a href="decay%20chain%23Uranium%20series">uranium series</a>, which has 18 members, into <a href="lead%23Isotopes">lead-206</a>, by a variety of different decay paths.

The <a href="decay%20chain">decay chain</a> of U, which is called the <a href="decay%20chain%23Actinium%20series">actinium series</a>, has 15 members and eventually decays into lead-207. The constant rates of decay in these decay series makes the comparison of the ratios of parent to <a href="decay%20product">daughter elements</a> useful in <a href="radiometric%20dating">radiometric dating</a>.

Uranium-234, which is a member of the uranium series (the decay chain of uranium-238), decays to lead-206 through a series of relatively short-lived isotopes.

Uranium-233 is made from <a href="thorium%23Isotopes">thorium-232</a> by neutron bombardment, usually in a nuclear reactor, and U is also fissile. Its decay chain forms part of the <a href="decay%20chain%23Neptunium%20series">neptunium series</a> and ends at <a href="bismuth-209">bismuth-209</a> and <a href="thallium">thallium</a>-205.

Uranium-235 is important for both <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s and <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s, because it is the only uranium isotope existing in nature on Earth in any significant amount that is <a href="fissile">fissile</a>. This means that it can be split into two or three fragments (<a href="fission%20products">fission products</a>) by thermal neutrons.

Uranium-238 is not fissile, but is a fertile isotope, because after <a href="neutron%20activation">neutron activation</a> it can produce <a href="plutonium-239">plutonium-239</a>, another fissile isotope. Indeed, the U nucleus can absorb one neutron to produce the radioactive isotope <a href="uranium-239">uranium-239</a>. U decays by <a href="beta%20emission">beta emission</a> to <a href="neptunium">neptunium</a>-239, also a beta-emitter, that decays in its turn, within a few days into plutonium-239. Pu was used as fissile material in the first <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> detonated in the "<a href="Trinity%20test">Trinity test</a>" on 15 July 1945 in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>.

In nature, uranium is found as uranium-238 (99.2742%) and uranium-235 (0.7204%). <a href="Isotope%20separation">Isotope separation</a> concentrates (enriches) the fissionable uranium-235 for nuclear weapons and most nuclear power plants, except for <a href="gas%20cooled%20reactor">gas cooled reactor</a>s and <a href="pressurised%20heavy%20water%20reactor">pressurised heavy water reactor</a>s. Most neutrons released by a fissioning atom of uranium-235 must impact other uranium-235 atoms to sustain the <a href="nuclear%20chain%20reaction">nuclear chain reaction</a>. The concentration and amount of uranium-235 needed to achieve this is called a '<a href="critical%20mass">critical mass</a>'.

To be considered 'enriched', the uranium-235 fraction should be between 3% and 5%. This process produces huge quantities of uranium that is depleted of uranium-235 and with a correspondingly increased fraction of uranium-238, called depleted uranium or 'DU'. To be considered 'depleted', the uranium-235 isotope concentration should be no more than 0.3%. The price of uranium has risen since 2001, so enrichment tailings containing more than 0.35% uranium-235 are being considered for re-enrichment, driving the price of depleted uranium hexafluoride above $130 per kilogram in July 2007 from $5 in 2001.

The <a href="gas%20centrifuge">gas centrifuge</a> process, where gaseous <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> () is separated by the difference in molecular weight between UF and UF using high-speed <a href="centrifuge">centrifuge</a>s, is the cheapest and leading enrichment process. The <a href="gaseous%20diffusion">gaseous diffusion</a> process had been the leading method for enrichment and was used in the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. In this process, uranium hexafluoride is repeatedly <a href="diffusion">diffused</a> through a <a href="silver">silver</a>-<a href="zinc">zinc</a> membrane, and the different isotopes of uranium are separated by diffusion rate (since uranium 238 is heavier it diffuses slightly slower than uranium-235). The <a href="molecular%20laser%20isotope%20separation">molecular laser isotope separation</a> method employs a <a href="laser">laser</a> beam of precise energy to sever the bond between uranium-235 and fluorine. This leaves uranium-238 bonded to fluorine and allows uranium-235 metal to precipitate from the solution. An alternative laser method of enrichment is known as <a href="atomic%20vapor%20laser%20isotope%20separation">atomic vapor laser isotope separation</a> (AVLIS) and employs visible <a href="tunable%20laser">tunable laser</a>s such as <a href="dye%20laser">dye laser</a>s. Another method used is liquid thermal diffusion.

A person can be exposed to uranium (or its <a href="decay%20product">radioactive daughters</a>, such as <a href="radon">radon</a>) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, people who work in factories that process <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>s, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium <a href="weapons">weapons</a> have been used, or live or work near a <a href="coal">coal</a>-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased exposure to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of exposure to radon gas. The <a href="Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health%20Administration">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) has set the <a href="permissible%20exposure%20limit">permissible exposure limit</a> for uranium exposure in the workplace as 0.25 mg/m over an 8-hour workday. The <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Occupational%20Safety%20and%20Health">National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH) has set a <a href="recommended%20exposure%20limit">recommended exposure limit</a> (REL) of 0.2 mg/m over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6 mg/m. At levels of 10 mg/m, uranium is <a href="IDLH">immediately dangerous to life and health</a>.

Most ingested uranium is excreted during <a href="digestion">digestion</a>. Only 0.5% is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium, such as its oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble <a href="uranyl">uranyl</a> ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the <a href="lung">lung</a>s, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulate</a> and stay for many years in <a href="bone">bone</a> tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and <a href="alpha%20particle">alpha particle</a>s released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.

Incorporated uranium becomes <a href="uranyl">uranyl</a> ions, which accumulate in bone, liver, kidney, and reproductive tissues. Uranium can be decontaminated from steel surfaces and <a href="aquifer">aquifer</a>s.

Normal functioning of the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>, <a href="brain">brain</a>, <a href="liver">liver</a>, <a href="heart">heart</a>, and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a <a href="toxic%20metal">toxic metal</a>. Uranium is also a reproductive toxicant. Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation, the primary form of U decay, has a very short range, and will not penetrate skin. Alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers. <a href="Uranyl">Uranyl</a> () ions, such as from <a href="uranium%20trioxide">uranium trioxide</a> or uranyl nitrate and other hexavalent uranium compounds, have been shown to cause birth defects and immune system damage in laboratory animals. While the CDC has published one study that no human <a href="cancer">cancer</a> has been seen as a result of exposure to natural or depleted uranium, exposure to uranium and its decay products, especially <a href="radon">radon</a>, are widely known and significant health threats. Exposure to <a href="strontium-90">strontium-90</a>, <a href="iodine-131">iodine-131</a>, and other fission products is unrelated to uranium exposure, but may result from medical procedures or exposure to spent reactor fuel or fallout from nuclear weapons.
Although accidental inhalation exposure to a high concentration of <a href="uranium%20hexafluoride">uranium hexafluoride</a> has
resulted in human fatalities, those deaths were associated with the generation of highly toxic hydrofluoric acid and <a href="uranyl%20fluoride">uranyl fluoride</a> rather than with uranium itself. Finely divided uranium metal presents a fire hazard because uranium is <a href="pyrophoricity">pyrophoric</a>; small grains will ignite spontaneously in air at room temperature.

Uranium metal is commonly handled with gloves as a sufficient precaution. Uranium concentrate is handled and contained so as to ensure that people do not inhale or ingest it.

Ulysses S. Grant

Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant; April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was an American politician, soldier, international statesman, and author, who served as the 18th <a href="president%20of%20the%20United%20States">president of the United States</a> from 1869 to 1877. During the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> Grant led the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> as <a href="Commanding%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Army">its commanding general</a> to victory over the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> with the supervision of President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. During the <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction Era</a>, President Grant led the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republicans</a> in their efforts to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism, racism, and slavery.

From early childhood in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, Grant was a skilled <a href="equestrianism">equestrian</a> who had a talent for taming horses. He graduated from <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">West Point</a> in 1843 and served with distinction in the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>. Upon his return, Grant married <a href="Julia%20Dent">Julia Dent</a>, and together they had four children. In 1854, Grant abruptly resigned from the army. He and his family struggled financially in civilian life for seven years. When the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> broke out in 1861, Grant joined the Union Army and rapidly rose in rank to general. Grant was persistent in his pursuit of the Confederate enemy, winning major battles and gaining Union control of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a>. In March 1864, President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> promoted Grant to Lieutenant General, a rank previously reserved for <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>. For over a year Grant's <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> fought the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> led by <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> in the <a href="Overland%20Campaign">Overland Campaign</a> and at <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Petersburg</a>. On April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered to Grant at <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">Appomattox</a>, and the war ended.

On April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated. Grant continued his service under Lincoln's successor President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> and was promoted General of the Army in 1866. Disillusioned by Johnson's conservative approach to <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a>, Grant drifted toward the <a href="Radical%20Republican">"Radical" Republicans</a>. Elected the youngest 19th Century president in 1868, Grant stabilized the post-war national economy, created the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a>, and prosecuted the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. He appointed <a href="African-Americans">African-Americans</a> and <a href="Jewish-Americans">Jewish-Americans</a> to prominent federal offices. In 1871, Grant created the first <a href="United%20States%20Civil%20Service%20Commission">Civil Service Commission</a>. The <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a> and <a href="Liberal%20Republicans">Liberal Republicans</a> united behind Grant's opponent in the presidential election of 1872, but Grant was handily re-elected. Grant's new Peace Policy for Native Americans had both successes and failures. Grant's administration successfully resolved the <a href="Alabama%20Claims">"Alabama" claims</a> and the <a href="Virginius%20Affair">"Virginius" Affair</a>, but Congress rejected his <a href="Annexation%20of%20Santo%20Domingo">Dominican annexation</a> initiative. Grant's presidency was plagued by numerous public scandals, while the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a> plunged the nation into a severe economic depression.

After Grant left office in March 1877, he embarked on a two-and-a-half-year <a href="World%20tour%20of%20Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">world tour</a> that captured favorable global attention for him and the United States. In 1880, Grant was unsuccessful in obtaining the Republican presidential nomination for a third term. In the final year of his life, facing severe investment reversals and dying of throat cancer, he wrote <a href="Personal%20Memoirs%20of%20Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">his memoirs</a>, which proved to be a major critical and financial success. At the time of his death, he was memorialized as a symbol of national unity.

<a href="Historical%20reputation%20of%20Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Historical assessments</a> of Grant's legacy have varied considerably over the years. Historians have hailed Grant's military genius, and <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%20and%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">his strategies</a> are featured in military history textbooks. Stigmatized by multiple scandals, Grant's presidency has traditionally been <a href="Historical%20rankings%20of%20presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">ranked</a> among the worst. Modern scholars have shown greater appreciation for his achievements that included civil rights enforcement and has raised his historical reputation. Grant has been regarded as an embattled president who performed a difficult job during Reconstruction.

Hiram Ulysses Grant was born in <a href="Point%20Pleasant%2C%20Ohio">Point Pleasant, Ohio</a>, on April 27, 1822, to <a href="Jesse%20Root%20Grant">Jesse Root Grant</a>, a <a href="Tanner%20%28occupation%29">tanner</a> and merchant, and Hannah Grant (née Simpson). His ancestors Matthew and Priscilla Grant arrived aboard the ship "<a href="Mary%20and%20John">Mary and John</a>" at <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> in 1630. Grant's great-grandfather fought in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a>, and his grandfather, Noah, served in the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a> at <a href="Battle%20of%20Bunker%20Hill">Bunker Hill</a>. Afterward, Noah settled in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and married Rachel Kelley, the daughter of an <a href="Irish%20Americans">Irish</a> pioneer. Their son Jesse (Ulysses's father) was a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> supporter and a fervent abolitionist.

Jesse Grant moved to Point Pleasant in 1820 and found work as a foreman in a tannery. He soon met his future wife, Hannah, and the two were married on June 24, 1821. Ten months later Hannah gave birth to their first child, a son. At a family gathering several weeks later the boy's name, Ulysses, was drawn from ballots placed in a hat. Wanting to honor his father-in-law, who had suggested Hiram, Jesse declared the boy to be Hiram Ulysses, though he would always refer to him as "Ulysses".

In 1823, the family moved to <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Ohio">Georgetown, Ohio</a>, where five more siblings were born: Simpson, Clara, Orvil, Jennie, and Mary. At the age of five, Ulysses began his formal education, starting at a subscription school and later in two private schools. In the winter of 1836–1837, Grant was a student at <a href="John%20Brett%20Richeson%20House%23Maysville%20Academy">Maysville Seminary</a>, and in the autumn of 1838, he attended <a href="John%20Rankin%20%28abolitionist%29">John Rankin</a>'s academy. In his youth, Grant developed an unusual ability to ride and manage horses. Since Grant expressed a strong dislike for the tannery his father put his ability with horses to use by giving him work driving wagon loads of supplies and transporting people. Unlike his siblings, Grant was not forced to attend church by his <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> parents. For the rest of his life, he prayed privately and never officially joined any denomination. To others, including late in life, his own son, Grant appeared to be an <a href="agnostic">agnostic</a>. He inherited some of Hannah's Methodist <a href="Works%20of%20Piety">piety</a> and quiet nature. Grant was largely apolitical before the war but wrote, "If I had ever had any political sympathies they would have been with the Whigs. I was raised in that school."

Grant's father wrote to Representative <a href="Thomas%20L.%20Hamer">Thomas L. Hamer</a> requesting that he nominate Ulysses to the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> (USMA) at <a href="West%20Point%2C%20New%20York">West Point, New York</a>. When a spot opened in March 1839, Hamer nominated the 16-year-old Grant. He mistakenly wrote down "Ulysses S. Grant", which became his adopted name because West Point could not change the name of the appointee. Initially reluctant because of concerns about his academic ability, Grant entered the academy on July 1, 1839, as a <a href="cadet">cadet</a> and trained there for four years. His nickname became "Sam" among army colleagues since the initials "U.S." also stood for "<a href="Uncle%20Sam">Uncle Sam</a>".

Initially, Grant was indifferent to military life, but within a year he reexamined his desire to leave the academy and later wrote that "on the whole I like this place very much". While at the Academy, his greatest interest was horses, and he earned a reputation as the "most proficient" horseman. During the graduation ceremony, while riding "York", a large and powerful horse Grant managed well, he set a high-jump record that stood for 25 years. Seeking relief from military routine, he studied under <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> artist <a href="Robert%20Walter%20Weir">Robert Walter Weir</a>, producing nine surviving artworks. He spent more time reading books from the library than his academic texts, frequently reading works by <a href="James%20Fenimore%20Cooper">James Fenimore Cooper</a> and others. On Sundays, cadets were required to march to and attend services at the academy's church, a requirement that Grant disliked. Quiet by nature, Grant established a few intimate friends among fellow cadets, including <a href="Frederick%20Tracy%20Dent">Frederick Tracy Dent</a> and <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a>. He was inspired both by the Commandant, Captain <a href="Charles%20Ferguson%20Smith">Charles F. Smith</a> and by General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>, who visited the academy to review the cadets. Grant later wrote of the military life, "there is much to dislike, but more to like."

Grant graduated on June 30, 1843, ranked 21st out of 39 <a href="alumni">alumni</a> and was promoted on July 1 to the rank brevet <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>. Small for his age at 17, he had entered the academy weighing only 117 pounds at five feet two inches tall; upon graduation four years later he had grown to a height of five feet seven inches. Glad to leave the academy, he planned to resign his commission after his four-year term of duty. Grant would later write to a friend that among the happiest days of his life was the day he left the presidency and the day he left the academy. Despite his excellent horsemanship, he was not assigned to the cavalry, but to the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">4th Infantry Regiment</a>. Grant's first assignment took him to the <a href="Jefferson%20Barracks">Jefferson Barracks</a> near <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a>. Commanded by Colonel <a href="Stephen%20W.%20Kearny">Stephen W. Kearny</a>, the barracks was the nation's largest military base in the west. Grant was happy with his new commander but looked forward to the end of his military service and a possible teaching career.

In Missouri, Grant visited Dent's family and became engaged to his sister, <a href="Julia%20Grant">Julia</a>, in 1844. Four years later on August 22, 1848, they were married at Julia's home in <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>. Grant's abolitionist father Jesse, who disapproved of the Dents owning slaves, refused to attend their wedding, which took place without either of Grant's parents. Grant was flanked by three fellow West Point graduates, all dressed in their blue uniforms, including Longstreet, Julia's cousin. At the end of the month, Julia was nevertheless warmly received by Grant's family in <a href="Bethel%2C%20Ohio">Bethel, Ohio</a>. They had four children: <a href="Frederick%20Dent%20Grant">Frederick</a>, <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%20Jr.">Ulysses Jr.</a> ("Buck"), <a href="Nellie%20Grant">Ellen</a> ("Nellie"), and <a href="Jesse%20Root%20Grant%20%28politician%29">Jesse</a>. After the wedding, Grant obtained a two-month extension to his leave and returned to St. Louis when he decided, with a wife to support, that he would remain in the army.

After rising tensions with Mexico following the United States' <a href="Texas%20annexation">annexation of Texas</a>, war broke out in 1846. During the conflict, Grant distinguished himself as a daring and competent soldier. Before the war President <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a> had ordered Grant's unit to Louisiana as part of the <a href="Army%20of%20Observation">Army of Observation</a> under Major General <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>. In September 1846, Tyler's successor, <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>, unable to provoke Mexico into war at <a href="Corpus%20Christi%2C%20Texas">Corpus Christi, Texas</a>, ordered Taylor to march 150 miles south to the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a>. Marching south to <a href="Fort%20Texas">Fort Texas</a>, to prevent a Mexican siege, Grant experienced combat for the first time on May 8, 1846, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Palo%20Alto">Battle of Palo Alto</a>.

Grant was tapped to serve as regimental quartermaster, but yearned for a combat role; when finally allowed, he led a cavalry charge at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Resaca%20de%20la%20Palma">Battle of Resaca de la Palma</a>. He demonstrated his equestrian ability at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monterrey">Battle of Monterrey</a> by carrying a dispatch past snipers while hanging off the side of his horse, keeping the animal between him and the enemy. Before leaving the city he stopped at a house occupied by wounded Americans, giving them assurance he would send for help. Polk, wary of Taylor's growing popularity, divided his forces, sending some troops (including Grant's unit) to form a new army under Major General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>. Traveling by sea, Scott's army landed at <a href="Veracruz">Veracruz</a> and advanced toward <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. The army met the Mexican forces at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Molino%20del%20Rey">Molino del Rey</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Chapultepec">Chapultepec</a> outside Mexico City. For his bravery at Molino del Rey, Grant was <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevetted</a> first lieutenant on September 30. At San Cosmé, men under Grant's direction dragged a disassembled <a href="howitzer">howitzer</a> into a church steeple, reassembled it, and bombarded nearby Mexican troops. His bravery and initiative earned him his second brevet promotion to captain. On September 14, 1847, Scott's army marched into the city; Mexico <a href="Treaty%20of%20Guadalupe%20Hidalgo">ceded</a> the vast territory, including <a href="California">California</a>, to the U.S. on February 2, 1848.

During the war, Grant established a commendable record, studied the tactics and strategies of Scott and Taylor, and emerged as a seasoned officer, writing in his memoirs that this is how he learned much about military leadership. In retrospect, although he respected Scott he identified his leadership style with Taylor's. However, Grant also wrote that the Mexican War was wrong and the territorial gains were designed to expand slavery, stating, "I was bitterly opposed to the measure ... and to this day, regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation." He opined that the Civil War was divine punishment on the nation for its aggression in Mexico. During the war, Grant discovered his "moral courage" and began to consider a career in the army.

Grant's first post-war assignments took him and Julia to <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> on November 17, 1848, but he had been replaced and was sent instead to <a href="Madison%20Barracks">Madison Barracks</a>, a desolate outpost in upstate New York, in bad need of supplies and repair. After four months, Grant was sent back to his quartermaster job in Detroit.

When the discovery of <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">gold in California</a> brought droves of prospectors and settlers to the territory, Grant and the 4th infantry were ordered to reinforce the small garrison there. Grant was charged with bringing the soldiers and a few hundred civilians from New York City to Panama, <a href="Maritime%20history%20of%20California%23To%20California%20via%20Panama">overland</a> to the Pacific and then north to California. Julia, eight months pregnant with Ulysses Jr., did not accompany him. While Grant was in Panama, a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemic broke out and claimed the lives of many soldiers, civilians, and children. In Panama City, Grant established and organized a field hospital and moved the worst cases to a hospital barge one mile offshore. When orderlies protested having to attend to the sick, Grant did much of the nursing himself, earning high praise from observers. In August, Grant arrived in San Francisco. His next assignment sent him north to <a href="Vancouver%20Barracks">Vancouver Barracks</a> in the <a href="Oregon%20Territory">Oregon Territory</a>.

To supplement his meager salary, Grant tried several business ventures. They failed, confirming his father's belief that he had no head for business. Grant assured Julia in a letter that the local Indians were harmless, while he developed an empathy for the plight of Indians from the "unjust treatment" by white men. Promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28U.S.%20Army%29">captain</a> on August 5, 1853, Grant was assigned to command Company F, <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">4th Infantry</a>, at the newly constructed <a href="Fort%20Humboldt%20State%20Historic%20Park">Fort Humboldt</a> in California. He arrived at the fort on January 5, 1854, and reported to its commander, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="Robert%20C.%20Buchanan">Robert C. Buchanan</a>. Grant was bored and depressed about being separated from his wife, and he began to drink. An officer who roomed with Grant reported the affair to Colonel Buchanan, who reprimanded Grant for one drinking episode. Grant told Buchanan if he did not reform, he would resign. On Sunday, Grant was again rumored to have been found at his company's pay table influenced by alcohol. Keeping his pledge to Buchanan, Grant resigned, effective July 31, 1854, without explanation. Buchanan endorsed Grant's letter of resignation but did not submit any report that verified the incident. Grant was neither arrested nor faced court-martial, while the War Department stated, "Nothing stands against his good name." Grant said years later, "the vice of intemperance (drunkenness) had not a little to do with my decision to resign." With no means of support, Grant returned to St. Louis and reunited with his family, uncertain about his future.

At age 32, with no civilian vocation, Grant needed work to support his growing family. It was the beginning of seven financially lean years. His father offered him a place in the <a href="Galena%2C%20Illinois">Galena, Illinois</a> branch of the family's leather business on condition that Julia and the children stay with her parents in Missouri or with the Grants in Kentucky. Ulysses and Julia opposed another separation and declined the offer. In 1855, Grant farmed on his brother-in-law's property near St. Louis, using slaves owned by Julia's father. The farm was not successful and to earn a living he sold firewood on St. Louis street corners. Earning only $50 a month (), wearing his faded army jacket, an unkempt Grant desperately looked for work. The next year, the Grants moved to land on Julia's father's farm, and built a home Grant called "<a href="Grant%27s%20Farm">Hardscrabble</a>". Julia disliked the <a href="Log%20house">rustic house</a>, which she described as an "unattractive cabin". The <a href="Panic%20of%201857">Panic of 1857</a> devastated farmers, including Grant, who pawned his gold watch to pay for Christmas. In 1858, Grant rented out Hardscrabble and moved his family to Julia's father's <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%20National%20Historic%20Site">850-acre plantation</a> that used slave labor. That fall, after a bout of <a href="malaria">malaria</a>, Grant retired from farming.

The same year, Grant acquired a slave from his father-in-law, a thirty-five-year-old man named William Jones. In March 1859, Grant freed William, worth about $1,500, instead of selling him at a time when he needed money. Grant moved to St. Louis, taking on a partnership with Julia's cousin Harry Boggs working in the real estate business as a bill collector, again without success, and at Julia's recommendation he dissolved his partnership. In August, Grant applied for a position as county engineer, believing his education qualified him for the job. His application came with thirty-five notable recommendations, but Grant correctly assumed the position would be given on the basis of political affiliation and was passed over by the <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil</a> and <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> county commissioners because he was believed to share his father-in-law's <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> sentiments. In the 1856 presidential election, Grant cast his first <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">presidential vote</a> for Democrat <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, later saying he was really voting against Republican <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> over concern that his anti-slavery position would lead to southern secession and war and because he considered Frémont to be a shameless self-promoter. Although Grant was not an <a href="abolitionist">abolitionist</a>, he was not considered a "slavery man", and could not bring himself to force slaves to do work.

In April 1860, Grant and his family moved north to Galena, accepting a position in his father's leather goods business run by his younger brothers Simpson and Orvil. In a few months, Ulysses paid off the debts he acquired in Missouri. Ulysses and family attended the local Methodist church and he soon established himself as a reputable citizen of Galena. For the 1860 election, he could not vote because he was not yet a legal resident of Illinois, but he favored Democrat <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> over the eventual winner, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, and Lincoln over the Southern Democrat, <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a>. He was torn between his increasingly anti-slavery views and the fact that his wife remained a staunch Democrat.

On April 12, 1861, the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> began when Confederate troops <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">attacked Fort Sumter</a> in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>. The news came as a shock in Galena, and Grant shared his neighbors' concern about the war. On April 15, Lincoln called for 75,000 volunteers. On April 16, Grant attended a mass meeting held in Galena to assess the crisis and encourage recruitment, and a speech by his father's attorney, <a href="John%20Aaron%20Rawlins">John Aaron Rawlins</a>, stirred Grant's patriotism. Ready to fight, Grant recalled with satisfaction, "I never went into our leather store again." On April 18, Grant chaired a second recruitment meeting, but turned down a captain's position as commander of the newly-formed militia company, hoping his previous experience would aid him to obtain more senior military rank.

Grant's early efforts to be recommissioned failed, rejected by Major General <a href="George%20B.%20McClellan">George B. McClellan</a> and Brigadier General <a href="Nathaniel%20Lyon">Nathaniel Lyon</a>. On April 29, supported by Congressman <a href="Elihu%20B.%20Washburne">Elihu B. Washburne</a> of Illinois, Grant was appointed military aide to Governor <a href="Richard%20Yates%20%2819th%20century%20politician%29">Richard Yates</a> and mustered ten regiments into the Illinois militia. On June 14, again aided by Washburne, Grant was promoted to Colonel and put in charge of the unruly <a href="21st%20Illinois%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, which he soon restored to good order and discipline. Colonel Grant and his 21st Regiment were transferred to Missouri to dislodge reported Confederate forces.

On August 5, with Washburne's aid, Grant was appointed Brigadier General of volunteers. Major General <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a>, Union commander of the West, passed over senior generals and appointed Grant commander of the District of Southeastern Missouri. Grant set up his headquarters at <a href="Cairo%2C%20Illinois">Cairo, Illinois</a>, a bustling Union military and naval base, that was to be used to launch a joint campaign down the Mississippi, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers. After the Confederates moved into western Kentucky, with designs on southern Illinois, Grant, who notified Frémont, advanced on <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah, Kentucky</a>, taking it without a fight on September 6, and set up a supply station. Having understood the importance to Lincoln about Kentucky's neutrality, Grant assured its citizens, "I have come among you not as your enemy, but as your friend." On November 1, Frémont ordered Grant to "<a href="Demonstration%20%28military%29">make demonstrations</a>" against the Confederates on both sides of the Mississippi, but prohibited him from attacking the enemy.

On November 2, 1861, Lincoln removed Frémont from command, a move that freed up Grant to make a planned attack from Cairo on Confederate soldiers encamped in <a href="Battle%20of%20Belmont">Belmont</a>, Missouri. On November 7, Grant, along with Brigadier General <a href="John%20A.%20McClernand">John A. McClernand</a>, landed 2,500 men at Hunter's Point, two miles north of the Confederate base outside Belmont. The Union army took the camp, but the reinforced Confederates under Brigadier Generals <a href="Frank%20Cheatham">Frank Cheatham</a> and <a href="Gideon%20J.%20Pillow">Gideon J. Pillow</a> forced a chaotic Union retreat. Grant had wanted to destroy Confederate strongholds at both <a href="Belmont%2C%20Missouri">Belmont, Missouri</a> and <a href="Columbus%2C%20Kentucky">Columbus, Kentucky</a>, but was not given enough troops and was only able to disrupt their positions. Grant's troops had to fight their way back to their Union boats and escaped back to Cairo under fire from the heavily fortified stronghold at Columbus. Although Grant and his army retreated, the battle gave his volunteers much-needed confidence and experience. Also, President Lincoln noticed that Grant was a general willing to fight.

Confederate-held Columbus blocked Union access to the lower Mississippi. Grant, and General <a href="James%20B.%20McPherson">James B. McPherson</a>, came up with a plan to bypass Columbus and with a force of 25,000 troops, move against <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Henry">Fort Henry</a> on the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a> and then ten miles east to <a href="Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> on the <a href="Cumberland%20River">Cumberland River</a>, with the aid of gunboats, opening both rivers and allowing the Union access further south. Grant presented his plan to <a href="Henry%20Halleck">Henry Halleck</a>, his new commander under the newly created <a href="Department%20of%20Missouri">Department of Missouri</a>. Halleck was considering the same strategy, but rebuffed Grant, believing he needed twice the number of troops. However, after Halleck telegraphed and consulted McClellan about the plan, he finally agreed on condition that the attack be conducted in close cooperation with navy <a href="Flag%20Officer%23United%20States">Flag Officer</a>, <a href="Andrew%20H.%20Foote">Andrew H. Foote</a>. Foote's gunboats bombarded Fort Henry, leading to its surrender on February 6, 1862, before Grant's infantry even arrived.

Grant then ordered an immediate <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Donelson">assault</a> on Fort Donelson, under the command of <a href="John%20B.%20Floyd">John B. Floyd</a>, which dominated the Cumberland River. Unlike Fort Henry, Grant was now going up against a force equal to his. Unaware of the garrison's strength, Grant's forces were over-confident. Grant, McClernand, and Smith positioned their divisions around the fort. The next day McClernand and Smith launched probing attacks on apparent weak spots in the Confederate line, only to retreat with heavy losses. On February 14, 1862, Foote's gunboats began bombarding the fort, only to be repulsed by its heavy guns. Foote himself was wounded. Thus far the Confederates were winning, but soon Union reinforcements arrived, giving Grant a total force of over 40,000 men. When Foote regained control of the river, Grant resumed his attack resulting in a standoff. That evening, Floyd called a council of war, unsure of his next action. Grant received a dispatch from Foote, requesting that they meet. Grant mounted a horse and rode seven miles over freezing roads and trenches, reaching Smith's division, instructing him to prepare for the next assault, and rode on and met up with McClernand and Wallace. After exchanging reports, he met up with Foote. On February 16, Foote resumed his bombardment, which signaled a general attack. Floyd and Pillow fled, leaving the fort in command of <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner">Simon Bolivar Buckner</a>, who submitted to Grant's demand for "unconditional and immediate surrender".

Grant had won the first major victory for the Union, capturing Floyd's entire rebel army of more than 12,000. Halleck was angry that Grant had acted without his authorization and complained to McClellan, accusing Grant of "neglect and inefficiency". On March 3, Halleck sent a telegram to Washington complaining that he had no communication with Grant for a week. Three days later, Halleck followed up with a postscript claiming "word has just reached me that ... Grant has resumed his bad habits (of drinking)." Lincoln, regardless, promoted Grant to major general of volunteers while the Northern press treated Grant as a hero. Playing off his initials, they took to calling him "Unconditional Surrender Grant."

As the great numbers of troops from both armies gathered, it was widely thought in the North that another western battle might end the war. Grant, reinstated by Halleck at Lincoln's and Stanton's urging, left Fort Henry and traveled by boat up the Tennessee River to rejoin his army with orders to advance with the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Tennessee">Army of the Tennessee</a> into Tennessee. Grant's main Union army was located at <a href="Pittsburg%20Landing">Pittsburg Landing</a>, while 40,000 Confederate troops converged at <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth</a>. Brigadier General <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> assured Grant that his green troops were ready for an attack. Grant agreed and wired Halleck with their assessment. Grant, whose forces numbered 45,000, wanted to attack the Confederates at Corinth, but Halleck ordered him not to attack until Major General <a href="Don%20Carlos%20Buell">Don Carlos Buell</a> arrived with his division of 25,000. Meanwhile, Grant prepared for an attack on the Confederate army of roughly equal strength. Instead of preparing defensive fortifications between the Tennessee River and Owl Creek, and clearing fields of fire, they spent most of their time drilling the largely inexperienced troops while Sherman dismissed reports of nearby Confederates.

Union inaction created the opportunity for the Confederates to attack first before Buell arrived. On the morning of April 6, 1862, Grant's troops were taken by surprise when the Confederates, led by Generals <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a> and <a href="P.G.T.%20Beauregard">P.G.T. Beauregard</a>, struck first "like an Alpine avalanche" near Shiloh church, attacking five divisions of Grant's army and forcing a confused retreat toward the Tennessee River. Johnston was wounded and died and command fell upon Beauregard. One Union line held the Confederate attack off for several hours at a place later called the "Hornet's Nest", giving Grant time to assemble artillery and 20,000 troops near Pittsburg Landing. The Confederates finally broke through the Hornet's Nest to capture a Union division, but "Grant's Last Line" held Pittsburg Landing, while the exhausted Confederates, lacking reinforcements, halted their advance. The day's fighting had been costly, with thousands of troops killed and wounded. That evening, heavy rain set in. <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">Sherman</a> found Grant standing alone under a tree in the rain. "Well, Grant, we've had the devil's own day of it, haven't we?" Sherman said. "Yes," replied Grant. "Lick 'em tomorrow, though."

Bolstered by 18,000 fresh troops from the divisions of Major Generals Buell and <a href="Lew%20Wallace">Lew Wallace</a>, Grant counterattacked at dawn the next day and regained the field, forcing the disorganized and demoralized rebels to retreat back to Corinth while thousands deserted. Halleck ordered Grant not to advance more than one day from Pittsburg Landing, stopping the pursuit of the Confederate Army. Although Grant had won the battle the situation was little changed, with the Union in possession of Pittsburg Landing and the Confederates once again holed up in Corinth. Grant, now realizing that the South was determined to fight and that the war would not be won with one battle, would later write, "Then, indeed, I gave up all idea of saving the Union except by complete conquest."

Shiloh was the costliest battle in American history to that point and the staggering 23,746 total casualties stunned the nation. Briefly hailed a hero for routing the Confederates, Grant was soon mired in controversy. The Northern press castigated Grant for shockingly high casualties, and accused him of drunkenness during the battle, contrary to the accounts of officers and others with him at the time. However, Grant's victory at Shiloh ended any chance for the Confederates to prevail in the Mississippi valley or regain its strategic advantage in the West.

Halleck arrived from St. Louis on April 11, took command, and assembled a combined army of about 120,000 men. On April 29, 1862, he relieved Grant of field command and replaced him with Major General <a href="George%20Henry%20Thomas">George Henry Thomas</a>. Halleck slowly marched his army to take Corinth, entrenching each night. Meanwhile, Beauregard pretended to be reinforcing, sent "deserters" to the Union Army with that story, and moved his army out during the night, to Halleck's surprise when he finally <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Corinth">arrived at Corinth</a> on May 30. Discouraged, Grant considered resigning but Sherman convinced him to stay. Lincoln dismissed Grant's critics, saying "I can't spare this man; he fights." Halleck divided his combined army and reinstated Grant as field commander of the Army of the Tennessee on July 11.

On September 19, 1862, Grant's army defeated Confederates at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iuka">Battle of Iuka</a>, then successfully <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Corinth">defended Corinth</a>, inflicting heavy casualties. On October 25, Grant assumed command of the District of the Tennessee. In November, after Lincoln's preliminary <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, Grant ordered units under his command to incorporate former slaves into the Union Army, giving them clothes, shelter and wages for their services.

The Confederate stronghold of <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>, blocked the way of Union control of the Mississippi River, making its capture vital. Grant's Army held western Tennessee with almost 40,000 troops available to fight. Grant was aggravated to learn that Lincoln authorized McClernand to raise a separate army for the purpose. Halleck ordered McClernand to <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a>, and placed him and his troops under Grant's authority. After Grant's army captured <a href="Holly%20Springs%2C%20Mississippi">Holly Springs</a>, Grant planned to attack Vicksburg's front overland while Sherman would attack the fortress from the rear on the Mississippi River. However, Confederate cavalry raids on December 11 and 20, 1862, broke Union communications and recaptured Holly Springs, preventing the armies of Grant and Sherman from connecting. On December 29, a Confederate army led by <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Lieutenant General</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Pemberton">John C. Pemberton</a> repulsed Sherman's direct approach ascending the bluffs to Vicksburg at <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickasaw%20Bayou">Chickasaw Bayou</a>. McClernand reached Sherman's army, assumed command, and independently of Grant led a campaign that captured Confederate <a href="Battle%20of%20Arkansas%20Post">Fort Hindman</a>. During this time, Grant incorporated fleeing <a href="African%20American">African American</a> slaves into the Union Army giving them protection and paid employment.

Along with his military responsibilities in the months following Grant's return to command, he was concerned over an expanding illicit cotton trade in his district. He believed the trade undermined the Union war effort, funded the Confederacy, and prolonged the war, while Union soldiers died in the fields. Grant's own father, together with some Jewish partners, the Mack Brothers, attempted to gain access to this lucrative trade through Grant. On December 17, 1862, Grant issued <a href="General%20Order%20No.%2011%20%281862%29">General Order No. 11</a>, expelling "Jews, as a class", from the district, saying that Jewish merchants were violating trade regulations. The Northern press strongly condemned Grant's <a href="anti-semitism">anti-semitism</a>, while Jewish leaders complained to Lincoln. Lincoln demanded the order be revoked and Grant rescinded it within three weeks.

On January 29, 1863, Grant assumed overall command and attempted to advance his army through water-logged terrain to bypass Vicksburg's guns, while the green Union soldiers gained valuable experience. On April 16, Grant ordered Admiral <a href="David%20Dixon%20Porter">David Dixon Porter</a>'s gunboats south under fire from the Vicksburg batteries to meet up with his troops who had marched south down the west side of the Mississippi River. Grant ordered diversionary battles, confusing Pemberton and allowing Grant's army to move east across the Mississippi, landing troops at <a href="Bruinsburg%2C%20Mississippi">Bruinsburg</a>. Grant's army <a href="Battle%20of%20Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">captured Jackson</a>, the state capital. Advancing his army to Vicksburg, Grant defeated Pemberton's army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Champion%20Hill">Battle of Champion Hill</a> on May 16, forcing their retreat into Vicksburg. After Grant's men assaulted the entrenchments twice, suffering severe losses, they settled in for <a href="Siege%20of%20Vicksburg">a siege lasting seven weeks</a>. During quiet periods of the campaign Grant would take to drinking on occasion. The personal rivalry between McClernand and Grant continued until Grant removed McClernand from command when he contravened Grant by publishing an order without permission. Pemberton surrendered Vicksburg to Grant on July 4, 1863.

Vicksburg's fall gave Union forces control of the Mississippi River and split the Confederacy. By that time, Grant's political sympathies fully coincided with the <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a>' aggressive prosecution of the war and emancipation of the slaves. The success at Vicksburg was a morale boost for the Union war effort. When <a href="Secretary%20of%20War">Secretary of War</a> <a href="Edwin%20M.%20Stanton">Edwin M. Stanton</a> suggested Grant be brought back east to run the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a>, Grant demurred, writing that he knew the geography and resources of the West better and he did not want to upset the chain of command in the East.

Lincoln promoted Grant to major general in the regular army and assigned him command of the newly formed <a href="Military%20Division%20of%20the%20Mississippi">Division of the Mississippi</a> on October 16, 1863, including the Armies of the <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Ohio">Ohio</a>, Tennessee, and <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Cumberland">Cumberland</a>. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a>, the Army of the Cumberland retreated into Chattanooga where they became trapped. Taking command, Grant arrived in Chattanooga by horseback with plans to resupply the city and break the siege. Lincoln also sent Major General <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> to assist Grant. Union forces captured Brown's Ferry and opened a supply line to Bridgeport. On November 23, Grant organized three armies to attack at <a href="Battle%20of%20Missionary%20Ridge">Missionary Ridge</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Lookout%20Mountain">Lookout Mountain</a>. Two days later, Hooker's forces took Lookout Mountain. Grant ordered Major General <a href="George%20Henry%20Thomas">George Henry Thomas</a> to advance when Sherman's army failed to take Missionary Ridge from the northeast. The Army of the Cumberland, led by Major General <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a> and Brigadier General <a href="Thomas%20J.%20Wood">Thomas J. Wood</a>, charged uphill and captured the Confederate entrenchments at the top, forcing a retreat. The decisive battle gave the Union control of Tennessee and opened <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, the Confederate heartland, to Union invasion. Grant was given an enormous <a href="thoroughbred">thoroughbred</a> horse, <a href="Cincinnati%20%28horse%29">"Cincinnati"</a>, by a thankful admirer in St. Louis.

On March 2, 1864, Lincoln promoted Grant to lieutenant general, giving him command of all Union Armies, answering only to the president. Grant arrived in Washington on March 8, and he was formally commissioned by Lincoln the next day at a Cabinet meeting. Grant developed a good working relationship with Lincoln, who allowed Grant to devise his own strategy as long as Lee was defeated. Grant established his headquarters with General <a href="George%20Meade">George Meade</a>'s Army of the Potomac in <a href="Culpeper%2C%20Virginia">Culpeper</a>, north-west of Richmond, and met weekly with Lincoln and Stanton in Washington. After protest from Halleck, Grant scrapped a risky invasion plan of North Carolina, and adopted a plan of five coordinated Union offensives on five fronts, so Confederate armies could not shift troops along interior lines. Grant and Meade would make a direct frontal attack on <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>, while Sherman, whom Grant named chief of the western armies, was to destroy <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>'s <a href="Army%20of%20Tennessee">Army of Tennessee</a> and take Atlanta. Major General <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Butler</a> would advance on Lee from the southeast, up the <a href="James%20River">James River</a>, while Major General <a href="Nathaniel%20Banks">Nathaniel Banks</a> would capture <a href="Battle%20of%20Mobile%20Bay">Mobile</a>. Major General <a href="Franz%20Sigel">Franz Sigel</a> was to capture granaries and rail lines in the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a> that supplied the Confederate Army. Grant commanded in total 533,000 battle-ready troops spread out over an eighteen-mile front, while the Confederates had lost many officers in battle and had great difficulty finding replacements.

Grant's own popularity had risen, and there was talk that a Union victory early in the year could lead to his candidacy for the presidency. He was aware of the rumors, but had ruled out a political candidacy; the possibility would soon vanish with delays on the battlefield.

The Overland Campaign was a series of brutal battles fought in Virginia for seven weeks during May and June 1864. Sigel's and Butler's efforts failed, and Grant was left alone to fight Lee. On the morning of Wednesday, May 4, dressed in his full uniform, with sword at his side, Grant rode out from his headquarters at <a href="Culpeper%2C%20Virginia">Culpeper</a> towards Germanna Ford, mounted on his war horse, "Cincinnati". That day Grant crossed the <a href="Rapidan%20River">Rapidan</a> unopposed, while supplies were transported on four pontoon bridges. On May 5, the Union army attacked Lee in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Wilderness">Wilderness</a>, a three-day battle with estimated casualties of 17,666 Union and 11,125 Confederate. Rather than retreat, Grant flanked Lee's army to the southeast and attempted to wedge his forces between Lee and Richmond at <a href="Battle%20of%20Spotsylvania%20Court%20House">Spotsylvania Court House</a>. Lee's army got to Spotsylvania first and a costly battle ensued, lasting thirteen days, with high casualties. On May 12, Grant attempted to break through Lee's "Muleshoe" salient guarded by Confederate artillery, resulting in one of the bloodiest assaults of the Civil War, known as <a href="The%20Bloody%20Angle%20%28Spotsylvania%29">the Bloody Angle</a>. Unable to break Lee's lines, Grant again flanked the rebels to the southeast, meeting at <a href="Battle%20of%20North%20Anna">North Anna</a>, where a battle lasted three days.

Grant maneuvered his army to <a href="Battle%20of%20Cold%20Harbor">Cold Harbor</a>, a vital railroad hub that linked to Richmond, but Lee's men had the defensive advantage and were already entrenched. On the third day of the thirteen-day battle, Grant led a costly assault and was soon castigated as "the Butcher" by the Northern press after taking 52,788 Union casualties; Lee's Confederate army suffered 32,907 casualties, but he was less able to replace them. This battle was the second of two that Grant later said he regretted (the other being his initial assault on Vicksburg). Undetected by Lee, Grant moved his army south of the James River, freed Butler from <a href="Bermuda%20Hundred%20Campaign">the Bermuda Hundred</a>, and advanced toward <a href="Petersburg%2C%20Virginia">Petersburg</a>, Virginia's central railroad hub.
After crossing the James, Grant arrived at <a href="Siege%20of%20Petersburg">Petersburg</a>, threatening nearby Richmond. Beauregard defended the city, and Lee's veteran reinforcements soon arrived, resulting in a nine-month siege. Northern resentment grew as the war dragged on. Lee was forced to defend Richmond, unable to reinforce other Confederate forces. Sheridan was assigned command of the <a href="Union%20Army%20of%20the%20Shenandoah">Union Army of the Shenandoah</a> and Grant directed him to "follow the enemy to their death" and to destroy vital Confederate supplies in the Shenandoah Valley. When Sheridan reported suffering attacks by <a href="John%20S.%20Mosby">John S. Mosby</a>'s irregular Confederate cavalry, Grant recommended rounding up their families for imprisonment as hostages at <a href="Fort%20McHenry">Fort McHenry</a>. After Grant's abortive attempt to capture Petersburg, Lincoln supported Grant in his decision to continue. Because of the high casualties, Lincoln arrived at Grant's headquarters at City Point on June 21 to assess the state of Grant's army, meeting with Grant and Admiral Porter. By the time Lincoln departed his appreciation for Grant had grown.

At Petersburg, Grant approved a plan to <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Crater">blow up</a> part of the enemy trenches from an underground tunnel. The explosion created a crater, into which poorly led Union troops poured. Recovering from the surprise, Confederates surrounded the crater and easily picked off Union troops within it. The Union's 3,500 casualties outnumbered the Confederates' by three-to-one; although the plan could have been successful if implemented correctly, Grant admitted the tactic had been a "stupendous failure". Rather than fight Lee in a full frontal attack as he had done at Cold Harbor, Grant continued to extend Lee's defenses south and west of Petersburg to capture essential railroad links.

After the Federal army rebuilt the <a href="City%20Point%20Railroad">City Point Railroad</a>, Grant used mortars to attack Lee's overstretched forces. Union forces soon captured <a href="Battle%20of%20Mobile%20Bay">Mobile Bay</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and now controlled the Shenandoah Valley, ensuring Lincoln's reelection in November. Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln to send his army to <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">march on Savannah</a> and devastate the Confederate heartland. Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction of Southern infrastructure unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22. On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed Hood's Confederate Army at <a href="Battle%20of%20Nashville">Nashville</a>. It was the beginning of the end for the Confederacy, with Lee's forces at Petersburg being the only significant obstacle remaining.

By March 1865, Grant had severely weakened Lee's strength, having extended his lines to 35 miles. Lee's troops deserted by the thousands due to hunger and the strains of trench warfare. Grant, Sherman, Porter, and Lincoln held a conference to discuss the surrender of Confederate armies and <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> of the South on March 28.

On April 2, Grant ordered a general assault on Lee's entrenched forces. Union troops took Petersburg and captured an evacuated <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a> the following day. Lee and part of his army broke free and attempted to link up with the remnants of <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>'s defeated army, but Sheridan's cavalry stopped the two armies from converging, cutting them off from their supply trains. Grant was in communication with Lee before he entrusted his aide <a href="Orville%20Babcock">Orville Babcock</a> to carry his last dispatch to Lee requesting his surrender with instructions to escort him to a meeting place of Lee's choosing. Grant immediately mounted his horse, "Cincinnati", and rode west, bypassing Lee's army, to join Sheridan who had captured Appomattox Station, blocking Lee's escape route. On his way Grant was hailed by a member of Meade's staff carrying a letter sent by Lee through the picket lines, informing Grant that he was ready to formally surrender.

On April 9, Grant and Lee met at <a href="Appomattox%20Court%20House%20National%20Historical%20Park">Appomattox Court House</a>. Upon receiving Lee's dispatch about the proposed meeting Grant had been jubilant. Although Grant felt depressed at the fall of "a foe who had fought so long and valiantly," he believed the Southern cause was "one of the worst for which a people ever fought." After briefly discussing their days of old in Mexico, Grant wrote out the terms of surrender, whereupon Lee expressed satisfaction and accepted Grant's terms. Going beyond his military authority, Grant gave Lee and his men amnesty; Confederates would surrender their weapons and return to their homes. At Lee's request, Grant also allowed them to keep their horses, all on the condition that they would not take up arms against the United States. Grant ordered his troops to stop all celebration, saying the "war is over; the rebels are our countrymen again." Confederate forces surrendered to Union forces, and the war ended on May 9, 1865.

On April 14, 1865, five days after Grant's victory at Appomattox, he attended a cabinet meeting in Washington. Lincoln invited him and his wife to <a href="Ford%27s%20Theater">Ford's Theater</a>, but they declined as upon his wife Julia's urging, had plans to travel to Philadelphia. In a conspiracy that also targeted top cabinet members, and in one last effort to topple the Union, Lincoln was fatally shot by <a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> at the theater, and died the next morning. Many, including Grant himself, thought that he had been a target in the plot. Stanton notified him of the President's death and summoned him back to Washington. Vice President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> was <a href="Inauguration%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">sworn in</a> as President on April 15. Attending Lincoln's funeral on April 19, Grant stood alone and wept openly; he later said Lincoln was "the greatest man I have ever known." Upon Johnson's assumption of the presidency, Grant told Julia that he dreaded the change in administrations; he judged Johnson's attitude toward white southerners as one that would "make them unwilling citizens", and feared that the Civil War would be revived.

At the war's end, Grant remained commander of the army, with duties that included dealing with <a href="Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico">Maximilian</a> and French troops in Mexico, enforcement of Reconstruction in the former Confederate states, and supervision of Indian wars on the western Plains. Grant secured a house for his family in Georgetown Heights in 1865, but instructed Elihu Washburne that for political purposes his legal residence remained in Galena, Illinois. That same year, Grant spoke at <a href="Cooper%20Union">Cooper Union</a> in New York in support of Johnson's presidency. Further travels that summer took the Grants to <a href="Albany%2C%20New%20York">Albany, New York</a>, back to Galena, and throughout Illinois and Ohio, with enthusiastic receptions. On July 25, 1866, Congress promoted Grant to the newly created rank of <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20of%20the%20United%20States">General of the Army of the United States</a>.

Reconstruction was a turbulent period from 1863 to 1877 when former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union, and fierce controversy arose over the status of both the defeated Confederates and the newly freed ex-slaves. In November 1865, Johnson sent Grant on a fact-finding mission to the South. Grant recommended continuation of the <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a>, which Johnson opposed, but advised against using black troops, which he believed encouraged an alternative to farm labor. Grant did not believe the people of the South were ready for self-rule, and that both whites and blacks in the South required protection by the federal government. Concerned that the war led to diminished respect for civil authorities, Grant continued using the Army to maintain order. On the same day, the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a> was ratified, Grant filed an unconvincing and optimistic report of his tour, expressing his faith that "the mass of thinking men of the South accept the present situation of affairs in good faith." Grant later disavowed the report. In this respect Grant's opinion on Reconstruction aligned with Johnson's policy of restoring former Confederates to their positions of power, arguing that Congress should allow representatives from the South to take their seats. Grant believed the federal government was responsible to all Union Army veterans who served in the war, both white and black.

Grant was initially optimistic about Johnson, saying he was satisfied the nation had "nothing to fear" from the Johnson administration. Despite differing styles, Grant got along cordially with Johnson, and he was allowed to attend cabinet meetings concerning Reconstruction. By February 1866, the relationship between Grant and Johnson began to break apart. Johnson opposed Grant's closure of the "<a href="Richmond%20Examiner">Richmond Examiner</a>" for disloyal editorials. Grant's team of commanders enforced the landmark <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201866">Civil Rights Act of 1866</a>, passed over Johnson's veto. Needing Grant's popularity, Johnson took Grant on his "<a href="Swing%20Around%20the%20Circle">Swing Around the Circle</a>" tour, a failed attempt to gain national support for lenient policies toward the South. Grant privately called Johnson's speeches a "national disgrace" and he left the tour early. On March 2, 1867, overriding Johnson's veto, Congress passed the first of three <a href="Reconstruction%20Acts">Reconstruction Acts</a>, which divided the southern states into five military districts, putting in charge military officers to enforce Reconstruction policy. Protecting Grant, Congress passed the Command of the Army Act, attached to an army appropriation bill, preventing his removal or relocation, and forcing Johnson to pass orders through Grant.

In August 1867, Johnson suspended Secretary of War <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a>, a Lincoln appointee who sympathized with Congressional Reconstruction, replacing him with Grant as acting Secretary. Stanton was a Radical Republican protected by allies in Congress. Grant wanted to replace him but recommended against bypassing the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281867%29">Tenure of Office Act</a>, prohibiting a cabinet removal without Senate approval. Grant accepted the position, not wanting the Army to fall under a conservative appointee who would impede Reconstruction, and managed an uneasy partnership with Johnson. In December 1867, Congress voted to keep Stanton, who was reinstated by a Senate Committee on Friday, January 10, 1868. Grant told Johnson he was going to resign office to avoid fines and imprisonment. Johnson said he would assume Grant's legal responsibility, and reminded Grant that he had promised him to delay his resignation until a suitable replacement was found. On Monday, January 13, Grant immediately surrendered the office to Stanton. Johnson was livid and accused Grant of lying at a stormy cabinet meeting. The publication of angry messages between Grant and Johnson led to a complete break between the president and his general. The controversy led to Johnson's <a href="impeachment">impeachment</a> and trial in the Senate. Johnson was saved from removal from office by one vote. Grant's popularity rose among the Radical Republicans and his nomination for the presidency appeared certain.

When the Republican Party met at the <a href="1868%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1868 Republican National Convention</a> in Chicago, the delegates unanimously nominated Grant for president and Speaker of the House <a href="Schuyler%20Colfax">Schuyler Colfax</a> for vice president. Although Grant had preferred to remain in the army, he accepted the Republican nomination, believing that he was the only one who could unify the nation. The Republicans advocated "equal civil and political rights to all" and <a href="African%20American">African American</a> enfranchisement. The Democrats, having abandoned Johnson, nominated former governor <a href="Horatio%20Seymour">Horatio Seymour</a> (New York) for president and <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair%20Jr.">Francis P. Blair</a> (Missouri) for vice president. The Democrats advocated the immediate restoration of former Confederate states to the Union and amnesty from "all past political offenses".

Grant played no overt role during the campaign and instead was joined by Sherman and Sheridan in a tour of the West that summer. However, the Republicans adopted his words "Let us have peace" as their campaign slogan. Grant's 1862 <a href="General%20Order%20No.%2011%20%281862%29">General Order No. 11</a> became an issue during the <a href="U.S.%20presidential%20election%2C%201868">presidential campaign</a>; he sought to distance himself from the order, saying "I have no prejudice against sect or race, but want each individual to be judged by his own merit." The Democrats and their Klan supporters focused mainly on ending Reconstruction and returning control of the South to the white Democrats and the planter class, which alienated many <a href="War%20Democrats">War Democrats</a> in the North. To intimidate blacks from voting Republican, the Klan, led by former Confederate general <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>, used violence and intimidation across the South in three states: Kansas, Georgia, and Louisiana. Grant won the popular vote by 300,000 votes out of 5,716,082 votes cast, receiving an <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a> landslide of 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Seymour received a majority of white votes, but Grant was aided by 500,000 votes cast by blacks, winning him 52.7 percent of the popular vote. At the age of 46, Grant was the youngest president yet elected, and the first president after the nation had outlawed slavery.

On March 4, 1869, Grant was sworn in as the eighteenth President of the United States by Chief Justice <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a>. In his inaugural address, Grant urged the ratification of the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a>, while large numbers of African Americans attended his inauguration. He also urged that bonds issued during the Civil War should be paid in gold and called for reform in Indian Policy while he recommended the "proper treatment" of <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a> and encouraged their "civilization and ultimate citizenship".

Grant's <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%23Cabinet">cabinet appointments</a> sparked both criticism and approval. Grant appointed <a href="Elihu%20B.%20Washburne">Elihu B. Washburne</a> Secretary of State and <a href="John%20A.%20Rawlins">John A. Rawlins</a> Secretary of War. Washburne resigned, and Grant appointed him Minister to France. Grant then appointed former New York Senator <a href="Hamilton%20Fish">Hamilton Fish</a> Secretary of State. Rawlins died in office, and Grant appointed <a href="William%20W.%20Belknap">William W. Belknap</a> of <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> Secretary of War. Grant appointed New York businessman <a href="Alexander%20T.%20Stewart">Alexander T. Stewart</a> Secretary of Treasury, but Stewart was found legally ineligible to hold office by a 1789 law. Grant then appointed Massachusetts Representative <a href="George%20S.%20Boutwell">George S. Boutwell</a> Secretary of Treasury. Philadelphia businessman <a href="Adolph%20E.%20Borie">Adolph E. Borie</a> was appointed Secretary of Navy, but he found the job stressful and resigned. Grant then appointed New Jersey's attorney general <a href="George%20M.%20Robeson">George M. Robeson</a> Secretary of Navy. Grant appointed: former Ohio Governor <a href="Jacob%20D.%20Cox">Jacob D. Cox</a> Secretary of Interior, former Maryland Senator <a href="John%20Creswell">John Creswell</a> Postmaster-General, and <a href="Ebenezer%20Rockwood%20Hoar">Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar</a> Attorney General.
Grant nominated Sherman his Army successor as general-in-chief and gave him control over war bureau chiefs. When Rawlins took over the War Department, he complained to Grant that Sherman was given too much authority. Grant reluctantly revoked his own order, upsetting Sherman and damaging their wartime friendship. Grant's nomination of <a href="James%20Longstreet">James Longstreet</a>, a former Confederate general, to the position of Surveyor of Customs of the port of New Orleans, was met with general amazement, and was largely seen as a genuine effort to unite the North and South.

Grant, while president, very much regretted his wartime order expelling Jewish traders, and set out to make amends. Historian <a href="Jonathan%20Sarna">Jonathan Sarna</a> said Grant was eager to prove he was above racism, while he "appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and, in the name of human rights, he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania."

When Grant took office in 1869, <a href="Reconstruction%20Era">Reconstruction</a> took precedence, Republicans controlled most Southern states, propped up by Republican controlled Congress, northern money, and southern military occupation. Grant advocated in his inaugural address the ratification of the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a> that declared the right to vote for <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a>. Unlike Johnson, Grant's vision of Reconstruction included federal enforcement of civil rights and spoke out against voter intimidation of Southern blacks. Within a year, three remaining former Confederate states—<a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, and <a href="Texas">Texas</a>—were admitted to Congress, having complied with Congressional Reconstruction Acts and adopted the Fifteenth Amendment. Supported by Congress, Grant put military pressure on <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, the last remaining former Confederate state, to reinstate its black legislators and adopt the new amendment. Georgia complied, and on February 24, 1871 its Senators were seated in Congress. Southern Reconstructed states were controlled by <a href="carpetbaggers">carpetbaggers</a>, <a href="scalawags">scalawags</a> and former slaves. The <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a> terrorist group, however, continued to undermine Reconstruction by violence and intimidation.

Grant, in 1870, signed legislation creating the <a href="United%20States%20Justice%20Department">Justice Department</a>. He employed it to enforce the Reconstruction efforts in the South. On March 23, 1871, Grant asked Congress for legislation, passed on April 20, known as the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan%20Act">Ku Klux Klan Act</a>, that authorized the president to impose <a href="martial%20law">martial law</a> and suspend the writ of "<a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>". By October, Grant suspended "habeas corpus" in part of South Carolina and sent federal troops to help marshals, who initiated prosecutions. Grant's new Attorney General, <a href="Amos%20T.%20Akerman">Amos T. Akerman</a>, a former Confederate officer and now zealous civil rights attorney from Georgia, replaced Hoar. Bolstered by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">Department of Justice</a> and Solicitor General, he made hundreds of arrests while forcing 2,000 Klansmen to flee the state. Akerman returned over 3,000 indictments of the Klan throughout the South and obtained 600 convictions for the worst offenders. By 1872 the Klan's power had collapsed, and African Americans voted in record numbers in elections in the South. That same year, Grant signed the <a href="Amnesty%20Act">Amnesty Act</a>, which restored political rights to former Confederates. Lacking sufficient funding, the Justice Department stopped prosecutions of the Klan by June 1873. Civil rights prosecutions continued but with fewer yearly cases and convictions. Grant's Postmaster General <a href="John%20Creswell">John Creswell</a> used his patronage powers to integrate the postal system and appointed a record number of African American men and women as postal workers across the nation, while also expanding many of the mail routes. Grant appointed Republican abolitionist and champion of black education <a href="Hugh%20Lennox%20Bond">Hugh Lennox Bond</a> as U.S. Circuit Court judge.

After the Klan's decline, a faction of southern conservatives called "<a href="Redeemers">Redeemers</a>" formed armed groups, such as the <a href="Red%20Shirts%20%28Southern%20United%20States%29">Red Shirts</a> and the <a href="White%20League">White League</a>, who openly used violence, intimidation, voter fraud, and racist appeals in an attempt to take control of state governments. The <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a> and the ensuing depression contributed to public fatigue, and the North grew less concerned with Reconstruction. Supreme Court rulings in the "<a href="Slaughter-House%20Cases">Slaughter-House Cases</a>" and "<a href="United%20States%20v.%20Cruikshank">United States v. Cruikshank</a>" restricted federal enforcement of civil rights. In 1874, Grant ended the <a href="Brooks%E2%80%93Baxter%20War">Brooks–Baxter War</a>, bringing Reconstruction in <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> to a peaceful conclusion. That same year, he sent troops and warships under Major General <a href="William%20H.%20Emory">William H. Emory</a> to New Orleans in the wake of the <a href="Colfax%20massacre">Colfax massacre</a> and disputes over the election of Governor <a href="William%20Pitt%20Kellogg">William Pitt Kellogg</a>. Grant recalled Sheridan and most of the federal troops from Louisiana.

By 1875, Redeemer Democrats had taken control of all but three Southern states. As violence against black Southerners escalated once more, Attorney General <a href="Edwards%20Pierrepont">Edwards Pierrepont</a> told Governor <a href="Adelbert%20Ames">Adelbert Ames</a> of Mississippi that the people were "tired of the autumnal outbreaks in the South", and declined to intervene directly, instead sending an emissary to negotiate a peaceful election. Grant later regretted not issuing a proclamation to help Ames, having been told Republicans in Ohio would bolt the party if Grant intervened in Mississippi. Grant told Congress in January 1875 he could not "see with indifference Union men or Republicans ostracized, persecuted, and murdered." Congress refused to strengthen the laws against violence, but instead passed a sweeping law to guarantee blacks access to public facilities. Grant signed it as the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201875">Civil Rights Act of 1875</a>, but enforcement was weak and the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional in 1883. In October 1876, Grant dispatched troops to South Carolina to aid Republican Governor <a href="Daniel%20Henry%20Chamberlain">Daniel Henry Chamberlain</a>. Grant's successor, <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a>, abandoned the remaining three Republican governments in the South that were supported by the army after the <a href="Compromise%20of%201877">Compromise of 1877</a>, which marked the end of Reconstruction.

In 1875, Grant proposed measures to limit religious roles in public schools. Grant laid out his agenda for "good common school education." He attacked government support for "sectarian schools" run by religious organizations, and called for the defense of public education "unmixed with sectarian, pagan or atheistical dogmas." Grant declared that "Church and State" should be "forever separate." Religion, he said, should be left to families, churches, and private schools devoid of public funds. His views were incorporated into the <a href="Blaine%20Amendment">Blaine Amendment</a>. That amendment did not become federal law but many states adopted versions. Historian <a href="Tyler%20Anbinder">Tyler Anbinder</a> says, "Grant was not an obsessive nativist. He expressed his resentment of immigrants and animus toward Catholicism only rarely. But these sentiments reveal themselves frequently enough in his writings and major actions as general...In the 1850s he joined a Know Nothing lodge and irrationally blamed immigrants for setbacks in his career."

When Grant took office in 1869, the nation's policy towards Indians was in chaos, with more than 250,000 Indians being governed by 370 treaties. He appointed <a href="Ely%20S.%20Parker">Ely S. Parker</a>, a <a href="Seneca%20people">Seneca</a> Indian, a member of his wartime staff, as <a href="Bureau%20of%20Indian%20Affairs">Commissioner of Indian Affairs</a>, the first Native American to serve in this position, surprising many around him. In April 1869, Grant signed a law establishing an unpaid <a href="Board%20of%20Indian%20Commissioners">Board of Indian Commissioners</a> to reduce corruption and oversee implementation of Indian policy, based on the appointment of Quakers as Indian agents. In 1871, he signed a bill ending the Indian treaty system; the law now treated individual Native Americans as <a href="ward%20%28law%29">wards</a> of the federal government, and no longer dealt with the tribes as sovereign entities. Parker's resignation in 1871 undermined the peace policy, as did denominational infighting and entrenched economic interests, while Indians refused to adopt <a href="European%20American">European American</a> culture.

On October 1, 1872, General <a href="Oliver%20Otis%20Howard">Oliver Otis Howard</a> successfully negotiated peace with <a href="Apache">Apache</a> leader, <a href="Cochise">Cochise</a>, who waged guerrilla war against the army and settlers, to move the tribe to a new reservation. On April 11, 1873, General <a href="Edward%20Canby">Edward Canby</a>, was killed in Northern California south of <a href="Tule%20Lake">Tule Lake</a> by <a href="Modoc%20people">Modoc</a> leader <a href="Kintpuash">Kintpuash</a>, in a failed peace conference to end the <a href="Modoc%20War">Modoc War</a>, shocking the nation. Grant ordered restraint after Canby's death, the army captured Kintpuash, who was convicted of Canby's murder and hanged on October 3 at <a href="Fort%20Klamath">Fort Klamath</a>, while the remaining Modoc tribe was relocated to the <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a>. In 1874, the army defeated the <a href="Comanche">Comanche</a> Indians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Palo%20Duro%20Canyon">Battle of Palo Duro Canyon</a>. Their villages were burned and horses slaughtered, eventually forcing them to finally settle at the <a href="Fort%20Sill">Fort Sill</a> reservation in 1875. Grant pocket-vetoed a bill in 1874 protecting bison and supporting Interior Secretary <a href="Columbus%20Delano">Columbus Delano</a>, who believed correctly the killing of bison would force Plains Indians to abandon their nomadic lifestyle.

After discovery of <a href="Black%20Hills%20Gold%20Rush">gold in the Black Hills</a>, miners encroached on Sioux land guaranteed under the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Laramie%20%281868%29">Fort Laramie treaty</a>. Grant believed he could not keep the miners out, so he offered the Sioux $6,000,000 for their sacred lands in October 1874; <a href="Red%20Cloud">Red Cloud</a> reluctantly entered negotiations, but other Sioux chiefs readied for war. On November 3, 1875, Grant held a meeting at the White House and, under advice from Sheridan, Grant agreed not to enforce keeping out miners from the Black Hills, and to force "hostile" Indians onto the Sioux reservation. During the <a href="Great%20Sioux%20War%20of%201876">Great Sioux War</a> that started after <a href="Sitting%20Bull">Sitting Bull</a> refused to relocate to agency land, warriors led by <a href="Crazy%20Horse">Crazy Horse</a> killed <a href="George%20Armstrong%20Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a> and his men at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Little%20Big%20Horn">Battle of the Little Big Horn</a>, the army's most famous defeat in the Indian wars. Later, Grant castigated Custer in the press, saying "I regard Custer's massacre as a sacrifice of troops, brought on by Custer himself, that was wholly unnecessary – wholly unnecessary." In September and October 1876, Grant convinced the tribes to relinquish the Black Hills. Congress ratified the agreement three days before Grant left office in 1877.

Grant's most pressing diplomatic problem when he took office in 1869 was the settlement of the <a href="Alabama%20Claims">"Alabama" claims</a>, depredations primarily caused to the Union by the , a British ship secretly purchased by the Confederacy. Senator <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a>, Chairman of the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Relations">Senate Foreign Relations Committee</a>, believed the British had violated American neutrality and demanded reparations, including the acquisition of Canada. Secretary of State Hamilton Fish and Treasurer George Boutwell convinced Grant that peaceful relations with Britain were more important, and the two nations agreed to negotiate along those lines. To avoid jeopardizing negotiations, Grant refrained from recognizing Cuban rebels who were fighting for independence from Spain, which would have been inconsistent with American objections to the British granting belligerent status to Confederates. A commission in Washington produced a treaty whereby an international tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, but not fault. The Senate approved the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Washington%20%281871%29">Treaty of Washington</a>, which settled disputes over fishing rights and maritime boundaries, by a 50–12 vote, signed on May 8, 1871.
Grant's foreign policy had an expansionist drive not uncommon for his times. In early April 1869, Joseph W. Fabens met with Fish and proposed annexation of the <a href="Dominican%20Republic">Dominican Republic</a>. On April 6, Fish brought up Fabens' proposal at a cabinet meeting, but Grant's cabinet showed no interest. On July 17, Grant sent Babcock to Santo Domingo with instructions by Fish to report on the nation's resources and local conditions, but was given no diplomatic authority. Grant told Babcock to assess President <a href="Buenaventura%20B%C3%A1ez">Buenaventura Báez</a> terms for annexation. In mid-September, Babcock returned to Washington with an generous annexation treaty proposal, which Grant endorsed at a cabinet meeting. Believing annexation would strengthen American strategic power in the Caribbean, and serve as a safe haven for Freedmen, Grant ordered Fish to draw up formal treaties, completed on October 19. In November, Babcock returned to Santo Domingo, and President Báez signed the treaties. 

On December 31, Grant met with Sumner to gain his support for annexation. Grant was confident he had Sumner's approval, but he was wrong; the episode led to hostility between the two men. On January 10, 1870, Grant submitted the treaties to the Senate for ratification. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee rejected the treaties by a 5-to-2 vote. Grant personally lobbied senators, but despite his efforts, the Senate defeated the treaties, on June 30, by a 28–28 vote. The next day Grant fired Sumner's friend, Minister to Great Britain, <a href="John%20Lothrop%20Motley">John Lothrop Motley</a>. In January 1871, Grant signed a joint resolution to send a commission to investigate annexation. For this undertaking, he chose three neutral parties, with <a href="Fredrick%20Douglass">Fredrick Douglass</a> to head the commission. Although the commission approved its findings, the Senate remained opposed, forcing Grant to abandon further efforts. 

In October 1873, Grant's Caribbean neutrality policy was shaken when a Spanish cruiser captured a merchant ship, <a href="Virginius%20Affair">"Virginius"</a>, flying the U.S. flag, carrying supplies and men to aid the <a href="Ten%20Years%27%20War">Cuban insurrection</a>. Spanish authorities executed the prisoners, including eight American citizens, and many Americans called for war with Spain. Grant ordered U.S. Navy Squadron warships to converge on Cuba, off of <a href="Key%20West%2C%20Florida">Key West</a>, supported by the <a href="USS%20Kansas%20%281863%29">"USS" Kansas</a>. On November 27, Fish reached a diplomatic resolution in which Spain's president, <a href="Emilio%20Castelar%20y%20Ripoll">Emilio Castelar y Ripoll</a>, expressed his regret, surrendered the "Virginius" and surviving captives. A year later, Spain paid a cash indemnity of $80,000 to the families of the executed Americans. Realizing the Navy was susceptible to European naval powers, in June 1874, Secretary Robeson commissioned the reconstruction of five redesigned double-turreted <a href="Monitor%20%28warship%29">monitor</a> warships. Grant and Fish secured a <a href="Reciprocity%20Treaty%20of%201875">free trade treaty in 1875</a> with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a>, incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economic sphere.

Soon after taking office Grant took conservative steps to return the nation's currency to a more secure footing. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">Treasury</a> to issue banknotes that, unlike the rest of the currency, were not backed by gold or silver. The "<a href="United%20States%20Note">greenback</a>" notes, as they were known, were necessary to pay the unprecedented war debts, but they also caused inflation and forced gold-backed money out of circulation; Grant was determined to return the national <a href="economy">economy</a> to pre-war monetary standards. On March 18, 1869, he signed the <a href="Public%20Credit%20Act%20of%201869">Public Credit Act of 1869</a> that guaranteed bondholders would be repaid in "coin or its equivalent", while greenbacks would gradually be redeemed by the Treasury and replaced by notes backed by specie. The act committed the government to the full return of the <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> within ten years. This followed a policy of "hard currency, economy and gradual reduction of the national debt." Grant's own ideas about the economy were simple and he relied on the advice of wealthy and financially successful businessman that he courted.

In April 1869, railroad tycoons <a href="Jay%20Gould">Jay Gould</a> and <a href="James%20Fisk%20%28financier%29">Jim Fisk</a>, conspired to corner the gold market in New York, the nation's financial capital. Gould and Fisk controlled the Erie Railroad, and a high price of gold would allow foreign agriculture buyers to purchase exported crops, shipped east over the Erie's routes. Boutwell's bi-weekly policy of selling gold from the Treasury, however, kept gold artificially low. To stop the sale of Treasury gold and raise the price, Gould and Fisk built a relationship with Grant's brother-in-law, <a href="Abel%20Corbin">Abel Corbin</a>, and gained access to Grant. Assistant Treasurer <a href="Daniel%20Butterfield">Daniel Butterfield</a>, who had been appointed by Grant under influence from Corbin, was bribed by Gould $10,000. Butterfield was to send coded messages to Gould and Fisk to secretly alert them of Treasury gold sales by Boutwell. In mid-June, Gould personally lobbied Grant that a high price of gold would spur the economy and increase agriculture sales.

In July, Grant reduced the sale of Treasury gold to $2,000,000 per month and subsequent months. Fisk played a role in August in New York, having a letter from Corbin, he told Grant his gold policy would destroy the nation. By September, Grant, who was naive in matters of finance, was convinced that a low gold price would help farmers, and the sale of gold for September was not increased. On September 23, when the gold price reached , Boutwell rushed to the White House and talked with Grant. The following day, September 24, known as <a href="Black%20Friday%20%281869%29">Black Friday</a>, Grant ordered Boutwell to sell, whereupon Boutwell wired Butterfield in New York, to sell $4,000,000 in gold. The <a href="bull%20market">bull market</a> at Gould's Gold Room collapsed, the price of gold plummeted from 160 to , a <a href="bear%20market">bear market</a> panic ensued, Gould and Fisk fled for their own safety, while severe economic damages lasted months. By January 1870, the economy resumed its post-war recovery. An 1870 Congressional investigation chaired by <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> cleared Grant of profiteering, but excoriated Gould and Fisk for their manipulation of the gold market and Corbin for exploiting his personal connection to Grant.

Grant's first administration was mixed with both success and failure. His reelection was supported by Frederick Douglass, and other prominent abolitionists, and Indian reformers. In 1871, to placate reformers, Grant created the America's first <a href="Civil%20Service%20Commission">Civil Service Commission</a>, chaired by reformer <a href="George%20William%20Curtis">George William Curtis</a>. Notwithstanding, the <a href="Liberal%20Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Liberal Republicans</a>, composed of reformers, men who supported low tariffs, and those who opposed Grant's prosecution of the Klan, broke from Grant and the Republican Party. The Liberals, who personally disliked Grant, detested Grant's alliance with Senator <a href="Simon%20Cameron">Simon Cameron</a> and Senator <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a>, considered to be spoilsmen politicians.

In 1872, the Liberals nominated <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a>, a leading Republican "New York Tribune" editor and a fierce enemy of Grant, for president, and Missouri governor <a href="Benjamin%20Gratz%20Brown">B. Gratz Brown</a>, for vice president. The Liberals denounced <a href="Grantism">Grantism</a>, corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency, demanded the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, literacy tests for blacks to vote, and amnesty for Confederates. The Democrats adopted the Greeley-Brown ticket and the Liberals party platform. The opposition pushed the themes that Grant was a scandal-ridden crook and a drunkard. The Republicans nominated Grant for reelection, with Senator <a href="Henry%20Wilson">Henry Wilson</a> of Massachusetts replacing Colfax as the vice presidential nominee. The Republicans shrewdly borrowed from the Liberals party platform including "extended amnesty, lowered tariffs, and embraced civil service reform." To placate the burgeoning <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage%20in%20the%20United%20States">suffragist</a> movement, the Republicans' platform included that women's rights should be treated with "respectful consideration." To the Liberals' chagrin, Greeley made Grant's Southern policy, rather than civil service reform, the main campaign issue.

Grant won reelection easily thanks to federal prosecution of the Klan, a strong economy, debt reduction, lowered tariffs, and tax reductions. He received 3.6 million ("55.6%") votes to Greeley's 2.8 million votes and an Electoral College landslide of 286 to 66. A majority of African Americans in the South voted for Grant, while Democratic opposition remained mostly peaceful. Grant lost in six former slave states that wanted to see an end to Reconstruction. Grant proclaimed the victory as a personal vindication of his presidency, but inwardly he felt betrayed by the "Liberals". Grant was sworn in for his second term by <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> on March 4, 1873. In his second inaugural address, he reiterated the problems still facing the nation and focused on what he considered the chief issues of the day: freedom and fairness for all Americans while emphasizing the benefits of citizenship for freed slaves. Grant concluded his address with the words, "My efforts in the future will be directed towards the restoration of good feelings between the different sections of our common community". In 1873, Wilson suffered a stroke; never fully recovering, he died in office on November 22, 1875. With Wilson's loss, Grant relied on Fish's guidance more than ever.

Grant continued to work for a strong dollar, signing into law the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201873">Coinage Act of 1873</a>, which effectively ended the legal basis for <a href="bimetallism">bimetallism</a> (the use of both silver and gold as money), establishing the gold standard in practice. The Coinage Act discontinued the <a href="Seated%20Liberty%20dollar">standard silver dollar</a> and established the <a href="gold%20dollar">gold dollar</a> as the sole monetary standard; because the gold supply did not increase as quickly as the population, the result was deflation. Silverites, who wanted more money in circulation to raise the prices that farmers received, denounced the move as the "Crime of 1873", claiming the deflation made debts more burdensome for farmers.
Economic turmoil renewed during Grant's second term. In September 1873, <a href="Jay%20Cooke%20%26amp%3B%20Company">Jay Cooke & Company</a>, a New York brokerage house, collapsed after it failed to sell all of the bonds issued by <a href="Jay%20Cooke">Cooke</a>'s <a href="Northern%20Pacific%20Railway">Northern Pacific Railway</a>. The collapse rippled through Wall Street, and other banks and brokerages that owned railroad stocks and bonds were also ruined. On September 20, the <a href="New%20York%20Stock%20Exchange">New York Stock Exchange</a> suspended trading for ten days. Grant, who knew little about finance, traveled to New York to consult leading businessmen and bankers for advice on how to resolve the crisis, which became known as the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>. Grant believed that, as with the collapse of the Gold Ring in 1869, the panic was merely an economic fluctuation that affected bankers and brokers. He instructed the Treasury to buy $10 million in government bonds, injecting cash into the system. The purchases curbed the panic on Wall Street, but an industrial depression, later called the <a href="Long%20Depression">Long Depression</a>, nonetheless swept the nation. Many of the nation's railroads—89 out of 364—went bankrupt.

Congress hoped inflation would stimulate the economy and passed what became known as the "Inflation Bill" in 1874. Many farmers and workingmen favored the bill, which would have added $64 million in greenbacks to circulation, but some Eastern bankers opposed it because it would have weakened the dollar. Belknap, Williams, and Delano told Grant a veto would hurt Republicans in the November elections. Grant believed the bill would destroy the credit of the nation, and he vetoed it despite their objections. Grant's veto placed him in the conservative faction of the Republican Party and was the beginning of the party's commitment to a gold-backed dollar. Grant later pressured Congress for a bill to further strengthen the dollar by gradually reducing the number of greenbacks in circulation. When the Democrats gained a majority in the House after the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201874">1874 elections</a>, the <a href="Lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame-duck</a> Republican Congress did so before the Democrats took office. On January 14, 1875, Grant signed the <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">Specie Payment Resumption Act</a>, which required gradual reduction of the number of greenbacks allowed to circulate and declared that they would be redeemed for gold beginning on January 1, 1879.

Grant's presidency took place during massive post-war industrial growth, speculation and lifestyle extravagance, that fueled criminal behavior in government offices. Many charges of misconduct that Grant responded to involved financial corruption, while all of his executive departments were investigated by Congress. Grant often trusted wealthy men involved in <a href="speculation">speculation</a>, or wartime comrades, while he stubbornly defended cabinet members and appointees involved in corruption whom he believed innocent.

Grant's administration had limited success with civil service reform. Grant's Secretary of Interior <a href="Jacob%20D.%20Cox">Jacob D. Cox</a> fired unqualified clerks, implemented a merit testing system, and rebuffed mandatory party contributions. On October 3, 1870, Cox resigned office under pressure from Republican party bosses and a dispute with Grant over a patent claim. On March 3, 1871 Congress authorized Grant to create the <a href="United%20States%20Civil%20Service%20Commission">Civil Service Commission</a>. Grant appointed reformer <a href="George%20William%20Curtis">George William Curtis</a> to head of the Commission, that advocated competitive exams, and the end of forced political payments. The Commission's rules took effect the next year, but Department heads, assistants, and higher level officials were exempted.

In November 1871, Grant's appointed <a href="Collector%20of%20the%20Port%20of%20New%20York">New York Collector</a> <a href="Thomas%20Murphy%20%28Collector%29">Thomas Murphy</a>, an ally of <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a>, resigned from office. Murphy's men had created a corrupt profiteering ring at the <a href="United%20States%20Custom%20House%20%28New%20York%20City%29">New York Custom House</a>. Grant appointed <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, another Conkling man, to replace Murphy, and administration of the Customs House steadily improved. Pressured by an 1872 Congressional investigation, Grant ordered prosecutions of men involved in the bribery scandal and removed the ringleader. He was exonerated, but his reputation was damaged by being associated with Conkling's patronage machine. On March 3, 1873, Grant signed a bill that increased pay for federal employees. Decried as the <a href="Salary%20Grab%20Act">Salary Grab Act</a>, Congress repealed the law later that year, but Grant was allowed to keep his doubled $50,000 annual salary. By 1873, public confidence in government rule and Congress had reached its lowest ebb in an era derisively named the <a href="Gilded%20Age">Gilded Age</a>.

Scandals escalated in Grant's second term, reaching into the President's inner circle. In 1872, Grant signed into law, an act that eliminated private moiety ("tax collection") contracts, but an attached rider allowed three more contracts. Boutwell's assistant secretary <a href="William%20Adams%20Richardson">William A. Richardson</a>, hired <a href="John%20B.%20Sanborn">John B. Sanborn</a> to go after "individuals and cooperations" who allegedly evaded taxes. Retained by Richardson (as Sectretary), Sanborn aggressively collected $427,000 in supposed delinquent taxes. A May 1874 Congressional investigation report exposed the <a href="Sanborn%20Incident">Sanborn Incident</a>, while Richardson was severely condemned. When the House motioned Richardson's censure he resigned and Grant appointed him as a judge of the <a href="United%20States%20Court%20of%20Claims">Court of Claims</a>. In June, Grant signed into law another <a href="Anti-Moiety%20Acts">Anti-Moiety Act</a>, that abolished the system.

Grant replaced Richardson as Treasury Secretary with <a href="Benjamin%20Helm%20Bristow">Benjamin Helm Bristow</a>, a man known for his honesty, who began a series of reforms in the department, while tightening up its investigation force. Bristow's anti-corruption house cleaning put him in the national spotlight as another scandal was discovered in 1875. Under Bristow's direction, an investigation uncovered the notorious <a href="Whiskey%20Ring">Whiskey Ring</a> that involved collusion between distillers and Treasury officials to evade paying the Treasury millions in tax revenues. Much of this money was being pocketed while some of it went into Republican coffers. Bristow informed Grant of the ring in mid-April and on May 10, Bristow struck. Federal marshals raided 32 installations nationwide and arrested 350 men; 176 indictments were obtained, leading to 110 convictions and $3,150,000 in fines returned to the Treasury.

Grant appointed <a href="David%20Patterson%20Dyer">David Dyer</a>, under Bristow's recommendation, <a href="United%20States%20Attorney">federal attorney</a> to prosecute the Ring in St. Louis, who indicted Grant's old friend General John McDonald, supervisor of Internal Revenue. Grant endorsed Bristow's investigation writing on a letter "Let no guilty man escape..." Bristow's investigation discovered Babcock received kickback payments, and that Babcock had secretly forewarned McDonald, the ring's mastermind boss, of the coming investigation. On November 22, the jury convicted McDonald. On December 9, Babcock was indicted, however Grant refused to believe in Babcock's guilt, was ready to testify in Babcock's favor, but Fish warned that doing so would put Grant in the embarrassing position of testifying against a case prosecuted by his own administration. Instead, Grant remained in Washington and on February 12, 1876, gave a deposition in Babcock's defense, expressing that his confidence in his secretary was "unshaken". Grant's testimony silenced all but his strongest critics. The jury acquitted Babcock, but there was enough evidence revealed that Grant reluctantly dismissed him from the White House, although Babcock kept his position of Superintendent of Public Buildings in Washington.

The Interior Department under Secretary <a href="Columbus%20Delano">Columbus Delano</a>, whom Grant appointed to replace Cox, was rife with fraud and corrupt agents and Delano was forced to resign. Surveyor General Silas Reed had set up corrupt contracts that benefited Delano's son, John Delano. Grant's Secretary Interior <a href="Zachariah%20Chandler">Zachariah Chandler</a>, who succeeded Delano in 1875, cleaned up corruption and reformed the department. When Grant was informed by Postmaster <a href="Marshall%20Jewell">Marshall Jewell</a> of a potential Congressional investigation into an extortion scandal involving Attorney General <a href="George%20Henry%20Williams">George H. Williams</a>' wife, Grant fired Williams and appointed <a href="Edwards%20Pierrepont">Edwards Pierrepont</a> in his place. Grant's new cabinet appointments temporarily appeased reformers.

When the Democrats took control of the House in 1875, they launched a series of investigations into corruption in federal departments. Among the most damaging of the Indian Ring scandal involved Secretary of War <a href="William%20W.%20Belknap">William W. Belknap</a> taking quarterly <a href="kickbacks">kickbacks</a> from the <a href="Trader%20post%20scandal">Fort Sill tradership</a>, which led to his resignation in February 1876. Belknap was impeached by the House, but was acquitted by the Senate. Grant's own brother Orvil set up "silent partnerships" and received kickbacks from four trading posts. Congress discovered that Secretary of Navy Robeson had been bribed by a naval contractor, but no articles of impeachment were drawn up. In November 1876, Grant apologized to the nation and admitted mistakes in his administration, saying, "[f]ailures have been errors of judgement, not of intent."

Even as Grant drew cheers at the opening of the <a href="Centennial%20Exposition">Centennial Exposition</a> in May 1876, the collected scandals of his presidency, the country's weak economy, and the Democratic gains in the House led many in the Republican party to repudiate him in June. Bristow was among the leading candidates to replace him, suggesting that a large faction desired an end to "<a href="Grantism">Grantism</a>" and feared that Grant would run for a third term. Ultimately, Grant declined to run, but Bristow also failed to capture the nomination, as the convention settled on Governor <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> of Ohio, a reformer. The Democrats nominated Governor <a href="Samuel%20J.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a> of New York. Voting irregularities in three Southern states caused the election that year to remain undecided for several months. Grant told Congress to settle the matter through legislation and assured both sides that he would not use the army to force a result, except to curb violence. On January 29, 1877, he signed legislation forming an <a href="Electoral%20Commission%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral Commission</a> to decide the matter. The Commission ruled that the disputed votes belonged to Hayes; to forestall Democratic protests, Republicans agreed to the <a href="Compromise%20of%201877">Compromise of 1877</a>, in which the last troops were withdrawn from Southern capitals. The Republicans had won, but Reconstruction was over. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, "Grant's calm visage in the White House reassured the nation."

After leaving the White House, Grant and his family stayed with Fish in Washington for two months before setting out on a world tour that lasted approximately two and a half years. Preparing for the tour, they arrived in Philadelphia on May 10, 1877, and were honored with celebrations during the week before their departure. On May 16, Grant and Julia left for England aboard the <a href="SS%20Indiana%20%281873%29">SS "Indiana"</a>. During the tour the Grants made stops in Europe, the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>, and points in the <a href="middle%20east">middle</a> and <a href="Far%20East">Far East</a>, meeting with notable dignitaries such as <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>, <a href="Pope%20Leo%20XIII">Pope Leo XIII</a>, <a href="Otto%20von%20Bismarck">Otto von Bismarck</a>, <a href="Emperor%20Meiji">Emperor Meiji</a> and others. Grant was the first U.S. President to visit Jerusalem and the Holy Land. As a courtesy to Grant, his touring party was sometimes transported to their destinations by the U.S. Navy. During the tour, the <a href="Rutherford%20B.%20Hayes">Hayes administration</a> encouraged Grant to assume a diplomatic role to unofficially represent the United States and strengthen American interests abroad, while resolving issues for some countries in the process. Homesick, the Grants left Japan sailing on the <a href="SS%20City%20of%20Tokio">SS "City of Tokio"</a> escorted by a Japanese man-of-war, crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco on September 20, 1879, greeted by cheering crowds. Before returning home to Philadelphia, Grant stopped at Chicago for a reunion with General Sherman and the Army of the Tennessee. Grant's tour demonstrated to much of the world that the United States was an emerging world power.

<a href="Stalwarts">Stalwarts</a>, led by Grant's old political ally, <a href="Roscoe%20Conkling">Roscoe Conkling</a>, saw Grant's renewed popularity as an opportunity to regain power, and sought to nominate him for the presidency in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">1880</a>. Opponents called it a violation of the unofficial two-term rule in use since George Washington. Grant said nothing publicly but wanted the job and encouraged his men. Washburne urged him to run; Grant demurred, saying he would be happy for the Republicans to win with another candidate, though he preferred <a href="James%20G.%20Blaine">James G. Blaine</a> to <a href="John%20Sherman">John Sherman</a>. Even so, Conkling and <a href="John%20A.%20Logan">John A. Logan</a> began to organize delegates in Grant's favor. When <a href="1880%20Republican%20National%20Convention">the convention</a> convened in Chicago in June, there were more delegates pledged to Grant than to any other candidate, but he was still short of a majority vote to get the nomination.

At the convention, Conkling nominated Grant with an elegant speech, the most famous line being: "When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree." With 370 votes needed for nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest to minor candidates. Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win. After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined with those of other candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative <a href="James%20A.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> of Ohio. A procedural motion made the vote unanimous for Garfield, who accepted the nomination. Grant gave speeches for Garfield but declined to criticize the Democratic nominee, <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>, a general who had served under him in the Army of the Potomac. Garfield won the election. Grant gave Garfield his public support and pushed him to include Stalwarts in his administration. On July 2, 1881, Garfield was shot by an assassin and died on September 19. On learning of Garfield's death from a reporter, Grant wept bitterly.

When Grant had returned to America from his costly world tour, he had depleted most of his savings and needed to earn money and find a new home. Wealthy friends bought him a home on Manhattan's <a href="Upper%20East%20Side">Upper East Side</a>, and to make an income, Grant, Jay Gould, and former Mexican Finance Secretary <a href="Mat%C3%ADas%20Romero">Matías Romero</a> chartered the <a href="Mexican%20Southern%20Railroad">Mexican Southern Railroad</a>, with plans to build a railroad from Oaxaca to Mexico City. Grant urged <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, who had succeeded Garfield as president in 1881, to negotiate a free trade treaty with Mexico. Arthur and the Mexican government agreed, but the United States Senate rejected the treaty in 1883. The railroad was similarly unsuccessful, falling into bankruptcy the following year.

At the same time, Grant's son Ulysses Jr. had opened a Wall Street brokerage house with <a href="Ferdinand%20Ward">Ferdinand Ward</a>, a confidence man who swindled numerous wealthy men; Ward was regarded as a rising star and the firm, Grant & Ward, was initially successful. In 1883, Grant joined the firm and invested $100,000 of his own money. Grant, however, warned Ward that if his firm engaged in government business he would dissolve their partnership. To encourage investment, Ward paid investors abnormally high interest, by pledging the company's securities on multiple loans in a process called "<a href="rehypothecation">rehypothecation</a>". Ward, in collusion with banker James D. Fish, kept secret from <a href="bank%20examiner">bank examiner</a>s, retrieved the firm's securities from the company's bank vault. When the trades went bad, multiple loans came due, all backed up by the same collateral. Historians agree that Grant was likely unaware of Ward's intentions, but it is unclear how much Buck Grant knew. In May 1884, enough investments went bad to convince Ward that the firm would soon be bankrupt. Ward, who assumed Grant was "a child in business matters," told him of the impending failure, but assured Grant that this was a temporary shortfall. Grant approached businessman <a href="William%20Henry%20Vanderbilt">William Henry Vanderbilt</a>, who gave him a personal loan of $150,000. Grant invested the money in the firm, but it was not enough to save it from failure. Essentially penniless, but compelled by a sense of personal honor, he repaid what he could with his Civil War mementos and the sale or transfer of all other assets. Vanderbilt took title to Grant's home, although he allowed the Grants to continue to reside there, and pledged to donate the souvenirs to the federal government and insisted the debt had been paid in full. Grant was distraught over Ward's deception and asked privately how he could ever "trust any human being again." In March 1885, as his health was failing, he testified against both Ward and Fish. Ward was convicted of <a href="grand%20larceny">fraud</a> in October 1885, months after Grant's death, and served six and a half years in prison. After the collapse of Grant and Ward, there was an outpouring of sympathy for Grant.

Throughout his career, Grant repeatedly told highly detailed stories of his military experiences, often making slight mistakes in terms of dates and locations. As a poor hardscrabble farmer in St. Louis just before the war, he kept his neighbors spellbound till midnight "listening intently to his vivid narrations of Army experiences." In calm moments during the Civil War, he often spoke of his recent experiences, typically "in terse and often eloquent language." Grant's interpretations changed over time – in his letters written during the Mexican War period, there is no criticism of the war. By contrast his "Memoirs" are highly critical of the political aspects, condemning the war as unwarranted aggression by the United States. Grant told and retold his war stories so many times that writing his "Memoirs" was more a matter of repetition and polish rather than trying to recall his memories for the first time. To restore his family's income and reputation, Grant wrote several articles on his Civil War campaigns for "<a href="The%20Century%20Magazine">The Century Magazine</a>" at $500 () each. The articles were well received by critics, and the editor, <a href="Robert%20Underwood%20Johnson">Robert Underwood Johnson</a>, suggested that Grant write a book of memoirs, as Sherman and others had done. Grant's articles would serve as the basis for several chapters.

In the summer of 1884, Grant complained of a sore throat but put off seeing a doctor until late October, when he learned it was cancer, possibly caused by his frequent cigar smoking. Grant chose not to reveal the seriousness of his condition to his wife, who soon found out from Grant's doctor. Before being diagnosed, Grant was invited to a Methodist service for Civil War veterans in <a href="Ocean%20Grove%2C%20New%20Jersey">Ocean Grove, New Jersey</a>, on August 4, 1884, receiving a standing ovation from more than ten thousand veterans and others; it would be his last public appearance. In March of the following year, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" announced that Grant was dying of cancer, and a nationwide public concern for the former president began. Knowing of Grant and Julia's financial difficulties, Congress sought to honor him and restored him to the rank of General of the Army with full retirement pay (Grant's assumption of the presidency in 1869 had required that he resign his commission and forfeit his pension).

Grant was nearly broke and worried constantly about leaving his wife a suitable amount of money to live on. "Century" magazine offered Grant a book contract with a 10 percent royalty, but Grant's friend <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>, understanding how bad Grant's financial condition was, made him an offer for his memoirs which paid an unheard-of 75 percent royalty. To provide for his family, Grant worked intensely on his memoirs at his home in New York City. His former staff member <a href="Adam%20Badeau">Adam Badeau</a> assisted him with much of the research, while his son <a href="Frederick%20Dent%20Grant">Frederick</a> located documents and did much of the fact-checking. Because of the summer heat and humidity, his doctors recommended that he move upstate to <a href="Grant%20Cottage%20State%20Historic%20Site">a cottage</a> at the top of <a href="Mount%20McGregor%20%28mountain%29">Mount McGregor</a>, offered by a family friend.

Grant finished his memoir and died only a few days later. Grant's memoirs treat his early life and time in the Mexican–American War briefly and are inclusive of his life up to the end of the Civil War. The "<a href="Personal%20Memoirs%20of%20Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Personal Memoirs of Ulysses S. Grant</a>" was a critical and commercial success. Julia Grant received about $450,000 in royalties (). Grant's successful autobiography pioneered a method for ex-presidents and veterans to earn money. The memoir has been highly regarded by the public, military historians, and literary critics. Grant portrayed himself in the persona of the honorable Western hero, whose strength lies in his honesty and straightforwardness. He candidly depicted his battles against both the Confederates and internal army foes. Twain called the "Memoirs" a "literary masterpiece." Given over a century of favorable literary analysis, reviewer <a href="Mark%20Perry%20%28author%29">Mark Perry</a> states that the "Memoirs" are "the most significant work" of American <a href="non-fiction">non-fiction</a>.

After a year-long struggle with throat cancer, surrounded by his family, Grant died at 8 o'clock in the morning in the Mount McGregor cottage on July 23, 1885, at the age of 63. Sheridan, then Commanding General of the Army, ordered a day-long tribute to Grant on all military posts, and President <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a> ordered a thirty-day nationwide period of mourning. After private services, the honor guard placed Grant's body on a special <a href="funeral%20train">funeral train</a>, which traveled to West Point and New York City. A quarter of a million people viewed it in the two days before the funeral. Tens of thousands of men, many of them veterans from the <a href="Grand%20Army%20of%20the%20Republic">Grand Army of the Republic</a>, marched with Grant's casket drawn by two dozen black stallions to <a href="Riverside%20Park%20%28Manhattan%29">Riverside Park</a> in the <a href="Morningside%20Heights%2C%20Manhattan">Morningside Heights</a> neighborhood of <a href="Upper%20Manhattan">Upper Manhattan</a>. His pallbearers included Union generals Sherman and Sheridan, Confederate generals Simon Bolivar Buckner and Joseph E. Johnston, Admiral David Dixon Porter, and Senator John A. Logan, the head of the GAR. Following the casket in the procession were President Cleveland, the two living former presidents Hayes and Arthur, all of the President's Cabinet, as well as the justices of the Supreme Court.

Attendance at the New York funeral topped 1.5 million. Ceremonies were held in other major cities around the country, while Grant was eulogized in the press and likened to <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and Abraham Lincoln. Grant's body was laid to rest in Riverside Park, first in a temporary tomb, and then—twelve years later, on April 17, 1897—in the <a href="Grant%27s%20Tomb">General Grant National Memorial</a>, also known as "Grant's Tomb", the largest <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a> in North America.

Many <a href="Bibliography%20of%20Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">historians and biographers</a> have been intrigued and challenged by contradictions in Grant's life, and few presidential reputations have shifted as dramatically as his. At his death, Grant was seen as "a symbol of the American national identity and memory". Soon afterward, Grant's reputation fell as post-war efforts in late-19th-century national reconciliation took hold among whites. Later accounts portrayed his administration as deeply corrupt; as the popularity of the pro-Confederate <a href="Lost%20Cause">Lost Cause</a> theory and the <a href="Dunning%20School">Dunning School</a> movement grew early in the 20th century, a more negative view of Grant became common. In 1917, historian Louis Arthur Coolidge bucked the trend of negativity and said Grant's "success as President" was "hardly less significant than his success at war."

In 1931, historians Paxson and Bach noted that Grant's presidency "had some achievements, after all." In 1934, historian Robert R. McCormick said Grant's military triumphs were neglected due in part to the "malicious and deliberate design" of "Lost Cause" veterans and writers. In the 1950s, historians <a href="Bruce%20Catton">Bruce Catton</a> and <a href="T.%20Harry%20Williams">T. Harry Williams</a> began a reassessment of Grant's military career, shifting the analysis of Grant as the victor by brute force to that of successful, skillful, modern strategist and commander. Historian <a href="Jonathan%20D.%20Sarna">Jonathan D. Sarna</a> said Grant's 1862 <a href="General%20Order%20No.%2011%20%281862%29">General Order No. 11</a> was "the most notorious anti-Jewish official order in American history." <a href="William%20S.%20McFeely">William S. McFeely</a> won the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Biography%20or%20Autobiography">Pulitzer Prize</a> for his critical 1981 biography that credited Grant's initial presidential efforts on civil rights, but lamented his failure to carry out lasting progress. However, historians debate how effective Grant was at halting corruption.

In the 21st century, Grant's reputation among historians has improved markedly. Opinions of Grant's presidency demonstrate a better appreciation of Grant's personal integrity, Reconstruction efforts, and peace policy towards Indians, even when they fell short. In 2016, <a href="Ronald%20C.%20White">Ronald C. White</a> continued this trend with a biography that historian <a href="T.%20J.%20Stiles">T. J. Stiles</a> said, "solidifies the positive image amassed in recent decades, blotting out the caricature of a military butcher and politically incompetent, promoted by Lost Cause and <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a> era historians." Like White's book, <a href="Ron%20Chernow">Ron Chernow</a>'s 2017 biography ("<a href="Grant%20%28book%29">Grant</a>") continued the elevation of Grant's historical reputation. In a review of Chernow's book, former U.S. President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> offered praise for "Grant's significant achievements at the end of the war and after."

While historian <a href="Charles%20W.%20Calhoun">Charles W. Calhoun</a> noted Grant's presidential successes and his steps to modernize the presidency, he questioned whether Grant's revived reputation among scholars has been found in the "popular consciousness." The scandals of the Grant administration were used to stigmatize his political reputation.

Several memorials honor Grant. In addition to his mausoleum – <a href="Grant%27s%20Tomb">Grant's Tomb</a> in New York City – there is the <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%20Memorial">Ulysses S. Grant Memorial</a> at the foot of <a href="Capitol%20Hill">Capitol Hill</a> in Washington, D.C. Created by sculptor <a href="Henry%20Merwin%20Shrady">Henry Merwin Shrady</a> and architect <a href="Edward%20Pearce%20Casey">Edward Pearce Casey</a>, and dedicated in 1922, it overlooks the <a href="Capitol%20Reflecting%20Pool">Capitol Reflecting Pool</a>. In 2015, restoration work began, which is expected to be completed before the bicentennial of Grant's birth in 2022.

The <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant%20National%20Historic%20Site">Ulysses S. Grant National Historic Site</a> near St. Louis, and several other sites in Ohio and Illinois memorialize Grant's life. The <a href="Grant%20Cottage%20State%20Historic%20Site">U.S. Grant Cottage State Historic Site</a> in <a href="Moreau%2C%20New%20York">Moreau, New York</a>, preserves the house in which he completed his memoirs and died. There are smaller memorials in Chicago's <a href="Lincoln%20Park">Lincoln Park</a> and Philadelphia's <a href="Fairmount%20Park">Fairmount Park</a>. Named in his honor are <a href="Grant%20Park%20%28Chicago%29">Grant Park</a>, as well as <a href="Grant%20County%2C%20Indiana">several counties in western and midwestern states</a>. On June 3, 1891, a bronze statue of Grant by Danish sculptor <a href="Johannes%20Gelert">Johannes Gelert</a> was dedicated at Grant Park in Galena, Illinois. From 1890 to 1940, part of what is now <a href="Kings%20Canyon%20National%20Park">Kings Canyon National Park</a> was called "General Grant National Park", named for the <a href="General%20Grant%20tree">General Grant sequoia</a>.

In May 2012, the Ulysses S. Grant Foundation, on the institute's fiftieth anniversary, selected <a href="Mississippi%20State%20University%23Mitchell%20Memorial%20Library">Mississippi State University</a> as the permanent location for Ulysses S. Grant's <a href="presidential%20library">presidential library</a>. Historian <a href="John%20Y.%20Simon">John Y. Simon</a> edited Grant's letters into a 32-volume scholarly edition published by <a href="Southern%20Illinois%20University%20Press">Southern Illinois University Press</a>.

Grant's image has appeared on the front of the <a href="United%20States%20fifty-dollar%20bill">United States fifty-dollar bill</a> since 1913. In 1921, the "Ulysses S. Grant Centenary Association" was founded with the goal of coordinating special observances and erecting monuments in recognition of Grant's historical role. The venture was financed by the minting of 10,000 gold dollars (depicted below) and 250,000 half dollars. The coins were minted and issued in 1922, commemorating the 100th anniversary of Grant's birth. Grant has also appeared on <a href="U.S.%20presidents%20on%20U.S.%20postage%20stamps%23Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">several U.S. postage stamps</a>, the first one issued in 1890, five years after his death.

Vampire

A vampire is a being from <a href="folklore">folklore</a> that subsists by feeding on the <a href="Vitalism">vital force</a> (generally in the form of <a href="blood">blood</a>) of the living. In <a href="European%20folklore">European folklore</a>, vampires were <a href="undead">undead</a> beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighborhoods they inhabited while they were alive. They wore <a href="shroud">shroud</a>s and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.

Vampiric entities have been <a href="Vampire%20folklore%20by%20region">recorded in most cultures</a>; the term "vampire" was popularised in Western Europe after reports of an 18th-century <a href="mass%20hysteria">mass hysteria</a> of a pre-existing folk belief in the <a href="Balkans">Balkans</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a> that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism. Local variants in Eastern Europe were also known by different names, such as "<a href="shtriga">shtriga</a>" in <a href="Albanian%20mythology">Albania</a>, "<a href="vrykolakas">vrykolakas</a>" in <a href="Greece">Greece</a> and "<a href="strigoi">strigoi</a>" in <a href="Folklore%20of%20Romania">Romania</a>.

In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the "<a href="chupacabra">chupacabra</a>" still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a> after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. <a href="Porphyria">Porphyria</a> was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.

The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of "<a href="The%20Vampyre">The Vampyre</a>" by <a href="John%20William%20Polidori">John Polidori</a>; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century. <a href="Bram%20Stoker">Bram Stoker</a>'s 1897 novel "<a href="Dracula">Dracula</a>" is remembered as the quintessential <a href="vampire%20literature">vampire novel</a> and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after <a href="Sheridan%20Le%20Fanu">Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu</a>'s 1872 novel "<a href="Carmilla">Carmilla</a>". The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire <a href="genre">genre</a>, still popular in the 21st century, with books, <a href="vampire%20films">films</a>, television shows, and video games. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the <a href="horror%20fiction">horror</a> genre.

The "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" dates the first appearance of the English word "vampire" (as "vampyre") in English from 1734, in a travelogue titled "Travels of Three English Gentlemen" published in "<a href="The%20Harleian%20Miscellany">The Harleian Miscellany</a>" in 1745. Vampires had already been discussed in <a href="French%20literature">French</a> and <a href="German%20literature">German literature</a>. After Austria gained control of northern Serbia and <a href="Oltenia">Oltenia</a> with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Passarowitz">Treaty of Passarowitz</a> in 1718, officials noted the local practice of <a href="Burial%23Exhumation">exhuming</a> bodies and "killing vampires". These reports, prepared between 1725 and 1732, received widespread publicity. The <a href="English%20language">English</a> term was derived (possibly via <a href="French%20language">French</a> "vampyre") from the <a href="German%20language">German</a> "Vampir", in turn derived in the early 18th century from the <a href="Serbian%20language">Serbian</a> "vampir" (<a href="Serbian%20Cyrillic%20script">Serbian Cyrillic</a>: вампир).

The Serbian form has parallels in virtually all <a href="Slavic%20languages">Slavic languages</a>: <a href="Bulgarian%20language">Bulgarian</a> and <a href="Macedonian%20language">Macedonian</a> вампир ("vampir"), <a href="Bosnian%20language">Bosnian</a>: "vampir" / вампир, <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a> "vampir", <a href="Czech%20language">Czech</a> and <a href="Slovak%20language">Slovak</a> "upír", <a href="Polish%20language">Polish</a> "wąpierz", and (perhaps <a href="East%20Slavic%20languages">East Slavic</a>-influenced) "upiór", <a href="Ukrainian%20language">Ukrainian</a> упир ("upyr"), <a href="Russian%20language">Russian</a> упырь ("upyr"), <a href="Belarusian%20language">Belarusian</a> упыр ("upyr"), from <a href="Old%20East%20Slavic">Old East Slavic</a> упирь ("upir") (many of these languages have also borrowed forms such as "vampir/wampir" subsequently from the West; these are distinct from the original local words for the creature). The exact <a href="etymology">etymology</a> is unclear. Among the proposed <a href="proto-Slavic%20language">proto-Slavic</a> forms are *ǫpyrь and *ǫpirь.

Another less widespread theory is that the Slavic languages have borrowed the word from a <a href="Turkic%20languages">Turkic</a> term for "witch" (e.g., <a href="Tatar%20language">Tatar</a> "ubyr"). Czech linguist Václav Machek proposes Slovak verb "vrepiť sa" (stick to, thrust into), or its hypothetical anagram "vperiť sa" (in Czech, the archaic verb "vpeřit" means "to thrust violently") as an etymological background, and thus translates "upír" as "someone who thrusts, bites". An early use of the <a href="Old%20Russian">Old Russian</a> word is in the anti-<a href="pagan">pagan</a> treatise "Word of Saint Grigoriy" (Russian "Слово святого Григория"), dated variously to the 11th–13th centuries, where pagan worship of "upyri" is reported.

The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>ns, <a href="Hebrews">Hebrews</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greeks</a>, and <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Romans</a> had tales of <a href="demon">demon</a>s and <a href="spirit">spirit</a>s which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century <a href="southeast%20Europe">southeastern Europe</a>, when <a href="oral%20culture">verbal traditions</a> of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are <a href="revenant%20%28folklore%29">revenants</a> of evil beings, <a href="suicide">suicide</a> victims, or <a href="Witchcraft">witches</a>, but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit <a href="demonic%20possession">possessing</a> a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even <a href="public%20execution">public execution</a>s of people believed to be vampires.

It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its <a href="shroud">shroud</a> or coffin and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general <a href="fang">fang</a>s were not a feature. Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folk tales spoke of them as living beings.

The causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In <a href="Slavic%20peoples">Slavic</a> and <a href="Chinese%20folklore">Chinese</a> traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In <a href="Folklore%20of%20Russia">Russian folklore</a>, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the <a href="Russian%20Orthodox%20Church">Russian Orthodox Church</a> while they were alive.

Cultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as <a href="scythe">scythe</a>s or <a href="sickle">sickle</a>s, near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the <a href="ancient%20Greek">ancient Greek</a> practice of placing an <a href="Charon%27s%20obol">obolus in the corpse's mouth</a> to pay the toll to cross the <a href="River%20Styx">River Styx</a> in the underworld. It has been argued that instead, the coin was intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the "<a href="vrykolakas">vrykolakas</a>," in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription "<a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a> conquers" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.

Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the <a href="patellar%20ligament">tendons at the knees</a> or placing <a href="poppy">poppy</a> seeds, <a href="millet">millet</a>, or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with <a href="arithmomania">arithmomania</a>. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of <a href="rice">rice</a>, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in <a href="Folklore%20of%20India">myths from the Indian subcontinent</a>, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.

In Albanian folklore, the <a href="dhampir">dhampir</a> is the hybrid child of the "karkanxholl" (a <a href="werewolf">werewolf</a>-like creature with an iron <a href="mail%20%28armour%29">mail</a> shirt) or the "lugat" (a water-dwelling <a href="ghost">ghost</a> or monster). The dhampir sprung of a karkanxholl has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl; from this derives the expression "the dhampir knows the lugat". The "lugat" cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself is usually the son of a lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. "Dhampiraj" is also an Albanian surname.

Many rituals were used to identify a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question. Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white. Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism.

Corpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor <a href="poltergeist">poltergeist</a>-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and <a href="mara%20%28folklore%29">pressing</a> on people in their sleep.

<a href="Apotrope">Apotropaics</a>—items able to ward off revenants—are common in vampire folklore. <a href="Garlic">Garlic</a> is a common example, a branch of <a href="rosa%20acicularis">wild rose</a> and <a href="common%20hawthorn">hawthorn</a> plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling <a href="mustard%20seed">mustard seed</a>s on the roof of a house was said to keep them away. Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a <a href="crucifix">crucifix</a>, <a href="rosary">rosary</a>, or <a href="holy%20water">holy water</a>. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on <a href="consecration">consecrated ground</a>, such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.

Although not traditionally regarded as an apotropaic, <a href="mirror">mirror</a>s have been used to ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a <a href="soul">soul</a>). This attribute is not universal (the Greek "vrykolakas/tympanios" was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in "Dracula" and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.

Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; after the first invitation they can come and go as they please. Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to <a href="sunlight">sunlight</a>.

Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with <a href="impalement">staking</a> the most commonly cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures. <a href="Ash%20tree">Ash</a> was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or <a href="common%20hawthorn">hawthorn</a> in Serbia, with a record of <a href="oak">oak</a> in <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a>. <a href="Populus%20tremula">Aspen</a> was also used for stakes, as it was believed that <a href="True%20Cross">Christ's cross</a> was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.

Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of "deflating" the bloated vampire. This is similar to a practice of "<a href="anti-vampire%20burial">anti-vampire burial</a>": burying sharp objects, such as sickles, with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.

<a href="Decapitation">Decapitation</a> was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the <a href="buttocks">buttocks</a> or away from the body. This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.
<a href="Romani%20people">Romani people</a> drove steel or iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse's sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near <a href="Venice">Venice</a>, a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006. In <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>, over 100 skeletons with metal objects, such as <a href="plough">plough</a> bits, embedded in the torso have been discovered.

Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling <a href="holy%20water">holy water</a> on the body, or by <a href="exorcism">exorcism</a>. In Romania, garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the <a href="coffin">coffin</a> was taken. For resistant cases, the body was <a href="dismemberment">dismembered</a> and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In <a href="Old%20Saxony">Saxon regions</a> of Germany, a <a href="lemon">lemon</a> was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.

Tales of supernatural beings consuming the blood or flesh of the living have been found in nearly every culture around the world for many centuries. The term "vampire" did not exist in ancient times. <a href="Blood%20drinking">Blood drinking</a> and similar activities were attributed to <a href="demon">demon</a>s or <a href="spirit">spirit</a>s who would eat flesh and drink blood; even the <a href="devil">devil</a> was considered synonymous with the vampire.

Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity. In India, for example, tales of <a href="vetala">vetālas</a>, ghoul-like beings that inhabit corpses, have been compiled in the "<a href="Baital%20Pachisi">Baitāl Pacīsī</a>"; a prominent story in the "<a href="Kath%C4%81sarits%C4%81gara">Kathāsaritsāgara</a>" tells of King <a href="Vikram%C4%81ditya">Vikramāditya</a> and his nightly quests to capture an elusive one. "<a href="Pishacha">Piśāca</a>", the returned spirits of evil-doers or those who died insane, also bear vampiric attributes.

The <a href="Persian%20Empire">Persians</a> were one of the first civilisations to have tales of blood-drinking demons: creatures attempting to drink blood from men were depicted on excavated <a href="pottery">pottery</a> shards. Ancient <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> and <a href="Assyria">Assyria</a> had tales of the mythical <a href="Lilith%23Lilitu%20demons">Lilitu</a>, synonymous with and giving rise to <a href="Lilith">Lilith</a> (<a href="Hebrew">Hebrew</a> לילית) and her daughters the <a href="Lilu%20%28mythology%29">Lilu</a> from <a href="Jewish%20demonology">Hebrew demonology</a>. Lilitu was considered a demon and was often depicted as subsisting on the blood of babies, and <a href="estries">estries</a>, female shape-changing, blood-drinking demons, were said to roam the night among the population, seeking victims. According to <a href="Sefer%20Hasidim">Sefer Hasidim</a>, estries were creatures created in the twilight hours before . An injured estrie could be healed by eating bread and salt given her by her attacker.

<a href="Greco-Roman%20mythology">Greco-Roman mythology</a> described the <a href="Empusa">Empusa</a>e, the <a href="Lamia%20%28mythology%29">Lamia</a>, and the <a href="strix%20%28mythology%29">striges</a>. Over time the first two terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa was the daughter of the goddess <a href="Hecate">Hecate</a> and was described as a demonic, <a href="bronze">bronze</a>-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the "gelloudes" or <a href="Gello">Gello</a>. Like the Lamia, the "striges" feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as "strix", a kind of nocturnal bird that fed on human flesh and blood.

Many myths surrounding vampires originated during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">medieval period</a>. The 12th-century English historians and chroniclers <a href="Walter%20Map">Walter Map</a> and <a href="William%20of%20Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a> recorded accounts of revenants, though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant. The <a href="Scandinavian%20folklore">Old Norse</a> "<a href="draugr">draugr</a>" is another medieval example of an undead creature with similarities to vampires. Vampire-like beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi <a href="David%20ben%20Solomon%20ibn%20Abi%20Zimra">David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra</a> (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event to the lack of a "<a href="shemira">shmirah</a>" (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.

Vampires proper originate in folklore widely reported from Eastern Europe in the late 17th and 18th centuries. These tales formed the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England, where they were subsequently embellished and popularized. One of the earliest recordings of vampire activity came from the region of <a href="Istria">Istria</a> in modern <a href="Croatia">Croatia</a>, in 1672. Local reports cited the local vampire <a href="Jure%20Grando">Jure Grando</a> of the village Khring near <a href="Tinjan">Tinjan</a> as the cause of panic among the villagers. A former peasant, Jure died in 1656. Local villagers claimed he returned from the dead and began drinking blood from the people and sexually harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart, but when the method failed to kill him, he was subsequently beheaded with better results.

During the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires. Despite being called the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Age of Enlightenment</a>, during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe. The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in <a href="East%20Prussia">East Prussia</a> in 1721 and in the <a href="Habsburg%20Monarchy">Habsburg Monarchy</a> from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, the first to be officially recorded, involved the corpses of <a href="Petar%20Blagojevich">Petar Blagojevich</a> and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have died at the age of 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.

In the second case, Miloš, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while <a href="hay">hay</a>ing. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Miloš had returned to prey on the neighbours. Another famous Serbian vampire legend recounts the story of a certain <a href="Sava%20Savanovi%C4%87">Sava Savanović</a>, who lives in a watermill and kills and drinks blood from the millers. The character was later used in a story written by Serbian writer <a href="Milovan%20Gli%C5%A1i%C4%87">Milovan Glišić</a> and in the Yugoslav 1973 horror film "<a href="Leptirica">Leptirica</a>" inspired by the story.

The two incidents were well-documented. Government officials examined the bodies, wrote case reports, and published books throughout Europe. The hysteria, commonly referred to as the "18th-Century Vampire Controversy", raged for a generation. The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so-claimed vampire attacks, undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities, with locals digging up bodies and in some cases, staking them.

In 1597, <a href="King%20James%20VI%20and%20I">King James</a> wrote a dissertation on witchcraft titled "<a href="Daemonologie">Daemonologie</a>" in which he wrote the belief that demons could possess both the living and the dead. Within his <a href="classification%20of%20demons">classification of demons</a>, he explained the concept through the notion that <a href="incubus">incubi</a> and <a href="succubus">succubae</a> could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.

In 1645 the Greek librarian of the Vatican, <a href="Leo%20Allatius">Leo Allatius</a>, produced the first methodological description of the Balkan beliefs in vampires (Greek: vrykolakas) in his work "De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus" ("On certain modern opinions among the Greeks").
From 1679, Philippe Rohr devotes an essay to the dead who chew their shrouds in their graves, a subject resumed by Otto in 1732, and then by <a href="Michael%20Ranft">Michael Ranft</a> in 1734. The subject was based on the observation that when digging up graves, it was discovered that some corpses had at some point either devoured the interior fabric of their coffin or their own limbs. Ranft described in his treatise of a tradition in some parts of Germany, that to prevent the dead from masticating they placed a mound of dirt under their chin in the coffin, placed a piece of money and a stone in the mouth, or tied a handkerchief tightly around the throat. In 1732 an anonymous writer writing as "the doctor Weimar" discusses the non-putrefaction of these creatures, from a theological point of view. In 1733, Johann Christoph Harenberg wrote a general treatise on vampirism and the <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20de%20Boyer%2C%20Marquis%20d%27Argens">Marquis d'Argens</a> cites local cases. Theologians and clergymen also address the topic.

Some theological disputes arose. The non-decay of vampires' bodies could recall the incorruption of the bodies of the saints of the Catholic Church. A paragraph on vampires was included in the second edition (1749) of "De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione", On the <a href="beatification">beatification</a> of the servants of God and on <a href="canonization">canonization</a> of the blessed, written by Prospero Lambertini (<a href="Pope%20Benedict%20XIV">Pope Benedict XIV</a>). In his opinion, while the <a href="incorruptibility">incorruption</a> of the bodies of saints was the effect of a divine intervention, all the phenomena attributed to vampires were purely natural or the fruit of "imagination, terror and fear". In other words, vampires did not exist.

<a href="Antoine%20Augustine%20Calmet">Dom Augustine Calmet</a>, a French theologian and scholar, published a comprehensive treatise in 1751 titled "<a href="Trait%C3%A9%20sur%20les%20apparitions%20des%20esprits%20et%20sur%20les%20vampires%20ou%20les%20revenans%20de%20Hongrie%2C%20de%20Moravie%2C%20%26amp%3Bc.">Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants</a>" which investigated the existence of vampires, demons, and spectres. Calmet conducted extensive research and amassed judicial reports of vampiric incidents and extensively researched theological and mythological accounts as well, using the scientific method in his analysis to come up with methods for determining the validity for cases of this nature. As he stated in his treatise:

[T]hey see, it is said, men who have been dead for several months, come back to earth, talk, walk, infest villages, ill use both men and beasts, suck the blood of their near relations, make them ill, and finally cause their death; so that people can only save themselves from their dangerous visits and their hauntings by exhuming them, impaling them, cutting off their heads, tearing out the heart, or burning them. These revenants are called by the name of oupires or vampires, that is to say, <a href="leech">leech</a>es; and such particulars are related of them, so singular, so detailed, and invested with such probable circumstances and such judicial information, that one can hardly refuse to credit the belief which is held in those countries, that these revenants come out of their tombs and produce those effects which are proclaimed of them.

Calmet had numerous readers, including both a critical <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a> and numerous supportive <a href="demonologist">demonologist</a>s who interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed. In the "<a href="Dictionnaire%20philosophique">Philosophical Dictionary</a>," Voltaire wrote:

The controversy in Austria only ceased when Empress <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Austria">Maria Theresa of Austria</a> sent her personal physician, <a href="Gerard%20van%20Swieten">Gerard van Swieten</a>, to investigate the claims of vampiric entities. He concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies, sounding the end of the vampire epidemics. Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local folklore.

Beings having many of the attributes of European vampires appear in the folklore of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and India. Classified as vampires, all share the thirst for blood.

Various regions of Africa have folktales featuring beings with vampiric abilities: in <a href="West%20Africa">West Africa</a> the <a href="Ashanti%20people">Ashanti</a> people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling "<a href="asanbosam">asanbosam</a>", and the <a href="Ewe%20people">Ewe people</a> of the "<a href="adze%20%28folklore%29">adze</a>," which can take the form of a <a href="firefly">firefly</a> and hunts children. The eastern <a href="Cape%20Peninsula">Cape</a> region has the "<a href="impundulu">impundulu</a>," which can take the form of a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the <a href="Betsileo">Betsileo</a> people of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> tell of the "ramanga", an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail clippings of nobles.

The "<a href="Loogaroo">Loogaroo</a>" is an example of how a vampire belief can result from a combination of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or <a href="West%20African%20Vodun">voodoo</a>. The term "Loogaroo" possibly comes from the French "<a href="loup-garou">loup-garou</a>" (meaning "werewolf") and is common in the <a href="culture%20of%20Mauritius">culture of Mauritius</a>. The stories of the "Loogaroo" are widespread through the <a href="Caribbean%20Islands">Caribbean Islands</a> and <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> in the United States. Similar female monsters are the "<a href="Soucouyant">Soucouyant</a>" of <a href="Trinidad">Trinidad</a>, and the "<a href="Tunda">Tunda</a>" and "<a href="Patasola">Patasola</a>" of <a href="Colombian%20folklore">Colombian folklore</a>, while the <a href="Mapuche">Mapuche</a> of southern <a href="Chile">Chile</a> have the bloodsucking snake known as the "<a href="Peuchen">Peuchen</a>". "<a href="Aloe%20vera">Aloe vera</a>" hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American folklore. <a href="Aztec%20mythology">Aztec mythology</a> described tales of the <a href="Cihuateteo">Cihuateteo</a>, skeletal-faced spirits of those who died in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.

During the late 18th and 19th centuries the belief in vampires was <a href="New%20England%20vampire%20panic">widespread in parts of New England</a>, particularly in <a href="Rhode%20Island">Rhode Island</a> and eastern <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term "vampire" was never used to describe the dead. The deadly disease <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>, or "consumption" as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves. The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old <a href="Mercy%20Brown%20vampire%20incident">Mercy Brown</a>, who died in <a href="Exeter%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Exeter, Rhode Island</a> in 1892. Her father, assisted by the family physician, removed her from her tomb two months after her death, cut out her heart and burned it to ashes.

Vampires have appeared in <a href="Japanese%20cinema">Japanese cinema</a> since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin. The <a href="Nukekubi">Nukekubi</a> is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night. Legends of female vampire-like beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the <a href="Philippine%20mythology">Philippines</a>, <a href="Malay%20folklore">Malaysia</a> and <a href="Folklore%20of%20Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the <a href="Tagalog%20people">Tagalog</a> "<a href="Mandurugo">Mandurugo</a>" ("blood-sucker") and the <a href="Visayan">Visayan</a> "<a href="Manananggal">Manananggal</a>" ("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a variety of the <a href="aswang">aswang</a> that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim. The "manananggal" is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck <a href="fetus">fetus</a>es from these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the <a href="heart">heart</a> and the <a href="liver">liver</a>) and the phlegm of sick people.

The Malaysian "<a href="Penanggalan">Penanggalan</a>" is a woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a> or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung "jeruju" (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the "Penanggalan" would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The <a href="Leyak">Leyak</a> is a similar being from <a href="Balinese%20mythology">Balinese folklore</a> of Indonesia. A "<a href="Pontianak%20%28folklore%29">Kuntilanak</a>" or "Matianak" in Indonesia, or "<a href="Pontianak%20%28folklore%29">Pontianak</a>" or "<a href="Langsuyar">Langsuir</a>" in Malaysia, is a woman who <a href="Maternal%20mortality%20in%20fiction">died during childbirth</a> and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming "langsuir." This description would also fit the <a href="Sundel%20bolong">Sundel Bolongs</a>.

<a href="Jiangshi">Jiangshi</a>, sometimes called "Chinese vampires" by Westerners, are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life essence (<a href="qi">qì</a>) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person's soul (魄 <a href="Hun%20and%20po">"pò"</a>) fails to leave the deceased's body. "Jiang shi" are usually represented as mindless creatures with no independent thought. This monster has greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or <a href="mold">mould</a> growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a <a href="Jiangshi%20fiction">genre of jiangshi films</a> and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like "<a href="Encounters%20of%20the%20Spooky%20Kind">Encounters of the Spooky Kind</a>" and "<a href="Mr.%20Vampire">Mr. Vampire</a>" were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.

In modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic <a href="villain">villain</a>. Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities, occasional sightings of vampires are reported. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons. Allegations of vampire attacks swept through <a href="Malawi">Malawi</a> during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor <a href="Eric%20Chiwaya">Eric Chiwaya</a>, based on the belief that the government was colluding with vampires.

In early 1970 local press spread rumours that a vampire haunted <a href="Highgate%20Cemetery">Highgate Cemetery</a> in London. Amateur <a href="vampire%20hunter">vampire hunter</a>s flocked in large numbers to the cemetery. Several books have been written about the case, notably by Sean Manchester, a local man who was among the first to suggest the existence of the "<a href="Highgate%20Vampire">Highgate Vampire</a>" and who later claimed to have <a href="exorcism">exorcised</a> and destroyed a whole nest of vampires in the area. In January 2005, rumours circulated that an attacker had bitten a number of people in <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>, England, fuelling concerns about a vampire roaming the streets. Local police stated that no such crime had been reported and that the case appears to be an <a href="urban%20legend">urban legend</a>.
In 2006, a physics professor at the <a href="University%20of%20Central%20Florida">University of Central Florida</a> wrote a paper arguing that it is mathematically impossible for vampires to exist, based on <a href="geometric%20progression">geometric progression</a>. According to the paper, if the first vampire had appeared on 1 January 1600, and it fed once a month (which is less often than what is depicted in films and folklore), and every victim turned into a vampire, then within two and a half years the entire human population of the time would have become vampires.

In one of the more notable cases of vampiric entities in the modern age, the "<a href="chupacabra">chupacabra</a>" ("goat-sucker") of <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> is said to be a creature that feeds upon the flesh or drinks the blood of <a href="domesticated%20animal">domesticated animal</a>s, leading some to consider it a kind of vampire. The "chupacabra hysteria" was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s.

In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.

In September / October 2017, mob violence in Malawi related to a vampire scare killed about 6 people accused of being vampires. A similar spate of vigilante violence linked to vampire rumours occurred there in 2002.

Vampirism and the <a href="vampire%20lifestyle">vampire lifestyle</a> also represent a relevant part of modern day's <a href="occult">occult</a>ist movements. The mythos of the vampire, his <a href="Magick%20%28Aleister%20Crowley%29">magickal</a> qualities, allure, and predatory archetype express a strong symbolism that can be used in ritual, energy work, and magick, and can even be adopted as a spiritual system. The vampire has been part of the occult society in Europe for centuries and has spread into the American sub-culture as well for more than a decade, being strongly influenced by and mixed with the <a href="Goth%20subculture">neo gothic</a> aesthetics.

"<a href="Coven">Coven</a>" has been used as a collective noun for vampires, possibly based on the <a href="Wicca">Wicca</a>n usage. An alternative collective noun is a "house" of vampires.

Commentators have offered many theories for the origins of vampire beliefs and related <a href="mass%20hysteria">mass hysteria</a>. Everything ranging from <a href="premature%20burial">premature burial</a> to the early ignorance of the body's <a href="decomposition">decomposition</a> cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.

Paul Barber in his book "Vampires, Burial and Death" has described that belief in vampires resulted from people of <a href="pre-industrial%20society">pre-industrial societies</a> attempting to explain the natural, but to them inexplicable, process of death and decomposition.

People sometimes suspected vampirism when a cadaver did not look as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, and many of the signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.

Corpses swell as gases from decomposition accumulate in the torso and the increased pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look "plump", "well-fed", and "ruddy"—changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the <a href="Arnold%20Paole">Arnold Paole case</a>, an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy than she had ever looked in life. The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.

Darkening of the skin is also caused by decomposition. The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the accumulated gases to escape the body. This could produce a groan-like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords, or a sound reminiscent of <a href="flatulence">flatulence</a> when they passed through the anus. The official reporting on the <a href="Petar%20Blagojevich">Petar Blagojevich</a> case speaks of "other wild signs which I pass by out of high respect".

After death, the skin and gums lose fluids and contract, exposing the roots of the hair, nails, and teeth, even teeth that were concealed in the jaw. This can produce the illusion that the hair, nails, and teeth have grown. At a certain stage, the nails fall off and the skin peels away, as reported in the Blagojevich case—the <a href="dermis">dermis</a> and <a href="nail%20%28anatomy%29%23Parts%20of%20the%20nail">nail beds</a> emerging underneath were interpreted as "new skin" and "new nails".

It has also been hypothesized that vampire legends were influenced by individuals being <a href="buried%20alive">buried alive</a> because of shortcomings in the medical knowledge of the time. In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin, it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside from the victim trying to escape. In other cases the person would hit their heads, noses or faces and it would appear that they had been "feeding". A problem with this theory is the question of how people presumably buried alive managed to stay alive for any extended period without food, water or fresh air. An alternate explanation for noise is the bubbling of escaping gases from natural decomposition of bodies. Another likely cause of disordered tombs is <a href="grave%20robbery">grave robbery</a>.

Folkloric vampirism has been associated with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community. The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of <a href="Mercy%20Brown%20vampire%20incident">Mercy Brown</a> and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of <a href="bubonic%20plague">bubonic plague</a>, it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.

In 1985 biochemist <a href="David%20Dolphin">David Dolphin</a> proposed a link between the rare blood disorder <a href="porphyria">porphyria</a> and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous <a href="heme">haem</a>, he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.

The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood. Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely. Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention and entered popular modern folklore.

<a href="Rabies">Rabies</a> has been linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a neurologist at Xeral Hospital in <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a>, Spain, examined this possibility in a report in "<a href="Neurology%20%28journal%29">Neurology</a>". The susceptibility to garlic and light could be due to hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and <a href="hypersexuality">hypersexuality</a>. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). <a href="Wolf">Wolves</a> and <a href="bat">bat</a>s, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.

In his 1931 treatise "On the Nightmare", <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalyst</a> <a href="Ernest%20Jones">Ernest Jones</a> asserted that vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and <a href="defence%20mechanism">defence mechanism</a>s. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel the idea of the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may <a href="psychological%20projection">project</a> the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.

In cases where there was unconscious guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to <a href="psychological%20repression">repression</a>, which <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> had linked with the development of morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect may or may not be present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their <a href="death%20anxiety%20%28psychology%29">fear of dying</a>.

The innate sexuality of bloodsucking can be seen in its intrinsic connection with <a href="cannibalism">cannibalism</a> and folkloric one with <a href="incubus%20%28demon%29">incubus</a>-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with <a href="semen">semen</a> being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular <a href="Sadistic%20personality%20disorder%23Freud%20and%20psychoanalysis">sadism</a>; he felt that <a href="Psychosexual%20development%23Oral%20stage">oral sadism</a> is integral in vampiric behaviour.

The reinvention of the vampire myth in the modern era is not without political overtones. The aristocratic Count Dracula, alone in his castle apart from a few demented retainers, appearing only at night to feed on his peasantry, is symbolic of the parasitic "<a href="ancien%20regime">ancien regime</a>". In his entry for "Vampires" in the "Dictionnaire philosophique" (1764), Voltaire notices how the mid-18th century coincided with the decline of the folkloric belief in the existence of vampires but that now "there were stock-jobbers, brokers, and men of business, who sucked the blood of the people in broad daylight; but they were not dead, though corrupted. These true suckers lived not in cemeteries, but in very agreeable palaces".

Marx defined capital as "dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks". <a href="Werner%20Herzog">Werner Herzog</a>, in his "<a href="Nosferatu%20the%20Vampyre">Nosferatu the Vampyre</a>", gives this political interpretation an extra ironic twist when protagonist <a href="Jonathon%20Harker">Jonathon Harker</a>, a middle-class solicitor, becomes the next vampire; in this way the capitalist <a href="bourgeois">bourgeois</a> becomes the next parasitic class.

A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. <a href="Serial%20killer">Serial killer</a>s <a href="Peter%20K%C3%BCrten">Peter Kürten</a> and <a href="Richard%20Trenton%20Chase">Richard Trenton Chase</a> were both called "vampires" in the <a href="tabloid%20journalism">tabloids</a> after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. Similarly, in 1932, an unsolved murder case in <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a>, Sweden was nicknamed the "<a href="Atlas%20Vampire">Vampire murder</a>", because of the circumstances of the victim's death. The late-16th-century Hungarian countess and mass murderer <a href="Elizabeth%20B%C3%A1thory">Elizabeth Báthory</a> became particularly infamous in later centuries' works, which depicted her bathing in her victims' blood in order to retain beauty or youth.

"Vampire lifestyle" is a term for a contemporary subculture of people, largely within the <a href="Goth%20subculture">Goth subculture</a>, who consume the blood of others as a pastime; drawing from the rich recent history of popular culture related to cult symbolism, <a href="horror%20film">horror film</a>s, the fiction of <a href="Anne%20Rice">Anne Rice</a>, and the styles of Victorian England. Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood-related vampirism, commonly referred to as "sanguine vampirism", and "<a href="psychic%20vampire">psychic vampirism</a>", or supposed feeding from <a href="prana">pranic</a> energy.

Although many cultures have stories about them, <a href="vampire%20bat">vampire bat</a>s have only recently become an integral part of the traditional vampire lore. Vampire bats were integrated into vampire folklore after they were discovered on the South American mainland in the 16th century. There are no vampire bats in Europe, but <a href="bat">bat</a>s and <a href="owl">owl</a>s have long been associated with the supernatural and omens, mainly because of their nocturnal habits, and in modern English <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> tradition, a bat means "Awareness of the powers of darkness and chaos".

The three species of vampire bats are all <a href="endemic%20%28ecology%29">endemic</a> to Latin America, and there is no evidence to suggest that they had any <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the "<a href="Oxford%20English%20Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a>" records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.

The literary <a href="Count%20Dracula">Dracula</a> transforms into a bat several times in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of "Dracula" followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the <a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">film</a>, where <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Lugosi">Béla Lugosi</a> would transform into a bat. The bat transformation scene was used again by <a href="Lon%20Chaney%2C%20Jr.">Lon Chaney Jr.</a> in 1943's "<a href="Son%20of%20Dracula%20%281943%20film%29">Son of Dracula</a>".

The vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and continued with 19th-century short stories, the first and most influential of which was <a href="John%20Polidori">John Polidori</a>'s "The Vampyre" (1819), featuring the vampire <a href="Lord%20Ruthven%20%28vampire%29">Lord Ruthven</a>. Lord Ruthven's exploits were further explored in a series of vampire plays in which he was the <a href="antihero">antihero</a>. The vampire theme continued in <a href="penny%20dreadful">penny dreadful</a> serial publications such as "<a href="Varney%20the%20Vampire">Varney the Vampire</a>" (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history: "<a href="Dracula">Dracula</a>" by Bram Stoker, published in 1897.

Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and <a href="Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Murnau">Murnau's</a> "<a href="Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a>" (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright <a href="Hamilton%20Deane">Hamilton Deane</a> to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, <a href="immortality">immortality</a> is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.

The vampire or revenant first appeared in poems such as "The Vampire" (1748) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder, "<a href="Lenore%20%28ballad%29">Lenore</a>" (1773) by <a href="Gottfried%20August%20B%C3%BCrger">Gottfried August Bürger</a>, "Die Braut von Corinth" ("The Bride of Corinth") (1797) by <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>, <a href="Robert%20Southey">Robert Southey</a>'s "Thalaba the Destroyer" (1801), <a href="John%20Stagg%20%28poet%29">John Stagg</a>'s "The Vampyre" (1810), <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Percy Bysshe Shelley</a>'s <a href="Posthumous%20Fragments%20of%20Margaret%20Nicholson">"The Spectral Horseman"</a> (1810) ("Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore") and "Ballad" in "<a href="St.%20Irvyne">St. Irvyne</a>" (1811) about a reanimated corpse, Sister Rosa, <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>'s unfinished "<a href="Christabel%20%28poem%29">Christabel</a>" and <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>'s "<a href="The%20Giaour">The Giaour</a>".

Byron was also credited with the first prose fiction piece concerned with vampires: "The Vampyre" (1819). This was in reality authored by Byron's personal physician, <a href="John%20Polidori">John Polidori</a>, who adapted an enigmatic fragmentary tale of his illustrious patient, "Fragment of a Novel" (1819), also known as "The Burial: A Fragment". Byron's own dominating personality, mediated by his lover <a href="Lady%20Caroline%20Lamb">Lady Caroline Lamb</a> in her unflattering "roman-a-clef" "Glenarvon" (a Gothic fantasia based on Byron's wild life), was used as a model for Polidori's undead protagonist <a href="Lord%20Ruthven%20%28vampire%29">Lord Ruthven</a>. "The Vampyre" was highly successful and the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.
"<a href="Varney%20the%20Vampire">Varney the Vampire</a>" was a landmark popular mid-<a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> <a href="gothic%20horror">gothic horror</a> story by <a href="James%20Malcolm%20Rymer">James Malcolm Rymer</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Peckett%20Prest">Thomas Peckett Prest</a>, which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 in a series of pamphlets generally referred to as "<a href="penny%20dreadful">penny dreadful</a>s" because of their inexpensive price and typically gruesome contents. The story was published in book form in 1847 and runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney. Another important addition to the genre was <a href="Sheridan%20Le%20Fanu">Sheridan Le Fanu</a>'s <a href="lesbian%20vampire">lesbian vampire</a> story "<a href="Carmilla">Carmilla</a>" (1871). Like Varney before her, the vampire Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted.

No effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as <a href="Bram%20Stoker">Bram Stoker</a>'s "Dracula" (1897). Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> Europe where <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> and <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.

Drawing on past works such as "The Vampyre" and "Carmilla", Stoker began to research his new book in the late 19th century, reading works such as "The Land Beyond the Forest" (1888) by <a href="Emily%20Gerard">Emily Gerard</a> and other books about Transylvania and vampires. In London, a colleague mentioned to him the story of <a href="Vlad%20III%20the%20Impaler">Vlad Ţepeş</a>, the "real-life Dracula", and Stoker immediately incorporated this story into his book. The first chapter of the book was omitted when it was published in 1897, but it was released in 1914 as "Dracula's Guest". Many experts believe, this deleted opening was based on the Austrian princess <a href="Eleonore%20von%20Schwarzenberg">Eleonore von Schwarzenberg</a>.

The latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was Gothic romance writer <a href="Marilyn%20Ross">Marilyn Ross</a>'s "<a href="Barnabas%20Collins">Barnabas Collins</a>" series (1966–71), loosely based on the contemporary American TV series "<a href="Dark%20Shadows">Dark Shadows</a>". It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic <a href="tragic%20hero">tragic hero</a>es rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice's highly popular and influential "<a href="Vampire%20Chronicles">Vampire Chronicles</a>" (1976–2003).

The 21st century brought more examples of vampire fiction, such as <a href="J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BR.%20Ward">J. R. Ward</a>'s <a href="Black%20Dagger%20Brotherhood">Black Dagger Brotherhood</a> series, and other highly popular vampire books which appeal to teenagers and young adults. Such vampiric <a href="paranormal%20romance">paranormal romance</a> novels and allied vampiric <a href="chick-lit">chick-lit</a> and vampiric <a href="occult%20detective">occult detective</a> stories are a remarkably popular and ever-expanding contemporary publishing phenomenon. <a href="Leslie%20Esdaile%20Banks">L. A. Banks</a>' "<a href="The%20Vampire%20Huntress%20Legend%20Series">The Vampire Huntress Legend Series</a>", <a href="Laurell%20K.%20Hamilton">Laurell K. Hamilton</a>'s erotic "" series, and <a href="Kim%20Harrison">Kim Harrison</a>'s "<a href="Hollows%20%28series%29">The Hollows</a>" series, portray the vampire in a variety of new perspectives, some of them unrelated to the original legends. Vampires in the <a href="Twilight%20%28novel%20series%29">"Twilight" series</a> (2005–2008) by <a href="Stephenie%20Meyer">Stephenie Meyer</a> ignore the effects of garlic and crosses and are not harmed by sunlight, although it does reveal their supernatural status. <a href="Richelle%20Mead">Richelle Mead</a> further deviates from traditional vampires in her <a href="Vampire%20Academy%20%28series%29">"Vampire Academy" series</a> (2007–present), basing the novels on Romanian lore with two races of vampires, one good and one evil, as well as half-vampires.

Considered one of the preeminent figures of the classic horror film, the vampire has proven to be a rich subject for the film and gaming industries. <a href="Dracula%20in%20popular%20culture">Dracula is a major character</a> in more films than any other but <a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>, and many early films were either based on the novel "Dracula" or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 German silent film "<a href="Nosferatu">Nosferatu</a>", directed by <a href="F.%20W.%20Murnau">F. W. Murnau</a> and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic "Dracula"s, Murnau could not obtain permission to do so from Stoker's widow, and had to alter many aspects of the film. Universal's "<a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">Dracula</a>" (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count, was the first <a href="sound%20film">talking film</a> to portray Dracula. The decade saw several more vampire films, most notably "<a href="Dracula%27s%20Daughter">Dracula's Daughter</a>" in 1936.
The legend of the vampire continued through the film industry when Dracula was reincarnated in the pertinent <a href="Hammer%20Horror">Hammer Horror</a> series of films, starring <a href="Christopher%20Lee">Christopher Lee</a> as the Count. The successful 1958 "<a href="Dracula%20%281958%20film%29">Dracula</a>" starring Lee was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these and became well known in the role. By the 1970s, vampires in films had diversified with works such as "<a href="Count%20Yorga%2C%20Vampire">Count Yorga, Vampire</a>" (1970), an African Count in 1972's "<a href="Blacula">Blacula</a>", the BBC's "<a href="Count%20Dracula%20%281977%29">Count Dracula</a>" featuring French actor <a href="Louis%20Jourdan">Louis Jourdan</a> as Dracula and <a href="Frank%20Finlay">Frank Finlay</a> as <a href="Abraham%20Van%20Helsing">Abraham Van Helsing</a>, and a Nosferatu-like vampire in 1979's "<a href="Salem%27s%20Lot%20%281979%20TV%20mini-series%29">Salem's Lot</a>", and a remake of "Nosferatu" itself, titled <a href="Nosferatu%20the%20Vampyre">Nosferatu the Vampyre</a> with <a href="Klaus%20Kinski">Klaus Kinski</a> the same year. Several films featured the characterisation of a female, often lesbian, vampire such as Hammer Horror's "<a href="The%20Vampire%20Lovers">The Vampire Lovers</a>" (1970), based on "Carmilla", though the plotlines still revolved around a central evil vampire character.
The <a href="Gothic%20fiction">Gothic</a> <a href="soap%20opera">soap opera</a> "<a href="Dark%20Shadows">Dark Shadows</a>", on American television from 1966 to 1971 and produced by <a href="Dan%20Curtis">Dan Curtis</a>, featured the vampire character <a href="Barnabas%20Collins">Barnabas Collins</a>, portrayed by Canadian actor <a href="Jonathan%20Frid">Jonathan Frid</a>, which proved partly responsible for making the series one of the most popular of its type, amassing a total of 1,225 episodes in its nearly five-year run. The pilot for the later Dan Curtis 1972 television series "" revolved around reporter Carl Kolchak hunting a vampire on the <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Strip">Las Vegas Strip</a>. Later films showed more diversity in plotline, with some focusing on the vampire-hunter, such as <a href="Blade%20%28comics%29">Blade</a> in the <a href="Marvel%20Comics">Marvel Comics</a>' <a href="Blade%20%28film%20series%29">"Blade"</a> films and the film "<a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28film%29">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>". "Buffy", released in 1992, foreshadowed a vampiric presence on television, with adaptation to a long-running hit <a href="Buffy%20the%20Vampire%20Slayer%20%28TV%20series%29">series of the same name</a> and its spin-off "<a href="Angel%20%281999%20TV%20series%29">Angel</a>". Still others showed the vampire as protagonist, such as 1983's "<a href="The%20Hunger%20%281983%20film%29">The Hunger</a>", 1994's "<a href="Interview%20with%20the%20Vampire%20%28film%29">Interview with the Vampire</a>" and its indirect sequel of sorts "<a href="Queen%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28film%29">Queen of the Damned</a>", and the 2007 series "<a href="Moonlight%20%28TV%20series%29">Moonlight</a>". The 1992 film "<a href="Bram%20Stoker%27s%20Dracula">Bram Stoker's Dracula</a>" became the then-highest grossing vampire film ever.

In his documentary "Vampire Princess" (2007) the investigative Austrian author and director <a href="Klaus%20T.%20Steindl">Klaus T. Steindl</a> discovered 2007 the historical inspiration for Bram Stoker's legendary Dracula character (see also Literature - Bram Stoker: Dracula's Guest): ""Many experts believe, the deleted opening was actually based on a woman. Archaeologists, historians, and forensic scientists revisit the days of vampire hysteria in the eighteenth-century Czech Republic and re-open the unholy grave of dark princess <a href="Eleonore%20von%20Schwarzenberg">Eleonore von Schwarzenberg</a>. They uncover her story, once buried and long forgotten, now raised from the dead.""

This increase of interest in vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as "<a href="Underworld%20%282003%20film%29">Underworld</a>" and "<a href="Van%20Helsing%20%28film%29">Van Helsing</a>", and the Russian "<a href="Night%20Watch%20%282004%20film%29">Night Watch</a>" and a TV miniseries remake of "<a href="Salem%27s%20Lot%20%282004%20TV%20miniseries%29">Salem's Lot</a>", both from 2004. The series "<a href="Blood%20Ties%20%28TV%20series%29">Blood Ties</a>" premiered on <a href="Lifetime%20Television">Lifetime Television</a> in 2007, featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy, illegitimate son of <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">Henry VIII of England</a> turned vampire, in modern-day <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role. A 2008 series from HBO, entitled "<a href="True%20Blood">True Blood</a>", gives a <a href="Southern%20Gothic">Southern Gothic</a> take to the vampire theme.

In 2008 the <a href="BBC%20Three%20%28former%29">BBC Three</a> series "<a href="Being%20Human%20%28UK%20TV%20series%29">Being Human</a>" became popular in Britain. It featured an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>. Another popular vampire-related show is CW's "<a href="The%20Vampire%20Diaries">The Vampire Diaries</a>". The continuing popularity of the vampire theme has been ascribed to a combination of two factors: the representation of <a href="human%20sexual%20behavior">sexuality</a> and the perennial dread of mortality.

The <a href="role-playing%20game">role-playing game</a> "" has been influential upon modern vampire fiction and elements of its terminology, such as "embrace" and "sire", appear in contemporary fiction. Popular <a href="List%20of%20vampire%20video%20games">video games about vampires</a> include "<a href="Castlevania">Castlevania</a>", which is an extension of the original Bram Stoker novel "Dracula", and "<a href="Legacy%20of%20Kain">Legacy of Kain</a>".
