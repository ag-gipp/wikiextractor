Star Trek V: The Final Frontier

Star Trek V: The Final Frontier is a 1989 American <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> directed by <a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> and based on the created by <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a>. It is the fifth installment in the <a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%20series%29">"Star Trek" film series</a>. Taking place shortly after the events of "" (1986), its plot follows the crew of the <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-A%29">USS "Enterprise"-A</a> as they confront a renegade <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Vulcan</a>, Sybok, who is searching for <a href="God">God</a> at the <a href="Galactic%20Center">center of the galaxy</a>.

The film was directed by cast member William Shatner, following two films being directed by his co-star <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a>. Shatner also developed the initial storyline, in which Sybok searches for God, but instead finds an alien being; his primary inspiration was the phenomenon of <a href="televangelism">televangelism</a> and the high potential for fraud among its practitioners. Series creator Gene Roddenberry disliked the original script, while Nimoy and <a href="DeForest%20Kelley">DeForest Kelley</a> objected to the premise that their characters, <a href="Spock">Spock</a> and <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a>, would betray Shatner's <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>. The script went through multiple revisions to please the cast and <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, including cuts in the effects-laden climax of the film. Despite a <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild</a> strike cutting into the film's pre-production, Paramount commenced filming in October 1988. Many "Star Trek" veterans assisted in the film's production; <a href="art%20director">art director</a> <a href="Nilo%20Rodis">Nilo Rodis</a> developed the designs for many of the film's locales, shots, and characters, while <a href="Herman%20Zimmerman">Herman Zimmerman</a> served as its <a href="production%20designer">production designer</a>. Production problems plagued the film on set and during location shooting in <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite National Park</a> and the <a href="Mojave%20Desert">Mojave Desert</a>. As effects house <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a>'s best crews were busy and would be too expensive, the production used <a href="Bran%20Ferren">Bran Ferren</a>'s company for the film's effects, which had to be revised several times in order to lower production costs. The film's ending was reworked because of poor test-audience reaction, and the failure of planned special effects. <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a>, composer for "", returned to score "The Final Frontier".

"The Final Frontier" was released in North America on June 9, 1989, by Paramount Pictures. It had the highest opening gross of any "Star Trek" film in at that point and was number one in its first week at the box office, but its grosses quickly dropped in subsequent weeks. The film received generally mixed to poor reviews by critics on release, and according to its producer, nearly killed the franchise. The next entry in the series, "" (1991), received a more positive reception.

The crew of the newly-<a href="Ship%20commissioning">commissioned</a> are enjoying <a href="shore%20leave">shore leave</a> after the starship's <a href="shakedown%20cruise">shakedown cruise</a> goes poorly. At <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite National Park</a>, <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>, recently demoted back to <a href="Captain%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Captain</a> after the events of the previous two films, is camping with <a href="Spock">Spock</a> and Dr. <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a>. Their leave is interrupted when "Enterprise" is ordered by <a href="Starfleet%23Starfleet%20Command">Starfleet Command</a> to rescue human, <a href="Klingon">Klingon</a>, and <a href="Romulan">Romulan</a> hostages on the planet <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20planets%20%28M%E2%80%93Q%29">Nimbus III</a>. Learning of "Enterprise"s mission, the Klingon Captain Klaa decides to pursue Kirk for personal glory.

On Nimbus III, the crew of "Enterprise" discovers that renegade <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Vulcan</a> <a href="Sybok">Sybok</a>, Spock's half-brother, is behind the hostage crisis. Sybok reveals the hostage situation was a ruse to lure a starship to Nimbus III. Sybok wants to use a ship to reach the mythical planet <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20planets%20%28R%E2%80%93S%29">Sha Ka Ree</a>, the place where creation began; the planet lies behind a seemingly impenetrable barrier near the center of the galaxy. Sybok uses his unique ability to reveal and heal the innermost pain of a person through the <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29">mind meld</a> to subvert the wills of the hostages and crew members. Only Spock and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain is what makes him human. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate "Enterprise" to Sha Ka Ree.

The ship successfully breaches the barrier, pursued by Klaa's vessel, and discovers a lone blue planet. Sybok, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy journey to the surface, where Sybok calls out to his perceived vision of God. An entity appears, and when told of how Sybok breached the barrier, demands that the starship be brought closer to the planet. When a skeptical Kirk inquires, "What does God need with a starship?", the entity attacks him in retribution. The others doubt a god who would inflict harm on people for pleasure.

Realizing his foolishness, Sybok sacrifices himself in an effort to combat the creature and allow the others to escape. Intent on stopping the being, Kirk orders "Enterprise" to fire a <a href="Weapons%20in%20Star%20Trek">photon torpedo</a> at their location, to little effect. Spock and McCoy are beamed back to the ship, but Klaa's vessel attacks "Enterprise" before Kirk can be transported aboard. The vengeful entity reappears and tries to kill Kirk when Klaa's vessel destroys it in a hail of fire. Kirk is beamed aboard the Klingon ship, where Spock and the Klingon General Korrd force Klaa to stand down. The crews of "Enterprise" and the Klingon ships celebrate a new <a href="d%C3%A9tente">détente</a>, and Kirk, Spock, and McCoy resume their vacation at Yosemite.




The other members of the USS "Enterprise"-A crew include chief engineer <a href="Scotty%20%28Star%20Trek%29">Montgomery Scott</a> (<a href="James%20Doohan">James Doohan</a>), helmsman <a href="Hikaru%20Sulu">Hikaru Sulu</a> (<a href="George%20Takei">George Takei</a>), navigator <a href="Pavel%20Chekov">Pavel Chekov</a> (<a href="Walter%20Koenig">Walter Koenig</a>), and communications officer <a href="Uhura">Nyota Uhura</a> (<a href="Nichelle%20Nichols">Nichelle Nichols</a>). Takei said that despite studio pressure to complete the film on time, Shatner maintained a creative and enthusiastic atmosphere on set. "I have enormous admiration for his ability to block that kind of pressure from seeping on to the set." Takei said that he found the biggest challenge of the film was learning to ride horses. Moreover, Takei acknowledged, "despite our sometimes strained personal history, I found working with Bill [Shatner] as a director to be surprisingly pleasant."

Casting director Bill Shepard was in charge of filling additional roles. He combed through initial auditions with promising actors, then presented his choices to Shatner. Both men called the actors back as many as two or three times before each role was cast. Additional players include Todd Bryant as Klingon Captain Klaa, with <a href="Spice%20Williams-Crosby">Spice Williams-Crosby</a> as Vixis, Klaa's lieutenant. Bryant was playing <a href="Table%20tennis">ping pong</a> at a beach party when a casting director offered him the role. Bryant performed his audition twice, as Shatner requested that he repeat his performance speaking in Klingon. Williams-Crosby thought Vixis was Kirk's girlfriend when she arrived for her audition, but recalled afterwards that it was "fun" to play a villain. <a href="David%20Warner%20%28actor%29">David Warner</a>, <a href="Charles%20Cooper%20%28actor%29">Charles Cooper</a>, and <a href="Cynthia%20Gouw">Cynthia Gouw</a> play the Federation, Klingon, and Romulan ambassadors to Nimbus III. Warner did not audition, but agreed to the role after Shatner swore that his character would survive the film. The director originally intended <a href="George%20Murdock%20%28actor%29">George Murdock</a> to play the Klingon diplomat Korrd, but changed his mind on seeing Cooper's performance. Murdock was recast as the "God" entity. <a href="Bill%20Quinn">Bill Quinn</a> played McCoy's father in one of his last roles. Producer <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> made a cameo as a Starfleet admiral.

During the 1966–69 "" television series, Shatner and Nimoy's lawyers drafted what Shatner termed a "<a href="Most%20favoured%20nation">favored nations</a> clause", with the result that whatever Shatner received—e.g., a pay raise or script control—Nimoy also got and vice versa. Nimoy had directed "" and "". Shatner had previously directed plays and television episodes; when he signed on for "The Voyage Home" following a pay dispute, Shatner was promised he could direct the next film.

Shatner conceived his idea for the film's story before he was officially given the director's job. His inspiration was <a href="televangelists">televangelists</a>; "They [the televangelists] were repulsive, strangely horrifying, and yet I became absolutely fascinated," he recalled. Shatner was intrigued that not only did these personalities convince others God was speaking directly to them, but they became wealthy by what Shatner considered false messages. The televangelists formed the basis for the character Zar, later Sybok. Shatner's first outline was titled "An Act of Love", and many of its elements—the Yosemite vacation, the abduction of Klingon, human and Romulan hostages on the failed paradise planet—survived to the final film. In Shatner's early draft, Kirk is overwhelmed by Zar's superior numbers of followers and Spock, McCoy and the rest of the "Enterprise" crew come to believe in Zar's divinity. Kirk feigns acceptance of Zar's beliefs to travel with him to the God planet, which to Shatner would be a desolate, fiery waste. When Kirk confronts "God", the image of the being transforms into that of <a href="Satan">Satan</a>, and Kirk, Spock, and McCoy split up in their escape. Kirk eludes capture but goes back to save his friends from being carried away to <a href="Hell">Hell</a>.

Shatner had presented his idea to studio head Frank Mancuso while filming "The Voyage Home". Mancuso liked Shatner's idea and agreed to hire a writer to draft a <a href="film%20treatment">film treatment</a>. Shatner wanted novelist <a href="Eric%20Van%20Lustbader">Eric Van Lustbader</a>, but negotiations between Lustbader and Paramount failed over the author's requested $1 million salary. Shatner dictated the story himself and gave it to Paramount's production president Ned Tanen for input.

Producer <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> was exhausted by his work on the previous three "Star Trek" films and wanted to move on, feeling that he was not part of the "Star Trek" "family" and that he had been mistreated by Nimoy. When Shatner tried to convince Bennett to reconsider, the producer insisted on a meeting at his home. After several hours of discussion Bennett agreed to return. Bennett disagreed with several elements of Shatner's story, feeling that because no one could assuredly answer the question of God's existence, the ending of the film would never be satisfying. Bennett also told Shatner that the film had the feeling of a <a href="Symphonic%20poem">tone poem</a> rather than an adventure story. The studio agreed with Bennett, reasoning that the subject matter could be too weighty or offensive to theatergoers.

Shatner and Bennett began reworking the story. Concerned that knowing the renegade Sybok's motivation from the beginning of the story was anticlimactic, the team moved the revelation to later in the story. Shatner said that Bennett also suggested turning the God entity into an "evil alien pretending to be God for his own gain". Having satisfied themselves and Paramount with the adjustments, Shatner and Bennett approached "" writer and director <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a> to pen the script, but he was unavailable. Bennett found a script by <a href="David%20Loughery">David Loughery</a> and showed his work to Shatner, who agreed that he would be a good fit for the task of scripting "Star Trek".

Not everyone was happy with the story. "Star Trek" creator <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> objected to the characters' search for God in general, and more particularly, the idea of a God as portrayed by Western religion. One of Roddenberry's employees suggested some of his employer's animosity towards the story stemmed back to "". Roddenberry had wanted to approach that film with similar ideas that investigated the nature of God but was rejected by Paramount. Roddenberry, Nimoy and Kelley all disagreed that Spock and McCoy would betray Kirk, which Loughery explained was done to give a conflict in which "one man stands alone" from the rest.

Loughery stopped work on the script when the <a href="Writers%20Guild%20of%20America">Writers Guild of America</a> went <a href="1988%20Writers%20Guild%20of%20America%20strike">on strike</a>, and the production was further delayed when Nimoy began working on another project. During this time, Shatner reconsidered elements of the "Star Trek V" story; he made Sybok's character softer and more sympathetic. When the writers' strike ended Loughery returned to work on the script while Shatner flew to the Himalayas for a job. When he returned, he felt betrayed by Loughery's revisions, which he felt transformed the search for God into the search for the mythical paradise Sha Ka Ree—a word play on "Sean Connery", whom they wanted for Sybok's role. Though Shatner convinced Bennett and Loughery to revise much of the script, Sha Ka Ree remained; it was changed to a place of ultimate knowledge of which Sybok had received visions. The script was also rewritten to address Nimoy and Kelley's concerns.

While Roddenberry, Kelley and Nimoy gave their approval to the revised script, Paramount was concerned that the film would go over-budget as written and ordered cuts. Shatner's envisioned angels and demons at the film's climax were converted to rock monsters that the false god would animate from the earth. Shatner wanted six of the creatures, but was forced to accept just one. Concerned that the franchise's momentum following "The Voyage Home" had disappeared, Paramount rushed the film into production in late 1988 despite the writers' strike cutting into pre-production.

Nilo Rodis, who had worked on two previous "Star Trek" features, was appointed the role of <a href="art%20director">art director</a>, and worked with Shatner to establish the film's visual design. Shatner sought a grittier and more realistic feel to the "Star Trek" universe, and so the two worked together to visualize the film from start to finish. After Shatner explained the entire story in a day-long session, Rodis went home and sketched out each scene from the script. Shatner was pleased with the results, especially with Rodis' designs for Shatner's most expansive or dramatic shots.

Rodis's input in developing the early character and costume designs was significant. Shatner praised his costume designs as being futuristic but plausible and in keeping with the continuity established in previous "Star Trek" films. After being disappointed by the costume designers approached to realize Rodis's ideas, Shatner suggested that Rodis become the costume designer as well. Bennett hired Dodie Shepard as the costume supervisor; Shepard's role was to oversee the costume fabrication and keep track of the clothes during filming. To save on costs, Shepard clothed extras with existing items from <a href="Western%20Costume">Western Costume</a>'s warehouses. The constrained budget meant Shatner could not completely redesign the <a href="Starfleet%20uniforms">Starfleet uniforms</a>, but Rodis created new brown field uniforms for the film's location scenes as well as the leisure clothes the crew wears during shore leave.

Rodis and Shatner also drew up sketches of what the various aliens seen in the film would look like. Shatner picked Kenny Myers as the special-effects makeup artist. Myers discussed the sketches with Shatner and made casts of actors' faces using dental <a href="Alginic%20acid">alginate</a>. These casts were used for close-up, high-quality "A" makeups, as well as less complicated masks for far-away and background characters. Shatner hired <a href="Richard%20Snell%20%28make-up%20artist%29">Richard Snell</a> as makeup supervisor, advising him to make each Klingon forehead distinct.

Shatner hired <a href="Herman%20F.%20Zimmerman">Herman Zimmerman</a> as production designer. His decision was based on Zimmerman's work on the sets for "", and he felt that the designer could convey Shatner's futuristic yet grounded aesthetic. Zimmerman was immediately put in charge of designing all-new sets for the Klingon <a href="Klingon%20starships">Bird-of-Prey</a> bridge, the "Enterprise"s bridge, elevator shafts and bowels, and Nimbus III interiors. At one point, he was building five sets at once. Art department head <a href="Michael%20Okuda">Michael Okuda</a> created <a href="LCARS">LCARS</a> backlit controls on the Klingon ship and "Enterprise". The corridors for the "Enterprise" were the same as those used in the "Next Generation" television series. The bridge set alone cost $250,000. The Nimbus III city of Paradise was one of the last locations to be designed and created, because its design relied on what exterior location and terrain was used. Zimmerman created a sketch of the town's layout over three days, drawing inspiration from a circular Moroccan fortress. Creation of the city cost $500,000 and took five weeks of construction in heat.

Tim Downs scouted possible areas for location filming. He looked for a location that could stand in for three different venues without the production having to move or change hotels: the film's opening scene; the God planet's establishing shots; and the Nimbus III Paradise City. Downs was familiar with the <a href="Mojave%20desert">Mojave desert</a> and thought that locations near <a href="Ridgecrest%2C%20California">Ridgecrest, California</a>, would serve the production's needs, so he took photos based on sketches Rodis had provided of what the locations might look like. Downs also shot photos with filters and tried to accomplish dust effects with his car to replicate ideas for how some sequences would be shot. When Downs returned with the photos, Shatner felt that the locations the scout found would be perfect for the film.

Principal photography began in October 1988, in and around Los Angeles, California. Shortly before the beginning of location shooting, Hollywood union truck drivers or <a href="teamster">teamster</a>s went on strike to protest pay cuts and overtime changes. With deadlines looming, the production searched for non-union drivers, aware that the Teamsters might retaliate by sabotaging equipment or flying airplanes above the filming to ruin audio recordings. After one of the production's camera trucks exploded in the studio parking lot, the non-union drivers headed to <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite National Park</a> under cover of darkness with a police escort.

The film's Yosemite scenes were all shot on location. Long shots of Kirk scaling the mountain were filmed with stunt doubles, while Shatner's closer shots had him on a fiberglass set positioned in front of the camera, with the real mountains visible in the background. Aided by two trainers, Shatner had spent weeks at the Paramount lot, learning to climb a wooden replica. Laszlo scouted out a tall peak on which the production created a rock face with safety net. The overhead shot gave the impression Kirk was climbing at a great height, while unnatural background features such as swimming pools were camouflaged. In the scene, Spock watches Kirk's ascent, and saves him when he slips and falls using levitating boots. Most of the shots framed Nimoy from the waist up; in these scenes the actor was supported by a crane that gave the appropriate "float" to achieve the effect. Bluescreen footage of Shatner falling was shot later at Paramount and composited, while stuntman Ken Bates set a record for the highest American descender fall by plummeting off <a href="El%20Capitan">El Capitan</a>—with a wire support rig—for long shots. In reviewing the dailies of the first two days of shooting, the production realized that a pine tree in the frame during Kirk and Spock's mountain dialogue ruined the illusion of height, while a shot of Shatner clinging to the face of El Capitan appeared muddy due to clouds obscuring the sun and ruining the depth of field. The scenes had to be reshot later.

After the Yosemite shots, location shooting moved to desert locales. Nimbus III and its town, Paradise City, were recreated in the Mojave. The town was created as a haphazard collection of spaceship parts and futuristic scrap. Shatner "cracked" during the filming in heat, insulting the head electrician and ignoring Laszlo's request for additional setup time. When a driver failed to appear and stranded Shatner and a skeleton crew, a park ranger came to the rescue and the production managed to film scenes of Sybok's followers before they lost daylight. Shatner called the resulting half-jogging pace of the dehydrated extras "the Sybok shuffle". The production spent three more weeks filming the rest of the desert scenes, finishing the last night scene shortly before sunrise and the trip back to Los Angeles.

At Paramount, the crew filmed all the scenes that would take place on soundstages, including the "Enterprise" and Bird-of-Prey sets, the Paradise City interiors, and the campfire location. Production was smoother on set, and the crew shot scenes ahead of schedule. The crew fabricated a stand-in set for the God planet location, where additional scenes were filmed to combine with the location footage. Spock's catching of Kirk as the captain falls off El Capitan was filmed against a set that replicated the forest floor and was rotated ninety degrees.

Shatner scheduled the campfire scenes to be the last ones shot, after which the cast and crew had a small celebration before a traditional wrap party later. The cast celebrated the end of filming in the last week of December 1988, and gave a press conference on the set of the "Enterprise" bridge on December 28. Shatner returned to Paramount Studios a few days after principal photography had wrapped to organize the film's post-production schedule. This included showing a rough cut of the film—minus the special effects—to studio personnel. Shatner recalled that the film received praise and left the screening "reveling" in its reception; it turned out to be a "momentary victory" once he saw the special effects.

During the writers' strike, producer <a href="Ralph%20Winter%20%28producer%29">Ralph Winter</a> confronted what writer Paul Mandell termed an "unenviable" effects situation. <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a> had provided the effects for the three previous "Star Trek" films, and Winter wanted them to work on "The Final Frontier". However, all of the effects house's best technicians were busy working on "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>" and "<a href="Ghostbusters%20II">Ghostbusters II</a>". With a stretched budget and short timeframe, Winter had to look elsewhere. To save time and money, he planned to create as many effects as he could either on stage, or through camera trickery. The producers solicited test footage from various effects houses to judge which was best able to create the film's main effects, including the planet Sha Ka Ree and the godlike being which resided there. <a href="Bran%20Ferren">Bran Ferren</a>'s effects company Associates and Ferren was picked. Ferren had worked on films such as "<a href="Altered%20States">Altered States</a>" and "<a href="Little%20Shop%20of%20Horrors%20%28film%29">Little Shop of Horrors</a>"; hiring the New York-based studio made "The Final Frontier" the first film in the "Star Trek" series produced on both the east and west coasts of the United States.
Associates and Ferren had three months to complete the effects work—around half the usual industry timeframe. Shatner insisted on viewing lots of test footage before he proceeded with each shot, requesting time-consuming changes if he did not like an effect. Ferren promoted a "low-tech" approach to realizing complicated effects, but his cost estimates were too expensive and interfered with the scope of other live-action sequences. Winter recalled that the production had budgeted $4 million for the film's effects, slightly more than "The Voyage Home". "The first pass", he said, "with all the things [Shatner] wanted, was [$5 or $6] million". Combined with Ferren's figures, the film's budget climbed to $33 million. The studio called a meeting with executives and began cutting out effects shots.

To reduce the optical effects workload, Ferren rejected <a href="Chroma%20key">bluescreen</a> compositing, opting instead for <a href="rear%20projection">rear projection</a>. This cheaper process, he reasoned, would save time, and would make sense for elements such as the "Enterprise"s bridge viewer, where compositing would lack the softness of a real transmitted image. Designer Lynda Weinman used a <a href="Mac%20II">Mac II</a> to create the <a href="Storyboard%23Animatics">animatics</a> cut into the film during production, which were eventually replaced by the film's finished effects.

The rock monster climax of the film was ultimately dropped due to difficulties during filming. The monster, dubbed the Rockman, was a large latex rubber suit that breathed fire on command. Effects personnel smoked cigarettes and blew smoke into the suit's tubing, loading it with smoke that it would slowly emit, obscuring some obvious rubber parts. On the last day of location shooting, the Rockman began suffering mechanical problems; the suit stopped breathing fire, and the desert wind dissipated the smoke. The result, Shatner wrote, was that "our guy in the silly rubber suit ultimately just looked like ... well, a guy in a silly rubber suit." With no time to return to the location, Shatner was forced to get wide shots and hope that the setting could be reproduced in the studio, but admitted that it was likely not going to work for the film.

Once back at the studio for non-location filming, Shatner and Ferren met to discuss how to replace the Rockman. The agreed-upon idea was an "amorphous blob of light and energy" that would rise up and chase after Kirk, shape-shifting while in pursuit. The visuals took weeks before they were ready to be shown after the completion of principal photography. When Shatner saw the effects, however, he was extremely disappointed with the low quality. Bennett and Shatner attempted to get money to reshoot the final scenes of the film, but Paramount turned them down.

ILM delivered the main "Enterprise" model, which was built by Magicam in 1978 for "", to Associates and Ferren. However, scenes which included the "Enterprise" in the <a href="Earth%20Spacedock">Earth-orbiting Spacedock</a> platform, as well as the Spacedock itself, were taken directly from ILM's previous work in "Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home". The "Enterprise" model had been damaged when it was loaned out for touring purposes, meaning the 30,000 panels on the model had to be repainted by hand. While production wrapped, Ferren continued work on the miniatures and other optical effects at his New Jersey studio. The opticals were completed in Manhattan before being sent west; for example, bluescreen footage of the motion controlled miniatures was filmed in Hoboken, New Jersey. In New York, the blue screen was replaced by a moving starfield—a single finished shot of a ship moving through space required as many as fifty pieces of film. The Great Barrier effects were created using chemicals, which were dropped into a large water tank to create swirls and other reactions. The "God column", in which the false god appeared, was created by a rapidly rotating cylinder through which light was shone; the result appeared on film as a column of light. Ferren used a <a href="beam%20splitter">beam splitter</a> to project actor George Murdock's head into the cylinder, giving the appearance that the false god resided within the column.

Days after filming was completed, Shatner returned to Paramount to supervise the film's edit, soundscape creation and score, and integration of optical effects. Editor <a href="Peter%20E.%20Berger">Peter E. Berger</a> had already assembled rough cuts of various sequences, and with only weeks before the film's scheduled completion, the production team set about the task of salvaging the film's ending through editing. The false god's screen time was reduced, and Ferren's "god blob" effect was replaced with a closeup of the actor's face, along with shots of lightning and smoke. At the time, Shatner felt that the edits "pulled a rabbit out of a hat", solving many of the film's problems.

Shatner's cut ran slightly over two hours (not including end credits or the opticals), which Paramount thought was too long. Their target runtime was one hour forty-five minutes, which would guarantee twice-nightly theatrical screenings. Bennett was handed the task of shortening the film's running time, despite Shatner's view that nothing could possibly be removed. Shatner was horrified by Bennett's edit, and the two haggled over what parts to restore or cut.

In early test screenings, the film received negative reviews. Of the first test audience, only a small portion considered the film "excellent", a rating that most other "Star Trek" films had enjoyed. Segments of the film were re-edited for the theatrical release. Five minutes of footage was excised to improve the film's pacing, and an additional scene was included on the Bird-of-Prey to make the circumstances of Kirk's rescue clearer. The second screening, with the final effects and sound in place, received much better reviews.

Music critic <a href="Jeff%20Bond">Jeff Bond</a> wrote that Shatner made "at least two wise decisions" in making "The Final Frontier"; beyond choosing Luckinbill as Sybok, he hired <a href="Jerry%20Goldsmith">Jerry Goldsmith</a> to compose the film's score. Goldsmith had written the Academy Award-nominated score for "", and the new "Trek" film was an opportunity to craft music with a similar level of ambition while adding action and character—two elements largely missing from "The Motion Picture". Goldsmith did not want to accentuate the film's comedy with music, feeling it would "[take] drama to the point of silliness". He focused on the God planet as his most difficult task.

Goldsmith's main theme begins with the traditional opening notes from <a href="Alexander%20Courage">Alexander Courage</a>'s original television series theme; an ascending string and electronic bridge leads to a rendition of the march from "The Motion Picture". According to Jeff Bond, Goldsmith's use of "The Motion Picture"s march led to some confusion among "" fans, as they were unfamiliar with the music's origins. Another theme from "The Motion Picture" to make a return appearance is the Klingon theme from the 1979 film's opening scene. Here, the theme is treated in what Bond termed a "Prokofiev-like style as opposed to the avant-garde counterpoint" as seen in "The Motion Picture". Goldsmith also added a crying ram's horn.

The breadth of "The Final Frontier"s locations led Goldsmith to eschew the two-themed approach of "The Motion Picture" in favor of <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s, recurring music used for locations and characters. Sybok is introduced with a synthesized motif in the opening scene of the film, while when Kirk and Spock discuss him en route to Nimbus III it is rendered in a more mysterious fashion. The motif also appears in the action cue as Kirk and company land on Nimbus III and try to free the hostages. When Sybok boards the "Enterprise", a new four-note motif played by low brass highlights the character's obsession. The Sybok theme from then on is used in either a benevolent sense or a more percussive, dark rendition. Arriving at Sha Ka Ree, the planet's five-note theme bears resemblance to Goldsmith's unicorn theme from "<a href="Legend%20%281985%20film%29">Legend</a>"; "the two melodies represent very similar ideas: lost innocence and the tragic impossibility of recapturing paradise," writes Bond. The music features cellos conveying a pious quality, while the appearance of "God" begins with string glissandos but turns to a dark rendition of Sybok's theme as its true nature is exposed. As the creature attacks Kirk, Spock and McCoy, the more aggressive Sybok theme takes on an attacking rhythm. When Spock appeals to the Klingons for help, the theme takes on a sensitive character before returning to a powerful sequence as the ship destroys the god-creature.

The original soundtrack for the film was originally released by Epic Records, and included nine score tracks (mostly out of film order) and the song "The Moon Is a Window to Heaven" by <a href="Hiroshima%20%28band%29">Hiroshima</a>. On Tuesday November 30, 2010, La-La Land Records reissued the soundtrack in a two-CD edition featuring the film's complete score on the first disc and the original soundtrack album and some alternate cues on the second disc.

<a href="Mark%20Mangini">Mark Mangini</a> served as "The Final Frontier"s sound designer; he had previously worked on "The Voyage Home". Because Mangini was concerned about creating continuity within "Star Trek"s sounds, he decided to reuse some effects rather than create new and different-sounding ones—as such, the Bird-of-Prey's cloak effect, beaming sounds, and the "Enterprise" engines sound similar to that of past movies. Mangini collaborated with Shatner to work out how the completely new effects would sound. For Sybok's mind melds, Shatner wanted the sounds of beating hearts and breathing.

Mangini was also responsible for the film's <a href="Foley%20%28filmmaking%29">foley</a> and <a href="post-synchronization">dialogue replacement</a>; foley editors created background audio in sync with actions on screen to enrich the soundscape. The sound of Klingons walking, for example, was conveyed with chains and leather for a "rough" sound.

"The Final Frontier" appeared amidst several other films that grappled with quests for God and spiritual meaning; author Peter Hansenberg regarded the film as part of an "almost fashionable" trend of 1980s science fiction movies with religious motifs. <a href="Regent%27s%20Park%20College%2C%20Oxford">Regent's Park College</a> professor and Baptist minister Larry Kreitzer argues the film was "deliberately constructed" to raise the issues of God and the Biblical concept of paradise, Eden. <a href="Dixie%20State%20College%20of%20Utah">Dixie State College</a> professor Ace Pilkington went further, saying that after the "theological preoccupations" of the television series and previous films, "where else can the "Enterprise" go ... but in quest of God?" Pilkington notes that "The Final Frontier" has roots in many plots from the series including "<a href="The%20Way%20to%20Eden">The Way to Eden</a>" (which also deals with a brilliant man hijacking the "Enterprise" to find the place of creation), "", and ""; a common thread between the paradises described is that they are always "too good to be true". John S. Schultes agrees, pointing out that the idea of paradise has been seen many times in the series, but almost always illusory or deadened.

While many "Star Trek" episodes dealt with false deities, "The Final Frontier" is one of the few that, in the words of religious scholar Ross Shepard Kraemer, "intentionally confronted and explored theological questions, including the existence of God." Theologian Larry Kreitzer dubbed it the film most preoccupied with religious ideas. According to the film, centuries in the future, beliefs in Eden persist, even among other alien races such as the Klingons and Romulans. Moreover, the view of God is homogenized—no one disputes Sybok's references to God as a "he". Kreitzer finds that the film's theological interpretation is offered by Kirk's words: "Maybe He [God] is not out there, Bones. Maybe He's right here, in the human heart."

"The Final Frontier" was expected to be one of the summer's biggest movies and a sure hit, despite its appearing in a market crowded with other sequels and blockbusters such as "<a href="Indiana%20Jones%20and%20the%20Last%20Crusade">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</a>", "<a href="Ghostbusters%20II">Ghostbusters II</a>", and "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>". Never before had so many sequels been released at the same time. Analysts expected "The Final Frontier" to make nearly $200 million.

Marketing included an <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> computer game, part of an increasing trend of game tie-ins to movies. J. M. Dillard wrote the film's novelization, which was on <a href="The%20New%20York%20Times%20Best%20Seller%20list">"The New York Times" Best Seller list</a> for four weeks. Paramount sold "Star Trek"-branded apparel through catalogues, and Kraft made a "Star Trek"-branded marshmallow dispenser. While "Star Trek" had a built-in fan market, marketing tie-ins were risky at the time and even high-grossing films could not guarantee success of related merchandise. Unlike other summer blockbusters, "Star Trek" had no mass-market appeal and no major food or beverage promotions, but sold pins and posters in theaters, bypassing retailers.

In its first week, "The Final Frontier" was number one at the domestic box office. Its $17.4 million opening on 2,202 screens beat the $16.8 million total of "The Voyage Home" and made it the best "Star Trek" opening weekend to that point. "The Voyage Home", however, had played in only 1,349 theaters at a time with lower ticket prices. In its second week "The Final Frontier" tumbled 58% to make $7.1 million; in its third week it grossed only $3.7 million. It had a wide release of ten weeks, shorter than that of any "Star Trek" film before it.

"The Final Frontier" grossed $49,566,330 in the domestic box office for a global total of $63 million. The season proved to be another record-breaker for the film industry, with domestic summer box-office revenues of $2.05 billion. "The Final Frontier" was the season's tenth-best-grossing film, although it failed to make expected returns. It and "<a href="Pink%20Cadillac%20%28film%29">Pink Cadillac</a>" were the early summer's biggest box-office disappointments.

Critics generally gave "The Final Frontier" poor reviews. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="Weighted%20arithmetic%20mean">weighted average</a> out of 100 to critics' reviews, "The Final Frontier" received a score of 43 based on 16 reviews.

Rob Lowing of "<a href="The%20Sun%20Herald">The Sun Herald</a>" called the film "likeable but average". The "<a href="Chicago%20Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a>" <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s Rita Kempley gave the film negative reviews, calling the film "a mess" and "a shambles", respectively. "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" Caryn James considered the film to be disappointing to fans and non-fans alike, while Chris Hicks of the "<a href="Deseret%20News">Deseret News</a>" disagreed, feeling that the film approached issues in the same vein as the television series and that fans would enjoy it. Ansen and Lowing considered Shatner's direction during action sequences weak, with Lowing adding that the second half of the film felt directionless. Hicks wrote that the film's broad humor gave the film an inconsistent tone. In contrast, Chris Dafoe of the Toronto "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" called it "the most intentionally funny" episode of the film series. "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">The Christian Science Monitor</a>"s David Sterritt stated that at its best, "The Final Frontier" showed "flashes" of the humor that propelled "The Voyage Home", and Lowing deemed Shatner's direction at its best during comedic moments.
Critics such as "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>"s David Ansen judged the principal characters' performances satisfactory; "these veterans know each other's moves so well they've found a neat comic shorthand that gets more laughs out of the lines than they deserve", Ansen wrote. Stan James of "<a href="The%20Advertiser%20%28Adelaide%29">The Advertiser</a>" wrote that Warner was wasted in his role and most characters lacked any "drive and motivation". In comparison, Luckinbill's Sybok received praise from critics such as "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>"s Mike Clark, who wrote that "he has the voice and stature of the golden screen's most scintillating intellectual villains", although he felt that he never seemed threatening or suspenseful. James considered Sybok the most "distinctive, compelling villain" of the series since <a href="Khan%20Noonien%20Singh">Khan Noonien Singh</a> in "".

The special effects were generally considered poor. Murphy wrote that the film fell apart after the arrival at Sha Ka Ree, where the "great special effects that graced parts I through IV are nowhere to be seen". Ebert's review agreed, saying that the visuals managed to inspire awe ever so briefly before dissolving into "an anticlimatic special effects show with a touch of "The Wizard of Oz" thrown in for good measure". Kempley wrote the "Enterprise"s objective was "to pass through an impenetrable (Ha!) swirl of what appears to be cosmic Windex, beyond which is the planet Shockara, home of God, or perhaps California shot through a purple filter."

Bennett blamed part of "The Final Frontier"s failure on the change from a traditional Thanksgiving-season "Star Trek" opening, to the sequel-stuffed summer release period, and the diffusion of "Star Trek" fan viewership following the premiere of "The Next Generation". Winter felt they should have recognized the film's plot was too reminiscent of <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20characters%20%28T%E2%80%93Z%29">V'ger</a> from "" and that the search for God was a mistake; while he felt many parts of the film were good, they "smoked [their] own press releases" and nearly killed the franchise. Initially, Shatner believed that the film would get a positive response. In the morning after the opening night, he woke Nimoy up to tell him that the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" had given "The Final Frontier" a positive review. Soon after a local television reporter also gave the film a good review, and Shatner recalled that he incorrectly "began sensing a [positive] trend". He later agreed that the film nearly ended the film series, and looking back on the film called it a "failed but glorious attempt" at a thought-provoking film that did not come together. "Star Trek" creator <a href="Gene%20Roddenberry">Gene Roddenberry</a> considered elements of this film to be "apocryphal at best", and particularly disliked the idea that Sarek had fathered a child (<a href="Sybok">Sybok</a>) with a Vulcan before Amanda. Nevertheless, the film is considered <a href="Canon%20%28fiction%29">canon</a>. Even <a href="George%20Takei">George Takei</a> expected the film to be a disappointment because "the script seemed rather a muddle...as if three separately interesting stories force-sealed together into one" which "made for a confusing and ultimately tiresome two hours".

Considered a critical and commercial failure, the poor performance of "The Final Frontier" jeopardized the production of further "Star Trek" features. Bennett was given the go-ahead to begin work on his own prequel concept that would have cast new actors to play the main cast at Starfleet Academy. Loughery worked with Bennett on a story inspired by "<a href="Santa%20Fe%20Trail%20%28film%29">Santa Fe Trail</a>". When Paramount president <a href="Ned%20Tanen">Ned Tanen</a> resigned, support for Bennett's prequel idea evaporated. Paramount instead wanted another film with the original cast, and Bennett decided to leave the franchise. Winter remained with the production and "The Wrath of Khan" director <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a> returned to direct the original cast's final movie, "".

The film was released on <a href="VHS">VHS</a>, <a href="Pan%20and%20scan">pan-and-scan</a> <a href="LaserDisc">LaserDisc</a>, and <a href="Betamax">Betamax</a> on December 21, 1989. It was also released as a <a href="widescreen">widescreen</a> VHS edition. The VHS release was preceded by a television ad that featured a series of patrons in a video store individually demanding a copy of the movie (one of which does so while flashing the Vulcan hand gesture). The last patron beams in and it's Montgomery "Scotty" Scott (played by James Doohan) politely asking for a copy. He then turns to the camera and instructs the viewer to demand it too.

The video was among the top-selling videocassettes for weeks after its release, and it enjoyed a resurgence in popularity in the months leading to the release of its sequel; it was Paramount's top-selling title in the third quarter of 1991. A LaserDisc version of the film was released by Pioneer LDCA; "The Final Frontier" was the 21st-best-selling title for the platform in 1990.

The film was released on <a href="DVD-Video">DVD-Video</a> on April 20, 1999, as a bare-bones edition with no bonus extras. It was re-released on DVD as a 2-Disc Special Collector's Edition on October 14, 2003, with bonus extras added, including footage of the principal photography wrap press conference, an interview with Shatner the day before filming began, a retrospective documentary and a commentary track by Shatner and his daughter Liz.

Paramount released "The Final Frontier" <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray Disc</a> in May 2009 to coincide with the release of <a href="J.%20J.%20Abrams">J. J. Abrams</a>' "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>", along with the other five films featuring the original crew, packaged as "Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection". "The Final Frontier" was remastered in <a href="1080p">1080p</a> <a href="High-definition%20video">high definition</a> from the 2000 high-definition master prepared for the DVD.

Liberty Bell

The Liberty Bell is an iconic <a href="symbol">symbol</a> of American independence, located in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. Once placed in the steeple of the Pennsylvania State House (now renamed <a href="Independence%20Hall">Independence Hall</a>), the bell today is located in the Liberty Bell Center in <a href="Independence%20National%20Historical%20Park">Independence National Historical Park</a>. The bell was commissioned in 1752 by the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Provincial%20Assembly">Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly</a> from the <a href="London">London</a> firm of Lester and Pack (known subsequently as the <a href="Whitechapel%20Bell%20Foundry">Whitechapel Bell Foundry</a>), and <a href="bellfounding">was cast</a> with the lettering "Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof", a <a href="Bible">Biblical</a> reference from the <a href="Book%20of%20Leviticus">Book of Leviticus</a> (). The bell first cracked when rung after its arrival in Philadelphia, and was twice recast by local workmen John Pass and John Stow, whose last names appear on the bell. In its early years the bell was used to summon lawmakers to legislative sessions and to alert citizens about public meetings and proclamations.

Although no immediate announcement was made of the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a>'s <a href="Lee%20Resolution">vote for independence</a>, and so the bell could not have rung on July 4, 1776, related to that vote, bells were rung on July 8 to mark the reading of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">United States Declaration of Independence</a>. While there is no contemporary account of the Liberty Bell ringing, most historians believe it was one of the bells rung. After American independence was secured, the bell fell into relative obscurity until, in the 1830s, the bell was adopted as a symbol by <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> societies, who dubbed it the "Liberty Bell".

The bell acquired its distinctive large crack some time in the early 19th century—a widespread story claims it cracked while ringing after the death of <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice</a> <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a> in 1835. The bell became famous after an 1847 short story claimed that an aged bellringer rang it on July 4, 1776, upon hearing of the Second Continental Congress' vote for independence. Despite the fact that the bell did not ring for independence on that July 4, the tale was widely accepted as fact, even by some historians. Beginning in 1885, the city of Philadelphia that owns the bell, allowed it to go to various expositions and patriotic gatherings. The bell attracted huge crowds wherever it went, additional cracking occurred and pieces were chipped away by souvenir hunters. The last such journey occurred in 1915, after which the city refused further requests.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Philadelphia allowed the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> to take custody of the bell, while retaining ownership. The bell was used as a symbol of freedom during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> and was a popular site for protests in the 1960s. It was moved from its longtime home in Independence Hall to a nearby glass pavilion on <a href="Independence%20Mall%20%28Philadelphia%29">Independence Mall</a> in 1976, and then to the larger Liberty Bell Center adjacent to the pavilion in 2003. The bell has been featured on coins and stamps, and its name and image have been widely used by corporations.

Philadelphia's city bell had been used to alert the public to proclamations or civic danger since the city's 1682 founding. The original bell hung from a tree behind the Pennsylvania State House (now known as <a href="Independence%20Hall">Independence Hall</a>) and was said to have been brought to the city by its founder, <a href="William%20Penn">William Penn</a>. In 1751, with a <a href="bell%20tower">bell tower</a> being built in the Pennsylvania State House, civic authorities sought a bell of better quality that could be heard at a greater distance in the rapidly expanding city. <a href="Isaac%20Norris%20%28statesman%29">Isaac Norris</a>, speaker of the <a href="Pennsylvania%20Provincial%20Assembly">Pennsylvania Provincial Assembly</a>, gave orders to the colony's <a href="London">London</a> agent, Robert Charles, to obtain a "good Bell of about two thousands pound weight".

The inscription on the bell reads:

<poem>Proclaim LIBERTY Throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof Lev. XXV. v X.
By Order of the ASSEMBLY of the Province of PENSYLVANIA for the State House in Philad
Pass and Stow
Philad
MDCCLIII</poem>

At the time, "Pensylvania" was an accepted alternative spelling for "Pennsylvania." That spelling was used by <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, a graduate of King's College (now <a href="Columbia%20College%2C%20Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>), in 1787 on the signature page of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.

Robert Charles dutifully ordered the bell from Thomas Lester of the London bellfounding firm of Lester and Pack (known subsequently as the <a href="Whitechapel%20Bell%20Foundry">Whitechapel Bell Foundry</a>) for the sum of <a href="Pound%20sterling">£</a>150 13<a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">s</a> 8<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a>, (equivalent to £ today) including freight to Philadelphia and insurance. It arrived in Philadelphia in August 1752. Norris wrote to Charles that the bell was in good order, but they had not yet sounded it, as they were building a clock for the State House's tower. The bell was mounted on a stand to test the sound, and at the first strike of the clapper, the bell's rim cracked. The episode would be used to good account in later stories of the bell; in 1893, former <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, speaking as the bell passed through <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, stated, "This old bell was made in England, but it had to be re-cast in America before it was attuned to proclaim the right of self-government and the equal rights of men." Philadelphia authorities tried to return it by ship, but the master of the vessel that had brought it was unable to take it on board.
Two local <a href="foundry">founders</a>, John Pass and John Stow, offered to recast the bell. Though they were inexperienced in bell casting, Pass had headed the <a href="Mount%20Holly%2C%20New%20Jersey">Mount Holly</a> Iron Foundry in neighboring New Jersey and came from <a href="Malta">Malta</a> that had a tradition of bell casting. Stow, on the other hand, was only four years out of his apprenticeship as a brass founder. At Stow's foundry on Second Street, the bell was broken into small pieces, melted down, and cast into a new bell. The two founders decided that the metal was too brittle, and augmented the bell metal by about ten percent, using copper. The bell was ready in March 1753, and Norris reported that the lettering (that included the founders' names and the year) was even clearer on the new bell than on the old.

City officials scheduled a public celebration with free food and drink for the testing of the recast bell. When the bell was struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When the fruit of the two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The bell was hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.

The reason for the difficulties with the bell is not certain. The Whitechapel Foundry took the position that the bell was either damaged in transit or was broken by an inexperienced bell ringer, who incautiously sent the clapper flying against the rim, rather than the body of the bell. In 1975, the <a href="Winterthur%20Museum">Winterthur Museum</a> conducted an analysis of the metal in the bell, and concluded that "a series of errors made in the construction, reconstruction, and second reconstruction of the Bell resulted in a brittle bell that barely missed being broken up for scrap". The Museum found a considerably higher level of tin in the Liberty Bell than in other Whitechapel bells of that era, and suggested that Whitechapel made an error in the alloy, perhaps by using scraps with a high level of tin to begin the melt instead of the usual pure copper. The analysis found that, on the second recasting, instead of adding pure tin to the bell metal, Pass and Stow added cheap <a href="pewter">pewter</a> with a high lead content, and incompletely mixed the new metal into the mold. The result was "an extremely brittle alloy which not only caused the Bell to fail in service but made it easy for early souvenir collectors to knock off substantial trophies from the rim".

Dissatisfied with the bell, Norris instructed Charles to order a second one, and see if Lester and Pack would take back the first bell and credit the value of the metal towards the bill. In 1754, the Assembly decided to keep both bells; the new one was attached to the tower clock while the old bell was, by vote of the Assembly, devoted "to such Uses as this House may hereafter appoint." The Pass and Stow bell was used to summon the Assembly. One of the earliest documented mentions of the bell's use is in a letter from <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a> to Catherine Ray dated October 16, 1755: "Adieu. The Bell rings, and I must go among the Grave ones, and talk Politiks." The bell was rung in 1760 to mark the accession of <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George III</a> to the throne. In the early 1760s, the Assembly allowed a local church to use the State House for services and the bell to summon worshipers, while the church's building was being constructed. The bell was also used to summon people to public meetings, and in 1772, a group of citizens complained to the Assembly that the bell was being rung too frequently.

Despite the legends that have grown up about the Liberty Bell, it did not ring on July 4, 1776 (at least not for any reason connected with independence), as no public announcement was made of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>. When the Declaration was publicly read on July 8, 1776, there was a ringing of bells, and while there is no contemporary account of this particular bell ringing, most authorities agree that the Liberty Bell was among the bells that rang. However, there is some chance that the poor condition of the State House bell tower prevented the bell from ringing. According to John C. Paige, who wrote a historical study of the bell for the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>, "We do not know whether or not the steeple was still strong enough to permit the State House bell to ring on this day. If it could possibly be rung, we can assume it was. Whether or not it did, it has come to symbolize all of the bells throughout the United States which proclaimed Independence."

If the bell was rung, it would have been most likely rung by <a href="Andrew%20McNair">Andrew McNair</a>, who was the doorkeeper both of the Assembly and of the Congress, and was responsible for ringing the bell. As McNair was absent on two unspecified days between April and November, it might have been rung by William Hurry, who succeeded him as doorkeeper for Congress. Bells were also rung to celebrate the first anniversary of Independence on July 4, 1777.

After <a href="George%20Washington">Washington</a>'s defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Battle of Brandywine</a> on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, and the city prepared for what was seen as an inevitable British attack. Bells could easily be recast into munitions, and locals feared the Liberty Bell and other bells would meet this fate. The bell was hastily taken down from the tower, and sent by heavily guarded wagon train to the town of <a href="Bethlehem%2C%20Pennsylvania">Bethlehem</a>. Local wagoneers transported the bell to the <a href="High%20German%20Evangelical%20Reformed%20Church">Zion German Reformed Church</a> in Northampton Town, now <a href="Allentown%2C%20Pennsylvania">Allentown</a>, where it waited out the <a href="Philadelphia%20campaign%23Capture%20of%20Philadelphia">British occupation of Philadelphia</a> under the church floor boards. It was returned to Philadelphia in June 1778, after the British departure. With the steeple of the State House in poor condition (the steeple was subsequently torn down and later restored), the bell was placed in storage, and it was not until 1785 that it was again mounted for ringing.

Placed on an upper floor of the State House, the bell was rung in the early years of independence on the <a href="Fourth%20of%20July">Fourth of July</a> and on <a href="Washington%27s%20Birthday">Washington's Birthday</a>, as well as on <a href="Election%20Day%20%28politics%29">Election Day</a> to remind voters to hand in their ballots. It also rang to call students at the <a href="University%20of%20Pennsylvania">University of Pennsylvania</a> to their classes at nearby <a href="Philosophical%20Hall">Philosophical Hall</a>. Until 1799, when the state capital was moved to <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster</a>, it again rang to summon legislators into session. When <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, having no further use for its State House, proposed to tear it down and sell the land for building lots, the City of Philadelphia purchased the land, together with the building, including the bell, for $70,000, equal to $ today. In 1828, the city sold the second Lester and Pack bell to <a href="St.%20Augustine%20Church%2C%20Philadelphia">St. Augustine's Roman Catholic Church</a> that was burned down by an anti-Catholic mob in the <a href="Philadelphia%20Nativist%20Riots">Philadelphia Nativist Riots</a> of 1844. The remains of the bell were recast; the new bell is now located at <a href="Villanova%20University">Villanova University</a>.

It is uncertain how the bell came to be cracked; the damage occurred sometime between 1817 and 1846. The bell is mentioned in a number of newspaper articles during that time; no mention of a crack can be found until 1846. In fact, in 1837, the bell was depicted in an anti-slavery publication—uncracked. In February 1846 "<a href="Public%20Ledger%20%28Philadelphia%29">Public Ledger</a>" reported that the bell had been rung on February 23, 1846, in celebration of Washington's Birthday (as February 22 fell on a Sunday, the celebration occurred the next day), and also reported that the bell had long been cracked, but had been "put in order" by having the sides of the crack filed. The paper reported that around noon, it was discovered that the ringing had caused the crack to be greatly extended, and that "the old Independence Bell ... now hangs in the great city steeple irreparably cracked and forever dumb".

The most common story about the cracking of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice of the United States</a>, <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a>. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, announced that he had ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Lafayette</a> <a href="Visit%20of%20the%20Marquis%20de%20Lafayette%20to%20the%20United%20States%20%281824-25%29">on his return to the United States</a> in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British <a href="Catholic%20Relief%20Act%201829">Catholic Relief Act 1829</a>, and that some boys had been invited to ring the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.

The Pass and Stow bell was first termed "the Liberty Bell" in the New York Anti-Slavery Society's journal, "Anti-Slavery Record". In an 1835 piece, "The Liberty Bell", Philadelphians were castigated for not doing more for the abolitionist cause. Two years later, in another work of that society, the journal "Liberty" featured an image of the bell as its frontispiece, with the words "Proclaim Liberty". In 1839, Boston's Friends of Liberty, another abolitionist group, titled their journal "The Liberty Bell". The same year, <a href="William%20Lloyd%20Garrison">William Lloyd Garrison</a>'s <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">anti-slavery</a> publication "<a href="The%20Liberator%20%28anti-slavery%20newspaper%29">The Liberator</a>" reprinted a Boston abolitionist pamphlet containing a poem entitled "The Liberty Bell" that noted that, at that time, despite its inscription, the bell did not proclaim liberty to "all" the inhabitants of the land.

A great part of the modern image of the bell as a relic of the proclamation of American independence was forged by writer <a href="George%20Lippard">George Lippard</a>. On January 2, 1847, his story "Fourth of July, 1776" appeared in the Saturday Courier. The short story depicted an aged bellman on July 4, 1776, sitting morosely by the bell, fearing that <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Congress</a> would not have the courage to declare independence. At the most dramatic moment, a young boy appears with instructions for the old man: to ring the bell. It was subsequently published in Lippard's collected stories. The story was widely reprinted and closely linked the Liberty Bell to the Declaration of Independence in the public mind. The elements of the story were reprinted in early historian <a href="Benson%20J.%20Lossing">Benson J. Lossing</a>'s "The Pictorial Field Guide to the Revolution" (published in 1850) as historical fact, and the tale was widely repeated for generations after in school primers.

In 1848, with the rise of interest in the bell, the city decided to move it to the Assembly Room (also known as the Declaration Chamber) on the first floor, where the Declaration and <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> had been debated and signed. The city constructed an ornate pedestal for the bell. The Liberty Bell was displayed on that pedestal for the next quarter-century, surmounted by an eagle (originally sculpted, later stuffed). In 1853, President <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> visited Philadelphia and the bell, and spoke of the bell as symbolizing the American Revolution and American liberty. At the time, Independence Hall was also used as a courthouse, and African-American newspapers pointed out the incongruity of housing a symbol of liberty in the same building in which federal judges were holding hearings under the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Act</a>.

In February 1861, the <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">President-elect</a>, <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, came to the Assembly Room and delivered an address en route to his inauguration in Washington DC. In 1865, Lincoln's body was returned to the Assembly Room after <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">his assassination</a> for a public viewing of his body, en route to his burial in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a>. Due to time constraints, only a small fraction of those wishing to pass by the coffin were able to; the lines to see the coffin were never less than long. Nevertheless, between 120,000 and 140,000 people were able to pass by the open casket and then the bell, carefully placed at Lincoln's head so mourners could read the inscription, "Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof."

In 1876, city officials discussed what role the bell should play in the nation's Centennial festivities. Some wanted to repair it so it could sound at the <a href="Centennial%20Exposition">Centennial Exposition</a> being held in Philadelphia, but the idea was not adopted; the bell's custodians concluded that it was unlikely that the metal could be made into a bell that would have a pleasant sound, and that the crack had become part of the bell's character. Instead, a replica weighing (1,000 pounds for each of the original states) was cast. The metal used for what was dubbed "the Centennial Bell" included four melted-down cannons: one used by each side in the American Revolutionary War, and one used by each side in the Civil War. That bell was sounded at the Exposition grounds on July 4, 1876, was later recast to improve the sound, and today is the bell attached to the clock in the steeple of Independence Hall. While the Liberty Bell did not go to the Exposition, a great many Exposition visitors came to visit it, and its image was ubiquitous at the Exposition grounds—myriad souvenirs were sold bearing its image or shape, and state pavilions contained replicas of the bell made of substances ranging from stone to tobacco. In 1877, the bell was hung from the ceiling of the Assembly Room by a chain with thirteen links.
Between 1885 and 1915, the Liberty Bell made seven trips to various expositions and celebrations. Each time, the bell traveled by rail, making a large number of stops along the way so that local people could view it. By 1885, the Liberty Bell was widely recognized as a symbol of freedom, and as a treasured relic of Independence, and was growing still more famous as versions of Lippard's legend were reprinted in history and school books. In early 1885, the city agreed to let it travel to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> for the <a href="World%20Cotton%20Centennial">World Cotton Centennial</a> exposition. Large crowds mobbed the bell at each stop. In <a href="Biloxi%2C%20Mississippi">Biloxi, Mississippi</a>, the former <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">President</a> of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>, <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> came to the bell. Davis delivered a speech paying homage to it, and urging national unity. In 1893, it was sent to Chicago's <a href="World%20Columbian%20Exposition">World Columbian Exposition</a> to be the centerpiece of the state's exhibit in the Pennsylvania Building. On July 4, 1893, in Chicago, the bell was serenaded with the first performance of "<a href="The%20Liberty%20Bell%20March">The Liberty Bell March</a>", conducted by "America's Bandleader", <a href="John%20Philip%20Sousa">John Philip Sousa</a>. Philadelphians began to cool to the idea of sending it to other cities when it returned from Chicago bearing a new crack, and each new proposed journey met with increasing opposition. It was also found that the bell's private watchman had been cutting off small pieces for souvenirs. The city placed the bell in a glass-fronted oak case. In 1898, it was taken out of the glass case and hung from its yoke again in the tower hall of Independence Hall, a room that would remain its home until the end of 1975. A guard was posted to discourage souvenir hunters who might otherwise chip at it.
By 1909, the bell had made six trips, and not only had the cracking become worse, but souvenir hunters had deprived it of over one percent of its weight. When, in 1912, the organizers of the <a href="Panama-Pacific%20International%20Exposition">Panama-Pacific International Exposition</a> requested the bell for the 1915 fair in San Francisco, the city was reluctant to let it travel again. The city finally decided to let it go as the bell had never been west of St. Louis, and it was a chance to bring it to millions who might never see it otherwise. However, in 1914, fearing that the cracks might lengthen during the long train ride, the city installed a metal support structure inside the bell, generally called the "spider." In February 1915, the bell was tapped gently with wooden mallets to produce sounds that were transmitted to the fair as the signal to open it, a transmission that also inaugurated transcontinental telephone service. Some five million Americans saw the bell on its train journey west. It is estimated that nearly two million kissed it at the fair, with an uncounted number viewing it. The bell was taken on a different route on its way home; again, five million saw it on the return journey. Since the bell returned to Philadelphia, it has been moved out of doors only five times: three times for patriotic observances during and after <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and twice as the bell occupied new homes in 1976 and 2003. Chicago and San Francisco had obtained its presence after presenting petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of children. Chicago tried again, with a petition signed by 3.4 million schoolchildren, for the 1933 <a href="Century%20of%20Progress">Century of Progress</a> Exhibition and New York presented a petition to secure a visit from the bell for the <a href="1939%20New%20York%20World%27s%20Fair">1939 New York World's Fair</a>. Both efforts failed.

In 1924, one of Independence Hall's exterior doors was replaced by glass, allowing some view of the bell even when the building was closed. When Congress enacted the nation's first peacetime draft in 1940, the first Philadelphians required to serve took their oaths of enlistment before the Liberty Bell. Once the war started, the bell was again a symbol, used to sell war bonds. In the early days of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, it was feared that the bell might be in danger from saboteurs or enemy bombing, and city officials considered moving the bell to <a href="Fort%20Knox">Fort Knox</a>, to be stored with the nation's gold reserves. The idea provoked a storm of protest from around the nation, and was abandoned. Officials then considered building an underground steel vault above which it would be displayed, and into which it could be lowered if necessary. The project was dropped when studies found that the digging might undermine the foundations of Independence Hall. On December 17, 1944, the Whitechapel Bell Foundry offered to recast the bell at no cost as a gesture of Anglo-American friendship. The bell was again tapped on <a href="D-Day">D-Day</a>, as well as in victory on <a href="V-E%20Day">V-E Day</a> and <a href="V-J%20Day">V-J Day</a>.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, and following considerable controversy, the City of Philadelphia agreed that it would transfer custody of the bell and Independence Hall, while retaining ownership, to the federal government. The city would also transfer various colonial-era buildings it owned. Congress agreed to the transfer in 1948, and three years later <a href="Independence%20National%20Historical%20Park">Independence National Historical Park</a> was founded, incorporating those properties and administered by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> (NPS or Park Service). The Park Service would be responsible for maintaining and displaying the bell. The NPS would also administer the three blocks just north of Independence Hall that had been condemned by the state, razed, and developed into a park, <a href="Independence%20Mall%20%28Philadelphia%29">Independence Mall</a>.

In the postwar period, the bell became a symbol of freedom used in the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. The bell was chosen for the symbol of a <a href="savings%20bond">savings bond</a> campaign in 1950. The purpose of this campaign, as <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">Vice President</a> <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a> put it, was to make the country "so strong that no one can impose ruthless, godless ideologies on us". In 1955, former residents of nations behind the <a href="Iron%20Curtain">Iron Curtain</a> were allowed to tap the bell as a symbol of hope and encouragement to their compatriots. Foreign dignitaries, such as Israeli Prime Minister <a href="David%20Ben-Gurion">David Ben-Gurion</a> and <a href="West%20Berlin">West Berlin</a> Mayor <a href="Ernst%20Reuter">Ernst Reuter</a> were brought to the bell, and they commented that the bell symbolized the link between the United States and their nations. During the 1960s, the bell was the site of several protests, both for the <a href="civil%20rights%20movement">civil rights movement</a>, and by various protesters supporting or opposing the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.
Almost from the start of its stewardship, the Park Service sought to move the bell from Independence Hall to a structure where it would be easier to care for the bell and accommodate visitors. The first such proposal was withdrawn in 1958, after considerable public protest. The Park Service tried again as part of the planning for the 1976 <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a>. The Independence National Historical Park Advisory Committee proposed in 1969 that the bell be moved out of Independence Hall, as the building could not accommodate the millions expected to visit Philadelphia for the Bicentennial. In 1972, the Park Service announced plans to build a large glass tower for the bell at the new visitors center at South Third Street and Chestnut Street, two blocks east of Independence Hall, at a cost of $5 million, but citizens again protested the move. Instead, in 1973, the Park Service proposed to build a smaller glass pavilion for the bell at the north end of Independence Mall, between Arch and Race Streets. Philadelphia Mayor <a href="Frank%20Rizzo">Frank Rizzo</a> agreed with the pavilion idea, but proposed that the pavilion be built across Chestnut Street from Independence Hall, which the state feared would destroy the view of the historic building from the mall area. Rizzo's view prevailed, and the bell was moved to a glass-and-steel <a href="Liberty%20Bell%20Pavilion">Liberty Bell Pavilion</a>, about from its old home at Independence Hall, as the Bicentennial year began.
During the Bicentennial, members of the <a href="Procrastinators%27%20Club%20of%20America">Procrastinators' Club of America</a> jokingly picketed the Whitechapel Bell Foundry with signs "We got a lemon" and "What about the warranty?" The foundry told the protesters that it would be glad to replace the bell—so long as it was returned in the original packaging. In 1958, the foundry (then trading under the name Mears and Stainbank Foundry) had offered to recast the bell, and was told by the Park Service that neither it nor the public wanted the crack removed. The foundry was called upon, in 1976, to cast a full-size replica of the Liberty Bell (known as the Bicentennial Bell) that was presented to the United States by the British monarch, Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a>, and was housed in the tower once intended for the Liberty Bell, at the former visitor center on South Third Street.

In 1995, the Park Service began preliminary work on a redesign of Independence Mall. Architects <a href="Robert%20Venturi">Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates</a> developed a master plan with two design alternatives. The first proposed a block-long visitors center on the south side of Market Street, that would also house the Liberty Bell. This would have interrupted the mall's three-block vista of Independence Hall, and made the bell visible only from the south, i.e. Chestnut Street. The second alternative placed a similar visitors center on the north side of Market Street, also interrupting the mall's vista, with the bell in a small pavilion on the south side. City planner <a href="Edmund%20Bacon%20%28architect%29">Edmund Bacon</a>, who had overseen the mall's design in the 1950s, saw preservation of the vista of Independence Hall as essential. He created his own plan that included a domed bell pavilion built north of Market Street. Public reaction to the possibility of moving the Liberty Bell so far from Independence Hall was strongly negative. NPS announced that the bell would remain on the block between Chestnut and Market Streets. Other plans were proposed, each had strengths and weaknesses, but the goal of all was to encourage visitors to see more of the historical park than just the Liberty Bell.
The <a href="Olin%20Partnership">Olin Partnership</a> was hired to create a new master plan for Independence Mall; its team included architect <a href="Bernard%20Cywinski">Bernard Cywinski</a>, who ultimately won a limited design competition to design what was called the Liberty Bell Center (LBC). Cywinski's design was unveiled in early 1999. Significantly larger than the existing pavilion, allowing for exhibit space and an interpretive center, the proposed LBC building also would cover about 15% of the footprint of the long-demolished <a href="President%27s%20House%20%28Philadelphia%29">President's House</a>, the "White House" of <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a> and <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a>. Archaeologists excavating the LBC's intended site uncovered remnants of the 1790–1800 executive mansion that were reburied. The project became highly controversial when it was revealed that Washington's slaves had been housed only feet from the planned LBC's main entrance. The Park Service refused to redesign the LBC building, or delay its construction. Initially, NPS resisted interpreting the slaves and the slave quarters, but after years of protest by Black activists, agreed. The new facility that opened hours after the bell was installed on October 9, 2003, is adjacent to an outline of Washington's slave quarters marked in the pavement, with interpretive panels explaining the significance of what was found. The GPS address is 526 Market Street.

Inside the LBC, visitors pass through a number of exhibits about the bell before reaching the Liberty Bell itself. Due to security concerns following an attack on the bell by a visitor with a hammer in 2001, the bell is hung out of easy reach of visitors, who are no longer allowed to touch it, and all visitors undergo a security screening.

Today, the Liberty Bell weighs . Its metal is 70% copper and 25% tin, with the remainder consisting of lead, zinc, arsenic, gold and silver. It hangs from what is believed to be its original yoke, made from <a href="American%20elm">American elm</a>. While the crack in the bell appears to end at the abbreviation "Philad" in the last line of the inscription, that is merely the 19th century widened crack that was filed out in the hopes of allowing the bell to continue to ring; a hairline crack, extending through the bell to the inside continues generally right and gradually moving to the top of the bell, through the word "and" in "Pass and Stow," then through the word "the" before the word "Assembly" in the second line of text, and through the letters "rty" in the word "Liberty" in the first line. The crack ends near the attachment with the yoke.

Professor Constance M. Greiff, in her book tracing the history of Independence National Historical Park, wrote of the Liberty Bell:

<nowiki>[T]</nowiki>he Liberty Bell is the most venerated object in the park, a national icon. It is not as beautiful as some other things that were in Independence Hall in those momentous days two hundred years ago, and it is irreparably damaged. Perhaps that is part of its almost mystical appeal. Like our democracy it is fragile and imperfect, but it has weathered threats, and it has endured.

In addition to the replicas that are seen at Independence National Historical Park, early replicas of the Liberty Bell include the so-called <a href="Justice%20Bell%20%28Valley%20Forge%29">Justice Bell</a> or Women's Liberty Bell, commissioned in 1915 by <a href="suffragist">suffragist</a>s to advocate for women's suffrage. This bell had the same legend as the Liberty Bell, with two added words, "establish justice", words taken from <a href="Preamble%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">the Preamble</a> to the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>. It also had the clapper chained to the bell so it could not sound, symbolizing the inability of women, lacking the vote, to influence political events. The Justice Bell toured extensively to publicize the cause. After the passage of the <a href="Nineteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment</a> (granting women the vote), the Justice Bell was brought to the front of Independence Hall on August 26, 1920, to finally sound. It remained on a platform before Independence Hall for several months before city officials required that it be taken away, and today is at the <a href="Washington%20Memorial%20Chapel">Washington Memorial Chapel</a> at <a href="Valley%20Forge">Valley Forge</a>.
As part of the Liberty Bell Savings Bonds drive in 1950, 55 replicas of the Liberty Bell (one each for the 48 states, the District of Columbia, and the territories) were ordered by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">United States Department of the Treasury</a> and were cast in <a href="France">France</a> by the <a href="Fonderie%20Paccard">Fonderie Paccard</a>. The bells were to be displayed and rung on patriotic occasions. Many of the bells today are sited near state capitol buildings. Although Wisconsin's bell is now at its state capitol, initially it was sited on the grounds of the state's Girls Detention Center. Texas' bell is located inside the <a href="Campus%20of%20Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University%23Academic%20Building">Academic Building</a> on the campus of <a href="Texas%20A%26amp%3BM%20University">Texas A&M University</a> in <a href="College%20Station%2C%20Texas">College Station</a>. The Texas bell was presented to the university in appreciation of the service of the school's graduates. <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Walt Disney World</a> has a replica of the Liberty Bell that is located in <a href="Liberty%20Square%20%28Magic%20Kingdom%29">Liberty Square</a> in the <a href="Magic%20Kingdom">Magic Kingdom</a>. The replica was cast from the mold of the actual Liberty Bell in 1989.

The Liberty Bell appeared on a commemorative coin in 1926 to mark the sesquicentennial of American independence. Its first use on a circulating coin was on the <a href="reverse%20%28coin%29">reverse</a> side of the <a href="Franklin%20half%20dollar">Franklin half dollar</a>, struck between 1948 and 1963. It also appeared on the <a href="United%20States%20Bicentennial%20coinage">Bicentennial design</a> of the <a href="Eisenhower%20dollar">Eisenhower dollar</a>, superimposed against the moon.

On the 150th anniversary of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a> in 1926 the U.S. Post Office issued a <a href="commemorative%20stamp">commemorative stamp</a> depicting the Liberty Bell for the <a href="Sesquicentennial%20Exposition">Sesquicentennial Exposition</a> in Philadelphia in 1926, though this stamp actually depicts the replica bell erected at the entrance to the exposition grounds. The Liberty Bell was chosen for the stamp design theme because the symbol was most representative of the nation's independence. Since then the Liberty Bell has appeared on several other U.S. postage stamps, including the first <a href="forever%20stamp">forever stamp</a>, issued since 2007.

An image of the Liberty Bell appears on the current $100 note. The image shifts in color, depending on the angle at which it is held.
The name "Liberty Bell" or "Liberty Belle" is commonly used for commercial purposes, and has denoted brands and business names ranging from a life insurance company to a <a href="Montana">Montana</a> escort service. A large outline of the bell hangs over the right-field bleachers at <a href="Citizens%20Bank%20Park">Citizens Bank Park</a>, home of the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> baseball team, and is illuminated whenever one of their players hits a <a href="home%20run">home run</a>. This bell outline replaced one at the Phillies' former home, <a href="Veterans%20Stadium">Veterans Stadium</a>. On April 1, 1996, <a href="Taco%20Bell">Taco Bell</a> announced via ads and press releases that it had purchased the Liberty Bell and changed its name to the <a href="Taco%20Liberty%20Bell">Taco Liberty Bell</a>. The bell, the ads related, would henceforth spend half the year at Taco Bell corporate headquarters in <a href="Irvine%2C%20California">Irvine, California</a>. Outraged calls flooded Independence National Historical Park, and Park Service officials hastily called a press conference to deny that the bell had been sold. After several hours, Taco Bell admitted that it was an <a href="April%20Fools%27%20Day">April Fools' Day</a> joke. Despite the protests, company sales of tacos, enchiladas, and burritos rose by more than a half million dollars that week.

Belton House

Belton House is a <a href="Grade%20I">Grade I</a> listed <a href="English%20country%20house">country house</a> in <a href="Belton%2C%20Lincolnshire">Belton</a> near <a href="Grantham">Grantham</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, <a href="England">England</a>. The mansion is surrounded by formal gardens and a series of avenues leading to <a href="folly">follies</a> within a larger wooded <a href="park">park</a>.

Belton has been described as a compilation of all that is finest of <a href="Restoration%20style">Carolean</a> architecture, the only truly <a href="Vernacular%20architecture">vernacular</a> style of architecture that England had produced since the <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor period</a>. The house has also been described as the most complete example of a typical English country house; the claim has even been made that Belton's principal facade was the inspiration for the modern British motorway signs which give directions to <a href="stately%20home">stately home</a>s. Only <a href="Brympton%20d%27Evercy">Brympton d'Evercy</a> has been similarly lauded as the perfect English country house.

For three hundred years, Belton House was the seat of the <a href="Earl%20Brownlow">Brownlow and Cust</a> family, who had first acquired land in the area in the late 16th century. Between 1685 and 1688 Sir John Brownlow and his wife had the present mansion built. Despite great wealth they chose to build a modest country house rather than a grand contemporary <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> palace. The contemporary, if provincial, Carolean style was the selected choice of design. However, the new house was fitted with the latest <a href="innovation">innovation</a>s such as <a href="sash%20window">sash window</a>s for the principal rooms, and more importantly, completely separate areas for the staff. As the Brownlows rose from <a href="baronet">baronet</a>s to <a href="baron">baron</a>s upward to <a href="earl">earl</a>s and then once again became barons, successive generations made changes to the interior of the house which reflected their changing social position and tastes, yet the fabric and design of the house changed little.

Following <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> (a period when the <a href="Machine%20Gun%20Corps">Machine Gun Corps</a> was based in the park, as referred to in <a href="Henry%20Williamson">Henry Williamson</a>'s "Chronicle of Ancient Sunlight"), the Brownlows, like many of their <a href="Peer%20group">peers</a>, were faced with mounting financial problems. In 1984 they gave the house away—complete with most of its contents. The recipients of their gift, the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>, today fully open Belton to the public. It is in a good state of repair and visited by many thousands of tourists each year.

The Brownlow family, a dynasty of <a href="lawyer">lawyer</a>s, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the <a href="Reversion%20%28law%29">reversion</a> of the <a href="Manor%20house">manor</a> of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £ in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £ now). They immediately bought a <a href="town%20house">town house</a> in the newly fashionable <a href="Bloomsbury%20Square">Southampton Square</a> in <a href="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a>, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.

Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is <a href="William%20Winde">William Winde</a>, although the house has also been attributed to Sir <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a>, while others believe the design to be so similar to <a href="Roger%20Pratt%20%28architect%29">Roger Pratt</a>'s <a href="Clarendon%20House">Clarendon House</a>, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and <a href="Coombe%20Abbey">Coombe Abbey</a>, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a <a href="plasterer">plasterer</a> who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.
Whoever the architect, Belton follows closely the design of Clarendon House, completed in 1667. This great London <a href="town%20house">town house</a> (demolished c. 1683) has been one of the most admired buildings of its era due to "its elegant symmetry and confident and common-sensical design". Sir <a href="John%20Summerson">John Summerson</a> described Clarendon House as "the most influential house of its time among those who aimed at the grand manner" and Belton as "much the finest surviving example of its class". John and Alice Brownlow assembled one of the finest teams of craftsmen available at the time to work on the project. This dream team was headed by the master <a href="Masonry">mason</a> <a href="William%20Stanton%20%28mason%29">William Stanton</a> who oversaw the project. His second in command, John Thompson, had worked with Sir Christopher Wren on several of the latter's London churches, while the chief <a href="joiner">joiner</a> John Sturges had worked at <a href="Chatsworth%20House">Chatsworth</a> under <a href="William%20Talman%20%28architect%29">William Talman</a>. The <a href="wrought%20iron">wrought-ironworker</a> John Warren worked under Stanton at <a href="Denham%20Place">Denham Place</a>, <a href="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a>, and the fine wrought iron gates and <a href="overthrow%20%28structure%29">overthrow</a> at Belton may be his. Thus so competent were the builders of Belton that Winde may have done little more than provide the original plans and drawings, leaving the interpretation to the on-site craftsmen. This theory is further demonstrated by the external appearance of the adjoining stable block. More provincial, and less masterful in proportion, it is known to have been entirely the work of Stanton.

The late 17th century in England was a time of great progress in design. Following the austere years of <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20England">Commonwealth</a> rule, a great flourishing and development in both architecture and the arts began after the <a href="English%20Restoration">restoration of the monarchy</a> in 1660. <a href="Cavalier">Royalist</a> exiles and wealthy young men who made the <a href="Grand%20Tour">Grand Tour</a>, returned home with new ideas—often extravagant variations on classical themes. This was, for England, the dawn of the <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> era. The new wave of architects such as Roger Pratt, <a href="John%20Webb%20%28architect%29">John Webb</a>, and Sir <a href="Christopher%20Wren">Christopher Wren</a> were not just building vast edifices in Renaissance-inspired styles, but also transforming existing older houses. Representative of the utilisation of older houses is <a href="Coleshill%2C%20Oxfordshire">Coleshill House</a> in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, where Pratt transformed the medieval, but now redundant, great hall into a classically inspired entrance hall complete with an <a href="imperial%20staircase">imperial staircase</a>. Great Halls were considered redundant now that employers wished to live separately from their servants, and no longer ate with them in a Great Hall. All evidence and odours of cooking and staff were banished from the principal parts of the house. Employers began to live in fine airy rooms, above the ground floor, with privacy from their servants, who were now confined, unless required, to specifically delegated areas—often the ground and uppermost attic floors. This was a period of great social change in British history, and the educated prided themselves on enlightenment and elegance.

Belton was designed in the restrained almost <a href="Palladian">Palladian</a>-inspired architecture of the time immediately before the full emergence in England of the ornate Baroque. The general form this architecture took was of severely symmetrical, often rectangular houses, with a <a href="pediment">pediment</a> over the central bays. This almost rigid concept was to influence the design of innumerable houses, including Belton. Later to be known as the <a href="Restoration%20style">Carolean</a> style (from "Carolus," the Latin name for the reigning monarch <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>), it was popular with the minor <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a> and <a href="gentry">gentry</a> for both their town and country houses until long after Charles II's death.

Belton is faced with the local <a href="Ancaster%20stone">Ancaster stone</a>, with a lighter <a href="ashlar">ashlar</a> from <a href="Ketton">Ketton</a> for the <a href="Quoin%20%28architecture%29">quoining</a>. The "H"-shaped plan was a design which became popular in the late <a href="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> period. However, by the late 16th century, domestic architecture had evolved further than the "one room deep" ranges of the earlier "H" plan houses, such as <a href="Montacute%20House">Montacute House</a>. The new layout placed rooms back to back, creating a house two rooms deep. This became known as "double pile". As at Belton, this permitted rooms to be not just better lit and heated but also better accessed and related to each other, and with the greatest advantage of all—greater privacy. On the construction side, the double room depth allowed the house to be more compact and under one, more easily constructed, roof, thus lowering building costs.

The plan of the rooms at Belton was passé for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s consisting of a <a href="withdrawing%20room">withdrawing room</a>, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central <a href="Drawing%20room">saloon</a> or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, <a href="enfilade%20%28architecture%29">enfilades</a> of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a <a href="baronetcy">baronetcy</a>, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as <a href="gentry">gentry</a>, not <a href="aristocracy">aristocracy</a>. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of <a href="state%20apartments">state apartments</a> coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a> to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the "Best bedchamber", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.

This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.

The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low <a href="basement">semi-basement</a> containing service rooms. The two principal entrances to the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single flared flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south, each of which have since been replaced by single broad flights of steps.

The second floor has a matching <a href="wikt%3Afenestration">fenestration</a>, with windows of equal value to those on the first floor below. The very latest innovation, <a href="sash%20window">sash window</a>s, was used on both floors. The semi-basement and <a href="attic">attic</a> storey used the more old-fashioned <a href="mullion">mullion</a>ed and <a href="Transom%20%28architectural%29">transomed</a> windows, indicating the lower status of the occupants of these floors. It was clearly emphasised from without that the two main floors of the house were purely for state and family use, and the staff and service areas were confined to the semi-basement and attic floors. This concept of keeping staff and domestic matters out of sight (when not required) was relatively new and had first been employed by Pratt in the design of <a href="Coleshill%2C%20Oxfordshire">Coleshill House</a> in Berkshire. The contemporary social commentator of the day <a href="Roger%20North%20%2817th%20century%29">Roger North</a> lauded back stairs, of which Belton has two examples (5 and 14 on plan), as one of the most important inventions of his day.

The principal room is the large Marble Hall (1) at the centre of the south front; this hall is the beginning of a grand procession of rooms, and corresponds to the former Great Parlour or <a href="Drawing%20room">Saloon</a> (9) on the north front. The Marble Hall is flanked by the former Little Parlour (11, now the Tapestry Room) and the Great Staircase (2), while the Saloon is flanked by two withdrawing rooms (8, 10). The bedrooms are arranged in individual suites on both floors of the two wings (3, "etc.") that flank the state centre of the house. The main staircase, set to one side of the Marble Hall, is one of the few things at Belton which is asymmetrically placed. It has a robust plaster-work ceiling incorporating the Brownlow crest by the London plasterer Edward Goudge, "now looked on as ye best master in England in his profession," William Winde reported in 1690.

Bodily and spiritual needs were balanced symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, rising from the semi-basement to the first floor. This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor.

One of the most <a href="Restoration%20style">Carolean</a> features of the house is the <a href="Baluster">balustrade</a> and <a href="cupola">cupola</a> surmounting the roof, another element introduced to English architecture by Roger Pratt. The cupola at Belton does not light a lofty domed hall, as is often the case in Europe, but houses a staircase which gives access to a large viewing platform on top of a lead roof, concealed from the ground by the balustrade which tops the more conventional and visible <a href="hipped">hipped</a> roof. From this vantage point, the owners of Belton could admire the perfect symmetry of their avenues and formal gardens spreading from the house. This feature of the house was removed by the architect <a href="James%20Wyatt">James Wyatt</a> when he modernised the house in the 18th century. It was restored to its original form in the 1870s by the 3rd Earl Brownlow.

Some of Belton's many rooms have been altered over the last 300 years both in use and design. One of the principal rooms, the Marble Hall (1), the first of the large reception rooms, serves as an entrance hall from the south entrance, and takes its name from a <a href="chequer%20board">chequer board</a> patterned floor of black and white marble tiles. By the time of Belton's conception, the <a href="great%20hall">great hall</a> was no longer a place for the household to eat, but intended as a grand entrance to the house. The hall was originally hung with 28 portraits of Kings, Queens, and Emperors, from <a href="William%20the%20Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a> to <a href="William%20III%20of%20England">William III</a>, intended to give the house an air of dynastic importance. The less numerous and far newer Brownlow family portraits were originally hung in the Great Dining Room immediately above. The room is fully panelled, and parts of the panelling contain <a href="tilia">lime wood</a> embellishments attributed to <a href="Grinling%20Gibbons">Grinling Gibbons</a>. In the early 19th century, this room, and some others, were re-modelled by <a href="Jeffry%20Wyatville">Jeffry Wyatville</a>, who in addition to graining and painting the panelling to imitate <a href="oak">oak</a> installed new doors.

The second of the principal reception rooms, the Saloon (9), opens from the Marble Hall. This large panelled room is on an axis to the avenues of the formal north gardens. Originally known as the Great Parlour, this has always been the chief reception room of the house. It retains its original marble fireplace and has an ornate plaster ceiling which is a <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian</a> copy of the original ceiling by the Carolean <a href="plaster">plaster</a>er Edward Goudge. The centrepiece of the room is a large <a href="Aubusson%2C%20Creuse">Aubusson</a> carpet made in 1839 for the <a href="John%20Cust%2C%201st%20Earl%20Brownlow">1st Earl Brownlow</a>.

Either side of the Saloon are two smaller drawing rooms (8, 10), which would originally have served as private withdrawing rooms from the more public activities which would have taken place in the Marble Hall and Saloon. One of these rooms, now called the Tyrconnel Room (10), was transformed into the principal or state bedroom during the occupancy of <a href="John%20Brownlow%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Tyrconnel">Lord Tyrconnel</a> in an attempt to create a more fashionable suite of Baroque state rooms on the first floor. After his death in 1754, it became a Billiard Room, until the <a href="Adelbert%20Brownlow-Cust%2C%203rd%20Earl%20Brownlow">3rd Earl Brownlow</a> had it refurnished more than a century later. Unusually, the floor is painted with the family arms and crest. The date of the floor is not known for certain but the early nineteenth century has been suggested.

The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by <a href="Melchior%20d%27Hondecoeter">Melchior d'Hondecoeter</a> (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.

Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century <a href="Mortlake%20Tapestry%20Works">Mortlake tapestries</a>. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by <a href="James%20Wyatt">James Wyatt</a> in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. <a href="Rupert%20Gunnis">Rupert Gunnis</a> attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir <a href="Richard%20Westmacott">Richard Westmacott</a>.

Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former "Best Bed Chamber". This panelled room was redecorated in 1841 for the visit of Queen <a href="Adelaide%20of%20Saxe-Meiningen">Adelaide</a>, widow of <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">William IV</a>, when its former function as a state bedroom was resurrected. It contains the great canopied <a href="Rococo">Rococo</a>-style bed in which the Queen slept, complete with the royal <a href="monogram">monogram</a> "AR" ("Adelaide Regina") <a href="embroidery">embroidered</a> on the bedhead. Other rooms on the second floor are mostly bedrooms, which include the Chinese Room (directly above the Tyrconnel Room) with its original hand-painted 18th-century Chinese wallpaper, the Yellow Room (directly above the Blue Room), and the Windsor Bedroom (directly above the School Room), so called following its use by King <a href="Edward%20VIII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward VIII of the United Kingdom</a>, who became the <a href="Duke%20of%20Windsor">Duke of Windsor</a> after the <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdication crisis of 1936</a>. Edward visited Belton in the 1930s with his mistress <a href="Wallis%20Simpson">Wallis Simpson</a>, and the <a href="Peregrine%20Cust%2C%206th%20Baron%20Brownlow">6th Baron Brownlow</a> was heavily involved in the crisis thanks to his position as the King's <a href="Lord-in-waiting">Lord-in-waiting</a>. Today, Belton has a permanent exhibition devoted to that event. Another royal visitor, <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">Charles, Prince of Wales</a>, also used the room frequently while a cadet at nearby <a href="RAF%20Cranwell">RAF Cranwell</a>.

In 1690, Sir John Brownlow was granted permission to enclose an area of 1,000 <a href="acre">acre</a>s (4 km²) to transform into a park, with a grant to keep deer. There is evidence to suggest that some of this area had been a park since at least 1580. The park was laid out with avenues, including the still surviving Eastern Avenue which led east from the house. Brownlow also had a large pond or lake dug and planted 21,400 ash trees, 9,500 oak trees, and 614 fruit trees. It is thought that William Winde may have advised on the layout of the gardens. Closer to the house were a series of more formal gardens, including canal ponds bordered by plantations containing symmetrical walks resembling the "rond-points" (circular clearings in a garden from which straight paths radiate) introduced by the landscape gardener <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Le%20N%C3%B4tre">André Le Nôtre</a>. By the end of the eighteenth century, these formal <a href="parterre">parterre</a>s had been removed and the canal ponds filled in.

Sir John Brownlow was succeeded at Belton by his brother, who was content to permit Brownlow's widow, Alice, to remain in occupation. She spent the remainder of her life at Belton arranging advantageous marriages for her five daughters. On her death in 1721, the house passed to her husband's nephew (and her son-in-law) <a href="John%20Brownlow%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Tyrconnel">Sir John Brownlow III (later Viscount Tyrconnel)</a>. Tyrconnel, a dilettante of no great intellect, was responsible for many of the architectural features which survive in the park and garden. Between 1742 and 1751, a series of <a href="folly">follies</a>, including a <a href="Gothic%20architecture">Gothic</a> ruin, a cascade, and a prospect or <a href="belvedere%20%28structure%29">belvedere</a> known as the Belmount Tower, were constructed for him. When built the tower had two small wings flanking each side, since removed.

<a href="John%20Cust%2C%201st%20Earl%20Brownlow">John Cust, 1st Earl Brownlow</a>, owner of Belton House from 1807–1853, commissioned the architect <a href="Anthony%20Salvin">Anthony Salvin</a> to undertake improvements to the Estate in 1838. Salvin's additions included a <a href="public%20house">public house</a>, estate cottages, a hermitage and <a href="Boathouse%20at%20Belton%20House">the boathouse</a>.

In 1754, Belton was inherited by <a href="Sir%20John%20Cust%2C%203rd%20Baronet">Sir John Cust</a>, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the "unusual fatigues of his office". <a href="Brownlow%20Cust%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brownlow">His heir</a> was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.

In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> and <a href="death%20duties">death duties</a> which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.

At the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the <a href="11th%20%28Northern%29%20Division">11th (Northern) Division</a> before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the <a href="Machine%20Gun%20Corps">Machine Gun Corps</a> were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the <a href="River%20Witham">River Witham</a> passes between the <a href="Lincolnshire%20limestone">Lower Lincolnshire Limestone</a> and the <a href="Upper%20Lias">Upper Lias</a> mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the <a href="Great%20North%20Road%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Great North Road</a> and <a href="Grantham%20railway%20station">Grantham railway station</a> on the <a href="East%20Coast%20Main%20Line">East Coast Main Line</a>. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish church.

Belton again saw war service during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. From 1942, part of the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force%20Regiment">Royal Air Force Regiment</a> was housed in <a href="Nissen%20hut">Nissen hut</a>s at the park in a facility named <a href="RAF%20Belton%20Park">RAF Belton Park</a>.
The years following World War I were severely testing for the owners of many great estates. The staff both indoor and outdoor, which had previously been plentiful, essential, and cheap, were now in short supply. Millions of men had left private service to join the army, and very few returned. Female domestic staff had been called up for war service in factories, and now realised there was an easier and better paid existence outside of the gates of the great country houses.

Belton House remained relatively untouched during this period, largely owing to the failing fortunes of the Brownlow family. The 3rd Earl Brownlow and his Countess lived for only a few months of the year at Belton, where they came for the <a href="fox-hunting">fox-hunting</a>, and divided the remainder of their time between their house in London and <a href="Ashridge">Ashridge</a>, another country house in <a href="Hertfordshire">Hertfordshire</a>. Ashridge, a huge <a href="Gothic%20revival">Gothic revival</a> pile, had come to the Brownlows in the 19th century through the <a href="Earl%20of%20Bridgewater">Egerton family</a>. It was sold, with its art collection and furnishings, to pay the <a href="death%20duties">death duties</a> arising on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1921. Hence Belton became the Brownlows' sole country home. Further death duties were incurred in 1927 on the death of the 3rd Earl's successor, his second cousin Adelbert Cust, 5th Baron Brownlow.

In the ensuing period many thousands of country houses of great architectural value were demolished, or had whole wings razed to the ground. In 1955 alone one house was demolished every five days. In this respect Belton was fortunate to survive at all, as in addition to the family's problems, the house deteriorated to such an extent that in 1961 the 6th Baron employed the architect <a href="Francis%20Johnson%20%28architect%29">Francis Johnson</a> to oversee a large restoration program lasting three years. Not only was the roof repaired but much of the panelling taken down and repaired, and new cornices installed. Also attempts were made to curtail serious infestations of <a href="dry%20rot">dry rot</a>.

The seventh Baron attempted to retain the house and estate by opening to the public. An adventure playground was built in the nearby woods to attract families to the house as a tourist attraction. However, the financial difficulties were too great and in January 1984 he transferred ownership of the house, garden and some of the contents to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Places%20of%20Historic%20Interest%20or%20Natural%20Beauty">National Trust</a>, a charitable body experienced in the management of historic properties. The National Trust further purchased at a cost of £8 million (worth about £ today) 1,317 acres (5.3 km²) of parkland and much of the remaining contents with a grant from the <a href="National%20Heritage%20Memorial%20Fund">National Heritage Memorial Fund</a>.

The Trust quickly produced a guide book for the 1984 season and opened to the public. A priority was the establishment of a restaurant, which would not only augment the estate's income, but also encourage people to spend more time at Belton, and travel greater distances to visit. Though the house, its contents and outbuildings were in an adequate state of repair at the time of the gift, they have since become part of an ongoing programme of conservation and restoration. At the same time the National Trust has introduced new features and attractions such as a silver exhibition which displays a collection of silver amassed by the Brownlow family, dating from 1698. Further revenue is raised from the use of the property as a filming location, and from licensing the Marble Hall for civil weddings. The house features in the BBC's 1988 adaptation of "<a href="Moondial%20%28television%29">Moondial</a>". and also as "Rosings Park" in the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s 1995 television version of "<a href="Pride%20and%20Prejudice%20%281995%20TV%20serial%29">Pride and Prejudice</a>".

Until its acceptance by the National Trust, Belton House was always in the ownership of the family of its builder, though the failure of three generations to produce a son and heir caused the ownership to pass sideways and sometimes through the female line.

The owners of Belton are buried in the village of <a href="Belton%2C%20Lincolnshire">Belton</a>'s <a href="parish">parish</a> church close to the house. Their tombs are collectively one of the most complete sets of family memorials in England—continuous generation to generation for almost 350 years. The earliest Brownlow buried here is the founder of the family fortune the lawyer <a href="Richard%20Brownlow">Richard Brownlow</a> (1555–1638), and one of the most recent is the 6th Baron Brownlow (1899–1978).

The owners of Belton House have been:

He was named <a href="Bishop%20of%20Elmham">Bishop of Elmham</a> in 1043, and was later <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and Archbishop of Canterbury. Stigand was an advisor to several members of the <a href="House%20of%20Wessex">Anglo-Saxon</a> and <a href="Norman%20dynasty">Norman</a> English royal dynasties, serving six successive kings. <a href="Excommunication">Excommunicated</a> by several popes for his <a href="Benefice%23Pluralism">pluralism</a> in holding the two <a href="Episcopal%20see">sees</a>, or bishoprics, of Winchester and Canterbury concurrently, he was finally deposed in 1070, and his estates and personal wealth were confiscated by <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a>. Stigand was imprisoned at <a href="Winchester">Winchester</a>, where he died without regaining his liberty.

Stigand served King <a href="Cnut%20the%20Great">Cnut</a> as a chaplain at a royal foundation at <a href="Ashingdon">Ashingdon</a> in 1020, and as an advisor then and later. He continued in his role of advisor during the reigns of Cnut's sons, <a href="Harold%20Harefoot">Harold Harefoot</a> and <a href="Harthacnut">Harthacnut</a>. When Cnut's stepson <a href="Edward%20the%20Confessor">Edward the Confessor</a> succeeded Harthacnut, Stigand in all probability became England's main administrator. Monastic writers of the time accused Stigand of extorting money and lands from the church, and by 1066 the only estates richer than Stigand's were the royal estates and those of <a href="Harold%20Godwinson">Harold Godwinson</a>.

In 1043 Edward appointed Stigand to the see of Elmham. Four years later he was appointed to the see of Winchester, and then in 1052 to the <a href="Province%20of%20Canterbury">archdiocese of Canterbury</a>, which Stigand held jointly with Winchester. Five successive popes, including <a href="Pope%20Nicholas%20II">Nicholas II</a> and <a href="Pope%20Alexander%20II">Alexander II</a>, excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury. Stigand was present at the deathbed of King Edward and at the coronation of Harold Godwinson as king of England in 1066. After Harold's death, Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror. On Christmas Day 1066 <a href="Ealdred%20%28archbishop%29">Ealdred</a>, the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a>, crowned William King of England. Stigand's excommunication meant that he could only assist at the coronation.

Despite growing pressure for his deposition, Stigand continued to attend the <a href="Court%20%28royal%29">royal court</a> and to consecrate bishops, until in 1070 he was deposed by <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>s and imprisoned at Winchester. His intransigence towards the papacy was used as propaganda by Norman advocates of the view that the English church was backward and needed reform.

Neither the year nor the date of Stigand's birth is known. He was born in <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>, possibly in <a href="Norwich">Norwich</a>, to an apparently prosperous family of mixed English and Scandinavian ancestry, as is shown by the fact that Stigand's name was Norse but his brother's was English. His brother <a href="%C3%86thelm%C3%A6r%20of%20Elmham">Æthelmær</a>, also a cleric, later succeeded Stigand as bishop of Elmham. His sister held land in Norwich, but her given name is unrecorded.

Stigand first appears in the historical record in 1020 as a royal chaplain to King Cnut of England (reigned 1016–1035). In that year he was appointed to Cnut's church at Ashingdon, or Assandun, which was dedicated by the reforming bishop <a href="Wulfstan%20II">Wulfstan of York</a>. Little is known of Stigand's life during Cnut's reign, but he must have had a place at the royal court, as he witnessed occasional charters. Following Cnut's death Stigand successively served Cnut's sons, Harold Harefoot (reigned 1035–1040) and Harthacnut (reigned 1040–1042). After Harthacnut died Stigand became an advisor to <a href="Emma%20of%20Normandy">Emma of Normandy</a>, Cnut's widow and the mother of Harthacnut and his successor Edward the Confessor. He may have been Emma's chaplain, and it is possible that Stigand was already one of her advisors while Cnut was alive, and that he owed his position at Ashingdon to Emma's influence and favour. Because little is known of Stigand's activities before his appointment as a bishop, it is difficult to determine to whom he owed his position.

Stigand was appointed to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Elmham">see of Elmham</a> shortly after Edward the Confessor's coronation on 3 April 1043, probably on Emma's advice. This was the first episcopal appointment of Edward's reign. The diocese of Elmham covered East Anglia in eastern England, and was one of the poorer episcopal sees at that time. He was consecrated bishop in 1043, but later that year Edward deposed Stigand and deprived him of his wealth. During the next year, however, Edward returned Stigand to office. The reasons for the deposition are unknown, but it was probably connected to the simultaneous fall from power of the dowager queen, Emma. Some sources state that Emma had invited King <a href="Magnus%20I%20of%20Norway">Magnus I of Norway</a>, a rival claimant to the English throne, to invade England and had offered her personal wealth to aid Magnus. Some suspected that Stigand had urged Emma to support Magnus, and claimed that his deposition was because of this. Contributing factors in Emma and Stigand's fall included Emma's wealth, and dislike of her political influence, which was linked to the reign of the unpopular Harthacnut.

By 1046 Stigand had begun to witness charters of Edward the Confessor, showing that he was once again in royal favour. In 1047 Stigand was translated to the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">see of Winchester</a>, but he retained Elmham until 1052. He may have owed the preferment to Earl <a href="Godwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Wessex">Godwin of Wessex</a>, the father-in-law of King Edward, although that is disputed by some historians. Emma, who had retired to Winchester after regaining Edward's favour, may also have influenced the appointment, either alone or in concert with Godwin. After his appointment to Winchester, Stigand was a witness to all the surviving charters of King Edward during the period 1047 to 1052.

Some historians, such as <a href="Frank%20Barlow%20%28historian%29">Frank Barlow</a> and Emma Mason, state that Stigand supported Earl Godwin in his quarrel with Edward the Confessor in 1051–1052; others, including Ian Walker, hold that he was neutral. Stigand, whether or not he was a supporter of Godwin's, did not go into exile with the earl. The quarrel started over a fight between <a href="Eustace%20II%20of%20Boulogne">Eustace of Boulogne</a>, brother-in-law of the king, and men of the town of Dover. The king ordered Godwin to punish the town, and the earl refused. Continued pressure from Edward undermined Godwin's position, and the earl and his family fled England in 1051. The earl returned in 1052 with a substantial armed force but eventually reached a peaceful accord with the king. Some medieval sources state that Stigand took part in the negotiations that reached a peace between the king and his earl; the Canterbury manuscript of the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" calls Stigand the king's chaplain and advisor during the negotiations.

The Archbishopric of Canterbury became drawn into the conflict between Edward and Godwin. Pope <a href="Pope%20Leo%20IX">Leo IX</a> was beginning a reform movement later known as the <a href="Gregorian%20Reform">Gregorian Reform</a>. Leo first focused on improving the clergy and prohibiting <a href="simony">simony</a> – the buying and selling of clerical and ecclesiastical offices. In 1049 Leo IX publicly pronounced that he would take more interest in English church matters and would investigate episcopal candidates more strictly before confirming them. When Archbishop <a href="Edsige">Edsige</a> of Canterbury died in 1051 the monks of the cathedral chapter elected Æthelric, a relative of Earl Godwin's, as archbishop. King Edward opposed the election and instead appointed <a href="Robert%20of%20Jumi%C3%A8ges">Robert of Jumièges</a>, who was Norman and already <a href="Bishop%20of%20London">Bishop of London</a>. Besides furthering Edward's quarrel with Godwin, the appointment signalled that there were limits to Edward's willingness to compromise on ecclesiastical reform.

Although not known as a reformer before his appointment, Robert returned in 1051 from Rome, where he had gone to be confirmed by the papacy, and opposed the king's choice for Bishop of London on the grounds that the candidate was not suitable. Robert's attempts to recover church property that had been appropriated by Earl Godwin contributed to the quarrel between the earl and the king. When Godwin returned to England in 1052 Robert was outlawed and exiled, following which King Edward appointed Stigand to the archbishopric. The appointment was either a reward from Godwin for Stigand's support during the conflict with Edward or a reward from King Edward for successfully negotiating a peaceful conclusion to the crisis in 1052. Stigand was the first non-monk to be appointed to either English archbishopric since before the days of <a href="Dunstan">Dunstan</a> (archbishop from 959 to 988).

The papacy refused to recognise Stigand's elevation, as Robert was still alive and had not been deprived of office by a pope. Robert of Jumièges appealed to Leo IX, who summoned Stigand to Rome. When Stigand did not appear, he was excommunicated. Historian <a href="Nicholas%20Brooks">Nicholas Brooks</a> holds the view that Stigand was not excommunicated at this time, but rather was ordered to refrain from any archiepiscopal functions, such as the consecration of bishops. He argues that in 1062 papal legates sat in council with Stigand, something they would not have done had he been excommunicated. The legates did nothing to alter Stigand's position either, although one of the legates later helped depose Stigand in 1070. However Pope Leo IX and his successors, <a href="Pope%20Victor%20II">Victor II</a> and <a href="Pope%20Stephen%20IX">Stephen IX</a>, continued to regard Stigand as uncanonically elected.

Stigand did not travel to Rome to receive a <a href="pallium">pallium</a>, the band worn around the neck that is the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from the pope. Travelling to Rome for the pallium had become a custom, practised by a number of his predecessors. Instead, some medieval chroniclers state that he used Robert of Jumièges' pallium. It is not known if Stigand even petitioned the papacy for a pallium soon after his appointment. Owing to the reform movement, Stigand probably knew the request would be unsuccessful. In 1058 Antipope <a href="Antipope%20Benedict%20X">Benedict X</a>, who opposed much of the reform movement, gave Stigand a pallium. However, Benedict was deposed the following year; the reforming party declared Benedict an <a href="antipope">antipope</a>, and nullified all his acts, including Stigand's pallium grant. The exact circumstances that led to Benedict granting a pallium are unknown, whether it was at Stigand's request or was given without prompting.

After his translation to Canterbury, Stigand released Elmham to his brother Æthelmær but retained the bishopric of Winchester. Canterbury and Winchester were the two richest sees in England, and while precedent allowed the holding of a rich see along with a poor one, there was no precedent for holding two rich sees concurrently. He may have retained Winchester out of avarice, or his hold on Canterbury may not have been secure. Besides these, he held the <a href="Gloucester%20Cathedral">abbey of Gloucester</a> and the <a href="Ely%20Cathedral">abbey of Ely</a> and perhaps other abbeys also. Whatever his reasons, the retention of Winchester made Stigand a pluralist: the holder of more than one <a href="benefice">benefice</a> at the same time. This was a practice that was targeted for elimination by the growing reform movement in the church. Five successive popes (Leo IX, Victor II, Stephen IX, Nicholas II and Alexander II) excommunicated Stigand for holding both Winchester and Canterbury at the same time. It has been suggested by the historian Emma Mason that Edward refused to remove Stigand because this would have undermined the royal prerogative to appoint bishops and archbishops without papal input. Further hurting Stigand's position, Pope Nicholas II in 1061 declared pluralism to be uncanonical unless approved by the pope.

Stigand was later accused of simony by monastic chroniclers, but all such accusations date to after 1066, and are thus suspect owing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify the English Church as corrupt and backward. The medieval chronicler <a href="William%20of%20Poitiers">William of Poitiers</a> also claimed that in 1052 Stigand agreed that William of Normandy, the future William the Conqueror, should succeed King Edward. This claim was used as propaganda after the Conquest, but according to the historian <a href="David%20Bates%20%28historian%29">David Bates</a>, among others, it is unlikely to be true. The position of Stigand as head of the church in England was used to good effect by the Normans in their propaganda before, during and after the Conquest.

The <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">diocese of York</a> took advantage of Stigand's difficulties with the papacy and encroached on the suffragans, or bishops owing obedience to an archbishop, normally subject to Canterbury. York had long been held in common with <a href="Bishop%20of%20Worcester">Worcester</a>, but during the period when Stigand was excommunicated, the see of York also claimed oversight over the sees of <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lichfield">Lichfield</a> and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Lincoln">Dorchester</a>. In 1062, however, <a href="papal%20legate">papal legate</a>s of Alexander II came to England. They did not depose Stigand, and even consulted with him and treated him as archbishop. He was allowed to attend the council they held and was an active participant with the legates in the business of the council.

Many of the bishops in England did not want to be consecrated by Stigand. Both <a href="Gisa%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Wells">Giso of Wells</a> and <a href="Walter%20of%20Lorraine">Walter of Hereford</a> travelled to Rome to be consecrated by the pope in 1061, rather than be consecrated by Stigand. During the brief period that he held a legitimate pallium, however, Stigand did consecrate <a href="%C3%86thelric%20II">Aethelric of Selsey</a> and <a href="Siward%2C%20Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Siward of Rochester</a>. Abbots of monasteries, however, came to Stigand for consecration throughout his time as archbishop. These included not only abbots from monastic houses inside his province, such as <a href="%C3%86thelsige">Æthelsige</a> as abbot of <a href="St%20Augustine%27s%20Abbey">St Augustine's Abbey</a> in Canterbury, but also <a href="Baldwin%20%28abbot%20of%20Bury%20St%20Edmunds%29">Baldwin</a> as <a href="Abbot%20of%20Bury%20St.%20Edmunds">Abbot of Bury St. Edmunds</a> and Thurstan as <a href="List%20of%20bishops%20of%20Ely">Abbot of Ely</a>. After the Norman Conquest, Stigand was accused of selling the office of abbot, but no abbot was deposed for buying the office, so the charge is suspect.

Stigand was probably the most lavish clerical donor of his period, when great men gave to churches on an unprecedented scale. He was a benefactor to the Abbey of Ely, and gave large gold or silver crucifixes to Ely, St Augustine's Abbey in Canterbury, <a href="Bury%20St.%20Edmunds%20Abbey">Bury St. Edmunds Abbey</a>, and to his <a href="Cathedral">cathedral church</a> at Winchester. The crucifixes given to Ely, Bury and Winchester all appear to have had about life-size figures of Christ with matching figures of the Virgin and <a href="John%20the%20Evangelist">John the Evangelist</a>, as is recorded in the monastic histories, and were probably permanently mounted over the altar or elsewhere. These would have been made with thin sheets of precious metal over a wooden core. No comparably early <a href="rood">rood</a> crosses with the side figures of Mary and John seem to survive, though we have large painted wooden crucifixes like the German <a href="Gero%20Cross">Gero Cross</a> of around 980, and the <a href="Volto%20Santo%20of%20Lucca">Volto Santo of Lucca</a> (renewed with a later figure) which is known to have inspired Leofstan, Abbot of Bury (d. 1065) to create a similar figure, perhaps covered in precious metal, on his return from a visit to Rome. To Ely he gave gold and silver vessels for the altar, and a <a href="chasuble">chasuble</a> embroidered in gold "of such inestimable workmanship and worth, that none in the kingdom is considered richer or more valuable". Although it does not appear that Stigand ever travelled to Rome, there are indications that Stigand did go on pilgrimage. A 12th-century life of Saint <a href="Willibrord">Willibrord</a>, written at the <a href="Abbey%20of%20Echternach">Abbey of Echternach</a> in what is now <a href="Luxembourg">Luxembourg</a>, records that "to this place also came Stigand, the eminent archbishop of the English". In the work, Stigand is recorded as giving rich gifts to the abbey as well as relics of saints.

During Edward's reign, Stigand was an influential advisor at court and used his position to increase his own wealth as well as that of his friends and family. Contemporary valuations of the lands he controlled at the death of King Edward, as listed in <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a>, come to an annual income of about 2500 pounds. There is little evidence, however, that he enriched either Canterbury or Winchester. He also appointed his followers to sees within his diocese in 1058, having Siward named <a href="Bishop%20of%20Rochester">Bishop of Rochester</a> and Æthelric installed as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Chichester">Bishop of Selsey</a>. Between his holding of two sees and the appointment of his men to other sees in the southeast of England, Stigand was an important figure in defending the coastline against invasion.

Stigand may have been in charge of the royal administration. He may also have been behind the effort to locate <a href="Edward%20the%20Exile">Edward the Atheling</a> and his brother <a href="Edmund%20%C3%86theling">Edmund</a> after 1052, possibly to secure a more acceptable heir to King Edward. His landholdings were spread across ten counties, and in some of those counties, his lands were larger than the king's holdings. Although Norman propagandists claimed that as early as 1051 or 1052 King Edward promised the throne of England to Duke <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William of Normandy</a>, who later became King William the Conqueror, there is little contemporary evidence of such a promise from non-Norman sources. By 1053, Edward probably realised that he would not have a son from his marriage, and he and his advisors began to search for an heir. Edward the Atheling, the son of King <a href="Edmund%20Ironside">Edmund Ironside</a> (reigned 1016), had been exiled from England in 1017, after his father's death. Although Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, went to the Continent in search of Edward the Exile, Ian Walker, the biographer of King Harold Godwinson, feels that Stigand was behind the effort. In the end, although Edward did return to England, he died soon after his return, leaving a young son <a href="Edgar%20the%20%C3%86theling">Edgar the Ætheling</a>.

King Edward, on his deathbed, left the crown to his brother-in-law Harold Godwinson, the son of Earl Godwin. Stigand performed the funeral services for Edward. Norman writers claimed that Stigand crowned Harold as king in January 1066. This is generally considered false propaganda, as it was in William's interest to portray Harold as uncanonically crowned. If Harold was improperly crowned, then William was merely claiming his rightful inheritance, and not deposing a rightful king. The <a href="Bayeux%20Tapestry">Bayeux Tapestry</a> depicts Stigand at Harold's coronation, although not actually placing the crown on Harold's head. The English sources claim that Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, crowned Harold, while the Norman sources claim that Stigand did so, with the conflict between the various sources probably tracing to the post-Conquest desire to vilify Harold and depict his coronation as improper. Current historical research has shown that the ceremony was performed by Ealdred, owing to the controversy about Stigand's position. However, one historian, <a href="Pauline%20Stafford">Pauline Stafford</a>, theorises that both archbishops may have consecrated Harold. Another historian, Frank Barlow, writing in 1979, felt that the fact that some of the English sources do not name who consecrated Harold "tip(s) the balance in favour of Stigand".

Stigand did support Harold, and was present at Edward the Confessor's deathbed. Stigand's controversial position may have influenced Pope Alexander II's support of William the Conqueror's invasion of England. The reformers, led by Archdeacon Hildebrand, later Pope <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20VII">Gregory VII</a>, opposed the older type of bishop, rich and installed by the lay powers.

After the death of Harold at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Hastings">Battle of Hastings</a>, Stigand worked with <a href="Edwin%2C%20Earl%20of%20Mercia">Earl Edwin</a> and <a href="Morcar%20of%20Northumbria">Earl Morcar</a>, as well as Archbishop Ealdred of York, to put Edgar the Ætheling on the throne. This plan did not come to fruition, however, due to opposition from the northern earls and some of the other bishops. Stigand submitted to William the Conqueror at <a href="Wallingford%2C%20Oxfordshire">Wallingford</a> in early December 1066, and perhaps assisted at his coronation on Christmas Day, 1066, although the coronation was performed by Ealdred. William took Stigand with him to <a href="Normandy">Normandy</a> in 1067, although whether this was because William did not trust the archbishop, as the medieval chronicler William of Poitiers alleges, is uncertain. Stigand was present at the coronation of William's queen, <a href="Matilda%20of%20Flanders">Matilda</a>, in 1068, although once more the ceremony was actually performed by Ealdred.

After the first rebellions broke out in late 1067 William adopted a policy of conciliation towards the church. He gave Stigand a place at court, as well as giving administrative positions to Ealdred of York and <a href="%C3%86thelwig">Æthelwig</a>, Abbot of <a href="Evesham%20Abbey">Evesham</a>. Archbishop Stigand appears on a number of royal charters in 1069, along with both Norman and English leaders. He even consecrated <a href="Remigius%20de%20F%C3%A9camp">Remigius de Fécamp</a> as Bishop of Dorchester in 1067. Once the danger of rebellion was past, however, William had no further need of Stigand. At a council held at Winchester at Easter 1070, the bishops met with papal legates from Alexander II. On 11 April 1070 Stigand was deposed by the papal legate, <a href="Ermenfrid">Ermenfrid</a>, <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Diocese%20of%20Sion">Bishop of Sion</a> in the Alps, and was imprisoned at Winchester. His brother Æthelmær, Bishop of Elmham, was also deposed at the same council. Shortly afterwards Aethelric the Bishop of Selsey, <a href="Ethelwin">Ethelwin</a> the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a> and <a href="Leofwin">Leofwin</a> Bishop of Lichfield, who was married, were deposed at a council held at Windsor. There were three reasons given for Stigand's deposition: that he held the bishopric of Winchester in plurality with Canterbury; that he not only occupied Canterbury after Robert of Jumièges fled but also seized Robert's pallium which was left behind; and that he received his own pallium from Benedict X, an anti-pope. Some accounts state that Stigand did appear at the council which deposed him, but nothing is recorded of any defence that he attempted. The charges against his brother are nowhere stated, leading to a belief that the depositions were mainly political. That spring he had deposited his personal wealth at Ely Abbey for safekeeping, but King William confiscated it after his deposition, along with his estates. The king appointed <a href="Lanfranc">Lanfranc</a>, a native of Italy and a scholar and abbot in Normandy, as the new archbishop.

King William appears to have left the initiative for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and did nothing to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand appears to have been a member of the royal council, and able to move freely about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William did nothing to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith. Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.

Stigand died in 1072 while still imprisoned, and his death was commemorated on 21 February or 22 February. Sometime between his deposition and his death the widow of King Edward and sister of King Harold, <a href="Edith%20of%20Wessex">Edith of Wessex</a>, visited him in his imprisonment and allegedly told him to take better care of himself. He was buried in the <a href="Old%20Minster%2C%20Winchester">Old Minster</a> at Winchester.

At King Edward's death, only the royal estates and the estates of Harold were larger and wealthier than those held by Stigand. Medieval writers condemned him for his greed and for his pluralism. <a href="Hugh%20the%20Chanter">Hugh the Chanter</a>, a medieval chronicler, claimed that the confiscated wealth of Stigand helped keep King William on the throne. A recent study of his wealth and how it was earned shows that while he did engage in some exploitative methods to gain some of his wealth, other lands were gained through inheritance or through royal favour. The same study shows little evidence that he despoiled his episcopal estates, although the record towards monastic houses is more suspect. There is no complaint in contemporary records about his private life, and the accusations that he committed simony and was illiterate only date from the 12th century.

Although monastic chroniclers after the Norman Conquest accused him of crimes such as perjury and homicide, they do not provide any evidence of those crimes. Almost 100 years after his death, another Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, was taunted in 1164 by King <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>'s barons with Stigand's fate for daring to oppose his king. Modern historians views tend to see him as either a wily politician and indifferent bishop or to see him purely in terms of his ecclesiastical failings. The historian <a href="Frank%20Stenton">Frank Stenton</a> felt that his "whole career shows that he was essentially a politician". Concurring with this, the historian Nick Higham said that "Stigand was a seasoned politician whose career had been built on an accurate reading of the balance of power." Another historian, <a href="Eric%20John">Eric John</a>, said that "Stigand had a fair claim to be the worst bishop of Christendom". However, the historian Frank Barlow felt that "he was a man of cultured tastes, a patron of the arts who was generous to the monasteries which he held". Alexander Rumble argued that Stigand was unlucky in living past the Conquest, stating that it could be said that Stigand was "unlucky to live so long that he saw in his lifetime not only the end of the Anglo-Saxon state but also the challenging of uncanonical, but hitherto tolerated, practices by a wave of papal reforms".

Highway 61 Revisited is the sixth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American singer-songwriter <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a>, released on August 30, 1965 by <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>. Having until then recorded mostly <a href="acoustic%20music">acoustic music</a>, Dylan used <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a>ians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing track, the 11-minute <a href="ballad">ballad</a> "<a href="Desolation%20Row">Desolation Row</a>". Critics have focused on the innovative way Dylan combined driving, <a href="blues">blues</a>-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author <a href="Michael%20Gray%20%28author%29">Michael Gray</a> has argued that, in an important sense, <a href="Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">the 1960s</a> "started" with this album.

Leading with the hit single "<a href="Like%20a%20Rolling%20Stone">Like a Rolling Stone</a>", the album features songs that Dylan has continued to perform live over his long career, including "<a href="Ballad%20of%20a%20Thin%20Man">Ballad of a Thin Man</a>" and <a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited%20%28song%29">the title track</a>. He named the album after the <a href="U.S.%20Route%2061">major American highway</a> which connected his birthplace of <a href="Duluth%2C%20Minnesota">Duluth, Minnesota</a>, to southern cities famed for their musical heritage, including <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a>, <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis</a>, <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, and the <a href="Delta%20blues">Delta blues</a> area of <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>.

"Highway 61 Revisited" peaked at No. 3 in the United States charts and No. 4 in the United Kingdom. The album was ranked No. 4 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s "<a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>". "Like a Rolling Stone" was a top-10 hit in several countries, and was listed at No. 1 on <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">"Rolling Stone"s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a> list. Two other songs, "Desolation Row" and "Highway 61 Revisited", were listed at No. 187 and No. 373 respectively.

In his memoir "", Dylan described the kinship he felt with the route that supplied the title of his sixth album: "Highway 61, the main thoroughfare of the country blues, begins about where I began. I always felt like I'd started on it, always had been on it and could go anywhere, even down in to the deep Delta country. It was the same road, full of the same contradictions, the same one-horse towns, the same spiritual ancestors ... It was my place in the universe, always felt like it was in my blood."

When he was growing up in the 1950s, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2061">Highway 61</a> stretched from <a href="Thunder%20Bay%2C%20Ontario">Thunder Bay (Ontario)</a> – north of the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Canada–US border</a>), through Duluth, where Dylan was born, and from <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">St. Paul</a>, all the way down to <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>. Along the way, the route passed near the birthplaces and homes of influential musicians such as <a href="Muddy%20Waters">Muddy Waters</a>, <a href="Son%20House">Son House</a>, <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis Presley</a> and <a href="Charley%20Patton">Charley Patton</a>. The "empress of the blues", <a href="Bessie%20Smith">Bessie Smith</a>, died after sustaining serious injuries in an automobile accident on Highway 61. Critic Mark Polizzotti points out that <a href="blues">blues</a> legend <a href="Robert%20Johnson">Robert Johnson</a> is alleged to have sold his soul to the devil at the highway's crossroads with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2049">Route 49</a>. The highway had also been the subject of several blues recordings, notably <a href="Roosevelt%20Sykes">Roosevelt Sykes</a>' "Highway 61 Blues" (1932) and <a href="Mississippi%20Fred%20McDowell">Mississippi Fred McDowell</a>'s "61 Highway" (1964).

Dylan has stated that he had to overcome considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer <a href="Robert%20Shelton%20%28critic%29">Robert Shelton</a>: "I wanted to call that album "Highway 61 Revisited". Nobody understood it. I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it what he wants to call it'." Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: "Indeed the album title "Highway 61 Revisited" announces that we are in for a long revisit, since it is such a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before [Dylan], all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'."

In May 1965, Dylan returned from his tour of England feeling exhausted and dissatisfied with his material. He told journalist <a href="Nat%20Hentoff">Nat Hentoff</a>: "I was going to quit singing. I was very drained." The singer added, "It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you."

As a consequence of his dissatisfaction, Dylan wrote 20 pages of <a href="Song%20structure%20%28popular%20music%29%23Verse">verse</a> he later described as a "long piece of vomit". He reduced this to a song with four verses and a <a href="Refrain">chorus</a>—"Like a Rolling Stone". He told Hentoff that writing and recording the song washed away his dissatisfaction, and restored his enthusiasm for creating music. Describing the experience to <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a> in 2004, nearly 40 years later, Dylan said: "It's like a ghost is writing a song like that ... You don't know what it means except the ghost picked me to write the song."

"Highway 61 Revisited" was recorded in two blocks of recording sessions that took place in Studio A of Columbia Records, located in <a href="Midtown%20Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. The first block, June 15 and June 16, was produced by <a href="Tom%20Wilson%20%28producer%29">Tom Wilson</a> and resulted in the single "Like a Rolling Stone". On July 25, Dylan performed his <a href="Electric%20Dylan%20controversy">controversial electric set at the Newport Folk Festival</a>, where some of the crowd booed his performance. Four days after Newport, Dylan returned to the recording studio. From July 29 to August 4, he and his band completed recording "Highway 61 Revisited", but under the supervision of a new producer, <a href="Bob%20Johnston">Bob Johnston</a>.

 Tom Wilson produced the initial recording sessions for "Highway 61 Revisited" on June 15–16, 1965. Dylan was backed by <a href="Bobby%20Gregg">Bobby Gregg</a> on drums, Joe Macho, Jr. on bass, <a href="Paul%20Griffin%20%28musician%29">Paul Griffin</a> on piano, and Frank Owens on guitar. For lead guitar, the singer recruited <a href="Mike%20Bloomfield">Michael Bloomfield</a> of the <a href="Paul%20Butterfield">Paul Butterfield Blues Band</a>. The musicians began the June 15 session by recording a fast version of "<a href="It%20Takes%20a%20Lot%20to%20Laugh%2C%20It%20Takes%20a%20Train%20to%20Cry">It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry</a>" and the song "Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence", which was omitted from the "Highway 61" album. Dylan and his band next attempted to record "Like a Rolling Stone"; at this early stage, Dylan's piano dominated the backing, which was in 3/4 time. "Barbed Wire Fence", the fast version of "It Takes a Lot to Laugh", and an early take of "Like a Rolling Stone" were eventually released on "<a href="The%20Bootleg%20Series%20Volumes%201%E2%80%933%20%28Rare%20%26amp%3B%20Unreleased%29%201961%E2%80%931991">The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991</a>".

The musicians returned to Studio A the following day, when they devoted almost the entire session to recording "Like a Rolling Stone". Present on this occasion was <a href="Al%20Kooper">Al Kooper</a>, a young musician invited by Wilson to observe, but who wanted to play on the session. Kooper managed to sit in on the session; despite never having played electric organ before, Kooper improvised an organ <a href="riff">riff</a> that, critics such as <a href="Greil%20Marcus">Greil Marcus</a> and Mark Polizzotti have argued, is a crucial element of the recording. The fourth take was ultimately selected as the master, but Dylan and the band recorded eleven more takes.

To create the material for "Highway 61 Revisited", Dylan spent a month writing in his new home in the <a href="Byrdcliffe%20Colony">Byrdcliffe artists' colony</a> of <a href="Woodstock%2C%20New%20York">Woodstock</a> in upstate New York. When he returned to Studio A on July 29, he was backed by the same musicians with Harvey Brooks on bass replacing Joe Macho and his producer had changed from Tom Wilson to Bob Johnston.

On July 30, Dylan and his band returned to Studio A and recorded three songs. A master take of "From a Buick 6" was recorded and later included on the final album, but most of the session was devoted to "<a href="Can%20You%20Please%20Crawl%20Out%20Your%20Window%3F">Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?</a>" Dylan was unsatisfied with the results and set the song aside for a later date; it was eventually re-recorded with <a href="The%20Band%23With%20Bob%20Dylan">the Hawks</a> in October.

After Dylan and Kooper spent the weekend in Woodstock writing <a href="chord%20chart">chord chart</a>s for the songs, sessions resumed at Studio A on August 2. "Highway 61 Revisited", "<a href="Just%20Like%20Tom%20Thumb%27s%20Blues">Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues</a>", "<a href="Queen%20Jane%20Approximately">Queen Jane Approximately</a>", and "Ballad of a Thin Man" were recorded successfully and masters were selected for the album.

One final session was held on August 4, again at Studio A. Most of the session was devoted to completing "Desolation Row". Johnston has related that Nashville musician <a href="Charlie%20McCoy">Charlie McCoy</a> was visiting New York, and he invited McCoy to play guitar at the session. According to some sources, seven takes of "Desolation Row" were recorded, and takes six and seven were spliced together for the master recording.

The resulting album, "Highway 61 Revisited", has been described as "Dylan's first purely 'rock' album", a realization of his wish to leave his old music format behind and move on from his all-acoustic first four albums and half-acoustic, half-electric fifth album, "<a href="Bringing%20It%20All%20Back%20Home">Bringing It All Back Home</a>". Documentary director <a href="D.%20A.%20Pennebaker">D. A. Pennebaker</a>, who <a href="Dont%20Look%20Back">filmed Dylan on his acoustic UK tour</a> in May 1965, has said: "I didn't know that he was going to leave acoustic. I did know that he was getting a little dragged by it."

"Highway 61 Revisited" opens with "<a href="Like%20a%20Rolling%20Stone">Like a Rolling Stone</a>", which has been described as revolutionary in its combination of electric guitar licks, organ chords, and Dylan's voice, "at once so young and so snarling ... and so cynical". Michael Gray characterized "Like a Rolling Stone" as "a chaotic amalgam of blues, impressionism, allegory, and an intense directness: 'How does it feel?'" Polizzotti writes that the composition is notable for eschewing traditional themes of popular music, such as romance, and instead expresses resentment and a yearning for revenge. It has been suggested that Miss Lonely, the song's central character, is based on <a href="Edie%20Sedgwick">Edie Sedgwick</a>, a socialite and actress in the <a href="The%20Factory">Factory</a> scene of <a href="pop%20art">pop art</a>ist <a href="Andy%20Warhol">Andy Warhol</a>. Critic <a href="Mike%20Marqusee">Mike Marqusee</a> has written that this composition is "surely a Dylan cameo", and that its full poignancy becomes apparent upon the realization that "it is sung, at least in part, to the singer himself: he's the one 'with no direction home'." "Like A Rolling Stone" reached number two in the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> in the summer of 1965, and was a top-10 hit in Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom.

The fast-paced, two-chord blues song "<a href="Tombstone%20Blues">Tombstone Blues</a>", driven by Michael Bloomfield's lead guitar, uses a parade of historical characters—outlaw <a href="Belle%20Starr">Belle Starr</a>, biblical temptress <a href="Delilah">Delilah</a>, <a href="Jack%20the%20Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a> (represented in this song as a successful businessman), <a href="John%20the%20Baptist">John the Baptist</a> (described here as a torturer), and blues singer <a href="Ma%20Rainey">Ma Rainey</a> who Dylan humorously suggests shared a sleeping bag with composer <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>—to sketch an absurdist account of contemporary America. Although other interpretations could be put forth: Where once the creativity embodied in the accomplishments of Ma Rainey and Beethoven [it isn't Always about sex] flourished, now there is stultification of patriotic martial music. For critics Mark Polizzotti and Andy Gill, the reality behind the song is the then-escalating <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>; both writers hear the "king of the Philistines" who sends his slaves "out to the jungle" as a reference to President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a>.

On July 29, 1965, Dylan and his band resumed recording "<a href="It%20Takes%20a%20Lot%20to%20Laugh%2C%20It%20Takes%20a%20Train%20to%20Cry">It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry</a>". <a href="Tony%20Glover">Tony Glover</a>, who observed the recording session, has recalled that Dylan re-worked the song at the piano while the other musicians took a lunch break. Critic Sean Egan writes that by slowing down the tempo, Dylan transformed the song from an "insufferably smart-alec number into a slow, tender, sensual anthem". Gill points out that the lyrics reveal the singer's talent for borrowing from old blues numbers, adapting the lines "Don't the clouds look lonesome shining across the sea/ Don't my gal look good when she's coming after me" from "Solid Road" by bluesmen <a href="Brownie%20McGhee">Brownie McGhee</a> and <a href="Leroy%20Carr">Leroy Carr</a>.

<a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> critic Bill Janovitz describes "<a href="From%20a%20Buick%206">From a Buick 6</a>" as a "raucous, up-tempo blues", which is played "almost recklessly". The song opens with a <a href="snare%20drum">snare</a> shot similar to the beginning of "Like a Rolling Stone". Partially based on <a href="Sleepy%20John%20Estes">Sleepy John Estes</a>' 1930 song "<a href="Milk%20Cow%20Blues">Milk Cow Blues</a>", the guitar part is patterned after older blues riffs by Robert Johnson, Charlie Patton and <a href="Big%20Joe%20Williams">Big Joe Williams</a>. Robert Shelton hears the song as "an earthy tribute to another funky earth-mother", while for Heylin it is close to filler material; he argues that only through the musicians' performance is Dylan able to "convince us he is doing more than just listing the number of ways in which this 'graveyard woman' is both a lifesaver and a death-giver".

"<a href="Ballad%20of%20a%20Thin%20Man">Ballad of a Thin Man</a>" is driven by Dylan's piano, which contrasts with "the spooky organ riffs" played by Al Kooper. Marqusee describes the song as one of "the purest songs of protest ever sung", as it looks at the media and its inability to understand both the singer and his work. He writes that the song became the anthem of an in-group, "disgusted by the old, excited by the new ... elated by their discovery of others who shared their feelings", with its refrain "Something is happening here/ But you don't know what it is/ Do you, Mr Jones?" epitomizing the "hip exclusivity" of the burgeoning <a href="Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">counterculture</a>. Robert Shelton describes the song's central character, Mr Jones, as "one of Dylan's greatest archetypes", characterizing him as "a <a href="Philistinism">Philistine</a> ... superficially educated and well bred but not very smart about the things that count".

Polizzotti, in his study of "Highway 61 Revisited", writes that the opening track of Side Two, "<a href="Queen%20Jane%20Approximately">Queen Jane Approximately</a>" is in a similar vein to "Like a Rolling Stone", but the song offers "a touch of sympathy and even comfort in place of relentless mockery". The song is structured as a series of ABAB <a href="quatrain">quatrain</a> verses, with each verse followed by a chorus that is simply a repeat of the last line of each verse: "Won't you come see me Queen Jane?". Gill calls this song "the least interesting track" on "Highway 61", but praises the piano ascending the scale during the harmonica break as an evocation of "the stifling nature of an upper class existence". Others have speculated that the song is directed at Joan Baez and the folk movement, which Dylan had largely left behind. "Queen Jane Approximately" was released as the B-side of Dylan's "<a href="One%20of%20Us%20Must%20Know%20%28Sooner%20or%20Later%29">One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)</a>" single in early 1966.

Dylan commences the title song of his album, "<a href="Highway%2061%20Revisited%20%28song%29">Highway 61 Revisited</a>", with the words "Oh God said to Abraham, 'Kill me a son'/Abe says, 'Man, you must be puttin' me on'". As Gill has pointed out, Abraham was the name of Dylan's father, which makes the singer the son whom God wants killed. Gill comments that it is befitting that this song, celebrating a highway central to the history of the blues, is a "raucous blues boogie". He notes that the scope of the song broadens to make the highway a road of endless possibilities, peopled by dubious characters and culminating in a promoter who "seriously considers staging World War III out on Highway 61". The song is punctuated by the sound of a <a href="Acme%20siren">siren whistle</a>, credited as "Police Car" to Dylan in the album liner notes. "Highway 61 Revisited" was released as the B-side of his "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?" single on November 30, 1965.

"<a href="Just%20Like%20Tom%20Thumb%27s%20Blues">Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues</a>" has six verses and no chorus. The lyrics describe a nightmarish experience in <a href="Ciudad%20Ju%C3%A1rez">Juarez</a>, Mexico, where, in Shelton's words, "our anti-hero stumbles amid sickness, despair, whores and saints." He battles with corrupt authorities, alcohol and drugs before resolving to return to New York City. In this song, critics have heard literary references to <a href="Malcolm%20Lowry">Malcolm Lowry</a>'s "<a href="Under%20the%20Volcano">Under the Volcano</a>", <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>'s "<a href="The%20Murders%20in%20the%20Rue%20Morgue">The Murders in the Rue Morgue</a>" and <a href="Jack%20Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>'s "<a href="Desolation%20Angels%20%28novel%29">Desolation Angels</a>". The backing musicians, Bobby Gregg on drums, Mike Bloomfield on electric guitar, and two pianists, Paul Griffin on <a href="tack%20piano">tack piano</a> and Al Kooper on <a href="Hohner%20Pianet">Hohner Pianet</a>, produce a mood that, for Gill, perfectly complements the "enervated tone" of the lyrics. Heylin notes that Dylan took great care—sixteen takes—to get the effect he was after, with lyrics that subtly "[skirt] the edge of reason".
Dylan concludes "Highway 61 Revisited" with the sole <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic</a> exception to his rock album. Gill has characterized "<a href="Desolation%20Row">Desolation Row</a>" as "an 11-minute epic of entropy, which takes the form of a <a href="Federico%20Fellini">Fellini-esque</a> parade of grotesques and oddities featuring a huge cast of iconic characters". These include historical celebrities such as <a href="Einstein">Einstein</a> and <a href="Nero">Nero</a>, the biblical characters <a href="Noah">Noah</a> and <a href="Cain%20and%20Abel">Cain and Abel</a>, the Shakespearian figures of <a href="Ophelia">Ophelia</a> and <a href="Romeo">Romeo</a>, ending with literary titans <a href="T.S.%20Eliot">T.S. Eliot</a> and <a href="Ezra%20Pound">Ezra Pound</a>. The song opens with a report that "they're selling postcards of the hanging", and adds "the circus is in town". Polizzotti connects this song with the <a href="1920%20Duluth%20lynchings">lynching of three black circus workers in Duluth, Minnesota</a>, which was Dylan's birthplace, and describes "Desolation Row" as a cowboy song, "the 'Home On The Range' of the frightening territory that was mid-sixties America". In the penultimate verse, the passengers on the "<a href="RMS%20Titanic">Titanic</a>" are shouting "Which side are you on?". Shelton suggests Dylan is asking, "What difference which side you're on if you're sailing on the "Titanic"?" and is thus satirizing "simpleminded political commitment".

The first non-album outtake from the "Highway 61 Revisited" sessions to be released was the single "Positively 4th Street", although on an early pressing of the single Columbia used another "Highway 61" outtake, "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?", by mistake. "Crawl Out Your Window" was subsequently re-recorded with the Hawks in October, and released as a single in November 1965. Columbia accidentally released an alternate take of "From a Buick 6" on an early pressing of "Highway 61 Revisited", and this version continued to appear on the Japanese release for several years. Other outtakes officially released between 1991 and 2005 include alternate takes of "Like a Rolling Stone" and "It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry", and a previously unreleased song, "Sitting on a Barbed Wire Fence", on "The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 (Rare & Unreleased) 1961–1991", as well as alternate takes of "Desolation Row", "Highway 61 Revisited", "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues", "Tombstone Blues", and "It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry" on "The Bootleg Series Volume 7". Excerpts from several different takes of "Like a Rolling Stone" appeared on the "<a href="Highway%2061%20Interactive">Highway 61 Interactive</a>" CD-ROM, released in February 1995.

In 2015, Dylan released Volume 12 of his Bootleg Series, "", in three different formats. The 18-disc "Collector's Edition" was described as including "every note recorded during the 1965–1966 sessions, every alternate take and alternate lyric". The 18 CDs contain every take of every song recorded in the studio during the "Highway 61 Revisited" sessions, from June 15 to August 4, 1965.

The "Highway 61 Revisited" out-takes from the first recording session in New York, June 15 and 16, 1965 comprise: ten takes of "It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry", six takes of "Sitting On A Barbed-Wire Fence", and fifteen takes of "Like A Rolling Stone". Additionally, "The Cutting Edge" contains four instrumental "stem" tracks, lifted from Take Four which was the released "Master take" of "Like A Rolling Stone": Guitar (Mike Bloomfield); vocal, guitar (Bob Dylan), piano and bass; drums and organ.

The tracks from the second recording session in New York, July 29 to August 4, 1965, comprise seven takes of "It Takes A Lot To Laugh, It Takes A Train To Cry", sixteen takes of "Tombstone Blues", twelve takes of "Positively Fourth Street", five takes of "From A Buick 6", seventeen takes of "Can You Please Crawl Out Your Window?", nine takes of "Highway 61 Revisited", sixteen takes of "Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues", seven takes of Queen Jane Approximately", and eight takes of "Desolation Row".

Describing the process of listening to these many alternative versions, Chris Gerard wrote in "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>": "The fact that these versions do not approach the greatness of the final recordings is exactly the point. These are works in progress. It’s a guided tour through the creative process that led to these landmark albums."

The <a href="cover%20art">cover art</a>work was photographed by Daniel Kramer several weeks before the recording sessions. Kramer captured Dylan sitting on the stoop of the apartment of his manager, <a href="Albert%20Grossman">Albert Grossman</a>, located in <a href="Gramercy%20Park">Gramercy Park</a>, New York, placing Dylan's friend <a href="Bob%20Neuwirth">Bob Neuwirth</a> behind Dylan "to give it extra color". Dylan wears a <a href="Triumph%20Engineering">Triumph motorcycle</a> T-shirt under a blue and purple silk shirt, holding his <a href="Ray-Ban">Ray-Ban</a> sunglasses in his right hand. Photographer Kramer commented in 2010 on the singer's expression: "He's hostile, or it's a hostile moodiness. He's almost challenging me or you or whoever's looking at it: 'What are you gonna do about it, buster?

As he had on his previous three albums, Dylan contributed his own writing to the back cover of "Highway 61 Revisited", in the shape of freeform, <a href="surrealism">surrealist</a> prose: "On the slow train time does not interfere & at the Arabian crossing waits White Heap, the man from the newspaper & behind him the hundred inevitables made of solid rock & stone." One critic has pointed out the close similarity of these notes to the <a href="stream%20of%20consciousness%20%28narrative%20mode%29">stream of consciousness</a>, experimental novel "<a href="Tarantula%20%28book%29">Tarantula</a>", which Dylan was writing during 1965 and 1966.

In the British music press, initial reviews of "Highway 61" expressed both bafflement and admiration for the record. "<a href="New%20Musical%20Express">New Musical Express</a>" critic Allen Evans wrote: "Another set of message songs and story songs sung in that monotonous and tuneless way by Dylan which becomes quite arresting as you listen." The "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" LP review section, by an anonymous critic, commented: "Bob Dylan's sixth LP, like all others, is fairly incomprehensible but nevertheless an absolute knock-out." The English poet <a href="Philip%20Larkin">Philip Larkin</a>, reviewing the album for "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", wrote that he found himself "well rewarded" by the record: "Dylan's cawing, derisive voice is probably well suited to his material ... and his guitar adapts itself to rock ('Highway 61') and ballad ('Queen Jane'). There is a marathon 'Desolation Row' which has an enchanting tune and mysterious, possibly half-baked words."

In September 1965, the US trade journal "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" also praised the album, and predicted big sales for it: "Based upon his singles hit 'Like a Rolling Stone', Dylan has a top-of-the-chart-winner in this package of his off-beat, commercial material." The album peaked at number three on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> chart of top albums, and number four on the UK albums charts. In the US, "Highway 61" was certificated as a <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">gold record</a> in August 1967, and platinum in August 1997.

"Highway 61 Revisited" has remained among the most highly acclaimed of Dylan's works. Biographer <a href="Anthony%20Scaduto">Anthony Scaduto</a> praises its rich imagery, and describes it as "one of the most brilliant pop records ever made. As rock, it cuts through to the core of the music—a hard driving beat without frills, without self-consciousness." Michael Gray calls "Highway 61" "revolutionary and stunning, not just for its energy and panache but in its vision: fusing radical, electrical music ... with lyrics that were light years ahead of anyone else's; Dylan here unites the force of blues-based rock'n'roll with the power of poetry. The whole rock culture, the whole post-<a href="The%20Beatles">Beatle</a> pop-rock world, and so in an important sense the 1960s started here." In the opinion of "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" critic Hank Kalet, the album was the most "electrifying" rock and roll record ever and "one of a handful of albums (including the Beatles' "<a href="Rubber%20Soul">Rubber Soul</a>" and "<a href="Revolver%20%28Beatles%20album%29">Revolver</a>") that gave literate rockers the green light to create a kind of intelligent, probing rock music that had not existed before". "This seminal folk-rock classic" showcased "Dylan's seething, not-quite-out-of-control vocal delivery and a rough-and-tumble instrumental attack", as well as his "transformation from a folk singer to a rock and roller", Sam Sutherland wrote in "<a href="High%20Fidelity%20%28magazine%29">High Fidelity</a>".

Most of the songs on "Highway 61 Revisited" have remained important, in varying degrees, to Dylan's live performances since 1965.

Seabird

Seabirds (also known as marine birds) are <a href="bird">bird</a>s that are <a href="adaptation">adapted</a> to life within the <a href="marine%20%28ocean%29">marine</a> environment. While seabirds vary greatly in lifestyle, behaviour and physiology, they often exhibit striking <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>, as the same environmental problems and feeding <a href="ecological%20niche">niches</a> have resulted in similar adaptations. The first seabirds evolved in the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="geological%20period">period</a>, and modern seabird families emerged in the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a>.

In general, seabirds live longer, <a href="Reproduction">breed</a> later and have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest a great deal of time in their young. Most <a href="species">species</a> nest in <a href="Bird%20colony">colonies</a>, which can vary in size from a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for undertaking long annual <a href="bird%20migration">migrations</a>, crossing the <a href="equator">equator</a> or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly <a href="pelagic">pelagic</a>, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.

Seabirds and humans have a long history together: they have provided food to <a href="hunting">hunters</a>, guided <a href="fishing">fishermen</a> to fishing stocks and led <a href="sailor">sailor</a>s to land. Many species are currently <a href="threatened%20species">threatened</a> by human activities, and <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation</a> efforts are under way.

There exists no single definition of which groups, families and species are seabirds, and most definitions are in some way arbitrary. In the words of two seabird scientists, "The one common characteristic that all seabirds share is that they feed in <a href="seawater">saltwater</a>; but, as seems to be true with any statement in biology, some do not." However, by convention all of the <a href="penguin">Sphenisciformes</a> and <a href="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a>, all of the <a href="Pelecaniformes">Pelecaniformes</a> except the <a href="darter">darter</a>s, and some of the <a href="Charadriiformes">Charadriiformes</a> (the <a href="skua">skua</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="tern">tern</a>s, <a href="auk">auk</a>s and <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a>s) are classified as seabirds. The <a href="phalarope">phalarope</a>s are usually included as well, since although they are <a href="wader">wader</a>s ("shorebirds" in North America), two of the three species are oceanic for nine months of the year, crossing the equator to feed pelagically.

<a href="Loon">Loon</a>s and <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s, which nest on lakes but winter at sea, are usually categorized as water birds, not seabirds. Although there are a number of <a href="Merginae">sea ducks</a> in the family <a href="Anatidae">Anatidae</a> that are truly marine in the winter, by convention they are usually excluded from the seabird grouping. Many waders (or shorebirds) and <a href="heron">heron</a>s are also highly marine, living on the sea's edge (coast), but are also not treated as seabirds.

Seabirds, by virtue of living in a <a href="geology">geologically</a> depositional environment (that is, in the sea where <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s are readily laid down), are well represented in the <a href="fossil">fossil</a> record. They are first known to occur in the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period, the earliest being the <a href="Hesperornithiformes">Hesperornithiformes</a>, like "Hesperornis regalis", a flightless loon-like seabird that could dive in a fashion similar to grebes and loons (using its feet to move underwater) but had a beak filled with sharp teeth. Flying Cretaceous seabirds do not exceed wingspans of two meters; any sizes were taken by piscivorous <a href="pterosaurs">pterosaurs</a>.
While "Hesperornis" is not thought to have left descendants, the earliest <a href="Neornithes">modern</a> seabirds also occurred in the Cretaceous, with a species called "<a href="Tytthostonyx%20glauconiticus">Tytthostonyx glauconiticus</a>", which seems allied to the <a href="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a> and <a href="Pelecaniformes">Pelecaniformes</a>. In the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> both pterosaurs and marine reptiles became extinct, allowing seabirds to expand ecologically. These post-extinction seas were dominated by early <a href="Procellariidae">Procellariidae</a>, giant <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s and two <a href="extinct">extinct</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a>, the <a href="Pelagornithidae">Pelagornithidae</a> and the <a href="Plotopteridae">Plotopteridae</a> (a group of large seabirds that looked like the penguins). Modern genera began their wide radiation in the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>, although the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Puffinus">Puffinus</a>" (which includes today's <a href="Manx%20shearwater">Manx shearwater</a> and <a href="sooty%20shearwater">sooty shearwater</a>) might date back to the <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>. The highest diversity of seabirds apparently existed during the Late Miocene and the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>. At the end of the latter, the oceanic <a href="food%20web">food web</a> had undergone a period of upheaval due to extinction of considerable numbers of marine species; subsequently, the spread of marine mammals seems to have prevented seabirds from reaching their erstwhile diversity.

Seabirds have made numerous adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. <a href="Wing">Wing</a> morphology has been shaped by the <a href="ecological%20niche">niche</a> an individual species or family has <a href="evolution">evolved</a>, so that looking at a wing's shape and <a href="wing%20loading">loading</a> can tell a scientist about its life feeding behaviour. Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more <a href="pelagic">pelagic</a> species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the <a href="wandering%20albatross">wandering albatross</a>, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of <a href="Gliding%20flight">gliding</a> called <a href="dynamic%20soaring">dynamic soaring</a> (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have <a href="Bird%20feet%20and%20legs%23Webbing%20and%20lobation">webbed feet</a>, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The <a href="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a> are unusual among birds in having a strong <a href="olfaction">sense of smell</a>, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.

<a href="Supraorbital%20gland">Salt glands</a> are used by seabirds to deal with the <a href="Edible%20salt">salt</a> they ingest by drinking and feeding (particularly on <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s), and to help them <a href="osmoregulation">osmoregulate</a>. The <a href="excretion">excretion</a>s from these glands (which are positioned in the head of the birds, emerging from the <a href="nasal%20cavity">nasal cavity</a>) are almost pure <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a>.

With the exception of the <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s and some terns, and in common with most other birds, all seabirds have waterproof <a href="plumage">plumage</a>. However, compared to land birds, they have far more feathers protecting their bodies. This dense plumage is better able to protect the bird from getting wet, and cold is kept out by a dense layer of <a href="down%20feathers">down feathers</a>. The cormorants possess a layer of unique feathers that retain a smaller layer of air (compared to other diving birds) but otherwise soak up water. This allows them to swim without fighting the <a href="buoyancy">buoyancy</a> that retaining air in the feathers causes, yet retain enough air to prevent the bird losing excessive heat through contact with water.

The plumage of most seabirds is less colourful than that of land birds, restricted in the main to variations of black, white or grey. A few species sport colourful plumes (such as the tropicbirds and some penguins), but most of the colour in seabirds appears in the bills and legs. The plumage of seabirds is thought in many cases to be for <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>, both defensive (the colour of <a href="United%20States%20Navy">US Navy</a> <a href="battleship">battleship</a>s is the same as that of <a href="Antarctic%20prion">Antarctic prion</a>s, and in both cases it reduces visibility at sea) and aggressive (the white underside possessed by many seabirds helps hide them from prey below). The usually black wing tips help prevent wear, as they contain melanins to make them black that helps the feathers resist abrasion.

Seabirds evolved to exploit different food resources in the world's seas and oceans, and to a great extent, their <a href="physiology">physiology</a> and <a href="ethology">behaviour</a> have been shaped by their <a href="diet%20%28nutrition%29">diet</a>. These evolutionary forces have often caused species in different families and even orders to evolve similar strategies and adaptations to the same problems, leading to remarkable <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>, such as that between <a href="auk">auk</a>s and <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s. There are four basic feeding strategies, or ecological guilds, for feeding at sea: surface feeding, pursuit diving, plunge diving and predation of <a href="higher%20vertebrates">higher vertebrates</a>; within these guilds there are multiple variations on the theme.

Many seabirds feed on the ocean's surface, as the action of marine <a href="ocean%20current">currents</a> often concentrates food such as <a href="krill">krill</a>, <a href="forage%20fish">forage fish</a>, <a href="squid">squid</a> or other prey items within reach of a dipped head.

Surface feeding itself can be broken up into two different approaches, surface feeding while <a href="bird%20flight">flying</a> (for example as practiced by <a href="gadfly%20petrel">gadfly petrel</a>s, <a href="frigatebird">frigatebird</a>s and <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>s), and surface feeding while swimming (examples of which are practiced by <a href="fulmar">fulmar</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, many of the <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s and gadfly petrels). Surface feeders in flight include some of the most acrobatic of seabirds, which either snatch morsels from the water (as do frigate-birds and some terns), or "walk", pattering and hovering on the water's surface, as some of the storm-petrels do. Many of these do not ever land in the water, and some, such as the frigatebirds, have difficulty getting airborne again should they do so. Another seabird family that does not land while feeding is the <a href="skimmer">skimmer</a>, which has a unique fishing method: flying along the surface with the lower mandible in the water—this shuts automatically when the bill touches something in the water. The skimmer's bill reflects its unusual lifestyle, with the lower mandible uniquely being longer than the upper one.

Surface feeders that swim often have unique bills as well, adapted for their specific prey. <a href="Prion%20%28bird%29">Prions</a> have special bills with filters called <a href="lamella%20%28zoology%29">lamellae</a> to filter out <a href="plankton">plankton</a> from mouthfuls of water, and many albatrosses and petrels have hooked bills to snatch fast-moving prey. Gulls have more generalised bills that reflect their more opportunistic lifestyle.

Pursuit diving exerts greater pressures (both evolutionary and physiological) on seabirds, but the reward is a greater area in which to feed than is available to surface feeders. <a href="Marine%20propulsion">Propulsion</a> underwater can be provided by wings (as used by penguins, auks, <a href="diving%20petrel">diving petrel</a>s and some other species of petrel) or <a href="Bird%20feet%20and%20legs">feet</a> (as used by <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s, <a href="grebe">grebe</a>s, <a href="loon">loon</a>s and several types of fish-eating <a href="duck">duck</a>s). Wing-propelled divers are generally faster than foot-propelled divers. In both cases, the use of wings or feet for diving has limited their utility in other situations: loons and grebes walk with extreme difficulty (if at all), <a href="penguin">penguin</a>s cannot fly, and auks have sacrificed flight efficiency in favour of underwater diving. For example, the <a href="razorbill">razorbill</a> (an <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> auk) requires 64% more energy to fly than a petrel of equivalent size. Many <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s are intermediate between the two, having longer wings than typical wing-propelled divers but heavier wing loadings than the other surface-feeding <a href="procellariidae">procellariids</a>, leaving them capable of diving to considerable depths while still being efficient long-distance travellers. The deepest diving exhibited by shearwaters is found in the <a href="short-tailed%20shearwater">short-tailed shearwater</a>, which has been recorded diving below 70 m. Some albatross species are also capable of limited diving, with <a href="light-mantled%20sooty%20albatross">light-mantled sooty albatross</a>es holding the record at 12 m. Of all the wing-propelled pursuit divers, the most efficient in the air are the <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es, and they are also the poorest divers. This is the dominant guild in polar and subpolar environments, as it is energetically inefficient in warmer waters. With their poor flying ability, many wing-propelled pursuit divers are more limited in their foraging range than other guilds, especially during the breeding season when hungry chicks need regular feeding.

<a href="Gannet">Gannet</a>s, <a href="booby">boobies</a>, <a href="tropicbird">tropicbird</a>s, some <a href="tern">tern</a>s and <a href="brown%20pelican">brown pelican</a>s all engage in plunge diving, taking fast moving prey by diving into the water from flight. Plunge diving allows birds to use the energy from the momentum of the dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished <a href="tropics">tropical</a> seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of plunge diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20 m (70 ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that plunge divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between plunge diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some plunge divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s and <a href="tuna">tuna</a> to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.

This catch-all category refers to other seabird strategies that involve the next <a href="trophic%20level">trophic level</a> up. <a href="Kleptoparasitism">Kleptoparasites</a> are seabirds that make a part of their living stealing food of other seabirds. Most famously, <a href="frigatebird">frigatebird</a>s and <a href="skua">skua</a>s engage in this behaviour, although gulls, terns and other species will steal food opportunistically. The <a href="nocturnal%20animal">nocturnal</a> nesting behaviour of some seabirds has been interpreted as arising due to pressure from this aerial piracy. Kleptoparasitism is not thought to play a significant part of the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of <a href="great%20frigatebird">great frigatebird</a>s stealing from <a href="masked%20booby">masked boobies</a> estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%. Many species of gull will feed on seabird and sea mammal <a href="carrion">carrion</a> when the opportunity arises, as will <a href="giant%20petrel">giant petrel</a>s. Some species of albatross also engage in scavenging: an analysis of regurgitated <a href="squid">squid</a> beaks has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive, and include mid-water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatrosses. Some species will also feed on other seabirds; for example, gulls, skuas and pelicans will often take eggs, chicks and even small adult seabirds from nesting colonies, while the giant petrels can kill prey up to the size of small penguins and seal pups.

Seabirds' life histories are dramatically different from those of land birds. In general, they are <a href="K-selected">K-selected</a>, live much longer (anywhere between twenty and sixty years), delay breeding for longer (for up to ten years), and invest more effort into fewer young. Most species will only have one <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> a year, unless they lose the first (with a few exceptions, like the <a href="Cassin%27s%20auklet">Cassin's auklet</a>), and many species (like the <a href="Procellariiformes">tubenoses</a> and <a href="sulidae">sulids</a>), only one egg a year.

Care of young is protracted, extending for as long as six months, among the longest for birds. For example, once <a href="common%20guillemot">common guillemot</a> chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a>, they remain with the male parent for several months at sea. The <a href="frigatebird">frigatebird</a>s have the longest period of parental care of any bird except a few raptors and the <a href="southern%20ground%20hornbill">southern ground hornbill</a>, with each chick fledging after four to six months and continued assistance after that for up to fourteen months. Due to the extended period of care, breeding occurs every two years rather than annually for some species. This life-history strategy has probably evolved both in response to the challenges of living at sea (collecting widely scattered prey items), the frequency of breeding failures due to unfavourable marine conditions, and the relative lack of predation compared to that of land-living birds.

Because of the greater investment in raising the young and because foraging for food may occur far from the nest site, in all seabird species except the phalaropes, both parents participate in caring for the young, and pairs are typically at least seasonally <a href="Animal%20sexuality%23Monogamy">monogamous</a>. Many species, such as gulls, auks and penguins, retain the same mate for several seasons, and many <a href="petrel">petrel</a> species mate for life. Albatrosses and <a href="procellariid">procellariid</a>s, which mate for life, take many years to form a pair bond before they breed, and the albatrosses have an elaborate breeding dance that is part of pair-bond formation.

Ninety-five percent of seabirds are colonial, and seabird colonies are among the largest bird colonies in the world, providing one of Earth's great wildlife spectacles. Colonies of over a million birds have been recorded, both in the <a href="tropics">tropics</a> (such as <a href="Kiritimati">Kiritimati</a> in the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>) and in the polar latitudes (as in <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>). Seabird colonies occur exclusively for the purpose of breeding; non-breeding birds will only collect together outside the breeding season in areas where prey species are densely aggregated.

Seabird colonies are highly variable. Individual nesting sites can be widely spaced, as in an albatross colony, or densely packed as with a <a href="murre">murre</a> colony. In most seabird colonies, several different species will nest on the same colony, often exhibiting some <a href="Niche%20differentiation">niche separation</a>. Seabirds can nest in trees (if any are available), on the ground (with or without <a href="bird%20nest">nests</a>), on cliffs, in <a href="burrow">burrow</a>s under the ground and in rocky crevices. Competition can be strong both within species and between species, with aggressive species such as <a href="sooty%20tern">sooty tern</a>s pushing less dominant species out of the most desirable nesting spaces. The tropical <a href="Bonin%20petrel">Bonin petrel</a> nests during the winter to avoid competition with the more aggressive <a href="wedge-tailed%20shearwater">wedge-tailed shearwater</a>. When the seasons overlap, the wedge-tailed shearwaters will kill young Bonin petrels in order to use their burrows.

Many seabirds show remarkable site <a href="fidelity">fidelity</a>, returning to the same burrow, nest or site for many years, and they will defend that site from rivals with great vigour. This increases breeding success, provides a place for returning mates to reunite, and reduces the costs of prospecting for a new site. Young adults breeding for the first time usually return to their natal colony, and often nest close to where they hatched. This tendency, known as <a href="philopatry">philopatry</a>, is so strong that a study of <a href="Laysan%20albatross">Laysan albatross</a>es found that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22 m; another study, this time on <a href="Cory%27s%20shearwater">Cory's shearwater</a>s nesting near <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a>, found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony bred in the burrow they were raised in, and two actually bred with their own mother.

Colonies are usually situated on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This is thought to provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of bird that do not defend feeding territories (such as <a href="swift">swift</a>s, which have a very variable prey source); this may be a reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of <a href="predation">predators</a>, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.

Like many birds, seabirds often <a href="bird%20migration">migrate</a> after the <a href="breeding%20season">breeding season</a>. Of these, the trip taken by the <a href="Arctic%20tern">Arctic tern</a> is the farthest of any bird, crossing the <a href="equator">equator</a> in order to spend the Austral summer in Antarctica. Other species also undertake trans-equatorial trips, both from the north to the south, and from south to north. The population of <a href="elegant%20tern">elegant tern</a>s, which nest off <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a>, splits after the breeding season with some birds travelling north to the <a href="Central%20Coast%20of%20California">Central Coast of California</a> and some travelling as far south as <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and <a href="Chile">Chile</a> to feed in the <a href="Humboldt%20Current">Humboldt Current</a>. The <a href="sooty%20shearwater">sooty shearwater</a> undertakes an annual migration cycle that rivals that of the Arctic tern; birds that nest in <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> and Chile and spend the northern summer feeding in the North Pacific off <a href="Japan">Japan</a>, <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and California, an annual round trip of .

Other species also migrate shorter distances away from the breeding sites, their distribution at sea determined by the availability of food. If oceanic conditions are unsuitable, seabirds will emigrate to more productive areas, sometimes permanently if the bird is young. After fledging, juvenile birds often disperse further than adults, and to different areas, so are commonly sighted far from a species' normal range. Some species, such as the auks, do not have a concerted migration effort, but drift southwards as the winter approaches. Other species, such as some of the <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>s, <a href="diving%20petrel">diving petrel</a>s and <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s, never disperse at all, staying near their breeding colonies year round.

While the definition of seabirds suggests that the birds in question spend their lives on the ocean, many seabird families have many species that spend some or even most of their lives inland away from the sea. Most strikingly, many species breed tens, hundreds or even thousands of miles inland. Some of these species still return to the ocean to feed; for example, the <a href="snow%20petrel">snow petrel</a>, the nests of which have been found inland on the Antarctic mainland, are unlikely to find anything to eat around their breeding sites. The <a href="marbled%20murrelet">marbled murrelet</a> nests inland in <a href="old%20growth%20forest">old growth forest</a>, seeking huge <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s with large branches to nest on. Other species, such as the <a href="California%20gull">California gull</a>, nest and feed inland on <a href="lake">lake</a>s, and then move to the coasts in the winter. Some <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>, <a href="pelican">pelican</a>, <a href="gull">gull</a> and <a href="tern">tern</a> species have individuals that never visit the sea at all, spending their lives on lakes, rivers, <a href="swamp">swamp</a>s and, in the case of some of the gulls, cities and <a href="agriculture">agricultural</a> land. In these cases it is thought that these terrestrial or freshwater birds evolved from marine ancestors. Some seabirds, principally those that nest in <a href="tundra">tundra</a>, as skuas and phalaropes do, will migrate over land as well.

The more marine species, such as <a href="petrel">petrel</a>s, <a href="auk">auk</a>s and <a href="gannet">gannet</a>s, are more restricted in their habits, but are occasionally seen inland as vagrants. This most commonly happens to young inexperienced birds, but can happen in great numbers to exhausted adults after large <a href="storm">storm</a>s, an event known as a "wreck", where they provide prized sightings for <a href="birdwatching">birders</a>.

Seabirds have had a long association with both <a href="fishery">fisheries</a> and <a href="sailor">sailor</a>s, and both have drawn benefits and disadvantages from the relationship.

Fishermen have traditionally used seabirds as indicators of both <a href="Shoaling%20and%20schooling">fish shoals</a>, underwater <a href="bank%20%28topography%29">banks</a> that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall. In fact, the known association of seabirds with land was instrumental in allowing the <a href="Polynesia">Polynesia</a>ns to locate tiny landmasses in the Pacific. Seabirds have provided food for fishermen away from home, as well as bait. Famously, tethered <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s have been used to catch fish directly. Indirectly, fisheries have also benefited from <a href="guano">guano</a> from colonies of seabirds acting as <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a> for the surrounding seas.

Negative effects on fisheries are mostly restricted to raiding by birds on <a href="aquaculture">aquaculture</a>, although <a href="long-line%20fishing">long-lining</a> fisheries also have to deal with <a href="bait%20%28luring%20substance%29">bait</a> stealing. There have been claims of prey depletion by seabirds of fishery stocks, and while there is some evidence of this, the effects of seabirds are considered smaller than that of <a href="marine%20mammal">marine mammal</a>s and predatory fish (like <a href="tuna">tuna</a>).

Some seabird species have benefited from fisheries, particularly from discarded fish and <a href="offal">offal</a>. These discards compose 30% of the food of seabirds in the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, for example, and compose up to 70% of the total food of some seabird populations. This can have other impacts; for example, the spread of the <a href="northern%20fulmar">northern fulmar</a> through the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> is attributed in part to the availability of discards. Discards generally benefit surface feeders, such as gannets and petrels, to the detriment of pursuit divers like penguins.

Fisheries also have negative effects on seabirds, and these effects, particularly on the long-lived and slow-breeding albatrosses, are a source of increasing concern to conservationists. The bycatch of seabirds entangled in nets or hooked on fishing lines has had a big impact on seabird numbers; for example, an estimated 100,000 albatrosses are hooked and drown each year on tuna lines set out by long-line fisheries. Overall, many hundreds of thousands of birds are trapped and killed each year, a source of concern for some of the rarest species (for example, only about 2,000 <a href="short-tailed%20albatross">short-tailed albatross</a>es are known to still exist). Seabirds are also thought to suffer when overfishing occurs.

The <a href="hunting">hunting</a> of seabirds and the collecting of seabird <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a> have contributed to the declines of many species, and the <a href="extinct">extinct</a>ion of several, including the <a href="great%20auk">great auk</a> and the <a href="spectacled%20cormorant">spectacled cormorant</a>. Seabirds have been hunted for food by coastal peoples throughout history—one of the earliest instances known is in southern <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, where <a href="archeology">archaeological</a> excavations in middens has shown hunting of albatrosses, cormorants and shearwaters from 5000 BP. This pressure has led to some species becoming extinct in many places; in particular, at least 20 species of an original 29 no longer breed on <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>. In the 19th century, the hunting of seabirds for <a href="fat">fat</a> deposits and feathers for the <a href="Hat">millinery</a> trade reached <a href="industry">industrial</a> levels. <a href="wikt%3Amuttonbirding">Muttonbirding</a> (harvesting shearwater chicks) developed as important industries in both New Zealand and Tasmania, and the name of one species, the <a href="providence%20petrel">providence petrel</a>, is derived from its seemingly miraculous arrival on <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a> where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers. In the <a href="Falkland%20Islands">Falkland Islands</a>, hundreds of thousands of penguins were harvested for their oil each year. Seabird eggs have also long been an important source of food for sailors undertaking long sea voyages, as well as being taken when settlements grow in areas near a colony. Eggers from <a href="San%20Francisco%2C%20California">San Francisco</a> took almost half a million eggs a year from the <a href="Farallon%20Islands">Farallon Islands</a> in the mid-19th century, a period in the islands' history from which the seabird species are still recovering.

Both hunting and egging continue today, although not at the levels that occurred in the past, and generally in a more controlled manner. For example, the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a> of <a href="Stewart%20Island/Rakiura">Stewart Island/Rakiura</a> continue to harvest the chicks of the <a href="sooty%20shearwater">sooty shearwater</a> as they have done for centuries, using traditional methods (called "<a href="kaitiaki">kaitiaki</a>tanga") to manage the harvest, but now work with the <a href="University%20of%20Otago">University of Otago</a> in studying the populations. In <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a>, however, uncontrolled hunting is pushing many species into steep decline.

Other human factors have led to declines and even extinctions in seabird populations, colonies and species. Of these, perhaps the most serious are <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a>. Seabirds, breeding predominantly on small isolated islands, have lost many predator defence behaviours. <a href="Feral%20cat">Feral cat</a>s are capable of taking seabirds as large as albatrosses, and many introduced rodents, such as the <a href="Polynesian%20rat">Pacific rat</a>, can take eggs hidden in burrows. Introduced <a href="goat">goat</a>s, <a href="cattle">cattle</a>, <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s and other <a href="herbivore">herbivore</a>s can lead to problems, particularly when species need vegetation to protect or shade their young. Disturbance of breeding colonies by humans is often a problem as well—visitors, even well-meaning <a href="tourism">tourists</a>, can flush brooding adults off a colony leaving chicks and eggs vulnerable to predators.
The build-up of <a href="toxin">toxin</a>s and <a href="pollution">pollutants</a> in seabirds is also a concern. Seabirds, being apex predators, suffered from the ravages of <a href="DDT">DDT</a> until it was banned; among other effects, DDT was implicated in embryo development problems and the skewed sex ratio of <a href="western%20gull">western gull</a>s in southern California. <a href="Oil%20spill">Oil spill</a>s are also a threat to seabird species, as both a toxin and because the feathers of the birds become saturated by the oil, causing them to lose their waterproofing. Oil pollution threatens species with restricted ranges or already depressed populations.

The threats faced by seabirds have not gone unnoticed by scientists or the <a href="conservation%20movement">conservation movement</a>. As early as 1903, U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> was convinced of the need to declare <a href="Pelican%20Island%20National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">Pelican Island</a> in <a href="Florida">Florida</a> a <a href="National%20Wildlife%20Refuge">National Wildlife Refuge</a> to protect the bird colonies (including the nesting <a href="brown%20pelican">brown pelican</a>s), and in 1909 he protected the <a href="Farallon%20Islands">Farallon Islands</a>. Today many important seabird colonies are given some measure of protection, from <a href="Heron%20Island%2C%20Australia">Heron Island</a> in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> to Triangle Island in <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>.

<a href="Island%20restoration">Island restoration</a> techniques, pioneered by <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, enable the removal of exotic invaders from increasingly large islands. Feral cats have been removed from <a href="Ascension%20Island">Ascension Island</a>, <a href="Arctic%20fox">Arctic fox</a>es from many islands in the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutian Islands</a>, and rats from <a href="Campbell%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Campbell Island</a>. The removal of these introduced species has led to increases in numbers of species under pressure and even the return of extirpated ones. After the removal of cats from Ascension Island, seabirds began to nest there again for the first time in over a hundred years.

Seabird mortality caused by <a href="Longline%20bycatch%20in%20Hawaii">long-line fisheries</a> can be greatly reduced by techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and by using bird scarers, and their deployment is increasingly required by many national fishing fleets. The international ban on the use of <a href="drift%20net">drift net</a>s has also helped reduce the mortality of seabirds and other marine wildlife.

One of the Millennium Projects in the UK was the <a href="Scottish%20Seabird%20Centre">Scottish Seabird Centre</a>, near the important bird sanctuaries on <a href="Bass%20Rock">Bass Rock</a>, <a href="Fidra">Fidra</a> and the surrounding islands. The area is home to huge colonies of gannets, <a href="puffin">puffin</a>s, skuas and other seabirds. The centre allows visitors to watch live video from the islands as well as learn about the threats the birds face and how we can protect them, and has helped to significantly raise the profile of seabird conservation in the UK. Seabird tourism can provide income for coastal communities as well as raise the profile of seabird conservation. For example, the <a href="northern%20royal%20albatross">northern royal albatross</a> colony at <a href="Taiaroa%20Head">Taiaroa Head</a> in New Zealand attracts 40,000 visitors a year.

The plight of albatross and large seabirds, as well as other marine creatures, being taken as bycatch by long-line fisheries, has been addressed by a large number of <a href="non-governmental%20organization">non-governmental organization</a>s (including <a href="BirdLife%20International">BirdLife International</a>, the American Bird Conservancy and the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a>). This led to the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Albatrosses%20and%20Petrels">Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels</a>, a legally binding treaty designed to protect these threatened species, which has been ratified by eleven countries as of 2008 (namely Argentina, Australia, Chile, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, New Zealand, Norway, <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>).

Many seabirds are little studied and poorly known, due to living far out to sea and breeding in isolated colonies. However, some seabirds, particularly, the albatrosses and gulls, have broken into popular consciousness. The albatrosses have been described as "the most legendary of birds", and have a variety of <a href="mythology">myths</a> and <a href="legend">legend</a>s associated with them, and today it is widely considered <a href="luck">unlucky</a> to harm them, although the notion that sailors believed that is a <a href="urban%20legend">myth</a> that derives from <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>'s famous <a href="poem">poem</a>, "<a href="The%20Rime%20of%20the%20Ancient%20Mariner">The Rime of the Ancient Mariner</a>", in which a sailor is punished for killing an albatross by having to wear its corpse around his neck.

"Instead of the Cross the Albatross"
"About my neck was hung"

Sailors did, however, consider it unlucky to touch a <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>, especially one that has landed on the ship.

Gulls are one of the most commonly seen seabirds, given their use of human-made <a href="habitat%20%28ecology%29">habitats</a> (such as cities and <a href="landfill">dumps</a>) and their often fearless nature. They therefore also have made it into the popular consciousness – they have been used <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>ically, as in "<a href="Jonathan%20Livingston%20Seagull">Jonathan Livingston Seagull</a>" by <a href="Richard%20Bach">Richard Bach</a>, or to denote a closeness to the sea, such as their use in "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings">The Lord of the Rings</a>" both in the insignia of <a href="Gondor">Gondor</a> and therefore <a href="N%C3%BAmenor">Númenor</a> (used in the design of the films), and to call <a href="Legolas">Legolas</a> to (and across) the sea. Other species have also made an impact; <a href="pelican">pelican</a>s have long been associated with mercy and <a href="altruism">altruism</a> because of an early Western <a href="Christianity">Christian</a> myth that they split open their breast to feed their starving chicks.

The following are the groups of birds normally classed as seabirds.

<a href="Sphenisciformes">Sphenisciformes</a> (Antarctic and southern waters; 16 species)

<a href="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a> (Tubenoses: pan-oceanic and pelagic; 93 species)

Arnold Bax

Sir Arnold Edward Trevor Bax (8 November 1883 – 3 October 1953) was an English composer, poet, and author. His prolific output includes songs, choral music, chamber pieces, and solo piano works, but he is best known for his orchestral music. In addition to a series of <a href="symphonic%20poems">symphonic poems</a> he wrote seven symphonies and was for a time widely regarded as the leading British symphonist.

Bax was born in the London suburb of <a href="Streatham">Streatham</a> to a prosperous family. He was encouraged by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> Bax became fascinated with Ireland and <a href="Celts%20%28modern%29">Celtic</a> culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. In the years before the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. Later, he developed an affinity with <a href="Nordic%20countries">Nordic</a> culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War.

Between 1910 and 1920 Bax wrote a large amount of music, including the symphonic poem "<a href="Tintagel%20%28Bax%29">Tintagel</a>", his best-known work. During this period he formed a lifelong association with the pianist <a href="Harriet%20Cohen">Harriet Cohen</a> – at first an affair, then a friendship, and always a close professional relationship. In the 1920s he began the series of seven symphonies which form the heart of his orchestral output. In 1942 Bax was appointed <a href="Master%20of%20the%20Queen%27s%20Music">Master of the King's Music</a>, but composed little in that capacity. In his last years he found his music regarded as old-fashioned, and after his death it was generally neglected. From the 1960s onwards, mainly through a growing number of commercial recordings, his music was gradually rediscovered, although little of it is heard with any frequency in the concert hall. In more recent years, Bax's music has been (re-)discovered enthusiastically by a new generation via online distribution services such as <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>.

Bax was born in the London suburb of <a href="Streatham">Streatham</a>, Surrey, to a prosperous Victorian family. He was the eldest son of Alfred Ridley Bax (1844–1918) and his wife, Charlotte Ellen, "née" Lea (1860–1940). The couple's youngest son, <a href="Clifford%20Bax">Clifford Lea Bax</a>, became a playwright and essayist. Alfred Bax was a <a href="barrister">barrister</a> of the <a href="Middle%20Temple">Middle Temple</a>, but having a private income he did not practise. In 1896 the family moved to a mansion in <a href="Fellows%20Road">Fellows Road</a>, <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>. Bax later wrote that although it would have been good to be raised in the country, the large gardens of the family house were the next best thing. He was a musical child: "I cannot remember the long-lost day when I was unable to play the piano – inaccurately".

After a <a href="Preparatory%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">preparatory school</a> in <a href="Balham">Balham</a>, Bax attended the Hampstead Conservatoire during the 1890s. The establishment was run – "with considerable personal pomp", according to Bax – by <a href="Cecil%20Sharp">Cecil Sharp</a>, whose passion for English folk-song and folk-dance excited no response in his pupil. An enthusiasm for folk music was widespread among British composers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Parry</a>, <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Stanford</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a> and <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Holst</a>; <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sullivan</a> and <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a> stood aloof, as did Bax, who later put into general circulation the saying, "You should make a point of trying every experience once, excepting incest and folk-dancing."
In 1900 Bax moved on to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>, where he remained until 1905, studying composition with <a href="Frederick%20Corder">Frederick Corder</a> and piano with <a href="Tobias%20Matthay">Tobias Matthay</a>. Corder was a devotee of the works of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, whose music was Bax's principal inspiration in his early years. He later observed, "For a dozen years of my youth I wallowed in Wagner's music to the almost total exclusion – until I became aware of <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a> – of any other". Bax also discovered and privately studied the works of <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>, whose music, like that of Strauss, was frowned on by the largely conservative faculty of the Academy.

Although Bax won a <a href="George%20Alexander%20Macfarren">Macfarren</a> Scholarship for composition and other important prizes, and was known for his exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries <a href="Benjamin%20Dale">Benjamin Dale</a> and <a href="York%20Bowen">York Bowen</a>. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. "The Times" considered that Bax's independence and disinclination to heed his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.

After leaving the Academy Bax visited Dresden, where he saw the original production of Strauss's "<a href="Salome%20%28opera%29">Salome</a>", and first heard the music of <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a>, which he found "eccentric, long-winded, muddle-headed, and yet always interesting". Among the influences on the young Bax was the Irish poet <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>; Bax's brother Clifford introduced him to Yeats's poetry and to Ireland. Influenced by Yeats's "<a href="The%20Wanderings%20of%20Oisin%20and%20Other%20Poems">The Wanderings of Oisin</a>", Bax visited the west coast of Ireland in 1902, and found that "in a moment the Celt within me stood revealed". His first composition to be performed – at an Academy concert in 1902 – was an Irish dialect song called "The Grand Match".

Musically, Bax veered away from the influence of Wagner and Strauss, and deliberately adopted what he conceived of as a Celtic idiom. In 1908 he began a <a href="trilogy">trilogy</a> of tone poems called "Eire" (I. "Into the Twilight" / II. "In the Faëry Hills" / III. "Roscatha"), described by his biographer Lewis Foreman as the beginning of the composer's truly mature style. The first of these pieces, "Into the Twilight", was premiered by <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Thomas Beecham</a> and the New Symphony Orchestra in April 1909, and the following year, at Elgar's instigation, <a href="Henry%20Wood">Henry Wood</a> commissioned the second in the cycle, "<a href="In%20the%20Fa%C3%ABry%20Hills">In the Faëry Hills</a>". The work received mixed notices. "<a href="The%20Manchester%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>"'s reviewer wrote, "Mr Bax has happily suggested the appropriate atmosphere of mystery"; "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" found the piece "very undeterminate and unsatisfying, but not difficult to follow". "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" commented on the "rather second-hand language" at some points, derivative of Wagner and Debussy, although "there is still a great deal which is wholly individual". "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" praised "a mystic glamour that could not fail to be felt by the listener" although the coherence of the piece "was not instantly discernible". A third work in the cycle, "Roscatha", was not performed in the composer's lifetime.

Bax's private means enabled him to travel to the <a href="Russian%20Empire">Russian Empire</a> in 1910. He was in pursuit of Natalia Skarginska, a young Ukrainian whom he had met in London – one of several women with whom he fell in love over the years. The visit eventually proved a failure from the romantic point of view but musically enriched him. In <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Saint Petersburg</a> he discovered and immediately loved ballet; he absorbed Russian musical influences that inspired material for the First Piano Sonata, the piano pieces, "May Night in the Ukraine" and "Gopak", and the First Violin Sonata, dedicated to Skarginska. Foreman describes him in this period as "a musical magpie, celebrating his latest discoveries in new compositions"; Foreman adds that Bax's own musical personality was strong enough for him to assimilate his influences and make them into his own. Russian music continued to influence him until the First World War. An unfinished ballet "Tamara", "a little-Russian fairy tale in action and dance", provided material the composer reused in post-war works.

Having given up his pursuit of Skarginska, Bax returned to England; in January 1911 he married the pianist Elsita Luisa Sobrino (b. 1885 or 1886), daughter of the teacher and pianist, Carlos Sobrino, and his wife, Luise, "née" Schmitz, a singer. Bax and his wife lived first in Chester Terrace, <a href="Regent%27s%20Park">Regent's Park</a>, London, and then moved to Ireland, taking a house in <a href="Rathgar">Rathgar</a>, a well-to-do suburb of Dublin. They had two children, Dermot (1912–1976) and Maeve Astrid (1913–1987). Bax became known in Dublin literary circles under the pseudonym "Dermot O'Byrne"; he mixed with the writer <a href="George%20William%20Russell">George William Russell</a> and his associates, and published stories, verses and a play. Reviewing a selection of the prose and poetry reissued in 1980, Stephen Banfield found most of Bax's earlier poems "like his early music, over-written, cluttered with the secondhand lumber of early Yeats, though the weakness is one of loosely chosen language rather than complexity." Banfield had better things to say of the later poems, where Bax "focuses matters, whether laconically and colloquially upon the grim futility of the 1916 <a href="Easter%20rising">Easter rising</a> ... or pungently upon his recurrent disillusionment about love." Some of Bax's writings as O'Byrne were regarded as subversively sympathetic to the <a href="Irish%20republicanism">Irish republican</a> cause, and the government censor prohibited their publication.

At the beginning of the war Bax returned to England. A heart complaint, from which he suffered intermittently throughout his life, made him unfit for military service; he acted as a <a href="special%20constable">special constable</a> for a period. At a time when fellow composers including Vaughan Williams, <a href="Arthur%20Bliss">Arthur Bliss</a>, <a href="George%20Butterworth">George Butterworth</a> and <a href="Ivor%20Gurney">Ivor Gurney</a> were serving overseas, Bax was able to produce a large body of music, finding, in Foreman's phrase, "his technical and artistic maturity" in his early thirties. Among his better-known works from the period are the orchestral <a href="symphonic%20poem">tone poems</a> "<a href="November%20Woods">November Woods</a>" (1916) and "<a href="Tintagel%20%28Bax%29">Tintagel</a>" (1917–19).

During his time in Dublin Bax had made many republican friends. The Easter rising in April 1916 and the subsequent execution of the ringleaders shocked him deeply. He expressed his feelings in some of his music such as the orchestral "In Memoriam" and the "Elegiac Trio" for flute, viola, and harp (1916), as well as in his poetry.

In addition to his Irish influences, Bax also drew on a Nordic tradition, being inspired by the Norwegian poet <a href="Bj%C3%B8rnstjerne%20Bj%C3%B8rnson">Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson</a> and Icelandic sagas. Bax's Symphonic Variations for Piano and Orchestra (1917) is seen by the <a href="musicologist">musicologist</a> <a href="Julian%20Herbage">Julian Herbage</a> as the turning-point from the Celtic to the Nordic in Bax's oeuvre; Herbage views it as a further indication of the shift that "Winter Legends", composed thirteen years later, has a Nordic rather than a Celtic setting.

During the war Bax began an affair with the pianist <a href="Harriet%20Cohen">Harriet Cohen</a>, for whom he left his wife and children. Musically, she was his muse for the rest of his life; he wrote numerous pieces for her, and she was the dedicatee of eighteen of his works. He took a flat in <a href="Swiss%20Cottage">Swiss Cottage</a>, London, where he lived until the start of the Second World War. He sketched many of his mature works there, often taking them in <a href="short%20score">short score</a> to his favoured rural retreats, <a href="Glencolmcille">Glencolmcille</a> in Ireland and then from 1928 onwards <a href="Morar">Morar</a> in Scotland, to work on the full score at leisure.

In a study of Bax in 1919 his friend and confidante, the critic Edwin Evans, commented on the waning of the Celtic influence in the composer's music and the emergence of "a more austere, abstract art". From the 1920s onwards Bax seldom turned to poetic legend for inspiration. In Foreman's view, in the post-war years Bax was recognised for the first time as an important, though isolated, figure in British music. The many substantial works he wrote during the war years were heard in public, and he started writing symphonies. Few English composers had so far written symphonies that occupied a secure place in the repertoire, the best known being Elgar (<a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Elgar%29">A</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Elgar%29">E</a> symphonies) and Vaughan Williams ("<a href="A%20Sea%20Symphony">Sea</a>", "<a href="A%20London%20Symphony">London</a>" and "<a href="A%20Pastoral%20Symphony">Pastoral</a>" symphonies). During the 1920s and into the 1930s Bax was seen by many as the leading British symphonist.

Bax's <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Bax%29">First Symphony</a> was written in 1921–22, and when first given it was a great success, despite its ferocity of tone. The critics found the work dark and severe. "<a href="The%20Daily%20News%20%28UK%29">The Daily News</a>" commented, "It is full of arrogant, almost blatant, virility. Its prevailing tone colour is dark, very dark – thick clouds with only here and there a ray of sunlight." "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" suggested that if there was any humour in the piece, it was sardonic. "The Manchester Guardian" noted the severity of the work, but declared it "a truly great English symphony". The work was a box-office attraction at the <a href="the%20Proms">Proms</a> for several years after the premiere. In Foreman's view, Bax was at his musical peak for a fairly short time, and his reputation was overtaken by those of Vaughan Williams and <a href="William%20Walton">William Walton</a>. The <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Bax%29">Third Symphony</a> was completed in 1929 and, championed by Wood, remained for some time among the composer's most popular works.

In the mid-1920s, while his affair with Cohen continued, Bax met the twenty-three-year-old Mary Gleaves, and for more than two decades he maintained relationships with both women. His affair with Cohen ripened into warm friendship and continuing musical partnership. Gleaves became his companion from the later 1920s until his death.

In the 1930s, Bax composed the last four of his seven symphonies. Other works from the decade include the popular "<a href="Overture%20to%20a%20Picaresque%20Comedy">Overture to a Picaresque Comedy</a>" (1930), several works for chamber groups, including a nonet (1930), a string quintet (1933), an octet for horn, piano, and strings (1934) and his third and last string quartet (1936). The Cello Concerto (1932) was commissioned by and dedicated to <a href="Gaspar%20Cassad%C3%B3">Gaspar Cassadó</a>, who quickly dropped the work from his repertoire. Although <a href="Beatrice%20Harrison">Beatrice Harrison</a> championed the concerto in the 1930s and 1940s, Bax said, "The fact that nobody has ever taken up this work has been one of the major disappointments of my musical life".

Bax was <a href="knight%20bachelor">knighted</a> in 1937; he had neither expected nor sought the honour, and was more surprised than delighted to receive it. As the decade progressed, he became less prolific; he commented that he wanted to "retire, like a grocer". Among his compositions from the period was the Violin Concerto (1938). Although not written to commission, he had composed it with the violin virtuoso <a href="Jascha%20Heifetz">Jascha Heifetz</a> in mind. Heifetz never played it, and it was premiered in 1942 by <a href="Eda%20Kersey">Eda Kersey</a> with the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> and Wood.

After the death of the <a href="Master%20of%20the%20King%27s%20Music">Master of the King's Music</a>, <a href="Walford%20Davies">Sir Walford Davies</a>, in 1941, Bax was appointed to succeed him. The choice surprised many. Bax, despite his knighthood, was not an Establishment figure; he himself had expressed a disinclination to "shuffle around in knee-breeches". In the opinion of "The Times" the appointment was not a good one: "Bax was not cut out for official duties and found their performance irksome". Nonetheless, Bax wrote a handful of occasional pieces for royal events, including a march for the <a href="Coronation%20of%20Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Coronation</a> in 1953.
After the Second World War began, Bax moved to Sussex, taking up residence at the White Horse Hotel, <a href="Storrington">Storrington</a>, where he lived for the rest of his life. He abandoned composition and completed a book of memoirs about his early years, "Farewell, My Youth". "The Times" found it at times waspish, at times reticent, surprising in parts, and regrettably short. Later in the war Bax was persuaded to contribute incidental music for a short film, "Malta G. C."; he subsequently wrote music for <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a>'s "<a href="Oliver%20Twist%20%281948%20film%29">Oliver Twist</a>" (1948) and a second short film, "Journey into History" (1952). His other works from the period include the short "Morning Song" for piano and orchestra, and the Left-Hand Concertante (1949), both written for Cohen. Bax and the <a href="Poet%20Laureate%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Poet Laureate</a>, <a href="John%20Masefield">John Masefield</a>, worked on a pageant, "The Play of Saint George" in 1947, but the project was not completed.

In his last years, Bax maintained a contented retirement for much of the time. Walton commented, "an important cricket match at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at <a href="Bournemouth">Bournemouth</a>, he said, "I ought perhaps to be thinking of an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. He wrote in 1952, "I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said all I have to say and it is of no use to repeat myself." Celebrations were planned by the <a href="the%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a> and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting <a href="Cork%20%28city%29">Cork</a> in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in <a href="St.%20Finbarr%27s%20Cemetery">St. Finbarr's Cemetery</a>, Cork.

Bax's fellow composer <a href="Arthur%20Benjamin">Arthur Benjamin</a> wrote that Bax was "a fount of music", whose "spontaneous and inexhaustible outpourings", unique among his contemporaries, were comparable to those of <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a> and <a href="Antonin%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Dvořák</a>. Evans has suggested that Bax's music paradoxically combines robustness and wistfulness, a view that later commentators including Herbage have endorsed. The early music is often instrumentally difficult or orchestrally and harmonically complex; from about 1913 onwards he moved towards a simpler, sparer style. The composer and musicologist <a href="Anthony%20Payne">Anthony Payne</a> considers that Bax's best works date from the period between 1910 and 1925: he instances "The Garden of Fand"," Tintagel", "November Woods", the Second Piano Sonata, Viola Sonata, and first two symphonies. By the 1930s Bax's music ceased to be regarded as new and difficult, and towards the end of that decade it was attracting less attention than before.

The conductor <a href="Vernon%20Handley">Vernon Handley</a>, long associated with Bax's music, commented that the composer's influences include <a href="Sergei%20Rachmaninoff">Rachmaninoff</a> and <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a> as well as Richard Strauss and Wagner: "He was aware of jazz and many more composers on the European scene than we are now. That finds its way into a person's psyche and personality and into his technique as a musician."

The critic <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> wrote of Bax's music:
York Bowen thought it regrettable that Bax's orchestral works frequently call for exceptionally large forces: "When the score demands such luxuries as triple or quadruple woodwind, six horns, three or four trumpets, extra percussion and perhaps organ, it is undoubtedly throwing extra difficulties in the way of performance." The composer <a href="Eric%20Coates">Eric Coates</a> commented that Bax's music appealed greatly to orchestral players: "whichever instrument he wrote for, it was as if he played that instrument himself, so well did he seem to write for it".

While in Dresden in 1907 Bax began work on what he later called "a colossal symphony which would have occupied quite an hour in performance, were such a cloud-cuckoo dream to become an actuality". He added "Happily, it never has!", but he left a complete piano sketch, which was orchestrated in 2012–13 by <a href="Martin%20Yates">Martin Yates</a>, and recorded for the <a href="Dutton%20Vocalion">Dutton Vocalion</a> label; it lasts for 77 minutes. The four-movement work, more conventional in structure than his completed symphonies, shows a strong Russian influence in its material.

Bax wrote his seven completed symphonies between 1921 and 1939. In a study of the seven, David Cox wrote in 1967 that they were "often dismissed as amorphous by those who imagine that Bax consists only of Celtic mistiness and 'atmosphere'. In fact they have considerable strength and frequent astringence; and formally the thematic material is presented with consistency and purpose." In Herbage's view, the cycle can be seen to fall into two groups – the first three and the last three – with the <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Bax%29">Fourth Symphony</a> as "an extrovert interlude between these largely introspective works". Handley agreed that the first three could be grouped together; Foreman sees a Celtic influence in all three, with Bax's emotions about the Easter rising and its aftermath discernible. The Fourth is generally regarded as a more optimistic work than its predecessors and successors. Handley calls it "festive", but comments that its ideas developed into darker mood in the <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Bax%29">Fifth</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Bax%29">Sixth</a>. The Fifth is, for Herbage, "the greatest "tour-de-force""; the Sixth stands out for its "magnificent final movement", which the critic Peter Pirie said "tears the earth up by its roots"; and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Bax%29">Seventh</a> has an elegiac tone, its simplicity far removed from the discursive and complex music of Bax's earlier years.

Bax's first work for solo instrument and orchestra was the 50-minute "Symphonic Variations" in E (1919), written for Harriet Cohen. "The Times" considered it "like one of those deeds of recklessness which in the Army may be followed either by a Court-martial or a V.C. We incline to favour the Court-martial, and to award the V.C. to Miss Harriet Cohen for her part in the enterprise."

The Cello Concerto (1932) was Bax's first attempt at a full-scale conventional concerto. It calls for a smaller orchestra than he customarily employed, with no trombones or tuba, and no percussion apart from timpani. Foreman points to many subtleties of scoring, but notes that it has never ranked high among the composer's mature works. The Violin Concerto (1937–38) is, like the last symphony, in a more relaxed vein than most of Bax's earlier music. Cardus singled it out as "unusually fine", although Heifetz may have felt it not virtuosic enough. The composer described it as in the romantic tradition of <a href="Joachim%20Raff">Joachim Raff</a>.

Among the minor concertante works is "Variations on the Name Gabriel Fauré" (1949) for harp and strings, in a style more neoclassical than most of Bax's music. Bax's last concertante piece was a short work for piano and orchestra (1947) written in his capacity as Master of the King's Music, marking <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Princess Elizabeth</a>'s twenty-first birthday.

Bax's tone poems are in a variety of styles and have varied sharply in their popularity. His impressionistic tone poem "In the Faëry Hills" is described by "Grove" as "a succinct and attractive piece". It was modestly successful, but "Spring Fire" (1913) is instanced by Foreman as a difficult work; it was not performed in Bax's lifetime. During the First World War Bax wrote three tone poems, two of which – "<a href="The%20Garden%20of%20Fand">The Garden of Fand</a>" (1913–16) and "<a href="November%20Woods">November Woods</a>" (1917) – have remained on the fringes of the modern repertoire, and a third – "<a href="Tintagel%20%28Bax%29">Tintagel</a>" (1917–19) – which in the decade after his death was the only work by which Bax was known to the public. "Grove" characterises all three as musical evocations of nature, with little expression of subjective personal response. The orchestral piece that was neglected longest was "In memoriam" (1917), a lament for <a href="Patrick%20Pearse">Patrick Pearse</a>, who was shot for his part in the Easter rising; the work was not played until 1998. Bax reused the main melody for his incidental music to "<a href="Oliver%20Twist%20%281948%20film%29">Oliver Twist</a>" (1948).

"Oliver Twist" was the second of Bax's film scores. The first was for a short wartime propaganda film, "Malta, G. C.". A four-movement suite was published after the release of the latter, containing what "<a href="The%20Penguin%20Guide%20to%20Recorded%20Classical%20Music">The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music</a>" calls "a notable March with a genuine "nobilmente" theme in the best Elgarian tradition". Bax's third and last cinema score was for a ten-minute short film "Journey into History" in 1952.

Other orchestral works include "Overture, Elegy and Rondo" (1927) – a lightweight piece, according to "Grove". The "<a href="Overture%20to%20a%20Picaresque%20Comedy">Overture to a Picaresque Comedy</a>" (1930), was for a time one of his most popular works. It was described by the composer as "Straussian pastiche" and by "The Times" as "gay and impudent, and with that tendency to vulgarity which so easily besets the instinctively refined composer determined to let himself go", Cardus thought the work so appealing that to live up to the overture the putative comedy would have to be "written by <a href="Hugo%20von%20Hofmannsthal">Hofmannsthal</a> and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Shaw</a> in collaboration. Not often is English music so free and audacious as this, so gay and winning."

The critic Peter Latham remarked that he was surprised that Bax had never set any of Yeats's poems to music. Bax replied, "What, I? I should never dare!". Latham added that Bax's sensitiveness to poetic values made him "painfully aware of the violence that even the best musical setting must do to a poem". Eventually this feeling caused him to give up song-writing completely.

At the start of his composing career, songs, together with piano music, formed the core of Bax's work. Some of the songs, mainly the early ones, are conspicuous for the virtuosity of their piano parts, which tend to overwhelm the voice. "Grove" contrasts the virtuoso accompaniment of "The Fairies" (1905) with the simpler "The White Peace" (1907), one of his most popular songs. The musical analyst Trevor Hold writes that the piano "goes berserk" in "Glamour" (1920). Among the poets whose verses Bax set were his brother Clifford, <a href="Robert%20Burns">Burns</a>, <a href="Geoffrey%20Chaucer">Chaucer</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Hardy</a>, <a href="A.%20E.%20Housman">Housman</a>, <a href="James%20Joyce">Joyce</a>, <a href="J.%20M.%20Synge">Synge</a> and <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Tennyson</a>. The composer himself singled out for mention in his "<a href="Who%27s%20Who%20%28UK%29">Who's Who</a>" article "A Celtic Song-Cycle" (1904) to words by "Fiona Macleod" (a pen name of the poet <a href="William%20Sharp%20%28writer%29">William Sharp</a>). Among the post-war songs, Hold considers Bax's "In the Morning" (1926) to be one of the best of all settings of Housman's works, "and it makes you wish that Bax had made further explorations into the Shropshire landscape." Hold classes that song, together with "Across the Door" (1921), "Rann of Exile" (1922) and "Watching the Needleboats" (1932), as "truly modern, 20th-century masterpieces of song".

Bax wrote a substantial number of choral works, mostly secular but some religious. He was a nominal member of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, but in the view of the critic Paul Spicer, "None of Bax's choral music can be described as devotional or even suitable for church use… Here is a secular composer writing voluptuous music." The choral works with religious texts include his largest-scale unaccompanied vocal piece, "Mater ora Filium" (1921), inspired by <a href="William%20Byrd">William Byrd</a>'s Five Part Mass; it is a setting of a medieval carol from a manuscript held by <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>. The composer <a href="Patrick%20Hadley">Patrick Hadley</a> considered it "an unsurpassed example of modern unaccompanied vocal writing". Bax's other choral works include settings of words by <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Shelley</a> ("Enchanted Summer", 1910), <a href="Henry%20Vaughan">Henry Vaughan</a> ("The Morning Watch", 1935), <a href="John%20Masefield">Masefield</a> ("To Russia", 1944), and <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Spenser</a> ("Epithalamium", 1947).

In his overview of Bax's earlier chamber works, Evans identifies as among the most successful the Phantasy for viola, the Trio for piano, violin, and viola and "a String Quintet of such difficulty that an adequate performance has seldom if ever been possible". He rates the Second Violin Sonata (1915) as the composer's most individual work to that date. For Evans, the culminating point of Bax's early chamber music was the Piano Quintet, a work "of such richness of invention that it would be an ornament to the musical literature of any country or period". Foreman makes particular mention of the First String Quartet (1918 – "a classical clarity of texture and form to its Celtic inspiration", and the "grittier" Second Quartet (1925), the Viola Sonata (1922), the Phantasy Sonata for viola and harp (1927) and the Sonata for Flute and Harp (1928).

The composer and musical scholar <a href="Christopher%20Palmer">Christopher Palmer</a> writes that Bax was unusual among British composers in composing a substantial oeuvre for solo piano. Bax published four piano sonatas (1910–32), which are, in Palmer's view, as central to the composer's piano music as the symphonies are to the orchestral output. The first two sonatas are each in a single movement, of about twenty minutes; the third and fourth are in conventional three-movement form. The First Symphony was originally planned as a large-scale piano sonata in E (1921); the manuscript score of the latter came to light in the early 1980s and was performed for the first time in 1983. Bax's own virtuosity as a pianist is reflected in the demands of many of his piano pieces. Palmer cites <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a> and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> as major influences on Bax's piano style as well as Balakirev and the other Russians whose influence is seen throughout the composer's work. For piano duo Bax composed two tone poems, "Moy Mell" (1917) and "Red Autumn" (1931). His shorter piano pieces include picturesque miniatures such as "In a Vodka Shop" (1915), "A Hill Tune" (1920) and "Water Music" (1929).

In his later years Bax's music fell into neglect. <a href="John%20Barbirolli">Sir John Barbirolli</a> wrote, "I think he felt keenly that his richly wrought and masterly scores were no longer 'fashionable' to-day, but nothing could deter him from the path of complete honesty and sincerity in his musical thought." The neglect became more complete after the composer's death. He had always sustained a <a href="Romanticism%20%28music%29">Romantic</a> outlook, distancing himself from <a href="Modernism%20%28music%29">musical modernism</a> and especially <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Arnold Schoenberg</a>'s <a href="serialism">serialism</a>, of which Bax wrote in 1951:
Neither Bax's views nor his works were fashionable in the two decades after his death. The critic <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a> writes that the mid-1950s were a time of "immense change and transition in influential musical circles." The music favoured by the cultural establishment until then was regarded as having made Britain musically parochial and indifferent to the developments of the past half-century. In Kennedy's words, "<a href="Edmund%20Rubbra">Rubbra</a>, Bax and <a href="John%20Ireland%20%28composer%29">Ireland</a> found themselves out in the cold".

Foreman comments that in the years after Bax's death his reputation was kept alive by a single work – "Tintagel". Kennedy estimates that it took "twenty painful years" before the music of the British romantics including Bax made headway against the dominance of modernism. Foreman dates the revival of Bax's music to Handley's performances of the Fourth Symphony and other works with the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra in the 1960s, and the pioneering recordings by <a href="Lyrita">Lyrita Recorded Edition</a> of five of the symphonies. Scholarly consideration of Bax's life and music came with studies by Colin Scott-Sutherland (1973) and Foreman (1983). Bax's centenary in 1983 was marked by twenty programmes on <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a>, covering a wide range of the composer's music. In 1985 the Sir Arnold Bax Trust was established to promote the composer's work including the sponsoring of live performances and recording and publication of his music and writings. Since then a large number of Bax's works, major and minor, have been recorded (see below). The proliferation of Bax recordings has not been matched by a revival in his fortunes in the concert hall; the critic Stephen Moss observed in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" in 2007, "Bax is considered the promotional kiss of death." In 1999 the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a> published a complete catalogue of Bax's works compiled and annotated by Graham Parlett; Lionel Pike, writing in "<a href="Music%20%26amp%3B%20Letters">Music & Letters</a>", called it "a benchmark for any future researchers seeking to compile a catalogue of a composer's works".

Two recordings of Bax as a pianist were made in 1929. With <a href="Lionel%20Tertis">Lionel Tertis</a> he recorded his own Viola Sonata for <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia</a>, and with May Harrison he recorded <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Delius</a>'s Violin Sonata No 1 for the rival <a href="Gramophone%20Company">HMV</a> label. Of the symphonies, only the Third was recorded in the composer's lifetime; it was played by the Hallé under Barbirolli and released in 1944. The Viola Sonata, Nonet and "Mater ora Filium" were recorded under the auspices of the English Music Society in 1937 and 1938. The Phantasy Sonata for Viola and Harp, the Sonata for Two Pianos and a handful of the songs were recorded on <a href="78%20rpm">78 rpm</a> discs. Of the tone poems, <a href="Eugene%20Aynsley%20Goossens">Eugene Goossens</a> conducted the first recording of "Tintagel", in 1928; twenty years later a set of "The Garden of Fand" with Beecham and the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</a> was released by HMV. By 1955 Bax on record was so scarce that "<a href="The%20Record%20Guide">The Record Guide</a>" listed only "Tintagel", the "Coronation March", the unaccompanied choral work "What is it Like to be Young and Fair?" and the solo piano piece "Paean".

Parlett included an extensive discography in his 1999 "A Catalogue of the Works of Sir Arnold Bax", later expanded and updated in a website. At 2015 the latter lists more than 250 works by Bax that have been recorded and published. The discography includes three complete cycles of Bax's symphonies released on CD, two by <a href="Chandos%20Records">Chandos Records</a>, the first conducted by <a href="Bryden%20Thomson">Bryden Thomson</a> (recorded 1983–88) and the second by Handley (2003); between them was a cycle issued by <a href="Naxos%20Records">Naxos Records</a> conducted by <a href="David%20Lloyd-Jones%20%28conductor%29">David Lloyd-Jones</a> (recorded 1997–2001). The major tone poems and other orchestral works have been recorded, many of them in several different versions. Bax's chamber music is well represented on disc, with recordings of most of the works, and multiple versions of many, including the Elegiac Trio, the Clarinet Sonata and the Fantasy Sonata. Much of the piano music has been recorded by pianists including <a href="Iris%20Loveridge">Iris Loveridge</a>, <a href="John%20McCabe%20%28composer%29">John McCabe</a>, <a href="Ashley%20Wass">Ashley Wass</a> and <a href="Michael%20Endres">Michael Endres</a>, though by 2015 no integral survey had yet been recorded. Of the vocal works, by far the most often recorded is "Mater ora Filium", but other choral works, and a representative selection of the songs are on disc.

Bax received the gold medals of the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a> (1931) and the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Musicians">Worshipful Company of Musicians</a> (1931), and the <a href="Walter%20Willson%20Cobbett">Cobbett Medal</a> for chamber music (1931). He was awarded honorary doctorates by the universities of <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> (1934) and <a href="University%20of%20Durham">Durham</a> (1935) and the <a href="National%20University%20of%20Ireland">National University of Ireland</a> (1947). A Bax Memorial Room at <a href="University%20College%20Cork">University College Cork</a>, was opened by Vaughan Williams in 1955. He was knighted in the <a href="1937%20Coronation%20Honours">1937 Coronation Honours</a> and was advanced to <a href="Royal%20Victorian%20Order">KCVO</a> in 1953. An <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a>, unveiled in 1993, commemorates Bax at his birthplace, 13 Pendennis Road in Streatham.

In 1992 <a href="Ken%20Russell">Ken Russell</a> made a television film dramatising Bax's later years, "The Secret Life of Arnold Bax". Russell himself portrayed Bax and <a href="Glenda%20Jackson">Glenda Jackson</a> appeared as Harriet Cohen.

Michael Tippett

<a href="Sir">Sir</a> Michael Kemp Tippett (2 January 1905 – 8 January 1998) was an English composer who rose to prominence during and immediately after the Second World War. In his lifetime he was sometimes ranked with his contemporary <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a> as one of the leading British composers of the 20th century. Among his best-known works are the oratorio "<a href="A%20Child%20of%20Our%20Time">A Child of Our Time</a>", the orchestral "<a href="Fantasia%20Concertante%20on%20a%20Theme%20of%20Corelli">Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli</a>", and the opera "<a href="The%20Midsummer%20Marriage">The Midsummer Marriage</a>".

Tippett's talent developed slowly. He withdrew or destroyed his earliest compositions, and was 30 before any of his works were published. Until the mid-to-late 1950s his music was broadly lyrical in character, before changing to a more astringent and experimental style. New influences, including those of <a href="jazz">jazz</a> and <a href="blues">blues</a> after his first visit to America in 1965, became increasingly evident in his compositions. While Tippett's stature with the public continued to grow, not all critics approved of these changes in style, some believing that the quality of his work suffered as a consequence. From around 1976 Tippett's late works began to reflect the works of his youth through a return to lyricism. Although he was much honoured in his lifetime, critical judgement on Tippett's legacy has been uneven, the greatest praise being generally reserved for his earlier works. His centenary in 2005 was a muted affair; apart from the few best-known works, his music has been performed infrequently in the 21st century.

Having briefly embraced <a href="Communism%23Modern%20communism">communism</a> in the 1930s, Tippett avoided identifying with any political party. A pacifist after 1940, he was imprisoned in 1943 for refusing to carry out war-related duties required by his military exemption. His initial difficulties in accepting his homosexuality led him in 1939 to <a href="Carl%20Jung">Jungian</a> psychoanalysis; the Jungian dichotomy of "shadow" and "light" remained a recurring factor in his music. He was a strong advocate of <a href="music%20education">music education</a>, and was active for much of his life as a radio broadcaster and writer on music.

The Tippett family originated in <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a>. Michael Tippett's grandfather, George Tippett, left the county in 1854 to make his fortune in London through property speculation and other business schemes. A flamboyant character, he had a strong tenor voice that was a popular feature at Christian revivalist meetings. In later life his business enterprises faltered, leading to debts, prosecution for fraud, and a term of imprisonment. His son Henry, born in 1858, was Michael's father. A lawyer by training, he was successful in business and was independently wealthy by the time of his marriage in April 1903. Unusually for his background and upbringing, Henry Tippett was a progressive liberal and a religious sceptic.

Henry Tippett's bride was <a href="Isabel%20Kemp">Isabel Kemp</a>, from a large <a href="Upper%20middle%20class">upper-middle class</a> family based in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>. Among her mother's cousins was <a href="Charlotte%20Despard">Charlotte Despard</a>, a well-known campaigner for women's rights, <a href="Suffragette">suffragism</a>, and <a href="Irish%20Home%20Rule%20movement">Irish home rule</a>. Despard was a powerful influence on the young Isabel, who was herself briefly imprisoned after participating in an illegal suffragette protest in <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a>. Although neither she nor Henry was musical, she had inherited an artistic talent from her mother, who had exhibited at the <a href="Royal%20Academy">Royal Academy</a>. After their marriage the couple settled outside London in <a href="Eastcote">Eastcote</a> where two sons were born, the second, Michael, on 2 January 1905.

Shortly after Michael's birth, the family moved to <a href="Wetherden">Wetherden</a> in <a href="Suffolk">Suffolk</a>. Michael's education began in 1909, with a nursery governess and various private tutors who followed a curriculum that included piano lessons—his first formal contact with music. There was a piano in the house, on which he "took to improvising crazily ... which I called 'composing', though I had only the vaguest notion of what that meant". In September 1914 Michael became a boarder at Brookfield Preparatory School in <a href="Swanage">Swanage</a>, Dorset. He spent four years there, at one point earning notoriety by writing an essay that challenged the existence of God. In 1918 he won a scholarship to <a href="Fettes%20College">Fettes College</a>, a boarding school in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a>, where he studied the piano, sang in the choir, and began to learn to play the <a href="pipe%20organ">pipe organ</a>. The school was not a happy place; sadistic bullying of the younger pupils was commonplace. When Michael revealed to his parents in March 1920 that he had formed a homosexual relationship with another boy, they removed him. He transferred to <a href="Stamford%20School">Stamford School</a> in Lincolnshire, where a decade previously <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a> had been a pupil.

Around this time Henry Tippett decided to live in France, and the house in Wetherden was sold. The 15-year-old Michael and his brother Peter remained at school in England, travelling to France for their holidays. Michael found Stamford much more congenial than Fettes, and developed both academically and musically. He found an inspiring piano teacher in Frances Tinkler, who introduced him to the music of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a> and <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>. Sargent had maintained his connection with the school, and was present when Tippett and another boy played a "C minor Concerto for Two Harpsichords" by Bach on pianos with a local string orchestra. Tippett sang in the chorus when Sargent directed a local performance of <a href="Robert%20Planquette">Robert Planquette</a>'s operetta "<a href="Les%20Cloches%20de%20Corneville">Les Cloches de Corneville</a>". Despite his parents' wish that he follow an orthodox path by proceeding to <a href="Cambridge%20University">Cambridge University</a>, Tippett had firmly decided on a career as a composer, a prospect that alarmed them and was discouraged by his headmaster and by Sargent.

By mid-1922 Tippett had developed a rebellious streak. His overt atheism particularly troubled the school, and he was required to leave. He remained in Stamford in private lodgings, while continuing lessons with Tinkler and with the organist of the local St Mary's Church. He also began studying <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a>'s book "Musical Composition" which, he later wrote, "became the basis of all my compositional efforts for decades to come". In 1923 Henry Tippett was persuaded that some form of musical career, perhaps as a concert pianist, was possible, and agreed to support his son in a course of study at the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a> (RCM). After an interview with the college principal, <a href="Hugh%20Allen%20%28conductor%29">Sir Hugh Allen</a>, Tippett was accepted despite his lack of formal entry qualifications.

Tippett began at the RCM in the summer term of 1923, when he was 18 years old. At the time, his biographer <a href="Meirion%20Bowen">Meirion Bowen</a> records, "his aspirations were Olympian, though his knowledge rudimentary". Life in London widened his musical awareness, especially <a href="the%20Proms">the Proms</a> at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a>, opera at <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a> (where he saw <a href="Dame%20Nellie%20Melba">Dame Nellie Melba</a>'s farewell performance in "<a href="La%20boh%C3%A8me">La bohème</a>") and the <a href="Ballets%20Russes">Diaghilev Ballet</a>. He heard <a href="Feodor%20Chaliapin">Chaliapin</a> sing, and attended concerts conducted by, among others, <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>—the last-named "a tiny man who stood bolt upright and conducted with what to me looked like a pencil". Tippett overcame his initial ignorance of early music by attending <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a> masses at <a href="Westminster%20Cathedral">Westminster Cathedral</a>, following the music with the help of a borrowed score.

At the RCM, Tippett's first composition tutor was <a href="Charles%20Wood%20%28composer%29">Charles Wood</a>, who used the models of Bach, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> and Beethoven to instil a solid understanding of musical forms and syntax. When Wood died in 1926, Tippett chose to study with <a href="Charles%20Herbert%20Kitson">C.H. Kitson</a>, whose pedantic approach and lack of sympathy with Tippett's compositional aims strained the relationship between teacher and pupil. Tippett studied conducting with Sargent and <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a>, finding the latter a particularly empathetic mentor—he let Tippett stand with him on the rostrum during rehearsals and follow the music from the conductor's score. By this means Tippett became familiar with the music of composers then new to him, such as <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Delius</a> and <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>, and learned much about the sounds of orchestral instruments.

In 1924 Tippett became the conductor of an amateur choir in the Surrey village of <a href="Oxted">Oxted</a>. Although he saw this initially as a means of advancing his knowledge of English <a href="madrigals">madrigals</a>, his association with the choir lasted many years. Under his direction it combined with a local theatrical group, the Oxted and Limpsfield Players, to give performances of <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a>'s opera "The Shepherds of the Delectable Mountains" and of Tippett's own adaptation of an 18th-century ballad opera, "The Village Opera". He passed his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Music">Bachelor of Music</a> (BMus) exams, at his second attempt, in December 1928. Rather than continuing to study for a doctorate, Tippett decided to leave the academic environment. The RCM years had brought him intense and lasting friendships with members of both sexes, in particular with Francesca Allinson and David Ayerst.

On leaving the RCM, Tippett settled in Oxted to continue his work with the choir and theatrical group and to compose. To support himself he taught French at Hazelwood, a small preparatory school in <a href="Limpsfield">Limpsfield</a>, which provided him with a salary of £80 a year and a cottage. Also teaching at the school was <a href="Christopher%20Fry">Christopher Fry</a>, the future poet and playwright who later collaborated with Tippett on several of the composer's early works.

In February 1930 Tippett provided the incidental music for a performance by his theatrical group of <a href="James%20Elroy%20Flecker">James Elroy Flecker</a>'s "Don Juan", and in October he directed them in his own adaptation of Stanford's opera "The Travelling Companion". His compositional output was such that on 5 April 1930 he gave a concert in Oxted consisting entirely of his own works—a Concerto in D for flutes, oboe, horns and strings; settings for tenor of poems by Charlotte Mew; "Psalm in C" for chorus and orchestra, with a text by Christopher Fry; piano variations on the song "Jockey to the Fair"; and a string quartet. Professional soloists and orchestral players were engaged, and the concert was conducted by David Moule-Evans, a friend from the RCM. Despite encouraging comments from "The Times" and the "Daily Telegraph", Tippett was deeply dissatisfied with the works, and decided that he needed further tuition. He withdrew the music, and in September 1930 re-enrolled at the RCM for a special course of study in <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> with <a href="R.%20O.%20Morris">R. O. Morris</a>, an expert on 16th-century music. This second RCM period, during which he learned to write <a href="fugue">fugue</a>s in the style of Bach and received additional tuition in orchestration from <a href="Gordon%20Jacob">Gordon Jacob</a>, was central to Tippett's eventual discovery of what he termed his "individual voice".

On 15 November 1931 Tippett conducted his Oxted choir in a performance of Handel's "<a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Messiah</a>", using choral and orchestral forces close to Handel's original intentions. Such performances were rare at that time, and the event attracted considerable interest.

In mid-1932 Tippett moved to a cottage in neighbouring Limpsfield, provided by friends as a haven in which he could concentrate on composition. His friendships with Ayerst and Allinson had opened up new cultural and political vistas. Through Ayerst he met <a href="W.%20H.%20Auden">W. H. Auden</a>, who in due course introduced him to <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>. Although no deep friendship developed with either poet, Tippett came to consider Eliot as his "spiritual father". Ayerst also introduced him to a young artist, Wilfred Franks. By this time Tippett was coming to terms with his homosexuality, while not always at ease with it. Franks provided him with what he described as "the deepest, most shattering experience of falling in love". This intense relationship ran alongside a political awakening. Tippett's natural sympathies had always been leftish, and became more consciously so from his inclusion in Allinson's circle of left-wing activists. As a result, he gave up his teaching position at Hazelwood to become the conductor of the South London Orchestra, a project financed by the <a href="London%20County%20Council">London County Council</a> and made up of unemployed musicians. Its first public concert was held on 5 March 1933 at <a href="Morley%20College">Morley College</a>, later to become Tippett's professional base.

In the summers of 1933 and 1934 Tippett took charge of musical activities at miners' work camps near <a href="Boosbeck">Boosbeck</a> in the north of England. These camps were run by a munificent local landowner, Major Pennyman, to give unemployed miners a sense of purpose and independence. In 1933 Tippett arranged the staging of a shortened version of John Gay's "<a href="The%20Beggar%27s%20Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a>", with locals playing the main parts, and the following year he provided the music for a new folk opera, "<a href="Robin%20Hood%20%28opera%29">Robin Hood</a>", with words by Ayerst, himself and Ruth Pennyman. Both works proved hugely popular with their audiences, and although most of the music has disappeared, some of "Robin Hood" was revived by Tippett for use in his "Birthday Suite for Prince Charles" of 1948. In October 1934 Tippett and the South London Orchestra performed at a centenary celebration of the <a href="Tolpuddle%20Martyrs">Tolpuddle Martyrs</a>, as part of a grand Pageant of Labour at <a href="the%20Crystal%20Palace">the Crystal Palace</a>.

Tippett was not formally a member of any political party or group until 1935, when he joined the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">British Communist Party</a> at the urging of his cousin, Phyllis Kemp. This membership was brief; the influence of <a href="Leon%20Trotsky">Trotsky</a>'s "History of the Russian Revolution" had led him to embrace <a href="Trotskyism">Trotskyism</a>, while the party maintained a strict <a href="Stalinism">Stalinist</a> line. Tippett resigned after a few months when he saw no chance of converting his local party to his Trotskyist views. According to his obituarist J.J. Plant, Tippett then joined the Bolshevik-Leninist Group within the Labour Party, where he continued to advocate Trotskyism until at least 1938. Although Tippett's radical instincts always remained strong, he was aware that excessive political activism would distract him from his overriding objective of becoming recognised as a composer. A significant step towards professional recognition came in December 1935, when his String Quartet No. 1 was performed by the Brosa Quartet at the Mercury Theatre in <a href="Notting%20Hill">Notting Hill</a>, London. This work, which he dedicated to Franks, is the first in the recognised canon of Tippett's music.

Before the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, Tippett released two further works: the Piano Sonata No. 1, first performed by <a href="Phyllis%20Sellick">Phyllis Sellick</a> at the Queen Mary Hall, London, on 11 November 1938, and the <a href="Concerto%20for%20Double%20String%20Orchestra%20%28Tippett%29">Concerto for Double String Orchestra</a>, which was not performed until 1940. In a climate of increasing political and military tension, Tippett's compositional efforts were overwhelmed by an emotional crisis. When his relationship with Franks ended acrimoniously in August 1938 he was thrown into doubt and confusion about both his homosexuality and his worth as an artist. He was saved from despair when, at Ayerst's suggestion, he undertook a course of <a href="Carl%20Jung">Jungian</a> analysis with the psychotherapist <a href="John%20Layard">John Layard</a>. Through an extended course of therapy, Layard provided Tippett with the means to analyse and interpret his dreams. Tippett's biographer <a href="Ian%20Kemp">Ian Kemp</a> describes this experience as "the major turning point in [his] life", both emotionally and artistically. His particular discovery from dream analysis was "the Jungian 'shadow' and 'light' in the single, individual psyche ... the need for the individual to accept his divided nature and profit from its conflicting demands". This brought him to terms with his homosexuality, and he was able to pursue his creativity without being distracted by personal relationships. While still unsure of his sexuality, Tippett had considered marriage with Francesca Allinson, who had expressed the wish that they should have children together. After his psychotherapy he enjoyed several committed—and sometimes overlapping—same-sex relationships. Among the most enduring, and most tempestuous, was that with the artist Karl Hawker, whom he first met in 1941.

While his therapy proceeded, Tippett was searching for a theme for a major work—an opera or an <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a>—that could reflect both the contemporary turmoil in the world and his own recent catharsis. Having briefly considered the theme of the Dublin <a href="Easter%20Rising">Easter Rising</a> of 1916, he based his work on a more immediate event: the murder in Paris of a German diplomat by a 17-year-old Jewish refugee, <a href="Herschel%20Grynszpan">Herschel Grynszpan</a>. This murder triggered "<a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a>" (Crystal Night), a coordinated attack on Jews and their property throughout Nazi Germany on 9–10 November 1938. Tippett hoped that Eliot would provide a libretto for the oratorio, and the poet showed interest. However, when Tippett presented him with a more detailed scenario, Eliot advised him to write his own text, suggesting that the poetic quality of the words might otherwise dominate the music. Tippett called the oratorio "<a href="A%20Child%20of%20Our%20Time">A Child of Our Time</a>", taking the title from "Ein Kind unserer Zeit", a contemporary protest novel by the Austro-Hungarian writer <a href="%C3%96d%C3%B6n%20von%20Horv%C3%A1th">Ödön von Horváth</a>. Within a three-part structure based on Handel's "Messiah", Tippett took the novel step of using North American <a href="Spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a> in place of the traditional <a href="chorales">chorales</a> that punctuate oratorio texts. According to Kenneth Gloag's commentary, the spirituals provide "moments of focus and repose ... giving shape to both the musical and literary dimensions of the work". Tippett began composing the oratorio in September 1939, on the conclusion of his dream therapy and immediately after the outbreak of war.

With the South London Orchestra temporarily disbanded because of the war, Tippett returned to teaching at Hazelwood. In October 1940 he accepted the post of Director of Music at <a href="Morley%20College">Morley College</a>, just after its buildings were almost completely destroyed by a bomb. Tippett's challenge was to rebuild the musical life of the college, using temporary premises and whatever resources he could muster. He revived the <a href="Morley%20College%20Choir">Morley College Choir</a> and orchestra, and arranged innovative concert programmes that typically mixed early music (<a href="Orlando%20Gibbons">Orlando Gibbons</a>, <a href="Claudio%20Monteverdi">Monteverdi</a>, <a href="John%20Dowland">Dowland</a>), with contemporary works by Stravinsky, <a href="Paul%20Hindemith">Hindemith</a> and <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a>.
He continued the college's established association with the music of <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>; a performance in November 1941 of Purcell's "<a href="Hail%21%20Bright%20Cecilia">Ode to St. Cecilia</a>", with improvised instruments and rearrangements of voice parts, attracted considerable attention. The music staff at Morley was augmented by the recruitment of refugee musicians from Europe, including <a href="Walter%20Bergmann">Walter Bergmann</a>, <a href="M%C3%A1ty%C3%A1s%20Seiber">Mátyás Seiber</a>, and <a href="Walter%20Goehr">Walter Goehr</a> who took charge of the college orchestra.

"A Child of Our Time" was finished in 1941 and put aside with no immediate prospects of performance. Tippett's "Fantasia on a Theme of Handel" for piano and orchestra was performed at the <a href="Wigmore%20Hall">Wigmore Hall</a> in March 1942, with Sellick again the soloist, and the same venue saw the première of the composer's String Quartet No. 2 a year later. The first recording of Tippett's music, the Piano Sonata No. 1 played by Sellick, was issued in August 1941. The recording was well received by the critics, <a href="Wilfrid%20Mellers">Wilfrid Mellers</a> predicting a leading role for the composer in the future of English music. In 1942, <a href="Schott%20Music">Schott Music</a> began to publish Tippett's works, establishing an association that continued until the end of the composer's life.

The question of Tippett's liability for war service remained unresolved until mid-1943. In November 1940 he had formalised his pacifism by joining the <a href="Peace%20Pledge%20Union">Peace Pledge Union</a> and applying for registration as a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>. His case was heard by a tribunal in February 1942, when he was assigned to non-combatant duties. Tippett rejected such work as an unacceptable compromise with his principles and in June 1943, after several further hearings and statements on his behalf from distinguished musical figures, he was sentenced to three months' imprisonment in <a href="HM%20Prison%20Wormwood%20Scrubs">HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs</a>. He served two months, and although thereafter he was technically liable to further charges for failing to comply with the terms set by his tribunal, the authorities left him alone.

On his release, Tippett returned to his duties at Morley, where he boosted the college's Purcell tradition by persuading <a href="Alfred%20Deller">Alfred Deller</a>, the <a href="countertenor">countertenor</a>, to sing several Purcell odes at a concert on 21 October 1944—the first modern use of a countertenor in Purcell's music. Tippett formed a fruitful musical friendship with <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Benjamin Britten</a> and <a href="Peter%20Pears">Peter Pears</a>, for whom he wrote the cantata "Boyhood's End" for tenor and piano. Encouraged by Britten, Tippett made arrangements for the first performance of "A Child of Our Time", at London's <a href="Adelphi%20Theatre">Adelphi Theatre</a> on 19 March 1944. Goehr conducted the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, and Morley's choral forces were augmented by the London Regional Civil Defence Choir. Pears sang the tenor solo part, and other soloists were borrowed from <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Opera">Sadler's Wells Opera</a>. The work was well received by critics and the public, and eventually became one of the most frequently performed large-scale choral works of the post-Second World War period, in Britain and overseas. Tippett's immediate reward was a commission from the BBC for a <a href="motet">motet</a>, "The Weeping Babe", which became his first broadcast work when it was aired on 24 December 1944. He also began to give regular radio talks on music.

In 1946 Tippett organised at Morley the first British performance of Monteverdi's "<a href="Vespro%20della%20Beata%20Vergine">Vespers</a>", adding his own organ "Preludio" for the occasion. Tippett's compositions in the immediate postwar years included his <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Tippett%29">First Symphony</a>, performed under Sargent in November 1945, and the String Quartet No. 3, premiered in October 1946 by the <a href="Zorian%20Quartet">Zorian Quartet</a>. His main creative energies were increasingly devoted to his first major opera, "<a href="The%20Midsummer%20Marriage">The Midsummer Marriage</a>". During the six years from 1946 he composed almost no other music, apart from the "Birthday Suite for Prince Charles" (1948).
The musical and philosophical ideas behind the opera had begun in Tippett's mind several years earlier. The story, which he wrote himself, charts the fortunes of two contrasting couples in a manner which has brought comparisons with Mozart's "<a href="The%20Magic%20Flute">The Magic Flute</a>". The strain of composition, combined with his continuing responsibilities at Morley and his BBC work, affected Tippett's health and slowed progress. Following the death in 1949 of Morley's principal, <a href="Eva%20Marian%20Hubback">Eva Hubback</a>, Tippett's personal commitment to the college waned. His now-regular BBC fees had made him less dependent on his Morley salary, and he resigned his college post in 1951. His farewell took the form of three concerts which he conducted at the new <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>, in which the programmes included "A Child of Our Time", the British première of Carl Orff's "<a href="Carmina%20Burana%20%28Orff%29">Carmina Burana</a>", and <a href="Thomas%20Tallis">Thomas Tallis</a>'s rarely performed 40-part motet "<a href="Spem%20in%20alium">Spem in alium</a>".

In 1951 Tippett moved from Limpsfield to a large, dilapidated house, Tidebrook Manor in <a href="Wadhurst">Wadhurst</a>, Sussex. As "The Midsummer Marriage" neared completion he wrote a song cycle for tenor and piano, "The Heart's Assurance". This work, a long-delayed tribute to Francesca Allinson (who had committed suicide in 1945), was performed by Britten and Pears at the Wigmore Hall on 7 May 1951. "The Midsummer Marriage" was finished in 1952, after which Tippett arranged some of the music as a concert suite, the "Ritual Dances", performed in <a href="Basel">Basel</a>, Switzerland, in April 1953. The opera itself was staged at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> on 27 January 1955. The lavish production, with costumes and stage designs by <a href="Barbara%20Hepworth">Barbara Hepworth</a> and choreography by <a href="John%20Cranko">John Cranko</a>, perplexed the opera-going public and divided critical opinion. According to Bowen, most "were simply unprepared for a work that departed so far from the methods of Puccini and Verdi". Tippett's libretto was variously described as "one of the worst in the 350-year history of opera" and "a complex network of verbal symbolism", and the music as "intoxicating beauty" with "passages of superbly conceived orchestral writing". A year after the première, the critic A.E.F. Dickinson concluded that "in spite of notable gaps in continuity and distracting infelicities of language, [there is] strong evidence that the composer has found the right music for his ends".

Much of the music Tippett composed following the opera's completion reflected its lyrical style. Among these works was the "<a href="Fantasia%20Concertante%20on%20a%20Theme%20of%20Corelli">Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli</a>" (1953) for string orchestra, written to commemorate the 300th anniversary of the composer <a href="Arcangelo%20Corelli">Arcangelo Corelli</a>'s birth. The "Fantasia" would eventually become one of Tippett's most popular works, though "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>"s critic lamented the "excessive complexity of the contrapuntal writing ... there was so much going on that the perplexed ear knew not where to turn or fasten itself". Such comments helped to foster a view that Tippett was a "difficult" composer, or even that his music was amateurish and poorly prepared. These perceptions were strengthened by controversies around several of his works in the late 1950s. The <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Tippett%29">Piano Concerto</a> (1955) was declared unplayable by its scheduled soloist, <a href="Julius%20Katchen">Julius Katchen</a>, who had to be replaced before the première by <a href="Louis%20Kentner">Louis Kentner</a>. The <a href="Dennis%20Brain">Dennis Brain Wind Ensemble</a>, for whom Tippett had written the "Sonata for Four Horns" (1955), complained that the work was in too high a key and required it to be <a href="Transposition%20%28music%29">transposed</a> down. When the <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Tippett%29">Second Symphony</a> was premièred by the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> under Boult, in a live broadcast from the Royal Festival Hall on 5 February 1958, the work broke down after a few minutes and had to be restarted by the apologetic conductor: "Entirely my mistake, ladies and gentlemen". The BBC's Controller of Music defended the orchestra in "The Times", writing that it "is equal to all reasonable demands", a wording that implied the fault was the composer's.

In 1960 Tippett moved to a house in the <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> village of <a href="Corsham">Corsham</a>, where he lived with his long-term partner Karl Hawker. By then Tippett had begun work on his second major opera, "<a href="King%20Priam">King Priam</a>". He chose for his theme the tragedy of <a href="Priam">Priam</a>, mythological king of the <a href="Troy">Trojans</a>, as recorded in <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>", and again he prepared his own libretto. As with "The Midsummer Marriage", Tippett's preoccupation with the opera meant that his compositional output was limited for several years to a few minor works, including a "Magnificat" and "Nunc Dimittis" written in 1961 for the 450th anniversary of the foundation of <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's College, Cambridge</a>. "King Priam" was premièred in <a href="Coventry">Coventry</a> by the <a href="The%20Royal%20Opera">Covent Garden Opera</a> on 29 May 1962 as part of a festival celebrating the consecration of the new <a href="Coventry%20Cathedral">Coventry Cathedral</a>. The production was by <a href="Sam%20Wanamaker">Sam Wanamaker</a> and the lighting by <a href="Sean%20Kenny%20%28theatre%20designer%29">Sean Kenny</a>. <a href="John%20Pritchard%20%28conductor%29">John Pritchard</a> was the conductor. The music for the new work displayed a marked stylistic departure from what Tippett had written hitherto, heralding what a later commentator, Iain Stannard, refers to as a "great divide" between the works before and after "King Priam". Although some commentators questioned the wisdom of so radical a departure from his established voice, the opera was a considerable success with critics and the public. Lewis later called it "one of the most powerful operatic experiences in the modern theatre". This reception, combined with the fresh acclaim for "The Midsummer Marriage" following a well-received BBC broadcast in 1963, did much to rescue Tippett's reputation and establish him as a leading figure among British composers.

As earlier with "The Midsummer Marriage", the compositions that followed "King Priam" retained the musical idiom of the opera, notably the Piano Sonata No. 2 (1962) and the Concerto for Orchestra (1963), the latter written for the <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Festival">Edinburgh Festival</a> and dedicated to Britten for his 50th birthday. Tippett's main work in the mid-1960s was the <a href="cantata">cantata</a> "The Vision of Saint Augustine", commissioned by the BBC, which Bowen marks as a peak of Tippett's compositional career: "Not since "The Midsummer Marriage" had he unleashed such a torrent of musical invention". His status as a national figure was now being increasingly recognised. He had been appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in 1959; in 1961 he was made an honorary <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Fellow of the Royal College of Music</a> (HonFRCM), and in 1964 he received from Cambridge University the first of many <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorates</a>. In 1966 he was awarded a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a>.

In 1965 Tippett made the first of several visits to the United States, to serve as composer in residence at the <a href="Aspen%20Music%20Festival%20and%20School">Aspen Music Festival</a> in Colorado. Tippett's American experiences had a significant effect on the music he composed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with jazz and blues elements particularly evident in his third opera, "<a href="The%20Knot%20Garden">The Knot Garden</a>" (1966–69), and in the Symphony No. 3 (1970–72). At home in 1969, Tippett worked with the conductor <a href="Colin%20Davis">Colin Davis</a> to rescue the <a href="Bath%20International%20Music%20Festival">Bath International Music Festival</a> from a financial crisis, and became the festival's artistic director for the following five seasons. In 1970, following the collapse of his relationship with Hawker, he left Corsham and moved to a secluded house on the <a href="North%20Wessex%20Downs">Marlborough Downs</a>. Among the works he wrote in this period were "In Memoriam Magistri" (1971), a chamber piece commissioned by "Tempo" magazine as a memorial to Stravinsky, who had died on 6 April 1971, and the Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973). 
In February 1974 Tippett attended a "Michael Tippett Festival", arranged in his honour by <a href="Tufts%20University">Tufts University</a>, near <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, Massachusetts. He was also present at a performance of "The Knot Garden" at <a href="Northwestern%20University">Northwestern University</a> at <a href="Evanston%2C%20Illinois">Evanston, Illinois</a>—the first Tippett opera to be performed in the US. Two years later he was again in the country, engaged on a lecture tour that included the Doty Lectures in Fine Art at the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas</a>. Between these American journeys, Tippett travelled to <a href="Lusaka">Lusaka</a> for the first African performance of "A Child of Our Time", at which the Zambian president, <a href="Kenneth%20Kaunda">Kenneth Kaunda</a>, was present.

In 1976 Tippett was awarded the Gold Medal of the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a>. The following few years saw journeys to Java and Bali—where he was much attracted by the sounds of <a href="gamelan">gamelan</a> ensembles—and to Australia, where he conducted a performance of his Fourth Symphony in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>. In 1979, with funds available from the sale of some of his original manuscripts to the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>, Tippett inaugurated the Michael Tippett Musical Foundation, which provided financial support to young musicians and music education initiatives.

Tippett maintained his pacifist beliefs, while becoming generally less public in expressing them, and from 1959 served as president of the Peace Pledge Union. In 1977 he made a rare political statement when, opening a PPU exhibition at <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a>, he attacked <a href="Jimmy%20Carter">President Carter</a>'s plans to develop a <a href="neutron%20bomb">neutron bomb</a>.

In his seventies, Tippett continued to compose and travel, although now handicapped by health problems. His eyesight was deteriorating as a result of <a href="macular%20corneal%20dystrophy">macular dystrophy</a>, and he relied increasingly on his musical amanuensis and near namesake Michael Tillett, and on Meirion Bowen, who became Tippett's assistant and closest companion in the remaining years of the composer's life. The main works of the late 1970s were a new opera, "<a href="The%20Ice%20Break">The Ice Break</a>", the <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Tippett%29">Symphony No. 4</a>, the String Quartet No. 4 and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello. "The Ice Break" was a reflection of Tippett's American experiences, with a contemporary storyline incorporating race riots and drug-taking. His libretto has been criticised for its awkward attempts at American street vernacular, and the opera has not found a place in the general repertory. Mellers finds that its fusion of "art music, rock ritual and performance art fail to gel". The Triple Concerto includes a finale inspired by the gamelan music that Tippett absorbed during his visit to Java.

In 1979 Tippett was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> (CH). The main composition that occupied him in the early 1980s was his oratorio "The Mask of Time", loosely based on Jacob Bronowski's 1973 TV series "<a href="The%20Ascent%20of%20Man">The Ascent of Man</a>". In Tippett's words, this is an attempt to deal "with those fundamental matters that bear upon man, his relationship with Time, his place in the world as we know it and in the mysterious universe at large". The oratorio was commissioned by the <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony Orchestra</a> for its centenary, and was one of several of Tippett's late compositions that were premièred in America. 
In 1983 Tippett became president of the <a href="London%20College%20of%20Music">London College of Music</a> and was appointed a Member of the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">Order of Merit</a> (OM). By the time of his 80th birthday in 1985 he was blind in his right eye, and his output had slowed. Nevertheless, in his final active years he wrote his last opera, "<a href="New%20Year%20%28opera%29">New Year</a>". This futuristic fable involving flying saucers, time travel and urban violence was indifferently received on its première in <a href="Houston">Houston</a>, Texas, on 17 October 1989. <a href="Donal%20Henahan">Donal Henahan</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" wrote that "Unlike Wagner, <a href="Tippett">Tippett</a> does not provide music of enough quality to allow one to overlook textual absurdities and commonplaces." The opera was introduced to Britain in the <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival</a> of 1990.

In spite of his deteriorating health, Tippett toured Australia in 1989–90, and also visited <a href="Senegal">Senegal</a>. His last major works, written between 1988 and 1993, were: "Byzantium", for soprano and orchestra; the String Quartet No. 5; and "The Rose Lake", a "song without words for orchestra" inspired by a visit to <a href="Lake%20Retba">Lake Retba</a> in Senegal during his 1990 trip. He intended "The Rose Lake" to be his farewell, but in 1996 he broke his retirement to write "Caliban's Song" as a contribution to the Purcell tercentenary. In 1997 he moved from Wiltshire to London to be closer to his friends and carers; in November of that year he made his last overseas trip, to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> for a festival of his music. After suffering a stroke he was taken home, where he died on 8 January 1998, six days after his 93rd birthday. He was cremated on 15 January, at <a href="Hanworth">Hanworth</a> crematorium, after a secular service.

Bowen has described Tippett as "a composer of our time", one who engaged with the social, political and cultural issues of his day. <a href="Arnold%20Whittall">Arnold Whittall</a> sees the music as embodying Tippett's philosophy of "ultimately optimistic humanism". Rather than ignoring the barbarism of the 20th century, says Kemp, Tippett chose through his works to seek "to preserve or remake those values that have been perverted, while at the same time never losing sight of the contemporary reality". The key early work in this respect is "A Child of Our Time", of which Clarke writes: "[t]he words of the oratorio's closing ensemble, 'I would know my shadow and my light, So shall I at last be whole', have become canonical in commentary on Tippett ... this [Jungian] statement crystallizes an ethic, and aesthetic, central to his world-view, and one which underlies all his text-based works". Sceptical critics such as the musicologist Derrick Puffett have argued that Tippett's craft as a composer was insufficient for him to deal adequately with the task that he had set himself of "transmut[ing] his personal and private agonies into ... something universal and impersonal". <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a> has referred to Tippett's "open‐eyed, even naive outlook on the world", while accepting the technical sophistication of his music. Others have acknowledged his creative ingenuity and his willingness to adopt whatever means or techniques were necessary to fit his intentions.

Tippett's music is marked by the expansive nature of his melodic line—the "Daily Telegraph"s Ivan Hewett refers to his "astonishingly long-breathed melodies". According to Jones, a further element of the "individual voice" that emerged in 1935 was Tippett's handling of rhythm and counterpoint, demonstrated in the First String Quartet—Tippett's first use of the additive rhythm and cross-rhythm <a href="polyphony">polyphony</a> which became part of his musical signature. This approach to metre and rhythm is derived in part from Bartók and Stravinsky but also from the English madrigalists. Sympathy with the past, observed by Colin Mason in an early appraisal of the composer's work, was at the root of the <a href="Neoclassicism%20%28music%29">neoclassicism</a> that is a feature of Tippett's music, at least until the Second Symphony (1957).

In terms of tonality, Tippett shifted his ground in the course of his career. His earlier works, up to "The Midsummer Marriage", are key-centred, but thereafter he moved through <a href="Polytonality">bitonality</a> into what the composer <a href="Charles%20Fussell">Charles Fussell</a> has summarised as "the freely-organized harmonic worlds" of the Third Symphony and "The Ice Break". Although Tippett flirted with <a href="Twelve-tone%20technique">the "twelve-tone" technique</a>—he introduced a twelve-tone theme into the "storm" prelude that begins "The Knot Garden"—Bowen records that he generally rejected <a href="serialism">serialism</a>, as incompatible with his musical aims.

Tippett described himself as the receiver of inspiration rather than its originator, the creative spark coming from a particular personal experience, which might take one of many forms but was most often associated with listening to music. The process of composing was lengthy and laborious, the actual writing down of the music being preceded by several stages of gestation; as Tippett put it, "the concepts come first, and then a lot of work and imaginative processes until eventually, when you're ready, "finally" ready, you look for the actual notes". Tippett elaborated: "I compose by first developing an overall sense of the length of the work, then of how it will divide itself into sections or movements, then of the kind of texture or instruments or voices that will be performing it. I prefer not to consider the actual notes of the composition until this process ... has gone as far as possible". Sometimes the time required to see a project through from conception to completion was very lengthy—seven years, Tippett says, in the case of the Third Symphony. In the earlier, contemplative stages he might be simultaneously engaged on other works, but once these stages were complete he would dedicate himself entirely to the completion of the work in hand. Tippett preferred to compose in full score; once the writing began, progress was often not fluent, as evidenced by Tippett's first pencil draft manuscripts which show multiple rubbings-out and reworkings. In this, the musicologist Thomas Schuttenhelm says, his methods resembled those of Beethoven, with the difference that "whereas Beethoven's struggle is considered a virtue of his work, and almost universally admired, Tippett's was the source and subject of a debate about his competency as a composer".

The style that emerged from Tippett's long compositional apprenticeship was the product of many diverse influences. Beethoven and Handel were initial models (Handel above Bach, who in Tippett's view lacked drama), supplemented by 16th- and 17th-century masters of counterpoint and madrigal—<a href="Thomas%20Weelkes">Thomas Weelkes</a>, Monteverdi and Dowland. Purcell became significant later, and Tippett came to lament his ignorance of Purcell during his RCM years: "It seems to me incomprehensible now that his work was not even recommended in composition lessons as a basic study for the setting of English".

Tippett recognised the importance to his compositional development of several 19th- and 20th-century composers: <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a> for his clear melodic lines, Debussy for his inventive sound, Bartók for his colourful dissonance, Hindemith for his skills at counterpoint, and <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a> for his originality in musical forms. He revered Stravinsky, sharing the Russian composer's deep interest in older music. Tippett had heard early <a href="ragtime">ragtime</a> as a small child before the First World War; he noted in his later writings that, in the early years of the 20th century, ragtime and jazz "attracted many serious composers thinking to find ... a means to refresh serious music by the primitive". His interest in these forms led to his fascination with <a href="blues">blues</a>, articulated in several of his later works. Among his contemporary composers, Tippett admired Britten and shared his desire to end the perception of English music as provincial. He also had a high regard for <a href="Alan%20Bush">Alan Bush</a>, with whom he joined forces to produce the 1934 Pageant of Labour. "I can remember the excitement I felt when he outlined to me his plan for a major string quartet".

Although influences of folk music from all parts of the British Isles are evident in Tippett's early works, he was wary of the English folksong revival of the early 20th century, believing that much of the music presented as "English" by <a href="Cecil%20Sharp">Cecil Sharp</a> and his followers originated elsewhere. Notwithstanding his doubts, Tippett took some inspiration from these sources. The composer <a href="David%20Matthews%20%28composer%29">David Matthews</a> writes of passages in Tippett's music which "evoke the 'sweet especial rural scene' as vividly as Elgar or Vaughan Williams ... perhaps redolent of the Suffolk landscape with its gently undulating horizons, wide skies and soft lights".

After the withdrawn works written in the 1920s and early 1930s, analysts generally divide Tippett's mature compositional career into three main phases, with fairly fluid boundaries and some internal subdivision in each main period. The first phase extends from the completion of the String Quartet No. 1 in 1935 to the end of the 1950s, a period in which Tippett drew on the past for his main inspiration. The 1960s marked the beginning of a new phase in which Tippett's style became more experimental, reflecting both the social and cultural changes of that era and the broadening of his own experiences. The mid-1970s produced a further stylistic change, less marked and sudden than that of the early 1960s, after which what Clarke calls the "extremes" of the experimental phase were gradually replaced by a return to the lyricism characteristic of the first period, a trend that was particularly manifested in the final works.

Tippett's earliest compositions cover several genres. Kemp writes that the works indicate Tippett's deep commitment to the learning of his craft, his early ability to manipulate traditional forms, and a general willingness to experiment. Clarke observes that in these youthful efforts, characteristics which would mark his mature work were already discernible. Some of the early work is of high quality—the Symphony in B flat of 1933 was, in Kemp's view, comparable to <a href="William%20Walton">William Walton</a>'s contemporaneous First Symphony. Tippett pondered for years whether to include this work in his formal canon before deciding that its debt to Sibelius was too great. Nevertheless, it foreshadows techniques that feature in the String Quartet No. 1 and in the "Corelli Fantasia".

Other accomplished early works include the two string quartets, composed between 1928 and 1930, in which Tippett sought to combine the styles of Beethoven and <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a> respectively with folk-song, as Beethoven had in his <a href="String%20Quartets%20Nos.%207%E2%80%939%2C%20Op.%2059%20%E2%80%93%20Rasumovsky%20%28Beethoven%29">Rasumovsky quartets</a> of 1806. Tippett explains the withdrawal of these and the other early works: "I realised very clearly that they were not totally consonant with myself. I didn't think they had the stamp of artistic durability. So I took the whole lot along to R.O. Morris who agreed that they didn't show enough technical mastery."

Kemp identifies the String Quartet No. 1 (1935) as marking Tippett's discovery of his individual voice. According to the composer <a href="Alan%20Ridout">Alan Ridout</a>, the work stamped its character on Tippett's first period, and together with the second and third quartets of 1942 and 1946 it typifies his style up to "<a href="The%20Midsummer%20Marriage">The Midsummer Marriage</a>". In the two works that immediately followed the first quartet, Bowen finds the Piano Sonata No. 1 (1938) full of the young composer's inventiveness, while Matthews writes of the <a href="Concerto%20for%20Double%20String%20Orchestra%20%28Tippett%29">Concerto for Double String Orchestra</a> (1939): "[I]t is the rhythmic freedom of the music, its joyful liberation from orthodox notions of stress and phrase length, that contributes so much to its vitality". Both of these works show influence of folk music, and the finale of the Piano Sonata is marked by innovative jazz syncopations. According to Schuttenhelm, the Double Concerto marks the proper beginning of Tippett's maturity as an orchestral composer.
In "A Child of Our Time" Tippett was, in Kemp's view, wholly successful in integrating the language of the spirituals with his own musical style. Tippett had obtained recordings of American singing groups, especially the <a href="Hall%20Johnson">Hall Johnson Choir</a>, which provided him with a model for determining the relationships between solo voices and chorus in the spirituals. Thus, Kemp believes, the fourth spiritual "O by and by" sounds almost as if it had been composed by Tippett. The composer's instructions in the score specify that "the spirituals should not be thought of as congregational hymns, but as integral parts of the Oratorio; nor should they be sentimentalised but sung with a strong underlying beat and slightly 'swung.

In Tippett's <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Tippett%29">Symphony No. 1</a> (1945), his only large-scale work between "A Child of Our Time" and "The Midsummer Marriage", his "gift for launching a confident flow of sharply characterized, contrapuntally combined ideas" is acknowledged by Whittall. The same critic found the symphony's quality uneven, and the orchestral writing weaker than in the Double Concerto. Whittall offers nearly unqualified praise for "The Midsummer Marriage", a view largely echoed by Mellers, who saw the perceived "difficulty" of the music as "an aspect of its truth". He considered the opera one of the best musical-theatrical works of its era.

Three major works of the 1950s round off Tippett's first period: the Corelli "Fantasia" (1953), in which Clarke sees, in the "alla pastorale" section, the composer's instrumental writing at its best; the mildly controversial Piano Concerto (1955) which Whittall regards as one of the composer's most intriguing works—an attempt to "make the piano sing"; and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Tippett%29">Symphony No. 2</a> (1957) which Tippett acknowledges as a turning-point in his music. Until this point, says Matthews, Tippett's style had remained broadly tonal. The Second Symphony was his first essay in <a href="polytonality">polytonality</a>, paving the way to the dissonance and chromaticism of subsequent works. Milner, too, recognises the pivotal position of this symphony in Tippett's development which, he says, both sums up the style of the late 1950s and presages the changes to come.

In his analysis of "<a href="King%20Priam">King Priam</a>", Bowen argues that the change in Tippett's musical style arose initially from the nature of the opera, a tragedy radically different in tone from the warm optimism of "The Midsummer Marriage". Clarke sees the change as something more fundamental, the increases in dissonance and atonality in "Priam" being representative of a trend that continued and reached a climax of astringency a few years later in Tippett's third opera, "The Knot Garden". Tippett's new modernistic language, writes Clarke, was rooted in his desire to represent a wider range of human experiences, characteristic of a changing world: "War, violence, sex, homoeroticism, and social and interpersonal alienation [would now feature] much more overtly in [his] dramatic works or works with text". Critics acknowledged "Priam" as a considerable achievement, but received the new musical style cautiously. While Gloag thought the change was not an absolute departure from Tippett's earlier style, Milner viewed "King Priam" as a complete break with Tippett's previous work, pointing out the lack of counterpoint, the considerably increased dissonances, and the move towards <a href="atonality">atonality</a>: "very little of the music is in a definite key".

Many of the minor works that Tippett wrote in the wake of "King Priam" reflect the musical style of the opera, in some cases quoting directly from it. In the first purely instrumental post-"Priam" work, the Piano Sonata No. 2 (1962), Milner thought the new style worked better in the theatre than in the concert or recital hall, although he found the music in the Concerto for Orchestra (1963) had matured into a form that fully justified the earlier experiments. The critic Tim Souster refers to Tippett's "new, hard, sparse instrumental style" evident in "The Vision of Saint Augustine" (1965), written for baritone soloist, chorus and orchestra, a work which Bowen considers one of the peaks of Tippett's career.

During the late 1960s Tippett worked on a series of compositions that reflected the influence of his American experiences after 1965: "The Shires Suite" (1970), "<a href="The%20Knot%20Garden">The Knot Garden</a>" (1970) and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Tippett%29">Symphony No. 3</a> (1972). In "The Knot Garden" Mellers discerns Tippett's "wonderfully acute" ear only intermittently, otherwise: "thirty years on, the piece still sounds and looks knotty indeed, exhausting alike to participants and audience". The Third Symphony is overtly linked by Tippett to <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's Ninth Symphony</a> through a vocal finale of four blues songs, introduced by a direct quotation from Beethoven's finale. Tippett's intention, explained by the music critic <a href="Malcolm%20MacDonald%20%28music%20critic%29">Calum MacDonald</a>, was to explore the contemporary relevance of the grand, universal sentiments in <a href="Friedrich%20Schiller">Schiller</a>'s "<a href="Ode%20to%20Joy">Ode to Joy</a>", as set by Beethoven. Tippett's conclusion is that while the need to rejoice remains, the twentieth century has put paid to the Romantic ideals of universality and certainty.

After completing his Piano Sonata No. 3 (1973), "a formidable piece of abstract composition" according to Bowen, Tippett returned to the modern vernacular in his fourth opera "<a href="The%20Ice%20Break">The Ice Break</a>" (1976). Describing the music in an introduction to the published libretto, Tippett identifies "two archetypal sounds: one relating to the frightening but exhilarating sound of the ice breaking on the great northern rivers in the spring; the other related to the exciting or terrifying sound of the slogan-shouting crowds, which can lift you on your shoulders in triumph, or stamp you to death". Although the work was generally regarded as a critical and public failure, aspects of its music have been recognised as among Tippett's best. The critic <a href="John%20Warrack">John Warrack</a> writes that, after the violence of the opening acts, the third act's music has a lyrical warmth comparable to that of "The Midsummer Marriage"". William Mann in "The Times" was equally enthusiastic, finding the music compelling and worthy of many a rehearing.

In the late 1970s Tippett produced three single-movement instrumental works: the <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Tippett%29">Symphony No. 4</a> (1977), the String Quartet No. 4 (1978), and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello (1979). The symphony, written in the manner of the <a href="tone%20poem">tone poem</a> or symphonic fantasia exemplified by Sibelius, represents what Tippett describes as a birth-to-death cycle, beginning and ending with the sounds of breathing. This effect was initially provided by a wind machine, although other means have been tried, with mixed results—according to Bowen "the sounds emitted can turn out to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello". The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, is an exercise in "finding a sound" that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on <a href="Rembrandt">Rembrandt</a>. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett's past with quotations from "The Midsummer Marriage".
Tippett described the longest and most ambitious of his late works, the oratorio "The Mask of Time" (1982), as "a pageant of sorts  with an ultimately lofty message". Mellers called the work "a mind-boggling cosmic history of the universe". Paul Driver, who had been a critic of Tippett's new style, wrote that the "Mask" revealed "the authentic early Tippett", with a return to the lyricism of "The Midsummer Marriage" and multiple acknowledgements of his early compositions.

Tippett had intended "The Ice Break" to be his final opera, but in 1985 he began work on "<a href="New%20Year%20%28opera%29">New Year</a>". Bowen saw this work as a summary of ideas and images that had attracted Tippett throughout his working life. Donal Henahan was dismissive of the music: "... the score generally natters along in the numbing, not-quite-atonal but antimelodic style familiar from other Tippett works." In "Byzantium" (1990), Tippett set the five stanzas of <a href="W.%20B.%20Yeats">W. B. Yeats</a>'s poem, with added orchestral interludes. By this time he was professing little interest in his own work beyond its creation; performance and reception had become irrelevant to him. In 1996 he told an interviewer: "I'm outside the music I've made, I have no interest in it". After the String Quartet No. 5 (1991), which connects thematically with earlier works, Tippett closed his main output with "The Rose Lake" (1993), described in Tippett's "Daily Telegraph" obituary as "of luminous beauty ... a worthy ending to a remarkable career".

In a joint study of Tippett and Britten published in 1982, Whittall designated the pair as "the two best British composers of that ... generation born between 1900 and the outbreak of the First World War, and among the best of all composers born in the first two decades of the twentieth century". After Britten's death in 1976, Tippett became widely regarded as the doyen of British music, but critical opinion of his later works was not always positive. After the first performance of the Triple Concerto in 1980, Driver wrote that "not since "The Knot Garden" has [he] produced anything worthy of his early masterpieces". In 1982, in his comparative study of Britten and Tippett, Whittall asserted that "it would be difficult to claim that any of the works [Tippett] has begun in his seventies are the equal of earlier compositions". Although both Driver and Whittall later modified their opinions, such comments represented a general view among critics that Tippett's creative powers had begun to decline after the triumph of "King Priam". This perception was strongly expressed by Derek Puffett, who argued that the decline followed Tippett's abandonment of myth—seen as the key to the success of "The Midsummer Marriage" and "King Priam"—and stemmed from his increasingly futile efforts to universalise his private agonies and express them musically. Despite his admiration for the early works, Puffett consigned Tippett "to the ranks of those noble but tragic composers who have lived beyond their time". The critic <a href="Norman%20Lebrecht">Norman Lebrecht</a>, writing in 2005, dismissed almost all Tippett's output, labelling him "a composer to forget". With the forthcoming centenary celebrations in mind, Lebrecht wrote: "I cannot begin to assess the damage to British music that will ensue from the coming year's purblind promotion of a composer who failed so insistently to observe the rules of his craft". Against these criticisms Kemp maintained that while the style had become less immediately accessible, Tippett's later works showed no loss of creative power. The critic Peter Wright, writing in 1999, challenged the "decline" theory with the view that the later compositions are "harder to come to terms with ... because of the more challenging nature of their musical language", a theme he developed in a detailed study of the Fifth String Quartet.

After Tippett's death the more popular pieces from his first period continued to be played, but there was little public enthusiasm for the later works. After the relatively muted 2005 centenary celebrations, performances and recordings tailed off. In October 2012 Hewett wrote in the "Daily Telegraph" of a "calamitous fall" in Tippett's reputation since his death. Geraint Lewis acknowledges that "no consensus yet exists in respect of the works composed from the 1960s onwards", while forecasting that Tippett will in due course be recognised as one of the most original and powerful musical voices of twentieth-century Britain".

Many of Tippett's articles and broadcast talks were issued in collections between 1959 and 1995. In 1991 he published an episodic autobiography, "Those Twentieth Century Blues", notable for its frank discussions of personal issues and relationships. Collectively, Tippett's writings define his aesthetic standpoint, which Clarke summarises thus: "Tippett holds that art's role in post-Enlightenment culture is to offer a corrective to society's spiritually injurious domination by mass technology. Art, he suggests, can articulate areas of human experience, unapproachable through scientific rationality, by presenting 'images' of the inner world of the psyche."

Although Tippett did not found a compositional school, composers who have acknowledged his influence include David Matthews and <a href="William%20Mathias">William Mathias</a>. More generally, his musical and educational influence continues through the Michael Tippett Foundation. He is also commemorated in the Michael Tippett Centre, a concert venue within the Newton Park campus of <a href="Bath%20Spa%20University">Bath Spa University</a>. In Lambeth, home of Morley College, is the Michael Tippett School, an educational facility for young people aged 11–19 with complex learning disabilities. Within the school's campus is the Tippett Music Centre, which offers music education for children of all ages and levels of ability.

Three collections of Tippett's articles and broadcast talks have been published:

Sir Adrian Cedric Boult, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">CH</a> (; 8 April 1889 – 22 February 1983) was an English conductor. Brought up in a prosperous mercantile family, he followed musical studies in England and at <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Germany, with early conducting work in London for the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> and <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a>'s ballet company. His first prominent post was conductor of the <a href="City%20of%20Birmingham%20Symphony%20Orchestra">City of Birmingham Orchestra</a> in 1924. When the <a href="BBC">British Broadcasting Corporation</a> appointed him director of music in 1930, he established the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> and became its chief conductor. The orchestra set standards of excellence that were rivalled in Britain only by the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a> (LPO), founded two years later.

Forced to leave the BBC in 1950 on reaching retirement age, Boult took on the chief conductorship of the LPO. The orchestra had declined from its peak of the 1930s, but under his guidance its fortunes were revived. He retired as its chief conductor in 1957, and later accepted the post of president. Although in the latter part of his career he worked with other orchestras, including the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>, the <a href="Philharmonia%20Orchestra">Philharmonia Orchestra</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, and his former orchestra, the BBC Symphony, it was the LPO with which he was primarily associated, conducting it in concerts and recordings until 1978, in what was widely called his "<a href="Indian%20summer">Indian Summer</a>".

Boult was known for his championing of British music. He gave the first performance of his friend <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Gustav Holst</a>'s "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>", and introduced new works by, among others, <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Bliss">Bliss</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Britten</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Delius</a>, <a href="Cyril%20Rootham">Rootham</a>, <a href="Michael%20Tippett">Tippett</a>, <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a> and <a href="William%20Walton">Walton</a>. In his BBC years he introduced works by foreign composers, including <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a>, <a href="Alban%20Berg">Berg</a>, <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a> and <a href="Anton%20Webern">Webern</a>. A modest man who disliked the limelight, Boult felt as comfortable in the recording studio as on the concert platform, making recordings throughout his career. From the mid-1960s until his retirement after his last sessions in 1978 he recorded extensively for <a href="EMI">EMI</a>. As well as a series of recordings that have remained in the catalogue for three or four decades, Boult's legacy includes his influence on prominent conductors of later generations, including <a href="Colin%20Davis">Colin Davis</a> and <a href="Vernon%20Handley">Vernon Handley</a>.

Boult was born in <a href="Chester">Chester</a>, <a href="Cheshire">Cheshire</a>, in <a href="North%20West%20England">North West England</a>, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence "née" Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">Justice of the Peace</a> and a successful businessman connected with <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had "a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to <a href="Blundellsands">Blundellsands</a>, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a>. He was educated at <a href="Westminster%20School">Westminster School</a> in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, <a href="Henry%20Wood">Sir Henry Wood</a>, <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Nikisch">Arthur Nikisch</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Steinbach">Fritz Steinbach</a>, and <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>. His biographer, <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a>, writes, "Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford." While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a> through <a href="Leo%20Frank%20Schuster">Frank Schuster</a>, a family friend.

At <a href="Christ%20Church%2C%20Oxford">Christ Church</a> college at <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a>, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor <a href="Hugh%20Allen%20%28conductor%29">Hugh Allen</a>. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a>, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled "Some Notes on Performance", in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at <a href="Henley%20Royal%20Regatta">Henley</a>, and all his life he remained a member of the <a href="Leander%20Club">Leander Club</a>.
Boult graduated in 1912, with a basic "pass" degree. He continued his musical education at the <a href="University%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre%20Leipzig">Leipzig Conservatory</a> in 1912–13. The musician <a href="Hans%20Sitt">Hans Sitt</a> was in charge of the conducting class, but Boult's main influence was Nikisch. He later recalled, "I went to all his [Nikisch's] rehearsals and concerts in the Gewandhaus. ... He had an astonishing baton technique and great command of the orchestra: everything was indicated with absolute precision. But there were others who were greater interpreters." Boult admired Nikisch "not so much for his musicianship but his amazing power of saying what he wanted with a bit of wood. He spoke very little". This style was in accord with Boult's opinion that "all conductors should be clad in an invisible <a href="Tarnhelm">Tarnhelm</a> which makes it possible to enjoy the music without seeing any of the antics that go on". He sang in choral festivals and at the <a href="Leeds%20Festival%20%28classical%20music%29">Leeds Festival</a> of 1913, where he watched Nikisch conduct. There he made the acquaintance of <a href="George%20Butterworth">George Butterworth</a>, and other British composers. Later that year Boult joined the musical staff of the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House, Covent Garden</a>, where his most important work was to assist the first British production of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>'s "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>", and do "odd jobs with lighting cues" while Nikisch conducted the "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Ring</a>" cycle.

Boult made his début as a professional conductor on 27 February 1914 at <a href="West%20Kirby">West Kirby</a> Public Hall, with members of the <a href="Royal%20Liverpool%20Philharmonic">Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. His programme comprised orchestral works by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>, Butterworth, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>, <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, Wagner and <a href="Hugo%20Wolf">Hugo Wolf</a>, interspersed with arias by Mozart and <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a> sung by <a href="Agnes%20Nicholls">Agnes Nicholls</a>. Boult was declared medically unfit for active service during the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, and until 1916 he served as an orderly officer in a reserve unit. He was recruited by the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> as a translator (he spoke good French, German and Italian). In his spare time he organised and conducted concerts, some of which were subsidised by his father, with the aims of giving work to orchestral players and bringing music to a wider audience.

In 1918 Boult conducted the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a> in a series of concerts that included important recent British works. Among them was the première of a revised version of Vaughan Williams's "<a href="A%20London%20Symphony">A London Symphony</a>", a performance which was "rather spoilt by a Zeppelin raid". His best-known première of this period was Holst's "<a href="The%20Planets">The Planets</a>". Boult conducted the first performance on 29 September 1918 to an invited audience of about 250. Holst later wrote on his copy of the score, "This copy is the property of Adrian Boult who first caused "The Planets" to shine in public and thereby earned the gratitude of Gustav Holst."

Elgar was another composer who had cause to be grateful to Boult. His <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Elgar%29">Second Symphony</a> had, since its premiere nine years earlier, received few performances. When Boult conducted it at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> in March 1920 to "great applause" and "frantic enthusiasm", the composer wrote to him: "With the sounds ringing in my ears I send a word of thanks for your splendid conducting of the Sym. ... I feel that my reputation in the future is safe in your hands." Elgar's friend and biographer, the violinist <a href="William%20Henry%20Reed">W. H. Reed</a>, wrote that Boult's performance of Elgar's neglected work brought "the grandeur and nobility of the work" to wider public attention.

Boult took a wide variety of conducting jobs in the years following the war. In 1919 he succeeded <a href="Ernest%20Ansermet">Ernest Ansermet</a> as musical director of <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a>'s ballet company. Although Ansermet gave Boult all the help he could in his preparations, there were fourteen ballets in the company's repertory – none of which Boult knew. In only a short period, Boult was required to master such scores as "<a href="Petrushka">Petrushka</a>", "<a href="The%20Firebird">The Firebird</a>", "<a href="Scheherazade%20%28Rimsky-Korsakov%29">Scheherazade</a>", "<a href="La%20Boutique%20fantasque">La Boutique fantasque</a>" and "<a href="The%20Good-Humoured%20Ladies">The Good-Humoured Ladies</a>". In June 1921, Boult conducted for <a href="Theodore%20Komisarjevsky">Theodore Komisarjevsky</a> and <a href="Vladimir%20Rosing">Vladimir Rosing</a>'s experimental "Opera Intime" week at London's <a href="Aeolian%20Hall%20%28London%29">Aeolian Hall</a>. He also took on an academic post. When Hugh Allen succeeded <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Sir Hubert Parry</a> as principal of the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Music">Royal College of Music</a>, he invited Boult to start a conducting class along the lines of Leipzig – the first such class in England. Boult ran the classes from 1919 to 1930. In 1921 he received a Doctorate of Music.

In 1923 Boult conducted the first season of the <a href="Robert%20Mayer%20%28philanthropist%29">Robert Mayer</a> concerts for children, but his participation in the following season was prevented by his appointment in 1924 as conductor of the Birmingham Festival Choral Society. This led to his becoming musical director of the <a href="City%20of%20Birmingham%20Symphony%20Orchestra">City of Birmingham Orchestra</a>, where he remained in charge for six years, attracting widespread attention with his adventurous programmes.

The advantage of the Birmingham post was that for the first time in his life Boult had his own orchestra, and sole control of programming; the only time in his life, he later said, when that was so. The disadvantages were that the orchestra was inadequately funded, the available venues (including the Town Hall) were unsatisfactory, the "<a href="Birmingham%20Post">Birmingham Post</a>"'s music critic, A. J. Symons, was a constant thorn in Boult's side, and the local concert-going public had conservative tastes. Despite this conservatism, Boult programmed as much innovative music as was practical, including works by <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a>, <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a> and <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Bruckner</a>. Such departures from the repertoire expected by the regular concert-goers depressed the box-office takings, requiring subsidies from private benefactors, including Boult's family.

While at Birmingham Boult had the opportunity to conduct a number of operas, chiefly with the <a href="British%20National%20Opera%20Company">British National Opera Company</a>, for which he conducted "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>" and "<a href="Otello">Otello</a>". He also conducted a diverse range of operas from such composers as <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>, Mozart and Vaughan Williams. In 1928 he succeeded Vaughan Williams as conductor of the <a href="The%20Bach%20Choir">Bach Choir</a> in London, a position he held until 1931.

Visits to London by the <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a> and particularly the <a href="Berlin%20Philharmonic">Berlin Philharmonic</a> under <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a> in 1929, had highlighted the relatively poor standards of London orchestras. <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a> and the director general of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> <a href="John%20Reith%2C%201st%20Baron%20Reith">Sir John Reith</a> were keen to establish a first-class symphony orchestra, and they agreed in principle to do so jointly. Only a small number of core players were recruited before negotiations foundered. Beecham withdrew, and with <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a> soon established the rival <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a>.

In 1930 Boult returned to London to succeed <a href="Percy%20Pitt">Percy Pitt</a> as director of music at the BBC. On taking up the post, Boult and his department recruited enough musicians to bring the complement of the new <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> to 114. A substantial number of these players performed at the 1930 <a href="The%20Proms">Promenade Concerts</a> under Sir Henry Wood, and the full BBC Symphony Orchestra gave its first concert on 22 October 1930, conducted by Boult at the Queen's Hall. The programme consisted of music by Wagner, <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>, <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Saint-Saëns</a> and <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>. Of the 21 programmes in the orchestra's first season, Boult conducted nine and Wood five.
The reviews of the new orchestra were enthusiastic. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" wrote of its "virtuosity" and of Boult's "superb" conducting. "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" commented, "The boast of the B.B.C. that it intended to get together a first-class orchestra was not an idle one" and spoke of "exhilaration" at the playing. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" called the playing "altogether magnificent" and said that Boult "deserves an instrument of this fine calibre to work on, and the orchestra deserves a conductor of his efficiency and insight." After the initial concerts Reith was told by his advisers that the orchestra had played better for Boult than anyone else. Reith asked him if he wished to take on the chief conductorship, and if so whether he would resign as director of music or occupy both posts simultaneously. Boult opted for the latter. He later said that this was a rash decision, and that he could not have sustained the two roles at once without the efforts of his staff in the music department, which included <a href="Edward%20Clark%20%28conductor%29">Edward Clark</a>, Julian Herbage and Kenneth Wright.

During the 1930s the BBC Symphony Orchestra became renowned for its high standard of playing and for Boult's capable performances of new and unfamiliar music. Like Henry Wood before him, Boult regarded it as his duty to give the best possible performances of a wide range of composers, including those whose works were not personally congenial to him. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes that there was a very short list of composers whose works Boult refused to conduct, "but it would be difficult to deduce who they were." Boult's pioneering work with the BBC included an early performance of <a href="Arnold%20Schoenberg">Schoenberg</a>'s "Variations," Op. 31, British premières, including <a href="Alban%20Berg">Alban Berg</a>'s opera "<a href="Wozzeck">Wozzeck</a>" and "<a href="Lyric%20Suite%20%28Berg%29">Three Movements from the Lyric Suite</a>", and world premières, including Vaughan Williams's <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Symphony No. 4 in F minor</a> and <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a>'s Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra. He introduced Mahler's <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Mahler%29">Ninth Symphony</a> to London in 1934, and Bartók's <a href="Concerto%20for%20Orchestra%20%28Bart%C3%B3k%29">Concerto for Orchestra</a> in 1946. Boult invited <a href="Anton%20Webern">Anton Webern</a> to conduct eight BBC concerts between 1931 and 1936.
The excellence of Boult's orchestra attracted leading international conductors. In its second season guest conductors included <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>, <a href="Felix%20Weingartner">Felix Weingartner</a> and <a href="Bruno%20Walter">Bruno Walter</a>, followed, in later seasons, by <a href="Serge%20Koussevitzky">Serge Koussevitzky</a>, Beecham and <a href="Willem%20Mengelberg">Willem Mengelberg</a>. <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>, widely regarded at the time as the world's leading conductor, conducted the BBC orchestra in 1935 and said that it was the finest he had ever directed. He returned to conduct the orchestra in 1937, 1938 and 1939.

During this period, Boult accepted some international guest conductorships, appearing with the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic">Vienna Philharmonic</a>, <a href="Boston%20Symphony%20Orchestra">Boston Symphony</a>, and <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a> orchestras. In 1936 and 1937 he headed European tours with the BBC Symphony Orchestra, giving concerts in Brussels, Paris, Zurich, Budapest and Vienna, where they were especially well received. During his BBC years, Boult did not entirely lose contact with the world of opera and his performances of "Die Walküre" at Covent Garden in 1931 and "<a href="Fidelio">Fidelio</a>" at <a href="Sadler%27s%20Wells%20Theatre">Sadler's Wells Theatre</a> in 1930 were considered outstanding.

For many years, Boult had been a close friend of the tenor <a href="Steuart%20Wilson">Steuart Wilson</a> and his wife Ann, "née" Bowles. When, in the late 1920s, Wilson began to mistreat his wife, Boult took her side. She divorced Wilson in 1931. In 1933, Boult astonished those who knew his notorious shyness with women by marrying her and becoming a much-loved stepfather to her four children; the marriage lasted for the rest of his life. The enmity it provoked in Wilson had repercussions in Boult's later career. The stigma attached to divorce in Britain in the 1930s affected Wilson's career but not Boult's: Wilson was barred from performing in English cathedrals at the <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> but Boult was invited to conduct the orchestra at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> for the <a href="coronation%20of%20King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth">coronation of George VI</a> in 1937.

During the Second World War the BBC Symphony Orchestra was evacuated first to <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, where it suffered from bombing, and later to <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a>. Boult strove to maintain standards and morale as he lost key players. Between 1939 and the end of the war, forty players left for active service or other activities. In 1942 Boult resigned as the BBC's director of music, while remaining chief conductor of the BBC Symphony Orchestra. This move, made as a favour to the composer <a href="Arthur%20Bliss">Arthur Bliss</a> to provide a suitable war-time job for him, later came to be Boult's undoing at the BBC. Meanwhile, he made recordings of Elgar's Second Symphony, Holst's "The Planets" and Vaughan Williams's "Job, A Masque for Dancing". At the end of the war Boult "found a changed attitude to the orchestra in the upper echelons of the BBC". Reith was no longer director general, and without his backing Boult had to fight hard to restore the orchestra to its pre-war glory.

On 29 September 1946 Boult conducted <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Britten</a>'s new "Festival Overture", to inaugurate the <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Third Programme</a>. For this innovative cultural channel, Boult was concerned in pioneering ventures including the British premiere of Mahler's <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Mahler%29">Third Symphony</a>. "The Times" later said of this period, "The Third Programme could not possibly have had the scope which made it world-famous musically without Boult." Nevertheless, Boult's BBC days were numbered. When he was appointed in 1930, Reith had informally promised him that would be exempt from the BBC's rule that staff must retire at age 60. However, Reith had left the BBC in 1938 and his promise carried no weight with his successors. In 1948 Steuart Wilson was appointed head of music at the BBC, the post previously occupied by Boult and Bliss. He made it clear from the start of his appointment that he intended that Boult should be replaced as chief conductor, and he used his authority to insist on Boult's enforced retirement. The director general of the BBC at the time, <a href="William%20Haley">Sir William Haley</a>, was unaware of Wilson's animus against Boult and later acknowledged, in a broadcast tribute to Boult, that he "had listened to ill-judged advice in retiring him." By the time of his retirement in 1950, Boult had made 1,536 broadcasts.

After it became clear that Boult would have to leave the BBC, Thomas Russell, the managing director of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO), offered him the post of principal conductor of the LPO in succession to <a href="Eduard%20van%20Beinum">Eduard van Beinum</a>. In the 1930s the LPO had flourished, but since Beecham's departure in 1940, it had struggled to survive. Boult was well known to the orchestra, having been among the musicians who came to its aid in 1940. He took over as chief conductor of the LPO in June 1950, immediately after leaving the BBC, and threw himself into the task of rebuilding it. In the early years of his conductorship, the finances of the LPO were perilous, and Boult subsidised the orchestra from his own funds for some time. The need to earn money obliged the orchestra to play many more concerts than its rivals. In the 1949–50 season, the LPO gave 248 concerts, compared with 55 by the BBC Symphony Orchestra, 103 by the London Symphony Orchestra, and 32 apiece by the <a href="Philharmonia%20Orchestra">Philharmonia</a> and <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic</a> orchestras.
Although he had worked extensively in the studio for the BBC, Boult had, up to this point, recorded only a part of his large repertoire for the gramophone. With the LPO he began a series of commercial recordings that continued at a varying rate for the rest of his working life. Their first recordings together were Elgar's "<a href="Falstaff%20%28Elgar%29">Falstaff</a>", Mahler's "<a href="Lieder%20eines%20fahrenden%20Gesellen">Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen</a>" with the <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo</a> <a href="Blanche%20Thebom">Blanche Thebom</a>, and Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Beethoven%29">First Symphony</a>. The work of the new team was greeted with approval by the reviewers. Of the Elgar, "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">The Gramophone</a>" wrote, "I have heard no other conductor approach [Boult's] performance. ... His newly adopted orchestra responds admirably". In "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>", <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> wrote, "Nobody is better able than Sir Adrian Boult to expound the subtly mingled contents of this master work."

In January 1951 Boult and the LPO made a tour of Germany, described by Kennedy as "gruelling", with 12 concerts on 12 successive days. The symphonies they played were Beethoven's <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Beethoven%29">Seventh</a>, Haydn's <a href="Symphony%20No.%20104%20%28Haydn%29">"London", No 104</a>, Brahms's <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Brahms%29">First</a>, Schumann's <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Schumann%29">Fourth</a> and Schubert's <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Schubert%29">"Great C major"</a>. The other works were Elgar's <a href="Introduction%20and%20Allegro%20%28Elgar%29">Introduction and Allegro</a>, Holst's "<a href="The%20Perfect%20Fool">The Perfect Fool</a>" ballet music, Richard Strauss's "<a href="Don%20Juan%20%28Strauss%29">Don Juan</a>", and Stravinsky's "Firebird".

In 1952 the LPO negotiated a five-year contract with <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a>, which was unusually rewarding for the orchestra, giving it a 10 per cent commission on most sales. On top of this, Boult always contributed his share of the recording fees to the orchestra's funds. In the same year, the LPO survived a crisis when Russell was dismissed as its managing director. He was an avowed member of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Great%20Britain">Communist party</a>; when the <a href="Cold%20War">cold war</a> began some influential members of the LPO felt that Russell's private political affiliations compromised the orchestra, and pressed for his dismissal. Boult, as the orchestra's chief conductor, stood up for Russell, but when matters came to a head Boult ceased to protect him. Deprived of that crucial support, Russell was forced out. Kennedy speculates that Boult's change of mind was due to a growing conviction that the orchestra would be "seriously jeopardized financially" if Russell remained in post. A later writer, <a href="Richard%20Witts">Richard Witts</a>, suggests that Boult sacrificed Russell because he believed doing so would enhance the LPO's chance of being appointed resident orchestra at the <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>.

In 1953 Boult once again took charge of the orchestral music at a coronation, conducting an ensemble drawn from UK orchestras at the coronation of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>. During the proceedings, he conducted the first performances of Bliss's "Processional" and Walton's march "<a href="Orb%20and%20Sceptre">Orb and Sceptre</a>". In the same year he returned to the Proms after a three-year absence, conducting the LPO. The notices were mixed: "The Times" found a Brahms symphony "rather colourless, imprecise and uninspiring", but praised Boult and the orchestra's performance of "The Planets". In the same year the orchestra celebrated its 21st birthday, giving a series of concerts at the Festival Hall and the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in which Boult was joined by guest conductors including <a href="Paul%20Kletzki">Paul Kletzki</a>, <a href="Jean%20Martinon">Jean Martinon</a>, <a href="Hans%20Schmidt-Isserstedt">Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt</a>, <a href="Georg%20Solti">Georg Solti</a>, <a href="Walter%20Susskind">Walter Susskind</a> and Vaughan Williams.

In 1956 Boult and the LPO visited Russia. Boult had not wished to go on the tour because flying hurt his ears, and long land journeys hurt his back. The Soviet authorities threatened to cancel the tour if he did not lead it, and he felt obliged to go. The LPO gave nine concerts in Moscow and four in <a href="Saint%20Petersburg">Leningrad</a>. Boult's assistant conductors were <a href="Anatole%20Fistoulari">Anatole Fistoulari</a> and <a href="George%20Hurst%20%28conductor%29">George Hurst</a>. Boult's four Moscow programmes included Vaughan Williams's <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Fourth</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Fifth</a> Symphonies, Holst's "The Planets", Walton's <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Walton%29">Violin Concerto</a> (with <a href="Alfredo%20Campoli">Alfredo Campoli</a> as soloist), and Schubert's "Great C major" Symphony. While in Moscow, Boult and his wife visited the <a href="Bolshoi%20Theatre">Bolshoi Opera</a> and were guests at the composer <a href="Dmitri%20Shostakovich">Dmitri Shostakovich</a>'s 50th birthday party.

After the Russian tour, Boult told the LPO that he wished to step down from the principal conductorship. He continued to be the orchestra's main conductor until his successor <a href="William%20Steinberg">William Steinberg</a> took up the post in 1959. After the sudden resignation of <a href="Andrzej%20Panufnik">Andrzej Panufnik</a> from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (CBSO), Boult returned as principal conductor of the CBSO for the 1959–60 season. That was his last chief conductorship, though he remained closely associated with the LPO as its president and a guest conductor until his retirement.

After stepping down from the chief conductorship of the LPO, Boult was, for a few years, less in demand in the recording studio and the concert hall. Nevertheless, he was invited to conduct in Vienna, Amsterdam and Boston. In 1964 he made no recordings, but in 1965 he began an association with Lyrita records, an independent label specialising in British music. In the same year he resumed recording for EMI after a six-year break. Celebrations for his eightieth birthday in 1969 also raised his profile in the musical world. After the death of his colleague <a href="John%20Barbirolli">Sir John Barbirolli</a> in 1970, Boult was seen as "the sole survivor of a great generation" and a living link with Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Holst. In the words of "The Guardian", "it was when he reached his late seventies that the final and most glorious period of his career developed." He ceased to accept overseas invitations, but conducted in the major British cities, as well as at the Festival and Albert Halls and began what is frequently called his "Indian Summer" in the concert hall and recording studio. He was featured in a 1971 film "The Point of the Stick", in which he illustrated his conducting technique with musical examples.

At a spare recording session in August 1970 Boult recorded the <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Brahms%29">Third Symphony</a> of Brahms. This was well received and led to a series of recordings of Brahms, Wagner, Schubert, Mozart and Beethoven. His repertoire in general was much wider than his discography might suggest. It was a disappointment to him that he was rarely invited to conduct in the opera house, and he relished the opportunity to record extensive excerpts from the Wagner operas in the 1970s. Having conducted several ballets at Covent Garden during the 1970s, Boult gave his last public performance conducting Elgar's ballet "<a href="The%20Sanguine%20Fan">The Sanguine Fan</a>" for the <a href="English%20National%20Ballet">London Festival Ballet</a> at the <a href="Coliseum%20Theatre">London Coliseum</a> on 24 June 1978. His final record, completed in December 1978, was of music by Hubert Parry. Boult formally retired from conducting in 1981 and died in London in 1983, aged 93.

A review in "The Observer" of Boult's second London concert, in 1918, said, "Having, apparently, a thorough knowledge of the work, he was content to let it speak for itself without having recourse to those aids to success which are a constant temptation to conductors." Sixty-five years later, in an obituary tribute, <a href="Peter%20Heyworth">Peter Heyworth</a> wrote in the same newspaper: "From Nikisch he had early acquired an immaculate stick technique and was quietly scathing about conductors who used their anatomy to indicate their artistic requirements. ... In an occupation ridden with inflated egos and circus tricksters Boult brought a rare probity to everything he undertook."

Boult's biographer, Kennedy, gave this summary: "In the music he admired most, Boult was often a great conductor; in the rest, an extremely conscientious one. ... If from behind he seemed unexciting and unemotional, the players could see the animation in his face – and he was capable of frightening outbursts of temper at rehearsals. Tall and erect, with something of the military in his appearance ... he seemed the personification of the English gentleman. But recipients of his cutting wit and occasional sarcasm knew that this was not the whole picture." "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove's Dictionary</a>" similarly said of him:
Boult, unlike many of his contemporaries, preferred the traditional orchestral layout, with first violins on the conductor's left and the seconds on the right. Of the practice of grouping all the violins together on the left, he wrote, "The new seating is, I admit, easier for the conductor and the second violins, but I firmly maintain that the second violins themselves "sound" far better on the right. ... When the new fashion reached us from America somewhere about 1908 it was adopted by some conductors, but Richter, Weingartner, Walter, Toscanini and many others kept what I feel is the right balance."

This care for balance was an important feature of Boult's music-making. Orchestral players across decades commented on his insistence that every important part should be heard without difficulty. His BBC principal violist wrote in 1938, "If a woodwind player has to complain that he has already been blowing 'fit to burst' there is trouble for somebody." The trombonist Ray Premru wrote forty years later, "One of the old school, like Boult, is so refreshing because he will reduce the dynamic level – 'No, no, pianissimo, strings, let the soloist through, less from everyone else.' That is the old idea of balance."

As an educator, Boult influenced several generations of musicians, beginning with his conducting class at the Royal College of Music, London, which he ran from 1919 to 1930. As no such classes had been held before in Britain, Boult "created its curriculum from out of his own experience. ... From that first small class has come all the later formal training for conductors throughout Britain." In the 1930s Boult ran a series of "conferences for conductors" at his country house near <a href="Guildford">Guildford</a>, sometimes helped by Vaughan Williams who lived a few miles away. From 1962 to 1966 he again taught at the Royal College of Music. In later life, he made time for young conductors who sought his counsel. Among those who studied with or were influenced by Boult were <a href="Colin%20Davis">Colin Davis</a>, <a href="James%20Loughran">James Loughran</a>, <a href="Richard%20Hickox">Richard Hickox</a> and <a href="Vernon%20Handley">Vernon Handley</a>. The last was not only a pupil of Boult, but acted as his musical assistant on many occasions.

Boult was created a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> in 1937 and was created a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> (CH) in 1969. He received the gold medal of the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a> in 1944 and the <a href="Harvard%20Glee%20Club">Harvard Glee Club</a> medal (jointly with Vaughan Williams) in 1956. He received honorary degrees and fellowships from 13 universities and conservatoires. In 1951 he was invited to be the first president of the <a href="Elgar%20Society">Elgar Society</a>. In 1959 he was made president of the <a href="Royal%20Scottish%20Academy%20of%20Music%20and%20Drama">Royal Scottish Academy of Music</a>.

Boult's old school, Westminster, has a music centre named in his honour, and the <a href="Birmingham%20Conservatoire">Birmingham Conservatoire</a>, a department of the <a href="Birmingham%20City%20University">Birmingham City University</a> included in its home building the <a href="Adrian%20Boult%20Hall">Adrian Boult Hall</a>. The hall was used for classical concerts, other musical performances, and conferences. The hall was demolished in June 2016 as part of a redevelopment project.

In the June 2013 issue of "Gramophone" Boult was added to the magazine's Hall of Fame which recognises musicians who have made a lasting impact on the world of recorded classical music.

Boult was a prolific recording artist. Unlike many musicians, he felt at home in the recording studio and actually preferred working without an audience. His recording career stretched from the days of acoustic recording until the beginning of the digital era. His last recording of "The Planets" made in May 1978 was taped in experimental digital sound, although technical problems led <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI</a> to release an analogue version.

Boult's recordings fall into three main periods. In the first, from 1920 to the end of the 1940s, he recorded almost exclusively for <a href="EMI%20Records">HMV/EMI</a>. In the 1950s and early 1960s, he was less in demand by the major labels, and although he made a substantial number of discs for <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a>, he recorded mostly for smaller labels, chiefly <a href="Nixa%20Records">Pye Nixa</a>. His last period, from the mid-1960s, sometimes referred to as his Indian Summer, was once again with HMV. With his regular collaborators the producer Christopher Bishop and the engineer Christopher Parker he made more than sixty recordings, re-recording much of his key repertoire in stereo. He also added many works to his discography that he had not recorded before.

Of the British composers, Boult extensively recorded and sometimes re-recorded major works by Elgar and Vaughan Williams. He recorded all eight then-existing symphonies by Vaughan Williams for <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca Records</a> in the 1950s with the LPO, in the presence of the composer. The recording producer, <a href="John%20Culshaw">John Culshaw</a>, wrote that the composer "said very little during the sessions because he was totally in favour of Sir Adrian's approach to his music." Vaughan Williams was to have been present for the first recording of his Ninth symphony, for <a href="Everest%20Records">Everest Records</a> in 1958, but he died the night before the session took place; Boult recorded a short introduction as a memorial tribute. All these recordings have been reissued on CD. In the 1960s Boult re-recorded the nine symphonies for <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI</a>.

Other British composers who feature significantly in Boult's discography include Holst, <a href="John%20Ireland%20%28composer%29">Ireland</a>, Parry, and <a href="William%20Walton">Walton</a>. Despite his reputation as a pioneer in Britain of the works of the <a href="Second%20Viennese%20School">Second Viennese School</a> and other avant-garde composers, the record companies, unlike the BBC, remained cautious about recording him in this repertory, and only a single recording of a Berg piece represents this side of Boult's work. In the core continental orchestral repertoire, Boult's recordings of the four symphonies of Brahms, and the Great C major Symphony of Schubert were celebrated in his lifetime and have remained in the catalogues during the three decades after his death. Late in his recording career he recorded four discs of excerpts from Wagner's operas, which received great critical praise. The exceptional breadth of Boult's repertoire has left some well-regarded recordings of works not immediately associated with him, among which are versions of <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">Franck</a>'s Symphony (recorded in 1959), Dvořák's Cello Concerto with <a href="Mstislav%20Rostropovich">Mstislav Rostropovich</a> (1958), and a pioneering recording of Mahler's Third Symphony taped live in 1947.

Boult wrote articles on a wide range of musical matters. They include an obituary of Nikisch ("Music and Letters", Vol. 3, No. 2 (April 1922), pp. 117–121); "Casals as Conductor" ("Music and Letters", Vol. 4 (1923), pp. 149–52); "<a href="Arnold%20Ros%C3%A9">Rosé</a> and the Vienna Philharmonic" ("Music and Letters", Vol. 32, No. 3 (July 1951), pp. 256–57); and an obituary of Toscanini for "The Musical Times" (March 1957, pp. 127–28)

Boult wrote books about music throughout his career. None were in print at April 2010. They are as follows:

The Supremes

The Supremes were an American <a href="girl%20group">female singing group</a> and the premier act of <a href="Motown">Motown</a> Records during the 1960s. Founded as The Primettes in <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>, Michigan, in 1959, the Supremes were the most commercially successful of Motown's acts and are, to date, America's most successful <a href="musical%20ensemble">vocal group</a> with <a href="List%20of%20Billboard%20Hot%20100%20chart%20achievements%20and%20milestones%23Most%20number-one%20hits">12 number one singles</a> on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a>. Most of these hits were written and produced by Motown's main songwriting and production team, <a href="Holland%E2%80%93Dozier%E2%80%93Holland">Holland–Dozier–Holland</a>. At their peak in the mid-1960s, the Supremes rivaled <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> in worldwide popularity, and it is said that their success made it possible for future African American <a href="Rhythm%20and%20blues">R&B</a> and soul musicians to find mainstream success.

<a href="Florence%20Ballard">Florence Ballard</a>, <a href="Mary%20Wilson%20%28singer%29">Mary Wilson</a>, <a href="Diana%20Ross">Diana Ross</a>, and <a href="Betty%20McGlown">Betty McGlown</a>, the original group, are all from the <a href="Brewster-Douglass%20Housing%20Projects">Brewster-Douglass</a> public housing project in Detroit. They formed the Primettes as the sister act to the Primes (with <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28The%20Temptations%29">Paul Williams</a> and <a href="Eddie%20Kendricks">Eddie Kendricks</a>, who went on to form <a href="the%20Temptations">the Temptations</a>). <a href="Barbara%20Martin%20%28singer%29">Barbara Martin</a> replaced McGlown in 1960, and the group signed with Motown the following year as the Supremes. Martin left the act in early 1962, and Ross, Ballard, and Wilson carried on as a <a href="trio%20%28music%29">trio</a>.

During the mid-1960s, the Supremes achieved mainstream success with Ross as lead singer and <a href="Holland-Dozier-Holland">Holland-Dozier-Holland</a> as its songwriting and production team. In 1967, Motown president <a href="Berry%20Gordy">Berry Gordy</a> renamed the group Diana Ross & the Supremes, and replaced Ballard with <a href="Cindy%20Birdsong">Cindy Birdsong</a>. Ross left to pursue a solo career in 1970 and was replaced by <a href="Jean%20Terrell">Jean Terrell</a>, so the group's name reverted to The Supremes. During the mid-1970s, the lineup changed with <a href="Lynda%20Laurence">Lynda Laurence</a>, <a href="Scherrie%20Payne">Scherrie Payne</a> and <a href="Susaye%20Greene">Susaye Greene</a> joining the group until, after 18 years, The Supremes disbanded in 1977.

In <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> in 1958, <a href="Florence%20Ballard">Florence Ballard</a>, a junior high school student living in the <a href="Brewster-Douglass%20Housing%20Projects">Brewster-Douglass Housing Projects</a>, met <a href="Paul%20Williams%20%28The%20Temptations%29">Paul Williams</a> and <a href="Eddie%20Kendricks">Eddie Kendricks</a>, who were two members of a Detroit singing group known as <a href="the%20Primes">the Primes</a>. Ballard sang, as did Paul Williams' girlfriend <a href="Betty%20McGlown">Betty McGlown</a>, so Milton Jenkins, the Primes's manager, decided to create a sister group to be called <a href="the%20Primettes">the Primettes</a>. Ballard recruited her best friend <a href="Mary%20Wilson%20%28singer%29">Mary Wilson</a>, who recruited classmate <a href="Diana%20Ross">Diana Ross</a>. Mentored and funded by Jenkins, the Primettes began by performing hit songs of artists such as <a href="Ray%20Charles">Ray Charles</a> and <a href="the%20Drifters">the Drifters</a> at <a href="sock%20hop">sock hop</a>s, social clubs and talent shows around the Detroit area. Receiving additional guidance from group friend and established songwriter <a href="Jesse%20Greer">Jesse Greer</a>, the quartet quickly earned a local fan following. The girls crafted an age-appropriate style that was inspired by the collegiate dress of popular <a href="doo-wop">doo-wop</a> group <a href="The%20Teenagers">Frankie Lymon & the Teenagers</a>; and, for the most part, Ballard, Ross and Wilson performed equal leads on songs. Within a few months, guitarist <a href="Marv%20Tarplin">Marvin Tarplin</a> was added to the Primettes' lineup— a move that helped distinguish the group from Detroit's many other aspiring acts by allowing the girls to sing live instead of <a href="lip-synching">lip-synching</a>.

After winning a prestigious local talent contest, the Primettes' sights were set on making a record. In hopes of getting the group signed to the local upstart <a href="Motown">Motown</a> label, in 1960 Ross asked an old neighbor, <a href="The%20Miracles">Miracles</a> lead singer <a href="Smokey%20Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a>, to help the group land an audition for Motown executive <a href="Berry%20Gordy">Berry Gordy</a>, who had already proven himself a capable songwriter. Robinson liked "the girls" (as they were then known around Motown) and agreed to help, but he liked their guitarist even more; with the Primettes' permission he hired Tarplin, who became the guitarist for the Miracles. Robinson arranged for the Primettes to audition "<a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a>" for Gordy—but Gordy, feeling the girls too young and inexperienced to be recording artists, encouraged them to return when they had graduated from high school. Undaunted, later that year the Primettes recorded a single for <a href="Lu%20Pine%20Records">Lu Pine Records</a>, a label created just for them, titled "<a href="Tears%20of%20Sorrow">Tears of Sorrow</a>", which was backed with "<a href="Pretty%20Baby%20%28The%20Primettes%20song%29">Pretty Baby</a>". The single failed to find an audience, however. Shortly thereafter, McGlown became engaged and left the group. Local girl <a href="Barbara%20Martin%20%28singer%29">Barbara Martin</a> was McGlown's prompt replacement.

Determined to leave an impression on Gordy and join the stable of rising Motown stars, the Primettes frequented his <a href="Hitsville%20U.S.A.">Hitsville U.S.A.</a> recording studio every day after school. Eventually, they convinced Gordy to allow them to contribute hand claps and background vocals for the songs of other Motown artists including <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> and <a href="Mary%20Wells">Mary Wells</a>. In January 1961, Gordy finally relented and agreed to sign the girls to his label – but under the condition that they change the name of their group. The Primes had by this time combined with Otis Williams & the Distants and would soon sign to Motown as <a href="the%20Temptations">the Temptations</a>. Gordy gave Ballard a list of names to choose from that included suggestions such as "the Darleens", "the Sweet Ps", "the Melodees", "the Royaltones" and "the Jewelettes". Ballard chose "the Supremes", a name that Ross initially disliked as she felt it too masculine. Nevertheless, on January 15 the group signed with Motown as the Supremes. In the spring of 1962, Martin left the group to start a family. Thus, the newly named Supremes continued as a trio.

Between 1961 and 1963, the Supremes released six singles, none of which charted in the <a href="Top%2040">Top 40</a> positions of the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">Billboard Hot 100</a>. Jokingly referred to as the "no-hit Supremes" around Motown's Hitsville U.S.A. offices, the group attempted to compensate for their lack of hits by taking on any work available at the studio, including providing hand claps and singing backup for Motown artists such as <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a> and <a href="the%20Temptations">the Temptations</a>. During these years, all three members took turns singing lead: Wilson favored soft ballads, Ballard favored soulful, hard-driving songs, and Ross favored mainstream pop songs. Most of their early material was written and produced by Berry Gordy or <a href="Smokey%20Robinson">Smokey Robinson</a>. In December 1963, the single "<a href="When%20the%20Lovelight%20Starts%20Shining%20Through%20His%20Eyes">When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes</a>" peaked at number 23 on the "Billboard" Hot 100.

"Lovelight" was the first of many Supremes songs written by the Motown songwriting and production team known as <a href="Holland%E2%80%93Dozier%E2%80%93Holland">Holland–Dozier–Holland</a>. In late 1963, Berry Gordy chose Diane Ross — who began going by "Diana" in 1965—as the official lead singer of the group. Ballard and Wilson were periodically given solos on Supremes albums, and Ballard continued to sing her solo number, "People", in concert for the next two years.

In the spring of 1964, the Supremes recorded the single "<a href="Where%20Did%20Our%20Love%20Go">Where Did Our Love Go</a>". The song was originally intended by Holland-Dozier-Holland for <a href="the%20Marvelettes">the Marvelettes</a>, who rejected it. Although the Supremes disliked the song, the producers coerced them into recording it. In August 1964, while the Supremes toured as part of <a href="Dick%20Clark">Dick Clark</a>'s "<a href="Caravan%20of%20Stars">Caravan of Stars</a>", "Where Did Our Love Go" reached number one on the US pop charts, much to the surprise and delight of the group. It was also their first song to appear on the UK pop charts, where it reached number three.

"Where Did Our Love Go" was followed by four consecutive US number-one hits: "<a href="Baby%20Love">Baby Love</a>" (which was also a number-one hit in the UK), "<a href="Come%20See%20About%20Me">Come See About Me</a>", "<a href="Stop%21%20In%20the%20Name%20of%20Love">Stop! In the Name of Love</a>" and "<a href="Back%20in%20My%20Arms%20Again">Back in My Arms Again</a>". "Baby Love" was nominated for the 1965 <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Song">Grammy Award for Best R&B Song</a>.

The Supremes deliberately embraced a more glamorous image than previous black performers. Much of this was accomplished at the behest of Motown chief Berry Gordy and <a href="Maxine%20Powell">Maxine Powell</a>, who ran Motown's in-house finishing school and Artist Development department. Unlike many of her contemporaries, Ross sang in a thin, calm voice, and her vocal styling was matched by having all three women embellish their femininity instead of imitate the qualities of male groups. Eschewing plain appearances and basic dance routines, the Supremes appeared onstage in detailed make-up and high-fashion gowns and wigs, and performed graceful choreography created by Motown choreographer <a href="Cholly%20Atkins">Cholly Atkins</a>. Powell told the group to "be prepared to perform before kings and queens." Gordy wanted the Supremes, like all of his performers, to be equally appealing to black and white audiences, and he sought to erase the image of black performers as being unrefined or lacking class.

Public magazines such as "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" and "<a href="The%20Detroit%20News">The Detroit News</a>" commented on the Supremes' polished presentation. "Time" called the Supremes "the pride of Detroit" and described them as "three thrushes who have a touch of gospel and sweet lyrics like 'I'm standing at the crossroads of love'." Arnold S. Hirsch of "The Detroit News" said about the Supremes: "they don't scream or wail incoherently. An adult can understand nine out of every 10 words they sing. And, most astounding, melody can be clearly detected in every song." In addition, unlike most American vocal groups, the group members became easily identifiable by their fans, thanks partially to the cover of their album, "<a href="More%20Hits%20by%20the%20Supremes">More Hits by the Supremes</a>", which each member was pictured separately on the front, with her signature above it.

By 1965, the Supremes were international stars. They toured the world, becoming almost as popular abroad as they were in the US. Almost immediately after their initial number-one hits, they recorded songs for motion picture soundtracks, appeared in the 1965 film "Beach Ball", and endorsed dozens of products, at one point having their own brand of bread. By the end of 1966, their number-one hits included "<a href="I%20Hear%20a%20Symphony">I Hear a Symphony</a>", "<a href="You%20Can%27t%20Hurry%20Love">You Can't Hurry Love</a>" and "<a href="You%20Keep%20Me%20Hangin%27%20On">You Keep Me Hangin' On</a>". That year the group also released "<a href="The%20Supremes%20A%27%20Go-Go">The Supremes A' Go-Go</a>", which on October 22 became the first album by an all-female group to reach number one on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, knocking the Beatles' "<a href="Revolver%20%28The%20Beatles%20album%29">Revolver</a>" out of the top spot.
Because the Supremes were popular with white audiences as well as with black ones, Gordy had the group cater to its <a href="Middle%20America%20%28US%29">middle American</a> audience with performances at renowned <a href="supper%20club">supper club</a>s such as the <a href="Copacabana%20%28nightclub%29">Copacabana</a> in New York. Broadway and pop standards were incorporated into their repertoire alongside their own hit songs. As a result, the Supremes became one of the first black musical acts to achieve complete and sustained crossover success. Black <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> musicians of the 1950s had seen many of their original hit tunes covered by white musicians, with these covers usually achieving more fame and sales success than the originals. The Supremes' success, however, counteracted this trend. Featuring three group members who were marketed for their individual personalities (a move unprecedented at the time) and Diana Ross's pop-friendly voice, the Supremes broke down racial barriers with rock and roll songs underpinned by <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> stylings. The group became extremely popular both domestically and abroad, becoming one of the first black musical acts to appear regularly on television programs such as "<a href="Hullabaloo%20%28television%29">Hullabaloo</a>", "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Palace">The Hollywood Palace</a>", "<a href="Della%20Reese">The Della Reese Show</a>", and, most notably, "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>", on which they made 17 appearances. The Supremes' cross-cultural success effectively paved the way for the mainstream success of contemporaneous label mates such as the Temptations, the <a href="Four%20Tops">Four Tops</a> and <a href="the%20Jackson%205">the Jackson 5</a>.

Problems within the group and within Motown Records' stable of performers led to tension among the members of the Supremes. Many of the other Motown performers felt that Berry Gordy was lavishing too much attention upon the group and upon Ross, in particular. In early 1967, the name of the act was officially changed briefly to "the Supremes with Diana Ross" before changing again to "Diana Ross & the Supremes" by mid-summer. The Miracles had become "Smokey Robinson & the Miracles" two years prior. The fall of 1967 saw Martha & the Vandellas become "Martha Reeves & the Vandellas". Having learned that Ross would receive top billing, <a href="David%20Ruffin">David Ruffin</a> lobbied, unsuccessfully, to have the Temptations renamed as "David Ruffin & the Temptations", although Gordy maintained that because they would be providing two acts, a lead singer and a group, Motown could demand more money for live bookings.

The Supremes' name change fueled already present rumors of a solo career for Ross and contributed to the professional and personal dismantling of the group. In fact, Gordy intended to replace Ross with <a href="Barbara%20Randolph">Barbara Randolph</a> as early as the fall of 1966, but changed his mind and instead kept Ross in the group for several more years. Gordy's caution may have been sparked by an incident in early 1966 as the group prepared to make their second appearance at the Copacabana. Angered by erratic behavior from Florence Ballard, Gordy intended to replace her with Marlene Barrow, a member of the Motown in-house singing group <a href="the%20Andantes">the Andantes</a>. However, when club management heard of this change, they threatened to cancel the group's appearance if Ballard was replaced, as they saw Ballard's banter with her group mates as a major part of their act's success.

As Ross became the focal point of the Supremes, Ballard felt pushed aside in the group. Depression ensued, and Ballard began to drink excessively, gaining weight until she could no longer comfortably wear many of her stage outfits. The friendship, and later the working relationship, between Ross and Ballard became strained. During this turbulent period, Ballard relied heavily upon the advice of group mate Mary Wilson, with whom she had maintained a close friendship. Wilson, while outwardly demure and neutral in hopes of keeping the group stable, privately advised Ballard that Ross and Gordy were eager to oust Ballard. Although the Supremes scored two number-one hits during the first quarter of 1967, "<a href="Love%20Is%20Here%20and%20Now%20You%27re%20Gone">Love Is Here and Now You're Gone</a>" and "<a href="The%20Happening%20%28song%29">The Happening</a>", the group as a unit began to disintegrate.

By 1967, Ballard would not show up for recording dates, or would arrive at shows too inebriated to perform. For some early 1967 shows, she was replaced by Marlene Barrow. Looking for a more permanent replacement, Gordy once again thought of Barbara Randolph, possibly believing that Randolph could be groomed as lead singer for the group once it was decided to take Ross solo. However, Ross did not receive Randolph well. In April 1967, Gordy then contacted <a href="Cindy%20Birdsong">Cindy Birdsong</a>, a member of <a href="Labelle">Patti LaBelle & the Blue Belles</a> who superficially resembled Ballard, with plans to bring her in as Ballard's replacement. He made his plans clear to Ballard and her group mates at a mid-April meeting, and Birdsong was brought in to begin rehearsals. Gordy did not fire Ballard outright at that time, asking Ballard instead to quit on her own.

Birdsong first appeared with the Supremes in Ballard's place at a benefit concert at the <a href="Hollywood%20Bowl">Hollywood Bowl</a> on April 29, 1967. Following the performance, Gordy quickly learned that Birdsong was still contractually committed to the Blue Belles when that group's lawyers filed an injunction against him. In May, Ballard returned for what she believed was a probationary period, although in reality it was a stopgap measure until Gordy was able to buy out Birdsong's contract. During May and June, knowing that she was one step away from being dismissed, Ballard made an attempt to toe the line, slimming down and showing up to commitments on time and sober. Despite this, Birdsong was secretly traveling with the Supremes, studying their routines.

On June 29, 1967 the group returned to the <a href="Flamingo%20Hotel">Flamingo Hotel</a> in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a> billed as "the Supremes with Diana Ross", the first time in which Ross was billed separately from the group. One month later, Gordy renamed the group "Diana Ross & the Supremes," putting Ross's name ahead of the group.

The first two days of the Flamingo engagement went by smoothly. On July 1, when reporting for makeup and wardrobe before their first show of the evening, Ballard discovered an extra set of gowns and costumes that had been brought along for Cindy Birdsong. Angered, Ballard performed the first concert of the night inebriated, leading to an embarrassing on-stage incident in which her stomach was revealed when she purposely thrust it forward during a dance routine. Enraged, Gordy ordered her back to Detroit and permanently dismissed her from the group. Birdsong officially assumed her place during the second July 1 show.

Ballard's release from Motown was made final on February 22, 1968, when she received a one-time payment of US$139,804.94 in royalties and earnings. She attempted a solo career with <a href="ABC%20Records">ABC Records</a>, and was forced to formally reject a solo contract offered by Motown as part of her settlement. Ballard's two 1968 singles failed to chart and her solo album was shelved. In 1971, Ballard sued Motown for $8.7 million, claiming that Gordy and Diana Ross had conspired to force her out of the group; the judge ruled in favor of Motown. Ballard eventually sank into poverty and died abruptly on February 22, 1976 from <a href="coronary%20thrombosis">coronary thrombosis</a> at the age of 32. At the time of her death, she had begun to make financial and personal strides and was planning to reinvigorate her solo career.

Holland-Dozier-Holland left Motown in early 1968 after a dispute with the label over royalties and profit sharing. The quality of Motown's output (and Diana Ross & the Supremes' records in particular) began to falter as a result. From "Reflections" in 1967 to "The Weight" in 1969, only six out of the eleven released singles reached the Top 20, and only one of those, 1968's "<a href="Love%20Child%20%28song%29">Love Child</a>", made it to number one. Due to the tension within the group and stringent touring schedules, neither Mary Wilson nor Cindy Birdsong appear on many of these singles; they were replaced on these recordings by <a href="session%20singer">session singer</a>s such as <a href="the%20Andantes">the Andantes</a>. The changes within the group and their decreasing sales were signs of changes within the music industry. The <a href="gospel%20music">gospel</a>-based soul of female performers such as <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a> had eclipsed the Supremes' pop-based sound, which had by now evolved to include more middle-of-the-road material. In a cultural climate now influenced more than ever by <a href="counterculture">countercultural</a> movements such as the <a href="Black%20Panther%20Party">Black Panther Party</a>, the Supremes found themselves attacked for not being "black enough", and lost ground in the black music market.

In mid-1968, Motown initiated a number of high-profile collaborations for the Supremes with their old colleagues, the Temptations. Besides the fact that both groups had come up together, the pairings made financial sense: the Supremes had a mostly white fanbase, while the Temptations a mostly black fanbase. By 1969, the label began plans for a Diana Ross solo career. A number of candidates—most notably <a href="Syreeta%20Wright">Syreeta Wright</a>—were considered to replace Ross. After seeing 24-year-old <a href="Jean%20Terrell">Jean Terrell</a> perform with her brother <a href="Ernie%20Terrell">Ernie</a> in Florida, Berry Gordy decided on Ross' replacement. Terrell was signed to Motown and began recording the first post-Ross Supremes songs with Wilson and Birdsong during the day, while Wilson and Birdsong toured with Ross at night. At the same time, Ross began to make her first solo recordings. In November 1969, Ross' solo career was publicly announced.

"<a href="Someday%20We%27ll%20Be%20Together">Someday We'll Be Together</a>" was recorded with the intent of releasing it as the first solo single for Diana Ross. Desiring a final Supremes number-one record, Gordy instead had the song released as a Diana Ross & the Supremes single, despite the fact that neither Wilson nor Birdsong sang on the record. "Someday We'll Be Together" hit number one on the American pop charts, becoming not only the Supremes' 12th and final number-one hit, but also the final number-one hit of the 1960s. This single also would mark the Supremes' final television appearance together with Ross, performing on "<a href="The%20Ed%20Sullivan%20Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a>" on December 21, 1969. The Supremes without Ross made their final appearance altogether on "Ed Sullivan" on February 15, 1970.

Diana Ross & the Supremes gave their final performance on January 14, 1970 at the <a href="New%20Frontier%20%28hotel%20and%20casino%29">Frontier Hotel</a> in Las Vegas. At the final performance, the replacement for Diana Ross, Jean Terrell, was introduced. According to Mary Wilson, after this performance, Berry Gordy wanted to replace Terrell with <a href="Syreeta%20Wright">Syreeta Wright</a>. Wilson refused, leading to Gordy stating that he was washing his hands of the group thereafter. This claim is also made by Mark Ribowsky. After the Frontier Hotel performance, Ross officially began her career as a solo performer. Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong continued working with Jean Terrell on the first post-Ross Supremes album, "<a href="Right%20On%20%28The%20Supremes%20album%29">Right On</a>".

The Terrell-led Supremes—now rebranded as "the Supremes;" known unofficially at first as "the New Supremes", and in later years informally called "The '70s Supremes"—scored hits including "<a href="Up%20the%20Ladder%20to%20the%20Roof">Up the Ladder to the Roof</a>" (US number 10, UK number 6), "<a href="Stoned%20Love">Stoned Love</a>" (US number 7, UK number 3) and "<a href="Nathan%20Jones%20%28song%29">Nathan Jones</a>" (US number 16, UK number 5), all of which were produced by <a href="Frank%20Wilson%20%28musician%29">Frank Wilson</a>. These three singles were also R&B Top Ten hits, with "Stoned Love" becoming their last No.1 R&B hit in December 1970. Songwriting/production team <a href="Ashford%20%26amp%3B%20Simpson">Nickolas Ashford & Valerie Simpson</a> produced another Top 20 hit for the group, a Supremes/<a href="Four%20Tops">Four Tops</a> duet version of <a href="Ike%20%26amp%3B%20Tina%20Turner">Ike & Tina Turner</a>'s "<a href="River%20Deep%20%E2%80%93%20Mountain%20High">River Deep – Mountain High</a>".

In 1972, the Supremes had their last Top 20 hit single release, "<a href="Floy%20Joy%20%28song%29">Floy Joy</a>", written and produced by Smokey Robinson, followed by the final US Top 40 hit for the Jean Terrell-led version of the group, "<a href="Automatically%20Sunshine">Automatically Sunshine</a>" (US number 37, UK number 10). "Automatically Sunshine" later became the group's final top 10 single in the UK. On both "Floy Joy" and "Sunshine" Terrell shared lead with Mary Wilson. Motown, by then moving from Detroit to Los Angeles to break into motion pictures, put only limited effort into promoting the Supremes' new material, and their popularity and sales began to wane. Cindy Birdsong left the group in April 1972, after recording the "<a href="Floy%20Joy%20%28album%29">Floy Joy</a>" album, to start a family; her replacement was <a href="Lynda%20Laurence">Lynda Laurence</a>, a former member of <a href="Stevie%20Wonder">Stevie Wonder</a>'s backup group, Third Generation (a predecessor to Wonderlove). <a href="Jimmy%20Webb">Jimmy Webb</a> was hired to produce the group's next LP, "<a href="The%20Supremes%20Produced%20and%20Arranged%20by%20Jimmy%20Webb">The Supremes Produced and Arranged by Jimmy Webb</a>", but the album and its only single "I Guess I'll Miss the Man" failed to make an impact on the "Billboard" pop chart, with the single charting at number 85.

In early 1973, Laurence prevailed upon her old mentor Stevie Wonder to write and produce a hit for the Supremes, but the resulting "<a href="Bad%20Weather">Bad Weather</a>" peaked at number 87 on the US pop charts and number 37 in the UK. Laurence can be heard briefly, shouting several times at the end of the song (the only recording on which Laurence is heard). Laurence left to start a family; her replacement: a returning Cindy Birdsong.

Dismayed by this poor-performing record and the lack of promotional support from Motown, Jean Terrell left the group and was replaced by <a href="Scherrie%20Payne">Scherrie Payne</a>, the sister of <a href="Invictus%20Records">Invictus Records</a> recording artist <a href="Freda%20Payne">Freda Payne</a>.

Between the 1973 departures of Laurence and Terrell and the first Supremes single with Scherrie Payne, "He's My Man", a disco single on which Payne and Wilson shared lead vocal, Motown was slow in producing contracts for Payne and the returning Birdsong. Before the release of the album in 1975, the Supremes remained a popular live act, and continued touring overseas, particularly in the UK and Japan. The group's new recordings were not as successful as their earlier releases, although "He's My Man" from the album "<a href="The%20Supremes%20%281975%20album%29">The Supremes</a>" was a popular disco hit in 1975. In 1976, Birdsong, dissatisfied with the management of the Supremes (handled at the time by Mary Wilson's then-husband Pedro Ferrer), left again and was replaced by <a href="Susaye%20Greene">Susaye Greene</a>, another former member of Wonderlove.

This final version of the Supremes released two albums, both of which reunited the Supremes with Holland-Dozier-Holland: "<a href="High%20Energy%20%28The%20Supremes%20album%29">High Energy</a>", which includes Birdsong on all of the tracks, and "<a href="Mary%2C%20Scherrie%20%26amp%3B%20Susaye">Mary, Scherrie & Susaye</a>". During that year, the Supremes released "<a href="I%27m%20Gonna%20Let%20My%20Heart%20Do%20the%20Walking">I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking</a>", their final Top 40 hit on the "Billboard" Hot 100.

On June 12, 1977, the Supremes performed their <a href="The%20Supremes%27%20farewell%20concert">farewell concert</a> at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane Theater</a> in London and disbanded.

Several fictional works have been published and produced that are based in part on the career of the group. The 1976 film "<a href="Sparkle%20%281976%20film%29">Sparkle</a>" features the story of a Supremes-like singing trio called "Sister & the Sisters" from <a href="Harlem">Harlem</a>, New York. The film's score was composed by <a href="Curtis%20Mayfield">Curtis Mayfield</a>, and the soundtrack album by <a href="Aretha%20Franklin">Aretha Franklin</a> was a commercial success. A remake of "Sparkle" was in development in the early 2000s with <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> singer <a href="Aaliyah">Aaliyah</a> as the lead, but the project was shelved when Aaliyah died in 2001. The "<a href="Sparkle%20%282012%20film%29">Sparkle</a>" remake was eventually released in August 2012 and starred <a href="Jordin%20Sparks">Jordin Sparks</a> and <a href="Whitney%20Houston">Whitney Houston</a>, in her final film role.

On December 21, 1981, the <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>-winning musical "<a href="Dreamgirls">Dreamgirls</a>" opened at the <a href="Imperial%20Theatre%20%28Broadway%29">Imperial Theatre</a> on Broadway and ran for 1,522 performances. The musical, loosely based on the history of the Supremes, follows the story of the Dreams, an all-female singing trio from <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> who become music superstars. Several of the characters in the play are analogues of real-life Supremes/Motown counterparts, with the story focusing upon the Florence Ballard <a href="doppelg%C3%A4nger">doppelgänger</a> Effie White. While influenced by the Supremes' and Motown's music, the songs in the play are a broader mix of R&B/soul and Broadway music. Mary Wilson loved the musical, but Diana Ross was reportedly angered by it and refused to see it.

A film adaptation of "<a href="Dreamgirls%20%28film%29">Dreamgirls</a>", starring <a href="Jamie%20Foxx">Jamie Foxx</a>, <a href="Beyonc%C3%A9">Beyoncé</a>, <a href="Eddie%20Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a>, and <a href="Jennifer%20Hudson">Jennifer Hudson</a>, was released by <a href="DreamWorks">DreamWorks</a> and <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a> in December 2006. The film contains more overt references to Motown and the Supremes than does the play that inspired it: for example, in the film, many of the Dreams' album covers are identical in design to Supremes album covers, and the Dreams themselves hail from Detroit – not Chicago, as do their Broadway counterparts.

The Supremes were twice nominated for a <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>—for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20R%26amp%3BB%20Song">Best Rhythm & Blues Recording</a> ("Baby Love", 1965) and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Pop%20Performance%20by%20a%20Duo%20or%20Group%20with%20Vocals">Best Contemporary Rock & Roll Group Vocal Performance</a> ("Stop! In the Name of Love", 1966)—but never won an award in competition. Three of their songs were added to the <a href="Grammy%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20Award">Grammy Hall of Fame</a>: "Where Did Our Love Go" and "You Keep Me Hangin' On" (both 1999) and "Stop! In the Name of Love" (2001).

"Stop! In the Name of Love" and "You Can't Hurry Love" are among the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll. The Ross-Wilson-Ballard lineup was inducted into the <a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a> in 1988, received a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a> in 1994, and entered into the <a href="Vocal%20Group%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Vocal Group Hall of Fame</a> in 1998. In 2004, "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" placed the group at number 97 on their list of the "100 Greatest Artists of All Time". The Supremes are notable for the influences they have had on black girl groups who have succeeded them in popular music, such as <a href="The%20Three%20Degrees">The Three Degrees</a>, <a href="The%20Emotions">The Emotions</a>, <a href="The%20Pointer%20Sisters">The Pointer Sisters</a>, <a href="En%20Vogue">En Vogue</a>, <a href="TLC%20%28band%29">TLC</a>, <a href="Destiny%27s%20Child">Destiny's Child</a> and <a href="Cleopatra%20%28band%29">Cleopatra</a>.

"<a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a> were there," said <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> of her childhood, "but I was more eager about The Supremes. I was really into girl groups."

Fan interest made the idea of a Supremes reunion tour a very profitable one during the 1980s. In 1982, around the time that Motown reunited all of the Temptations, it was rumored that Motown would reunite the Supremes. The 1974 line-up of the Supremes (Wilson, Birdsong and Payne) was considered for this reunion, which was to include new recordings and a tour. Under advisement from Berry Gordy, Wilson declined to reunite, and the idea was scrapped. Ross briefly reunited with Wilson and Birdsong to perform "Someday We'll Be Together" on the "" television special, taped on March 25, 1983, and broadcast on <a href="NBC">NBC</a> on May 16, 1983.

In 2000, plans were made for Ross to join Wilson and Birdsong for a planned "Diana Ross & the Supremes: Return to Love" reunion tour. However, Wilson passed on the idea, because while the promoters offered Ross $15 million to perform, Wilson was offered $4 million and Birdsong less than $1 million. Ross herself offered to double the amounts both Wilson and Birdsong had originally been offered, but while Birdsong accepted, Wilson remained adamant, and as a result the deal fell through with both former Supremes. Eventually, the "Return to Love" tour went on as scheduled, but with Payne and Laurence joining Ross, although none of the three had ever been in the group at the same time and neither Payne nor Laurence had sung on any of the original hit recordings that they were now singing live. Susaye Greene was also considered for this tour, but refused to audition for it. The music critics cried foul and many fans were disappointed by both this and the shows' high ticket prices. Though the tour did well in larger markets including near capacity at the opening night in Philadelphia and a sellout at <a href="Madison%20Square%20Garden">Madison Square Garden</a> in New York, it under performed in smaller/medium markets. The tour was canceled after playing only half of the dates on itinerary.

In 1986, Jean Terrell, Scherrie Payne and Lynda Laurence began to perform as "The FLOS": <a href="Former%20Ladies%20of%20the%20Supremes">Former Ladies of the Supremes</a>. When Terrell quit in 1992, <a href="Sundray%20Tucker">Sundray Tucker</a>, Laurence’s sister, stepped in for a short time, but was replaced by <a href="Freddi%20Poole">Freddi Poole</a> in 1996. More recently in September 2009, Poole was replaced by <a href="Joyce%20Vincent%20Wilson">Joyce Vincent</a>, formerly of <a href="Tony%20Orlando%20and%20Dawn">Tony Orlando and Dawn</a>. The group, now called "Scherrie Payne & Lynda Laurence, Formerly of the Supremes," and Joyce Vincent, are working on a new recording.

<a href="Kaaren%20Ragland">Kaaren Ragland</a> performed with Mary Wilson from 1978 though the mid-1980s. In 1989 she formed her own group called "the Sounds of the Supremes". She has claimed numerous times that she was a member of the Supremes because of her performances with Wilson, but she was never signed by Motown and performed with Wilson only after the Supremes disbanded in 1977 and is not considered as a member of the Supremes.

David I of Scotland

David I or Dauíd mac Maíl Choluim (<a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Modern</a>: "Daibhidh I mac [Mhaoil] Chaluim"; – 24 May 1153) was a 12th-century ruler who was <a href="David%2C%20Prince%20of%20the%20Cumbrians">Prince of the Cumbrians</a> from 1113 to 1124 and later <a href="King%20of%20the%20Scots">King of the Scots</a> from 1124 to 1153. The youngest son of <a href="Malcolm%20III">Malcolm III</a> and <a href="Margaret%20of%20Wessex">Margaret of Wessex</a>, David spent most of his childhood in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, but was exiled to <a href="England">England</a> temporarily in 1093. Perhaps after 1100, he became a dependent at the court of King <a href="Henry%20I%20of%20England">Henry I</a>. There he was influenced by the Anglo-French culture of the court.

When David's brother <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Scotland">Alexander I</a> died in 1124, David chose, with the backing of Henry I, to take the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> (<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Alba">Alba</a>) for himself. He was forced to engage in warfare against his rival and nephew, <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20mac%20Alaxandair">Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair</a>. Subduing the latter seems to have taken David ten years, a struggle that involved the destruction of <a href="%C3%93engus%20of%20Moray">Óengus</a>, <a href="Mormaer%20of%20Moray">Mormaer of Moray</a>. David's victory allowed expansion of control over more distant regions theoretically part of his Kingdom. After the death of his former patron Henry I, David supported the claims of Henry's daughter and his own niece, <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Empress Matilda</a>, to the throne of England. In the process, he came into conflict with King <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a> and was able to expand his power in northern England, despite his defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Standard">Battle of the Standard</a> in 1138.

The term "<a href="Davidian%20Revolution">Davidian Revolution</a>" is used by many scholars to summarise the changes which took place in Scotland during his reign. These included his foundation of <a href="burgh">burgh</a>s and regional markets, implementation of the ideals of <a href="Gregorian%20Reform">Gregorian Reform</a>, foundation of <a href="monastery">monasteries</a>, Normanisation of the Scottish government, and the introduction of <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> through immigrant <a href="French%20people">French</a> and <a href="Anglo-Norman%20language">Anglo-French</a> knights.

The early years of David I are the most obscure of his life. As there is little documented evidence, historians can only guess at most of David's activities in this period.

David was born on a date unknown in 1084 in Scotland. He was probably the eighth son of <a href="King%20Malcolm%20III">King Malcolm III</a>, and certainly the sixth and youngest born by Malcolm's second wife, <a href="Margaret%20of%20Wessex">Margaret of Wessex</a>. He was the grandson of the ill-fated <a href="King%20Duncan%20I">King Duncan I</a>.

In 1093 King Máel Coluim and David's brother Edward were killed at the <a href="River%20Aln">River Aln</a> during an invasion of <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. David and his two brothers <a href="Alexander%20I%20of%20Scotland">Alexander</a> and <a href="Edgar%20of%20Scotland">Edgar</a>, both future kings of Scotland, were probably present when their mother died shortly afterwards. According to later medieval tradition, the three brothers were in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> when they were besieged by their paternal uncle <a href="Donald%20III%20of%20Scotland">Donald</a>.

Donald became King of Scotland. It is not certain what happened next, but an insertion in the "<a href="Chronicle%20of%20Melrose">Chronicle of Melrose</a>" states that Donald forced his three nephews into exile, although he was allied with another of his nephews, <a href="Edmund%20of%20Scotland">Edmund</a>. John of Fordun wrote, centuries later, that an escort into England was arranged for them by their maternal uncle <a href="Edgar%20%C3%86theling">Edgar Ætheling</a>.

<a href="William%20Rufus">William Rufus</a>, King of England, opposed Donald's accession to the northerly kingdom. He sent the eldest son of Malcolm, David's half-brother <a href="Duncan%20II%20of%20Scotland">Duncan</a>, into Scotland with an army. Duncan was killed within the year, and so in 1097 William sent Donnchad's half-brother Edgar into Scotland. The latter was more successful, and was crowned King by the end of 1097.

During the power struggle of 1093–97, David was in England. In 1093, he may have been about nine years old. From 1093 until 1103 David's presence cannot be accounted for in detail, but he appears to have been in Scotland for the remainder of the 1090s. When William Rufus was killed, his brother <a href="Henry%20Beauclerc">Henry Beauclerc</a> seized power and married David's sister, <a href="Matilda%20of%20Scotland">Matilda</a>. The marriage made David the brother-in-law of the ruler of England. From that point onwards, David was probably an important figure at the English court. Despite his Gaelic background, by the end of his stay in England, David had become a full-fledged Normanised prince. <a href="William%20of%20Malmesbury">William of Malmesbury</a> wrote that it was in this period that David "rubbed off all tarnish of Scottish barbarity through being polished by intercourse and friendship with us".

David's time as "Prince of the Cumbrians" and Earl marks the beginning of his life as a great territorial lord. His earldom probably began in 1113, when Henry I arranged David's marriage to <a href="Maud%2C%202nd%20Countess%20of%20Huntingdon">Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon</a>, who was the heiress to the Huntingdon–Northampton lordship. As her husband, David used the title of earl, and there was the prospect that David's children by her would inherit all the honours borne by Matilda's father <a href="Waltheof%20II%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Waltheof</a>. 1113 is the year when David, for the first time, can be found in possession of territory in what is now Scotland.

David's brother, King Edgar, had visited William Rufus in May 1099 and bequeathed to David extensive territory to the south of the <a href="river%20Forth">river Forth</a>. On 8 January 1107, Edgar died. His younger brother Alexander took the throne. It has been assumed that David took control of his <a href="inheritance">inheritance</a> – the southern lands bequeathed by Edgar – soon after the latter's death. However, it cannot be shown that he possessed his inheritance until his foundation of <a href="Selkirk%20Abbey">Selkirk Abbey</a> late in 1113. According to <a href="Richard%20Oram">Richard Oram</a>, it was only in 1113, when Henry returned to England from Normandy, that David was at last in a position to claim his inheritance in southern "Scotland".

King Henry's backing seems to have been enough to force King Alexander to recognise his younger brother's claims. This probably occurred without bloodshed, but through threat of force nonetheless. David's aggression seems to have inspired resentment amongst some native Scots. A <a href="Middle%20Gaelic">Middle Gaelic</a> quatrain from this period complains that:
If "divided from" is anything to go by, this quatrain may have been written in David's new territories in southern Scotland.

The lands in question consisted of the <a href="pre-1975%20counties">pre-1975 counties</a> of <a href="Roxburghshire">Roxburghshire</a>, <a href="Selkirkshire">Selkirkshire</a>, <a href="Berwickshire">Berwickshire</a>, <a href="Peeblesshire">Peeblesshire</a> and <a href="Lanarkshire">Lanarkshire</a>. David, moreover, gained the title , "<a href="Kingdom%20of%20Strathclyde">Prince of the Cumbrians</a>", as attested in David's charters from this era. Although this was a large slice of Scotland south of the river Forth, the region of Galloway-proper was entirely outside David's control.

David may perhaps have had varying degrees of overlordship in parts of <a href="Dumfriesshire">Dumfriesshire</a>, <a href="Ayrshire">Ayrshire</a>, <a href="Dunbartonshire">Dunbartonshire</a> and <a href="Renfrewshire%20%28historic%29">Renfrewshire</a>. In the lands between Galloway and the Principality of Cumbria, David eventually set up large-scale marcher lordships, such as <a href="Annandale">Annandale</a> for Robert de Brus, <a href="Cunninghame">Cunningham</a> for Hugh de Morville, and possibly Strathgryfe for <a href="Walter%20Fitzalan">Walter Fitzalan</a>.

In the later part of 1113, King Henry gave David the hand of Matilda of Huntingdon, daughter and heiress of <a href="Waltheof%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Waltheof, Earl of Northumberland</a>. The marriage brought with it the "Honour of Huntingdon", a lordship scattered through the shires of <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a>, <a href="Huntingdon">Huntingdon</a>, and <a href="Bedford">Bedford</a>; within a few years, Matilda bore a son, whom David named <a href="Henry%20of%20Scotland">Henry</a> after his patron.

The new territories which David controlled were a valuable supplement to his income and manpower, increasing his status as one of the most powerful magnates in the Kingdom of the English. Moreover, Matilda's father Waltheof had been <a href="Earl%20of%20Northumberland">Earl of Northumberland</a>, a defunct lordship which had covered the far north of England and included <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> and <a href="Westmorland">Westmorland</a>, <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>-proper, as well as overlordship of the bishopric of Durham. After King Henry's death, David would revive the claim to this earldom for his son Henry.

David's activities and whereabouts after 1114 are not always easy to trace. He spent much of his time outside his principality, in England and in Normandy. Despite the death of his sister on 1 May 1118, David still possessed the favour of King Henry when his brother Alexander died in 1124, leaving Scotland without a king.

Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray David as having little initial connection with the culture and society of the Scots; but both likewise argue that David became increasingly re-Gaelicised in the later stages of his reign. Whatever the case, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. David was the youngest of eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. <a href="William%20fitz%20Duncan">William fitz Duncan</a>, son of King Donnchad II, and <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20mac%20Alaxandair">Máel Coluim</a>, son of the last king Alexander, both preceded David in terms of the slowly emerging principles of <a href="primogeniture">primogeniture</a>. However, unlike David, neither William nor Máel Coluim had the support of Henry. So when Alexander died in 1124, the aristocracy of Scotland could either accept David as King, or face war with both David and Henry I.

Alexander's son Máel Coluim chose war. <a href="Orderic%20Vitalis">Orderic Vitalis</a> reported that Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair "affected to snatch the kingdom from [David], and fought against him two sufficiently fierce battles; but David, who was loftier in understanding and in power and wealth, conquered him and his followers". Máel Coluim escaped unharmed into areas of Scotland not yet under David's control, and in those areas gained shelter and aid.

In either April or May of the same year, David was crowned King of Scotland (; <a href="Medieval%20Latin">Medieval Latin</a>: ) at <a href="Scone%2C%20Scotland">Scone</a>. If later Scottish and Irish evidence can be taken as evidence, the ceremony of coronation was a series of elaborate traditional rituals, of the kind infamous in the Anglo-French world of the 12th century for their "unchristian" elements. Ailred of Rievaulx, friend and one-time member of David's court, reported that David "so abhorred those acts of homage which are offered by the Scottish nation in the manner of their fathers upon the recent promotion of their kings, that he was with difficulty compelled by the bishops to receive them".

Outside his Cumbrian principality and the southern fringe of Scotland-proper, David exercised little power in the 1120s, and in the words of Richard Oram, was "king of Scots in little more than name". He was probably in that part of Scotland he did rule for most of the time between late 1127 and 1130. However, he was at the court of Henry in 1126 and in early 1127, and returned to Henry's court in 1130, serving as a judge at <a href="Woodstock%20Palace">Woodstock</a> for the <a href="treason">treason</a> trial of <a href="Geoffrey%20de%20Clinton">Geoffrey de Clinton</a>. It was in this year that David's wife, Matilda of Huntingdon, died. Possibly as a result of this, and while David was still in southern England, Scotland-proper rose up in arms against him.

The instigator was, again, his nephew Máel Coluim, who now had the support of <a href="%C3%93engus%20of%20Moray">Óengus of Moray</a>. King Óengus was David's most powerful vassal, a man who, as grandson of King <a href="Lulach%20of%20Scotland">Lulach of Scotland</a>, even had his own claim to the kingdom. The rebel Scots had advanced into <a href="Angus%2C%20Scotland">Angus</a>, where they were met by David's <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>n <a href="constable">constable</a>, <a href="Edward%20the%20Constable">Edward</a>; a battle took place at <a href="Stracathro">Stracathro</a> near <a href="Brechin">Brechin</a>. According to the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Ulster">Annals of Ulster</a>", 1000 of Edward's army, and 4000 of Óengus' army – including Óengus himself – died.

According to Orderic Vitalis, Edward followed up the killing of Óengus by marching north into Moray itself, which, in Orderic's words, "lacked a defender and lord"; and so Edward, "with God's help obtained the entire duchy of that extensive district". However, this was far from the end of it. Máel Coluim escaped, and four years of continuing civil war followed; for David this period was quite simply a "struggle for survival".

It appears that David asked for and obtained extensive military aid from King Henry. Ailred of Rievaulx related that at this point a large fleet and a large army of Norman knights, including Walter l'Espec, were sent by Henry to Carlisle in order to assist David's attempt to root out his Scottish enemies. The fleet seems to have been used in the <a href="Irish%20Sea">Irish Sea</a>, the <a href="Firth%20of%20Clyde">Firth of Clyde</a> and the entire <a href="Argyll">Argyll</a> coast, where Máel Coluim was probably at large among supporters. In 1134 Máel Coluim was captured and imprisoned in <a href="Roxburgh%20Castle">Roxburgh Castle</a>. Since modern historians no longer confuse him with "<a href="Malcolm%20MacHeth">Malcolm MacHeth</a>", it is clear that nothing more is ever heard of Máel Coluim mac Alaxadair, except perhaps that his sons were later allied with <a href="Somerled">Somerled</a>.

Richard Oram puts forward the suggestion that it was during this period that David granted Walter fitz Alan the "kadrez" of <a href="Strathgryfe">Strathgryfe</a>, with northern <a href="Kyle%2C%20Ayrshire">Kyle</a> and the area around <a href="Renfrew%2C%20Scotland">Renfrew</a>, forming what would become the "Stewart" lordship of Strathgryfe; he also suggests that Hugh de Morville may have gained the "kadrez" of <a href="Cunninghame">Cunningham</a> and the settlement of "Strathyrewen" (i.e. <a href="Irvine%2C%20North%20Ayrshire">Irvine</a>). This would indicate that the 1130–34 campaign had resulted in the acquisition of these territories.

How long it took to pacify Moray is not known, but in this period David appointed his nephew William fitz Duncan to succeed Óengus, perhaps in compensation for the exclusion from the succession to the Scottish throne caused by the coming of age of David's son <a href="Henry%20of%20Scotland">Henry</a>. William may have been given the daughter of Óengus in marriage, cementing his authority in the region. The burghs of <a href="Elgin%2C%20Moray">Elgin</a> and <a href="Forres">Forres</a> may have been founded at this point, consolidating royal authority in Moray. David also founded <a href="Urquhart%20Priory">Urquhart Priory</a>, possibly as a "victory monastery", and assigned to it a percentage of his "<a href="cain">cain</a>" (tribute) from Argyll.

During this period too, a marriage was arranged between the son of <a href="Matad%2C%20Mormaer%20of%20Atholl">Matad, Mormaer of Atholl</a>, and the daughter of <a href="Haakon%20Paulsson">Haakon Paulsson</a>, <a href="Earl%20of%20Orkney">Earl of Orkney</a>. The marriage temporarily secured the northern frontier of the Kingdom, and held out the prospect that a son of one of David's <a href="Mormaer">Mormaer</a>s could gain <a href="Orkney">Orkney</a> and <a href="Caithness">Caithness</a> for the Kingdom of Scotland. Thus, by the time Henry I died on 1 December 1135, David had more of Scotland under his control than ever before.

While fighting <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">King Stephen</a> and attempting to dominate northern England in the years following 1136, David was continuing his drive for control of the far north of Scotland. In 1139, his cousin, the five-year-old <a href="Harald%20Maddadsson">Harald Maddadsson</a>, was given the title of "Earl" and half the lands of the <a href="earldom%20of%20Orkney">earldom of Orkney</a>, in addition to Scottish Caithness. Throughout the 1140s Caithness and Sutherland were brought back under the Scottish zone of control. Sometime before 1146 David appointed a native Scot called <a href="Aindr%C3%A9as%20of%20Caithness">Aindréas</a> to be the first <a href="Bishop%20of%20Caithness">Bishop of Caithness</a>, a bishopric which was based at <a href="Halkirk">Halkirk</a>, near <a href="Thurso">Thurso</a>, in an area which was ethnically Scandinavian.

In 1150, it looked like Caithness and the whole earldom of Orkney were going to come under permanent Scottish control. However, David's plans for the north soon began to encounter problems. In 1151, King <a href="Eystein%20II%20of%20Norway">Eystein II of Norway</a> put a spanner in the works by sailing through the waterways of Orkney with a large fleet and catching the young Harald unaware in his residence at Thurso. Eystein forced Harald to pay <a href="fealty">fealty</a> as a condition of his release. Later in the year David hastily responded by supporting the claims to the Orkney earldom of Harald's rival <a href="Erlend%20Haraldsson">Erlend Haraldsson</a>, granting him half of Caithness in opposition to Harald. King Eystein responded in turn by making a similar grant to this same Erlend, cancelling the effect of David's grant. David's weakness in Orkney was that the Norwegian kings were not prepared to stand back and let him reduce their power.

David's relationship with England and the English crown in these years is usually interpreted in two ways. Firstly, his actions are understood in relation to his connections with the King of England. No historian is likely to deny that David's early career was largely manufactured by King Henry I of England. David was the latter's brother-in-law and "greatest protégé", one of Henry's "new men". His hostility to Stephen can be interpreted as an effort to uphold the intended inheritance of Henry I, the succession of his daughter and David's niece, <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Matilda</a>, the former Empress of the Holy Roman Empire. David carried out his wars in her name, joined her when she arrived in England, and later knighted her son, the future <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II</a>.

However, David's policy towards England can be interpreted in an additional way. David was the independence-loving king trying to build a "Scoto-Northumbrian" realm by seizing the most northerly parts of the English kingdom. In this perspective, David's support for Matilda is used as a pretext for land-grabbing. David's maternal descent from the <a href="House%20of%20Wessex">House of Wessex</a> and his son Henry's maternal descent from the English Earls of Northumberland is thought to have further encouraged such a project, a project which came to an end only after Henry II ordered David's child successor <a href="M%C3%A1el%20Coluim%20IV">Máel Coluim IV</a> to hand over the most important of David's gains. It is clear that neither one of these interpretations can be taken without some weight being given to the other.

Henry I had arranged his inheritance to pass to his daughter <a href="Empress%20Matilda">Empress Matilda</a>. Instead, <a href="Stephen%20of%20England">Stephen</a>, younger brother of <a href="Theobald%20II%2C%20Count%20of%20Blois">Theobald II, Count of Blois</a>, seized the throne. David had been the first lay person to take the oath to uphold the succession of Matilda in 1127, and when Stephen was crowned on 22 December 1135, David decided to make war.

Before December was over, David marched into northern England, and by the end of January he had occupied the castles of <a href="Carlisle%20Castle">Carlisle</a>, <a href="Wark%2C%20Tynedale">Wark</a>, <a href="Alnwick">Alnwick</a>, <a href="Norham">Norham</a> and <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>. By February David was at Durham, but an army led by King Stephen met him there. Rather than fight a pitched battle, a treaty was agreed whereby David would retain Carlisle, while David's son Henry was re-granted the title and half the lands of the earldom of Huntingdon, territory which had been confiscated during David's revolt. On Stephen's side he received back the other castles; and while David would do no homage, Stephen was to receive the homage of Henry for both Carlisle and the other English territories. Stephen also gave the rather worthless but for David face-saving promise that if he ever chose to resurrect the defunct earldom of Northumberland, Henry would be given first consideration. Importantly, the issue of Matilda was not mentioned. However, the first Durham treaty quickly broke down after David took insult at the treatment of his son Henry at Stephen's court.

When the winter of 1136–37 was over, David prepared again to invade England. The King of the Scots massed an army on the Northumberland's border, to which the English responded by gathering an army at Newcastle. Once more pitched battle was avoided, and instead a truce was agreed until December. When December fell, David demanded that Stephen hand over the whole of the old earldom of Northumberland. Stephen's refusal led to David's third invasion, this time in January 1138.

The army which invaded England in January and February 1138 shocked the English chroniclers. <a href="Richard%20of%20Hexham">Richard of Hexham</a> called it "an execrable army, savager than any race of heathen yielding honour to neither God nor man" and that it "harried the whole province and slaughtered everywhere folk of either sex, of every age and condition, destroying, pillaging and burning the vills, churches and houses". Several doubtful stories of cannibalism were recorded by chroniclers, and these same chroniclers paint a picture of routine enslavings, as well as killings of churchmen, women and infants.

By February King Stephen marched north to deal with David. The two armies avoided each other, and Stephen was soon on the road south. In the summer David split his army into two forces, sending William fitz Duncan to march into <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, where he harried <a href="Furness">Furness</a> and <a href="Craven">Craven</a>. On 10 June, William fitz Duncan met a force of knights and men-at-arms. A pitched battle took place, the <a href="battle%20of%20Clitheroe">battle of Clitheroe</a>, and the English army was routed.

By later July, 1138, the two Scottish armies had reunited in "St Cuthbert's land", that is, in the lands controlled by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Durham">Bishop of Durham</a>, on the far side of the <a href="river%20Tyne">river Tyne</a>. Another English army had mustered to meet the Scots, this time led by <a href="William%2C%20Earl%20of%20Aumale">William, Earl of Aumale</a>. The victory at Clitheroe was probably what inspired David to risk battle. David's force, apparently 26,000 strong and several times larger than the English army, met the English on 22 August at Cowdon Moor near <a href="Northallerton">Northallerton</a>, <a href="North%20Yorkshire">North Yorkshire</a>.
The <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Standard">Battle of the Standard</a>, as the encounter came to be called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although the result was a defeat, it was not by any means decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy <a href="Cumberland">Cumberland</a> as well as much of <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>.

On 26 September <a href="Alberic%20of%20Ostia">Cardinal Alberic</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Ostia">Bishop of Ostia</a>, arrived at Carlisle where David had called together his kingdom's nobles, abbots and bishops. Alberic was there to investigate the controversy over the issue of the Bishop of Glasgow's allegiance or non-allegiance to the Archbishop of York. Alberic played the role of peace-broker, and David agreed to a six-week truce which excluded the siege of Wark. On 9 April David and Stephen's wife <a href="Matilda%20of%20Boulogne">Matilda of Boulogne</a> (daughter of <a href="Mary%20of%20Scotland%2C%20Countess%20of%20Boulogne">Mary of Scotland</a>, and so another niece of David) met each other at Durham and agreed a settlement. David's son Henry was given the earldom of Northumberland and was restored to the earldom of Huntingdon and lordship of <a href="Doncaster">Doncaster</a>; David himself was allowed to keep Carlisle and Cumberland. King Stephen was to retain possession of the strategically vital castles of <a href="Bamburgh">Bamburgh</a> and Newcastle. This effectively fulfilled all of David's war aims.

The settlement with Stephen was not set to last long. The arrival in England of the Empress Matilda gave David an opportunity to renew the conflict with Stephen. In either May or June, David travelled to the south of England and entered Matilda's company; he was present for her expected coronation at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, though this never took place. David was there until September, when the Empress found herself surrounded at <a href="Rout%20of%20Winchester">Winchester</a>.

This civil war, or "<a href="the%20Anarchy">the Anarchy</a>" as it was later called, enabled David to strengthen his own position in northern England. While David consolidated his hold on his own and his son's newly acquired lands, he also sought to expand his influence. The castles at Newcastle and Bamburgh were again brought under his control, and he attained dominion over all of England north-west of the <a href="river%20Ribble">river Ribble</a> and <a href="Pennines">Pennines</a>, while holding the north-east as far south as the river Tyne, on the borders of the core territory of the bishopric of Durham. While his son brought all the senior barons of Northumberland into his entourage, David rebuilt the fortress of Carlisle. Carlisle quickly replaced Roxburgh as his favoured residence. David's acquisition of the mines at <a href="Alston%2C%20Cumbria">Alston</a> on the <a href="River%20Tyne">South Tyne</a> enabled him to begin minting the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a>'s first silver coinage. David, meanwhile, issued charters to <a href="Shrewsbury%20Abbey">Shrewsbury Abbey</a> in respect to their lands in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>.

However, David's successes were in many ways balanced by his failures. David's greatest disappointment during this time was his inability to ensure control of the bishopric of Durham and the archbishopric of York. David had attempted to appoint his chancellor, William Comyn, to the bishopric of Durham, which had been vacant since the death of Bishop <a href="Geoffrey%20Rufus">Geoffrey Rufus</a> in 1140. Between 1141 and 1143, Comyn was the "de facto" bishop, and had control of the bishop's castle; but he was resented by the <a href="Chapter%20%28religion%29">chapter</a>. Despite controlling the town of Durham, David's only hope of ensuring his election and consecration was gaining the support of the Papal legate, <a href="Henry%20of%20Blois">Henry of Blois</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Winchester">Bishop of Winchester</a> and brother of King Stephen. Despite obtaining the support of the Empress Matilda, David was unsuccessful and had given up by the time <a href="William%20de%20St%20Barbara">William de St Barbara</a> was elected to the see in 1143.

David also attempted to interfere in the succession to the archbishopric of York. <a href="Saint%20William%20of%20York">William FitzHerbert</a>, nephew of King Stephen, found his position undermined by the collapsing political fortune of Stephen in the north of England, and was deposed by the Pope. David used his Cistercian connections to build a bond with <a href="Henry%20Murdac">Henry Murdac</a>, the new archbishop. Despite the support of <a href="Pope%20Eugenius%20III">Pope Eugenius III</a>, supporters of King Stephen and William FitzHerbert managed to prevent Henry taking up his post at York. In 1149, Henry had sought the support of David. David seized on the opportunity to bring the archdiocese under his control, and marched on the city. However, Stephen's supporters became aware of David's intentions, and informed King Stephen. Stephen therefore marched to the city and installed a new garrison. David decided not to risk such an engagement and withdrew. Richard Oram has conjectured that David's ultimate aim was to bring the whole of the ancient <a href="kingdom%20of%20Northumbria">kingdom of Northumbria</a> into his dominion. For Oram, this event was the turning point, "the chance to radically redraw the political map of the British Isles lost forever".

Historical treatment of David I and the Scottish church usually emphasises David's pioneering role as the instrument of diocesan reorganisation and Norman penetration, beginning with the <a href="Bishop%20of%20Glasgow">bishopric of Glasgow</a> while David was Prince of the Cumbrians, and continuing further north after David acceded to the throne of Scotland. Focus too is usually given to his role as the defender of the Scottish church's independence from claims of overlordship by the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> and the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Archbishop of Canterbury</a>.

It was once held that Scotland's episcopal sees and entire parochial system owed its origins to the innovations of David I. Today, scholars have moderated this view. <a href="Ailred%20of%20Rievaulx">Ailred of Rievaulx</a> wrote in David's eulogy that when David came to power, "he found three or four bishops in the whole Scottish kingdom [north of the Forth], and the others wavering without a pastor to the loss of both morals and property; when he died, he left nine, both of ancient bishoprics which he himself restored, and new ones which he erected". Although David moved the bishopric of <a href="Mortlach%2C%20Scotland">Mortlach</a> east to his new burgh of Aberdeen, and arranged the creation of the diocese of Caithness, no other bishoprics can be safely called David's creation.

The <a href="Bishop%20of%20Glasgow">bishopric of Glasgow</a> was restored rather than resurrected. David appointed his reform-minded French chaplain <a href="John%20Capellanus">John</a> to the bishopric and carried out an <a href="inquest">inquest</a>, afterwards assigning to the bishopric all the lands of his principality, except those in the east which were already governed by the <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20Andrews">Bishop of St Andrews</a>. David was at least partly responsible for forcing semi-monastic "bishoprics" like <a href="Bishop%20of%20Brechin">Brechin</a>, <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunkeld">Dunkeld</a>, Mortlach (Aberdeen) and <a href="Bishop%20of%20Dunblane">Dunblane</a> to become fully episcopal and firmly integrated into a national diocesan system.

As for the development of the parochial system, David's traditional role as its creator can not be sustained. Scotland already had an ancient system of parish churches dating to the <a href="Early%20Middle%20Ages">Early Middle Ages</a>, and the kind of system introduced by David's Normanising tendencies can more accurately be seen as mild refashioning, rather than creation; he made the Scottish system as a whole more like that of France and England, but he did not create it.

One of the first problems David had to deal with as king was an ecclesiastical dispute with the English church. The problem with the English church concerned the subordination of Scottish sees to the archbishops of York and/or Canterbury, an issue which since his election in 1124 had prevented <a href="Robert%20of%20Scone">Robert of Scone</a> from being consecrated to the see of <a href="St%20Andrews">St Andrews</a> (Cell Ríghmonaidh). It is likely that since the 11th century the bishopric of St Andrews functioned as a "de facto" archbishopric. The title of "Archbishop" is accorded in Scottish and Irish sources to <a href="Giric%20of%20Cennr%C3%ADgmonaid">Bishop Giric</a> and <a href="Fothad%20II%20of%20Cennr%C3%ADgmonaid">Bishop Fothad II</a>.

The problem was that this archiepiscopal status had not been cleared with the papacy, opening the way for English archbishops to claim overlordship of the whole Scottish church. The man responsible was the new aggressively assertive Archbishop of York, <a href="Thurstan">Thurstan</a>. His easiest target was the bishopric of Glasgow, which being south of the <a href="river%20Forth">river Forth</a> was not regarded as part of Scotland nor the jurisdiction of St Andrews. In 1125, <a href="Pope%20Honorius%20II">Pope Honorius II</a> wrote to John, Bishop of Glasgow ordering him to submit to the archbishopric of York. David ordered Bishop John of Glasgow to travel to the <a href="Holy%20See">Apostolic See</a> in order to secure a <a href="pallium">pallium</a> which would elevate the <a href="Bishop%20of%20St%20Andrews">bishopric of St Andrews</a> to an archbishopric with jurisdiction over Glasgow.

Thurstan travelled to Rome, as did the Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="William%20de%20Corbeil">William de Corbeil</a>, and both presumably opposed David's request. David however gained the support of King Henry, and the Archbishop of York agreed to a year's postponement of the issue and to consecrate Robert of Scone without making an issue of subordination. York's claim over bishops north of the Forth were in practice abandoned for the rest of David's reign, although York maintained her more credible claims over Glasgow.

In 1151, David again requested a pallium for the Archbishop of St Andrews. Cardinal John Paparo met David at his residence of Carlisle in September 1151. Tantalisingly for David, the Cardinal was on his way to Ireland with four "pallia" to create four new Irish archbishoprics. When the Cardinal returned to Carlisle, David made the request. In David's plan, the new archdiocese would include all the bishoprics in David's Scottish territory, as well as <a href="Bishop%20of%20Orkney">bishopric of Orkney</a> and the <a href="Bishop%20of%20the%20Isles">bishopric of the Isles</a>. Unfortunately for David, the Cardinal does not appear to have brought the issue up with the papacy. In the following year the papacy dealt David another blow by creating the archbishopric of Trondheim, a new Norwegian archbishopric embracing the bishoprics of the Isles and Orkney.

Perhaps the greatest blow to David's plans came on 12 July 1152 when Henry, Earl of Northumberland, David's only son and heir, died. He had probably been suffering from some kind of illness for a long time. David had under a year to live, and he may have known that he was not going to be alive much longer. David quickly arranged for his grandson <a href="Malcolm%20IV">Malcolm IV</a> to be made his successor, and for his younger grandson <a href="William%20I%20of%20Scotland">William</a> to be made Earl of Northumberland. <a href="Donnchad%20I%2C%20Mormaer%20of%20Fife">Donnchad I, Mormaer of Fife</a>, the senior magnate in Scotland-proper, was appointed as "rector", or <a href="regent">regent</a>, and took the 11 year-old Malcolm around Scotland-proper on a tour to meet and gain the homage of his future Gaelic subjects. David's health began to fail seriously in the spring of 1153, and on 24 May 1153, David died in <a href="Carlisle%20Castle">Carlisle Castle</a>. In his obituary in the "<a href="Annals%20of%20Tigernach">Annals of Tigernach</a>", he is called "Dabíd mac Mail Colaim, rí Alban & Saxan", "David, son of Malcolm, King of Scotland and England", a title which acknowledged the importance of the new English part of David's realm. He was buried in <a href="Dunfermline%20Abbey">Dunfermline Abbey</a>.

The earliest assessments of David I portray him as a pious king, a reformer and a civilising agent in a barbarian nation. For William of Newburgh, David was a "King not barbarous of a barbarous nation", who "wisely tempered the fierceness of his barbarous nation". William praises David for his piety, noting that, among other saintly activities, "he was frequent in washing the feet of the poor" (this can be read literally: his mother, who is now patron saint of Scotland, was widely-known and lauded for the same practice). Another of David's eulogists, his former courtier <a href="Ailred%20of%20Rievaulx">Ailred of Rievaulx</a>, echoes Newburgh's assertions and praises David for his justice as well as his piety, commenting that David's rule of the Scots meant that "the whole barbarity of that nation was softened ... as if forgetting their natural fierceness they submitted their necks to the laws which the royal gentleness dictated".

Although avoiding stress on 12th-century Scottish "barbarity", the Lowland Scottish historians of the later Middle Ages tend to repeat the accounts of earlier chronicle tradition. Much that was written was either directly transcribed from the earlier medieval chronicles themselves or was modelled closely upon them, even in the significant works of <a href="John%20of%20Fordun">John of Fordun</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Wyntoun">Andrew Wyntoun</a> and <a href="Walter%20Bower">Walter Bower</a>. For example, Bower includes in his text the eulogy written for David by Ailred of Rievaulx. This quotation extends to over twenty pages in the modern edition, and exerted a great deal of influence over what became the traditional view of David in later works about Scottish history. Historical treatment of David developed in the writings of later Scottish historians, and the writings of men like <a href="John%20Major%20%28philosopher%29">John Mair</a>, <a href="George%20Buchanan">George Buchanan</a>, <a href="Hector%20Boece">Hector Boece</a>, and Bishop <a href="John%20Lesley">John Leslie</a> ensured that by the 18th century a picture of David as a pious, justice-loving state-builder and vigorous maintainer of Scottish independence had emerged.

In the modern period there has been more of an emphasis on David's statebuilding and on the effects of his changes on Scottish cultural development. Lowland Scots tended to trace the origins of their culture to the marriage of David's father Máel Coluim III to <a href="Saint%20Margaret%20of%20Scotland">Saint Margaret</a>, a myth which had its origins in the medieval period. With the development of modern historical techniques in the mid-19th century, responsibility for these developments appeared to lie more with David than his father. David assumed a principal place in the alleged destruction of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Alba">Celtic Kingdom of Scotland</a>. Andrew Lang, in 1900, wrote that "with Alexander [I], Celtic domination ends; with David, Norman and English dominance is established".

The ages of <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a> and <a href="Romanticism">Romanticism</a> had elevated the role of races and "ethnic packages" into mainstream history, and in this context David was portrayed as hostile to the native Scots, and his reforms were seen in the light of natural, perhaps even justified, civilised Teutonic aggression towards the backward Celts.

In the 20th century, several studies were devoted to Normanisation in 12th-century Scotland, focusing upon and hence emphasising the changes brought about by the reign of David I. Græme Ritchie's "The Normans in Scotland" (1954), <a href="Archie%20Duncan%20%28historian%29">Archie Duncan</a>'s "Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom" (1974) and the many articles of <a href="G.%20W.%20S.%20Barrow">G. W. S. Barrow</a> all formed part of this historiographical trend.

In the 1980s, Barrow sought a compromise between change and continuity, and argued that the reign of King David was in fact a "Balance of New and Old". Such a conclusion was a natural incorporation of an underlying current in Scottish historiography which, since <a href="William%20Forbes%20Skene">William F. Skene</a>'s monumental and revolutionary three-volume "Celtic Scotland: A History of Ancient Alban" (1876–80), had been forced to acknowledge that "Celtic Scotland" was alive and healthy for a long time after the reign of David I. Michael Lynch followed and built upon Barrow's compromise solution, arguing that as David's reign progressed, his kingship became more Celtic. Despite its subtitle, in 2004 in the only full volume study of David I's reign yet produced, "David I: The King Who Made Scotland", its author <a href="Richard%20Oram">Richard Oram</a> further builds upon Lynch's picture, stressing continuity while placing the changes of David's reign in their context.

However, while there may be debate about the importance or extent of the <a href="historical%20change">historical change</a> in David I's era, no historian doubts that it was taking place. The reason is what Barrow and Lynch both call the "Davidian Revolution". David's "revolution" is held to underpin the development of later medieval Scotland, whereby the changes he inaugurated grew into most of the central institutions of the later medieval kingdom.

Since <a href="Robert%20Bartlett%20%28historian%29">Robert Bartlett</a>'s pioneering work, "The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change, 950–1350" (1993), reinforced by Moore's "The First European Revolution, c.970–1215" (2000), it has become increasingly apparent that better understanding of David's "revolution" can be achieved by recognising the wider "European revolution" taking place during this period. The central idea is that from the late 10th century onwards the culture and institutions of the old <a href="Carolingian">Carolingian</a> heartlands in northern <a href="France">France</a> and western <a href="Germany">Germany</a> were spreading to outlying areas, creating a more recognisable "Europe". Scotland was just one of many "outlying" areas.

The widespread enfeoffment of foreign knights and the processes by which <a href="land%20ownership">land ownership</a> was converted from <a href="Custom%20%28law%29">customary</a> <a href="tenure">tenure</a>s into <a href="feudal">feudal</a>, or otherwise legally-defined relationships, would revolutionise the way the Kingdom of Scotland was governed, as did the dispersal and installation of royal agents in the new <a href="Motte-and-bailey">mottes</a> that were proliferating throughout the realm to staff newly created sheriffdoms and judiciaries for the twin purposes of <a href="law%20enforcement%20organization">law enforcement</a> and <a href="taxation">taxation</a>, bringing Scotland further into the "continental" model.

Scotland in this period experienced innovations in governmental practices and the importation of foreign, mostly <a href="French%20people">French</a>, <a href="knight">knight</a>s. It is to David's reign that the beginnings of <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> are generally assigned. This is defined as "castle-building, the regular use of professional cavalry, the knight's fee" as well as "homage and fealty". David established large scale feudal lordships in the west of his Cumbrian principality for the leading members of the French military entourage who kept him in power. Additionally, many smaller scale feudal lordships were created.

Steps were taken during David's reign to make the government of that part of Scotland he administered more like the government of Anglo-Norman England. New <a href="sheriffdom">sheriffdom</a>s enabled the King to effectively administer <a href="royal%20demesne">royal demesne</a> land. During his reign, royal sheriffs were established in the king's core personal territories; namely, in rough chronological order, at <a href="Roxburgh">Roxburgh</a>, <a href="Scone%2C%20Scotland">Scone</a>, <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>, <a href="Stirling">Stirling</a> and <a href="Perth%2C%20Scotland">Perth</a>. The <a href="Justiciar">Justiciar</a>ship too was created in David's reign. Although this institution had Anglo-Norman origins, in Scotland north of the Forth at least, it represented some form of continuity with an older office.

The revenue of his English earldom and the proceeds of the silver mines at <a href="Alston%2C%20Cumbria">Alston</a> allowed David to produce Scotland's first coinage. These altered the nature of trade and transformed his political image.

David was a great town builder. As Prince of the Cumbrians, David founded the first two <a href="burghs">burghs</a> of "Scotland", at <a href="Roxburgh">Roxburgh</a> and Berwick. Burghs were settlements with defined boundaries and guaranteed trading rights, locations where the king could collect and sell the products of his "cain" and "conveth" (a payment made "in lieu" of providing the king <a href="hospitality">hospitality</a>). David founded around 15 burghs.

Perhaps nothing in David's reign compares in importance to burghs. While they could not, at first, have amounted to much more than the nucleus of an <a href="immigrant">immigrant</a> <a href="merchant">merchant</a> class, nothing would do more to reshape the long-term economic and ethnic shape of Scotland than the burgh. These planned towns were or became <a href="English%20people">English</a> in culture and language; <a href="William%20of%20Newburgh">William of Newburgh</a> wrote in the reign of King <a href="William%20I%20of%20Scotland">William the Lion</a>, that "the towns and burghs of the Scottish realm are known to be inhabited by English"; as well as transforming the economy, the failure of these towns to go native would in the long term undermine the position of the <a href="Middle%20Irish%20language">native Scottish language</a> and give birth to the idea of the <a href="Scottish%20Lowlands">Scottish Lowlands</a>.

David was one of medieval Scotland's greatest monastic patrons. In 1113, in perhaps David's first act as Prince of the Cumbrians, he founded <a href="Selkirk%20Abbey">Selkirk Abbey</a> for the <a href="Tironensian">Tironensian</a>s. David founded more than a dozen new monasteries in his reign, patronising various new monastic orders.

Not only were such monasteries an expression of David's undoubted piety, but they also functioned to transform Scottish society. Monasteries became centres of foreign influence, and provided sources of <a href="Literacy">literate</a> men, able to serve the crown's growing administrative needs. These new monasteries, and the <a href="Cistercians">Cistercian</a> ones in particular, introduced new agricultural practices. Cistercian labour, for instance, transformed southern Scotland into one of northern Europe's most important sources of sheep wool.

Thomas Beecham

Sir Thomas Beecham, 2nd Baronet, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">CH</a></small> (29 April 18798 March 1961) was an English conductor and <a href="impresario">impresario</a> best known for his association with the <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic</a> orchestras. He was also closely associated with the <a href="Royal%20Liverpool%20Philharmonic">Liverpool Philharmonic</a> and <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé</a> orchestras. From the early 20th century until his death, Beecham was a major influence on the musical life of Britain and, according to the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, was Britain's first international conductor.

Born to a rich industrial family, Beecham began his career as a conductor in 1899. He used his access to the family fortune to finance opera from the 1910s until the start of the Second World War, staging seasons at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a>, <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a> and <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">His Majesty's Theatre</a> with international stars, his own orchestra and a wide repertoire. Among the works he introduced to England were <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s "<a href="Elektra%20%28opera%29">Elektra</a>", "<a href="Salome%20%28opera%29">Salome</a>" and "<a href="Der%20Rosenkavalier">Der Rosenkavalier</a>" and three operas by <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Frederick Delius</a>.

Together with his younger colleague <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a>, Beecham founded the London Philharmonic, and he conducted its first performance at the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> in 1932. In the 1940s he worked for three years in the United States where he was music director of the <a href="Seattle%20Symphony">Seattle Symphony</a> and conducted at the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>. After his return to Britain, he founded the Royal Philharmonic in 1946 and conducted it until his death in 1961.

Beecham's repertoire was eclectic, sometimes favouring lesser-known composers over famous ones. His specialities included composers whose works were neglected in Britain before he became their advocate, such as Delius and <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>. Other composers with whose music he was frequently associated were <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>, <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a> and the composer he revered above all others, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>.

Beecham was born in <a href="St%20Helens%2C%20Merseyside">St Helens</a>, <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, in a house adjoining the <a href="Beecham%27s%20Pills">Beecham's Pills</a> laxative factory founded by his grandfather, <a href="Thomas%20Beecham%20%28chemist%29">Thomas Beecham</a>. His parents were <a href="Sir%20Joseph%20Beecham%2C%201st%20Baronet">Joseph Beecham</a>, the elder son of Thomas, and Josephine, "née" Burnett. He was an uncle of poet <a href="Audrey%20Beecham">Audrey Beecham</a>. In 1885, with the family firm flourishing financially, Joseph Beecham moved his family to a large house in Ewanville, <a href="Huyton">Huyton</a>, near <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a>. Their former home was demolished to make room for an extension to the pill factory.

Beecham was educated at <a href="Rossall%20School">Rossall School</a> between 1892 and 1897, after which he hoped to attend a music conservatoire in Germany, but his father forbade it, and instead Beecham went to <a href="Wadham%20College%2C%20Oxford">Wadham College, Oxford</a>, to read <a href="Classics">Classics</a>. He did not find university life to his taste and successfully sought his father's permission to leave Oxford in 1898. He studied as a pianist, but had difficulty because of his small hands, and any career as a soloist was ruled out by a wrist injury in 1904. He studied composition privately with <a href="Frederic%20Austin">Frederic Austin</a> in Liverpool, <a href="Charles%20Wood%20%28composer%29">Charles Wood</a> in London, and <a href="Moritz%20Moszkowski">Moritz Moszkowski</a> in Paris. As a conductor, he was self-taught.

Beecham first conducted in public in St Helens in October 1899, with an "ad hoc" ensemble comprising local musicians and players from the <a href="Royal%20Liverpool%20Philharmonic">Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra</a> and <a href="the%20Hall%C3%A9">the Hallé</a> in Manchester. A month later, he stood in at short notice for the celebrated conductor <a href="Hans%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Hans Richter</a> at a concert by the Hallé to mark Joseph Beecham's inauguration as mayor of St Helens. Soon afterwards, Joseph Beecham secretly committed his wife to a mental hospital. Thomas and his elder sister Emily helped to secure their mother's release and to force their father to pay annual alimony of £4,500. For this, Joseph disinherited them. Beecham was estranged from his father for ten years.

Beecham's professional début as a conductor was in 1902 at the Shakespeare Theatre, <a href="Clapham">Clapham</a>, with <a href="Michael%20William%20Balfe">Balfe</a>'s "<a href="The%20Bohemian%20Girl">The Bohemian Girl</a>", for the Imperial Grand Opera Company. He was engaged as assistant conductor for a tour and was allotted four other operas, including "<a href="Carmen">Carmen</a>" and "<a href="Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a>". A Beecham biographer calls the company "grandly named but decidedly ramshackle", though Beecham's Carmen was <a href="Z%C3%A9lie%20de%20Lussan">Zélie de Lussan</a>, a leading exponent of the title role. Beecham was also composing music in these early years, but he was not satisfied with his own efforts and instead concentrated on conducting.

In 1906 Beecham was invited to conduct the New Symphony Orchestra, a recently formed ensemble of 46 players, in a series of concerts at the <a href="Wigmore%20Hall">Bechstein Hall</a> in London. Throughout his career, Beecham frequently chose to programme works to suit his own tastes rather than those of the paying public. In his early discussions with his new orchestra, he proposed works by a long list of barely known composers such as <a href="%C3%89tienne%20M%C3%A9hul">Étienne Méhul</a>, <a href="Nicolas%20Dalayrac">Nicolas Dalayrac</a> and <a href="Ferdinando%20Paer">Ferdinando Paer</a>. During this period, Beecham first encountered the music of <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Frederick Delius</a>, which he at once loved deeply and with which he became closely associated for the rest of his life.

Beecham quickly concluded that to compete with the two existing London orchestras, the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> Orchestra and the recently founded <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a> (LSO), his forces must be expanded to full symphonic strength and play in larger halls. For two years starting in October 1907, Beecham and the enlarged New Symphony Orchestra gave concerts at the Queen's Hall. He paid little attention to the box office: his programmes were described by a biographer as "even more certain to deter the public then than it would be in our own day". The principal pieces of his first concert with the orchestra were <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">d'Indy</a>'s symphonic ballad "La forêt enchantée", <a href="Bed%C5%99ich%20Smetana">Smetana</a>'s symphonic poem "Šárka", and <a href="%C3%89douard%20Lalo">Lalo</a>'s little-known <a href="Symphony%20in%20G%20minor%20%28Lalo%29">Symphony in G minor</a>. Beecham retained an affection for the last work: it was among the works he conducted at his final recording sessions more than fifty years later.

In 1908 Beecham and the New Symphony Orchestra parted company, disagreeing about artistic control and, in particular, the deputy system. Under this system, orchestral players, if offered a better-paid engagement elsewhere, could send a substitute to a rehearsal or a concert. The treasurer of the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a> described it thus: ""A", whom you want, signs to play at your concert. He sends "B" (whom you don't mind) to the first rehearsal. "B", without your knowledge or consent, sends "C" to the second rehearsal. Not being able to play at the concert, "C" sends "D", whom you would have paid five shillings to stay away." <a href="Henry%20Wood">Henry Wood</a> had already banned the deputy system in the Queen's Hall Orchestra (provoking rebel players to found the London Symphony Orchestra), and Beecham followed suit. The New Symphony Orchestra survived without him and subsequently became the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> Orchestra.

In 1909, Beecham founded the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. He did not poach from established symphony orchestras, but instead he recruited from theatre bandrooms, local symphony societies, the <a href="palm%20court">palm court</a>s of hotels, and music colleges. The result was a youthful team – the typical age of his players was 25. They included names that would become celebrated in their fields, such as <a href="Albert%20Sammons">Albert Sammons</a>, <a href="Lionel%20Tertis">Lionel Tertis</a>, <a href="Eric%20Coates">Eric Coates</a> and <a href="Eugene%20Cruft">Eugene Cruft</a>.

Because he persistently programmed works that did not attract the public, Beecham's musical activities at this time consistently lost money. As a result of his estrangement from his father between 1899 and 1909, his access to the Beecham family fortune was strictly limited. From 1907 he had an annuity of £700 left to him in his grandfather's will, and his mother subsidised some of his loss-making concerts, but it was not until father and son were reconciled in 1909 that Beecham was able to draw on the family fortune to promote opera.

From 1910, subsidised by his father, Beecham realised his ambition to mount opera seasons at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> and other houses. In the <a href="Edwardian%20era">Edwardian</a> opera house, the star singers were regarded as all-important, and conductors were seen as ancillary. Between 1910 and 1939 Beecham did much to change the balance of power.
In 1910, Beecham either conducted or was responsible as <a href="impresario">impresario</a> for 190 performances at Covent Garden and <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">His Majesty's Theatre</a>. His assistant conductors were <a href="Bruno%20Walter">Bruno Walter</a> and <a href="Percy%20Pitt">Percy Pitt</a>. During the year, he mounted 34 different operas, most of them either new to London or almost unknown there. Beecham later acknowledged that in his early years the operas he chose to present were too obscure to attract the public. During his 1910 season at His Majesty's, the rival Grand Opera Syndicate put on a concurrent season of its own at Covent Garden; London's total opera performances for the year amounted to 273 performances, far more than the box-office demand could support. Of the 34 operas that Beecham staged in 1910, only four made money: <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s new operas "<a href="Elektra%20%28opera%29">Elektra</a>" and "<a href="Salome%20%28opera%29">Salome</a>," receiving their first, and highly publicised, performances in Britain, and "<a href="The%20Tales%20of%20Hoffmann">The Tales of Hoffmann</a>" and "<a href="Die%20Fledermaus">Die Fledermaus</a>".

In 1911 and 1912, the Beecham Symphony Orchestra played for <a href="Sergei%20Diaghilev">Sergei Diaghilev</a>'s <a href="Ballets%20Russes">Ballets Russes</a>, both at Covent Garden and at the <a href="Kroll%20Opera%20House">Krolloper</a> in Berlin, under the batons of Beecham and <a href="Pierre%20Monteux">Pierre Monteux</a>, Diaghilev's chief conductor. Beecham was much admired for conducting the complicated new score of <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Stravinsky</a>'s "<a href="Petrushka">Petrushka</a>", at two days' notice and without rehearsal, when Monteux became unavailable. While in Berlin, Beecham and his orchestra, in Beecham's words, caused a "mild stir", scoring a triumph: the orchestra was agreed by the Berlin press to be an elite body, one of the best in the world. The principal Berlin musical weekly, "Die Signale", asked, "Where does London find such magnificent young instrumentalists?" The violins were credited with rich, noble tone, the <a href="woodwind">woodwind</a>s with lustre, the brass, "which has not quite the dignity and amplitude of our best German brass", with uncommon delicacy of execution.
Beecham's 1913 seasons included the British premiere of Strauss's "<a href="Der%20Rosenkavalier">Der Rosenkavalier</a>" at Covent Garden, and a "Grand Season of Russian Opera and Ballet" at <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>. At the latter there were three operas, all starring <a href="Feodor%20Chaliapin">Feodor Chaliapin</a>, and all new to Britain: <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Mussorgsky</a>'s "<a href="Boris%20Godunov%20%28opera%29">Boris Godunov</a>" and "<a href="Khovanshchina">Khovanshchina</a>", and <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a>'s <a href="The%20Maid%20of%20Pskov">"Ivan the Terrible"</a>. There were also 15 ballets, with leading dancers including <a href="Vaslav%20Nijinsky">Vaslav Nijinsky</a> and <a href="Tamara%20Karsavina">Tamara Karsavina</a>. The ballets included <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>'s "<a href="Jeux">Jeux</a>" and his controversially erotic "<a href="Afternoon%20of%20a%20Faun%20%28Nijinsky%29">L'après-midi d'un faune</a>," and the British premiere of Stravinsky's "<a href="The%20Rite%20of%20Spring">The Rite of Spring</a>," six weeks after its first performance in Paris. Beecham shared Monteux's private dislike of the piece, much preferring "Petrushka". Beecham did not conduct during this season; Monteux and others conducted the Beecham Symphony Orchestra. The following year, Beecham and his father presented Rimsky-Korsakov's "<a href="The%20Maid%20of%20Pskov">The Maid of Pskov</a>" and <a href="Alexander%20Borodin">Borodin</a>'s "<a href="Prince%20Igor">Prince Igor</a>", with Chaliapin, and Stravinsky's "<a href="The%20Nightingale%20%28opera%29">The Nightingale</a>."

During the First World War, Beecham strove, often without a fee, to keep music alive in London, Liverpool, Manchester and other British cities. He conducted for, and gave financial support to, three institutions with which he was connected at various times: the Hallé Orchestra, the LSO and the Royal Philharmonic Society. In 1915 he formed the <a href="Beecham%20opera%20company">Beecham Opera Company</a>, with mainly British singers, performing in London and throughout the country. In 1916, he received a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a> in the <a href="1916%20New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a> and succeeded to the <a href="baronet">baronet</a>cy on his father's death later that year.

After the war, there were joint Covent Garden seasons with the Grand Opera Syndicate in 1919 and 1920, but these were, according to a biographer, pale confused echoes of the years before 1914. These seasons included forty productions, of which Beecham conducted only nine. After the 1920 season, Beecham temporarily withdrew from conducting to deal with a financial problem that he described as "the most trying and unpleasant experience of my life".

Influenced by an ambitious financier, <a href="James%20White%20%28financier%29">James White</a>, Sir Joseph Beecham had agreed, in July 1914, to buy the Covent Garden estate from the <a href="Herbrand%20Russell%2C%2011th%20Duke%20of%20Bedford">Duke of Bedford</a> and float a <a href="limited%20company">limited company</a> to manage the estate commercially. The deal was described by "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" as "one of the largest ever carried out in real estate in London". Sir Joseph paid an initial deposit of £200,000 and covenanted to pay the balance of the £2 million purchase price on 11 November. Within a month, however, the First World War broke out, and new official restrictions on the use of capital prevented the completion of the contract. The estate and market continued to be managed by the Duke's staff, and in October 1916, Joseph Beecham died suddenly, with the transaction still uncompleted. The matter was brought before the civil courts with the aim of disentangling Sir Joseph's affairs; the court and all parties agreed that a private company should be formed, with his two sons as directors, to complete the Covent Garden contract. In July 1918, the Duke and his trustees conveyed the estate to the new company, subject to a mortgage of the balance of the purchase price still outstanding: £1.25 million.

Beecham and his brother Henry had to sell enough of their father's estate to discharge this mortgage. For more than three years, Beecham was absent from the musical scene, working to sell property worth over £1 million. By 1923 enough money had been raised. The mortgage was discharged, and Beecham's personal liabilities, amounting to £41,558, were paid in full. In 1924 the Covent Garden property and the pill-making business at St Helens were united in one company, Beecham Estates and Pills. The nominal capital was £1,850,000, of which Beecham had a substantial share.

After his absence, Beecham first reappeared on the rostrum conducting the Hallé in Manchester in March 1923, in a programme including works by <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>, <a href="Georges%20Bizet">Bizet</a>, Delius and <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>. He returned to London the following month, conducting the combined Royal Albert Hall Orchestra (the renamed New Symphony Orchestra) and London Symphony Orchestra in April 1923. The main work on the programme was Richard Strauss's "<a href="Ein%20Heldenleben">Ein Heldenleben</a>". No longer with an orchestra of his own, Beecham established a relationship with the London Symphony Orchestra that lasted for the rest of the 1920s. Towards the end of the decade, he negotiated inconclusively with the BBC over the possibility of establishing a permanent radio orchestra.

In 1931, Beecham was approached by the rising young conductor <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a> with a proposal to set up a permanent, salaried orchestra with a subsidy guaranteed by Sargent's patrons, the Courtauld family. Originally Sargent and Beecham envisaged a reshuffled version of the London Symphony Orchestra, but the LSO, a self-governing co-operative, balked at weeding out and replacing underperforming players. In 1932 Beecham lost patience and agreed with Sargent to set up a new orchestra from scratch. The <a href="London%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">London Philharmonic Orchestra</a> (LPO), as it was named, consisted of 106 players including a few young musicians straight from music college, many established players from provincial orchestras, and 17 of the LSO's leading members. The principals included <a href="Paul%20Beard%20%28violinist%29">Paul Beard</a>, George Stratton, <a href="Anthony%20Pini">Anthony Pini</a>, <a href="Gerald%20Jackson">Gerald Jackson</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9on%20Goossens">Léon Goossens</a>, <a href="Reginald%20Kell">Reginald Kell</a>, James Bradshaw and Marie Goossens.
The orchestra made its debut at the Queen's Hall on 7 October 1932, conducted by Beecham. After the first item, Berlioz's "<a href="Overtures%20by%20Hector%20Berlioz%23Le%20carnaval%20romain">Roman Carnival Overture</a>", the audience went wild, some of them standing on their seats to clap and shout. During the next eight years, the LPO appeared nearly a hundred times at the Queen's Hall for the Royal Philharmonic Society alone, played for Beecham's opera seasons at Covent Garden, and made more than 300 gramophone records. <a href="Berta%20Geissmar">Berta Geissmar</a>, his secretary from 1936, wrote, "The relations between the Orchestra and Sir Thomas were always easy and cordial. He always treated a rehearsal as a joint undertaking with the Orchestra.… The musicians were entirely unselfconscious with him. Instinctively they accorded him the artistic authority which he did not expressly claim. Thus he obtained the best from them and they gave it without reserve."

By the early 1930s, Beecham had secured substantial control of the Covent Garden opera seasons. Wishing to concentrate on music-making rather than management, he assumed the role of artistic director, and <a href="Geoffrey%20Toye">Geoffrey Toye</a> was recruited as managing director. In 1933, "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>" with <a href="Frida%20Leider">Frida Leider</a> and <a href="Lauritz%20Melchior">Lauritz Melchior</a> was a success, and the season continued with the "<a href="Der%20Ring%20des%20Nibelungen">Ring</a>" cycle and nine other operas. The 1934 season featured <a href="Conchita%20Superv%C3%ADa">Conchita Supervía</a> in "<a href="La%20Cenerentola">La Cenerentola</a>," and <a href="Lotte%20Lehmann">Lotte Lehmann</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Kipnis">Alexander Kipnis</a> in the "Ring". <a href="Clemens%20Krauss">Clemens Krauss</a> conducted the British première of Strauss's "<a href="Arabella">Arabella</a>". During 1933 and 1934, Beecham repelled attempts by <a href="John%20Christie%20%28opera%20manager%29">John Christie</a> to form a link between Christie's new <a href="Glyndebourne%20Festival%20Opera">Glyndebourne Festival</a> and the Royal Opera House. Beecham and Toye fell out over the latter's insistence on bringing in a popular film star, <a href="Grace%20Moore">Grace Moore</a>, to sing Mimi in "<a href="La%20boh%C3%A8me">La bohème</a>". The production was a box-office success, but an artistic failure. Beecham manoeuvred Toye out of the managing directorship in what their fellow conductor <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> described as an "absolutely beastly" manner.

From 1935 to 1939, Beecham, now in sole control, presented international seasons with eminent guest singers and conductors. Beecham conducted between a third and half of the performances each season. He intended the 1940 season to include the first complete performances of Berlioz's "<a href="Les%20Troyens">Les Troyens</a>", but the outbreak of the Second World War caused the season to be abandoned. Beecham did not conduct again at Covent Garden until 1951, and by then it was no longer under his control.

Beecham took the London Philharmonic on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. There were complaints that he was being used by <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> propagandists, and Beecham complied with a Nazi request not to play the "Scottish" Symphony of <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, who was a Christian by faith but a Jew by birth. In Berlin, Beecham's concert was attended by <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, whose lack of punctuality caused Beecham to remark very audibly, "The old bugger's late." After this tour, Beecham refused renewed invitations to give concerts in Germany, although he honoured contractual commitments to conduct at the <a href="Berlin%20State%20Opera">Berlin State Opera</a>, in 1937 and 1938, and recorded "The Magic Flute" for <a href="EMI%20Records">EMI</a> in the Beethovensaal in Berlin in the same years.

As his sixtieth birthday approached, Beecham was advised by his doctors to take a year's complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate. The <a href="Australian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Australian Broadcasting Commission</a> had been seeking for several years to get him to conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.

Beecham left Britain in the spring of 1940, going first to Australia and then to North America. He became music director of the <a href="Seattle%20Symphony">Seattle Symphony</a> in 1941. In 1942 he joined the <a href="Metropolitan%20Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a> as joint senior conductor with his former assistant Bruno Walter. He began with his own adaptation of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach's</a> comic cantata, "Phoebus and Pan", followed by "<a href="The%20Golden%20Cockerel">Le Coq d'Or</a>". His main repertoire was French: "Carmen, Louise" (with Grace Moore), "Manon", "<a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>", "<a href="Mignon">Mignon</a>" and "The Tales of Hoffmann". In addition to his Seattle and New York posts, Beecham was guest conductor with 18 American orchestras.

In 1944, Beecham returned to Britain. Musically his reunion with the London Philharmonic was triumphant, but the orchestra, now (after his help in 1939) a self-governing <a href="cooperative">co-operative</a>, attempted to hire him on its own terms as its salaried artistic director. "I emphatically refuse", concluded Beecham, "to be wagged by any orchestra ... I am going to found one more great orchestra to round off my career." When <a href="Walter%20Legge">Walter Legge</a> founded the <a href="Philharmonia%20Orchestra">Philharmonia Orchestra</a> in 1945, Beecham conducted its first concert. But he was not disposed to accept a salaried position from Legge, his former assistant, any more than from his former players in the LPO.

In 1946, Beecham founded the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Royal Philharmonic Orchestra</a> (RPO), securing an agreement with the Royal Philharmonic Society that the new orchestra should replace the LPO at all the Society's concerts. Beecham later agreed with the Glyndebourne Festival that the RPO should be the resident orchestra at Glyndebourne each summer. He secured backing, including that of record companies in the US as well as Britain, with whom lucrative recording contracts were negotiated. As in 1909 and in 1932, Beecham's assistants recruited in the freelance pool and elsewhere. Original members of the RPO included James Bradshaw, <a href="Dennis%20Brain">Dennis Brain</a>, Leonard Brain, <a href="Archie%20Camden">Archie Camden</a>, Gerald Jackson and Reginald Kell. The orchestra later became celebrated for its regular team of woodwind principals, often referred to as "The Royal Family", consisting of <a href="Jack%20Brymer">Jack Brymer</a> (clarinet), <a href="Gwydion%20Brooke">Gwydion Brooke</a> (bassoon), <a href="Terence%20MacDonagh">Terence MacDonagh</a> (oboe) and Gerald Jackson (flute).

Beecham's long association with the Hallé Orchestra as a guest conductor ceased after <a href="John%20Barbirolli">John Barbirolli</a> became the orchestra's chief conductor in 1944. Beecham was, to his great indignation, ousted from the honorary presidency of the Hallé Concerts Society, and Barbirolli refused to "let that man near my orchestra". Beecham's relationship with the Liverpool Philharmonic, which he had first conducted in 1911, was resumed harmoniously after the war. A manager of the orchestra recalled, "It was an unwritten law in Liverpool that first choice of dates offered to guest conductors was given to Beecham. ... In Liverpool there was one over-riding factor – he was adored."

Beecham, whom the BBC called "Britain's first international conductor", took the RPO on a strenuous tour through the United States, Canada and South Africa in 1950. During the North American tour, Beecham conducted 49 concerts in almost daily succession. In 1951, he was invited to conduct at Covent Garden after a 12-year absence. State-funded for the first time, the opera company operated quite differently from his pre-war regime. Instead of short, star-studded seasons, with a major symphony orchestra, the new director <a href="David%20Webster%20%28opera%20manager%29">David Webster</a> was attempting to build up a permanent ensemble of home-grown talent performing all the year round, in English translations. Extreme economy in productions and great attention to the box-office were essential, and Beecham, though he had been hurt and furious at his exclusion, was not suited to participate in such an undertaking. When offered a chorus of eighty singers for his return, conducting "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Die Meistersinger</a>", he insisted on augmenting their number to 200. He also, contrary to Webster's policy, insisted on performing the piece in German. In 1953 at <a href="Oxford">Oxford</a>, Beecham presented the world premiere of Delius's first opera, "Irmelin," and his last operatic performances in Britain were in 1955 at <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, with <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Gr%C3%A9try">Grétry</a>'s "Zémire et Azor".

Between 1951 and 1960, Beecham conducted 92 concerts at the <a href="Royal%20Festival%20Hall">Royal Festival Hall</a>. Characteristic Beecham programmes of the RPO years included symphonies by Bizet, <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">Franck</a>, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a> and <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a>; Richard Strauss's "Ein Heldenleben"; concertos by Mozart and <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Saint-Saëns</a>; a Delius and <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a> programme; and many of his favoured shorter pieces. He did not stick uncompromisingly to his familiar repertoire. After the sudden death of the German conductor <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a>, Beecham in tribute conducted the two programmes his colleague had been due to present at the Festival Hall; these included Bach's <a href="Brandenburg%20concertos">Third Brandenburg Concerto</a>, <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>'s "<a href="Rapsodie%20espagnole">Rapsodie espagnole</a>", <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Brahms%29">Symphony No. 1</a>, and <a href="Samuel%20Barber">Barber</a>'s "Second Essay for Orchestra".
In the summer of 1958, Beecham conducted a season at the <a href="Teatro%20Col%C3%B3n">Teatro Colón</a>, <a href="Buenos%20Aires">Buenos Aires</a>, Argentina, consisting of Verdi's "<a href="Otello">Otello</a>," Bizet's "Carmen", Beethoven's "<a href="Fidelio">Fidelio</a>," Saint-Saëns's "<a href="Samson%20and%20Delilah%20%28opera%29">Samson and Delilah</a>" and Mozart's "The Magic Flute". These were his last operatic performances. It was during this season that Betty Humby died suddenly. She was cremated in Buenos Aires and her ashes returned to England. Beecham's own last illness prevented his operatic debut at Glyndebourne in a planned "Magic Flute" and a final appearance at Covent Garden conducting Berlioz's "The Trojans".

Sixty-six years after his first visit to America, Beecham made his last, beginning in late 1959, conducting in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Seattle, Chicago and Washington. During this tour, he also conducted in Canada. He flew back to London on 12 April 1960 and did not leave England again. His final concert was at <a href="Portsmouth%20Guildhall">Portsmouth Guildhall</a> on 7 May 1960. The programme, all characteristic choices, comprised the "Magic Flute" Overture, Haydn's <a href="Symphony%20No.%20100%20%28Haydn%29">Symphony No. 100</a> (the "Military"), Beecham's own Handel arrangement, "Love in Bath", Schubert's <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Schubert%29">Symphony No. 5</a>, "On the River" by Delius, and the "Bacchanale" from "Samson and Delilah".

Beecham died of a <a href="coronary%20thrombosis">coronary thrombosis</a> at his London flat, aged 81, on 8 March 1961. He was buried two days later in <a href="Brookwood%20Cemetery">Brookwood Cemetery</a>, Surrey. Owing to changes at Brookwood, his remains were exhumed in 1991 and reburied in St Peter's Churchyard at <a href="Limpsfield">Limpsfield</a>, Surrey, close to the joint grave of Delius and his wife <a href="Jelka%20Rosen">Jelka Rosen</a>.

Beecham was married three times. In 1903 he married Utica Celestina Welles, daughter of Dr Charles S. Welles, of New York, and his wife Ella Celeste, "née" Miles. Beecham and his wife had two sons: Adrian, born in 1904, who became a composer and achieved some celebrity in the 1920s and 1930s, and Thomas, born in 1909. After the birth of his second child, Beecham began to drift away from the marriage. By 1911, no longer living with his wife and family, he was involved as co-respondent in a much-publicised divorce case. Utica ignored advice that she should divorce him and secure substantial alimony; she did not believe in divorce. She never remarried after Beecham divorced her (in 1943), and she outlived her former husband by sixteen years, dying in 1977.

In 1909 or early 1910, Beecham began an affair with Maud Alice (known as Emerald), <a href="Maud%20Cunard">Lady Cunard</a>. Although they never lived together, it continued, despite other relationships on his part, until his remarriage in 1943. She was a tireless fund-raiser for his musical enterprises. Beecham's biographers are agreed that she was in love with him, but that his feelings for her were less strong. During the 1920s and 1930s, Beecham also had an affair with <a href="Dora%20Labbette">Dora Labbette</a>, a soprano sometimes known as Lisa Perli, with whom he had a son, Paul Strang, born in March 1933.

In 1943 Lady Cunard was devastated to learn (not from Beecham) that he intended to divorce Utica to marry <a href="Betty%20Humby%20Beecham">Betty Humby</a>, a concert pianist 29 years his junior. Beecham married Betty in 1943, and they were a devoted couple until her death in 1958. On 10 August 1959, two years before his death, he married in Zurich his former secretary, Shirley Hudson, who had worked for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra's administration since 1950. She was 27, he 80.

The earliest composer whose music Beecham regularly performed was <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>, whom he called, "the great international master of all time. ... He wrote Italian music better than any Italian; French music better than any Frenchman; English music better than any Englishman; and, with the exception of Bach, outrivalled all other Germans." In his performances of Handel, Beecham ignored what he called the "professors, pedants, pedagogues". He followed Mendelssohn and Mozart in editing and reorchestrating Handel's scores to suit contemporary tastes. At a time when Handel's operas were scarcely known, Beecham knew them so well that he was able to arrange three ballets, two other suites and a piano concerto from them. He gave Handel's oratorio "<a href="Solomon%20%28Handel%29">Solomon</a>" its first performance since the 18th century, with a text edited by the conductor.

With Haydn, too, Beecham was far from an authenticist, using unscholarly 19th-century versions of the scores, avoiding the use of the <a href="harpsichord">harpsichord</a>, and phrasing the music romantically. He recorded the twelve "<a href="London%20symphonies">London</a>" symphonies, and regularly programmed some of them in his concerts. Earlier Haydn works were unfamiliar in the first half of the 20th century, but Beecham conducted several of them, including the <a href="Symphony%20No.%2040%20%28Joseph%20Haydn%29">Symphony No. 40</a> and an early piano concerto. He programmed "<a href="The%20Seasons%20%28Haydn%29">The Seasons</a>" regularly throughout his career, recording it for <a href="EMI">EMI</a> in 1956, and in 1944 added "<a href="The%20Creation%20%28Haydn%29">The Creation</a>" to his repertoire.

For Beecham, Mozart was "the central point of European music," and he treated the composer's scores with more deference than he gave most others. He edited the incomplete <a href="Requiem%20%28Mozart%29">Requiem</a>, made English translations of at least two of the great operas, and introduced Covent Garden audiences who had rarely if ever heard them to "<a href="Cos%C3%AC%20fan%20tutte">Così fan tutte</a>", "<a href="Der%20Schauspieldirektor">Der Schauspieldirektor</a>" and "<a href="Die%20Entf%C3%BChrung%20aus%20dem%20Serail">Die Entführung aus dem Serail</a>"; he also regularly programmed "<a href="The%20Magic%20Flute">The Magic Flute</a>", "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>" and "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>". He considered the best of Mozart's piano concertos to be "the most beautiful compositions of their kind in the world", and he played them many times with Betty Humby-Beecham and others.

Beecham's attitude towards 19th-century German repertoire was equivocal. He frequently disparaged Beethoven, Wagner and others, but regularly conducted their works, often with great success. He observed, "Wagner, though a tremendous genius, gorged music like a German who overeats. And <a href="Anton%20Bruckner">Bruckner</a> was a hobbledehoy who had no style at all ... Even Beethoven thumped the tub; the <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Beethoven%29">Ninth symphony</a> was composed by a kind of Mr. <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">Gladstone</a> of music." Despite his criticisms, Beecham conducted all the Beethoven symphonies during his career, and he made studio recordings of Nos. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 8, and live recordings of No. 9 and "<a href="Missa%20Solemnis%20%28Beethoven%29">Missa Solemnis</a>". He conducted the <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%204%20%28Beethoven%29">Fourth Piano Concerto</a> with pleasure (recording it with <a href="Arthur%20Rubinstein">Arthur Rubinstein</a> and the LPO) but avoided the "<a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%205%20%28Beethoven%29">Emperor Concerto</a>" when possible.

Beecham was not known for his Bach but nonetheless chose Bach (arranged by Beecham) for his debut at the Metropolitan Opera. He later gave the Third <a href="Brandenburg%20concertos">Brandenburg Concerto</a> in one of his memorial concerts for Wilhelm Furtwängler (a performance described by "The Times" as "a travesty, albeit an invigorating one"). In Brahms's music, Beecham was selective. He made a speciality of the <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Brahms%29">Second Symphony</a> but conducted the <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Brahms%29">Third</a> only occasionally, the First rarely, and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Brahms%29">Fourth</a> never. In his memoirs he made no mention of any Brahms performance after the year 1909.

Beecham was a great <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagnerian</a>, despite his frequent expostulation about the composer's length and repetitiousness: "We've been rehearsing for two hours – and we're still playing the same bloody tune!" Beecham conducted all the works in the regular Wagner canon with the exception of "<a href="Parsifal">Parsifal</a>", which he presented at Covent Garden but never with himself in the pit. The chief music critic of "The Times" observed: "Beecham's "<a href="Lohengrin%20%28opera%29">Lohengrin</a>" was almost Italian in its lyricism; his "Ring" was less heroic than Bruno Walter's or Furtwängler's, but it sang from beginning to end".

Richard Strauss had a lifelong champion in Beecham, who introduced "Elektra", "Salome", "Der Rosenkavalier" and other operas to England. Beecham programmed "Ein Heldenleben" from 1910 until his last year; his final recording of it was released shortly after his death. "<a href="Don%20Quixote%20%28Strauss%29">Don Quixote</a>, <a href="Till%20Eulenspiegel%27s%20Merry%20Pranks">Till Eulenspiegel</a>", the "Bourgeois Gentilhomme" music and "<a href="Don%20Juan%20%28Strauss%29">Don Juan</a>" also featured in his repertory, but not "<a href="Also%20sprach%20Zarathustra%20%28Strauss%29">Also Sprach Zarathustra</a>" or "<a href="Death%20and%20Transfiguration">Tod und Verklärung</a>". Strauss had the first and last pages of the manuscript of "Elektra" framed and presented them to "my highly honoured friend ... and distinguished conductor of my work."

In the opinion of the jury of the Académie du Disque Français, "Sir Thomas Beecham has done more for French music abroad than any French conductor". Berlioz featured prominently in Beecham's repertoire throughout his career, and in an age when the composer's works received little exposure, Beecham presented most of them and recorded many. Along with <a href="Colin%20Davis">Sir Colin Davis</a>, Beecham has been described as one of the two "foremost modern interpreters" of Berlioz's music. Both in concert and the recording studio, Beecham's choices of French music were characteristically eclectic. He avoided Ravel but regularly programmed Debussy. <a href="Gabriel%20Faur%C3%A9">Fauré</a> did not feature often, although his orchestral "<a href="Pavane%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Pavane</a>" was an exception; Beecham's final recording sessions in 1959 included the "Pavane" and the "<a href="Dolly%20%28Faur%C3%A9%29">Dolly Suite</a>". Bizet was among Beecham's favourites, and other French composers favoured by him included <a href="Gustave%20Charpentier">Gustave Charpentier</a>, <a href="L%C3%A9o%20Delibes">Delibes</a>, <a href="Henri%20Duparc%20%28composer%29">Duparc</a>, Grétry, Lalo, <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Lully">Lully</a>, Offenbach, Saint-Saëns and <a href="Ambroise%20Thomas">Ambroise Thomas</a>. Many of Beecham's later recordings of French music were made in Paris with the <a href="Orchestre%20National%20de%20France">Orchestre National de la Radiodiffusion Française</a>. ""C'est un dieu"", their concertmaster said of Beecham in 1957.

Of the more than two dozen operas in the <a href="Verdi">Verdi</a> canon, Beecham conducted eight during his long career: "<a href="Il%20trovatore">Il trovatore</a>", "<a href="La%20traviata">La traviata</a>", "<a href="Aida">Aida</a>", "<a href="Don%20Carlos">Don Carlos</a>", "<a href="Rigoletto">Rigoletto</a>", "<a href="Un%20ballo%20in%20maschera">Un ballo in maschera</a>", "Otello" and "<a href="Falstaff%20%28opera%29">Falstaff</a>". As early as 1904, Beecham met <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Puccini</a> through the librettist <a href="Luigi%20Illica">Luigi Illica</a>, who had written the libretto for Beecham's youthful attempt at composing an Italian opera. At the time of their meeting, Puccini and Illica were revising "<a href="Madama%20Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a>" after its disastrous première. Beecham rarely conducted that work, but he conducted "<a href="Tosca">Tosca</a>", "<a href="Turandot">Turandot</a>" and "La bohème". His 1956 recording of "La bohème", with <a href="Victoria%20de%20los%20%C3%81ngeles">Victoria de los Ángeles</a> and <a href="Jussi%20Bj%C3%B6rling">Jussi Björling</a>, has seldom been out of the catalogues since its release and received more votes than any other operatic set in a 1967 symposium of prominent critics.

Except for Delius, Beecham was generally antipathetic to, or at best lukewarm about, the music of his native land and its leading composers. Beecham's championship of Delius, however, promoted the composer from relative obscurity. Delius's <a href="amanuensis">amanuensis</a>, <a href="Eric%20Fenby">Eric Fenby</a>, referred to Beecham as "excelling all others in the music of Delius ... <a href="Charles%20Groves">Groves</a> and Sargent may have matched him in the great choruses of "<a href="A%20Mass%20of%20Life">A Mass of Life</a>", but in all else Beecham was matchless, especially with the orchestra." In an all-Delius concert in June 1911 Beecham conducted the premiere of "<a href="Songs%20of%20Sunset">Songs of Sunset</a>". He put on Delius Festivals in 1929 and 1946 and presented his concert works throughout his career. He conducted the British premieres of the operas "<a href="A%20Village%20Romeo%20and%20Juliet">A Village Romeo and Juliet</a>" in 1910 and "<a href="Koanga">Koanga</a>" in 1935, and the world premiere of "Irmelin" in 1953. However, he was not an uncritical Delian: he never conducted the <a href="Requiem%20%28Delius%29">"Requiem"</a>, and he detailed his criticisms of it in his book on Delius.

Another major 20th-century composer who engaged Beecham's sympathies was Sibelius, who recognised him as a fine conductor of his music (although Sibelius tended to be lavish with praise of anybody who conducted his music). In a live recording of a December 1954 concert performance of Sibelius's <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Sibelius%29">Second Symphony</a> with the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a> in the Festival Hall, Beecham can be heard uttering encouraging shouts at the orchestra at climactic moments.

Beecham was dismissive of some of the established classics, saying for example, "I would give the whole of Bach's "Brandenburg Concertos" for <a href="Jules%20Massenet">Massenet</a>'s "<a href="Manon">Manon</a>", and would think I had vastly profited by the exchange". He was, by contrast, famous for presenting slight pieces as encores, which he called "lollipops". Some of the best-known were Berlioz's "Danse des sylphes"; <a href="Emmanuel%20Chabrier">Chabrier</a>'s "<a href="Joyeuse%20Marche">Joyeuse Marche</a>" and <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a>'s "Le Sommeil de Juliette".

The composer <a href="Richard%20Arnell">Richard Arnell</a> wrote that Beecham preferred making records to giving concerts: "He told me that audiences got in the way of music-making – he was apt to catch someone's eye in the front row." The conductor and critic Trevor Harvey wrote in "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">The Gramophone</a>", however, that studio recordings could never recapture the thrill of Beecham performing live in the concert hall.
Beecham began making recordings in 1910, when the acoustical process obliged orchestras to use only principal instruments, placed as close to the recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for <a href="The%20Gramophone%20Company">HMV</a>, were of excerpts from <a href="Jacques%20Offenbach">Offenbach</a>'s "The Tales of Hoffmann" and <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20II">Johann Strauss</a>'s "Die Fledermaus". In 1915, Beecham began recording for the <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia Graphophone Company</a>. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925–26) made it possible to record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had to be broken into four-minute segments to fit on 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemeal – his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier's "<a href="Espa%C3%B1a%20%28Chabrier%29">España</a>" was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart. Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.

From 1926 to 1932, Beecham made more than 70 discs, including an English version of Gounod's "Faust" and the first of three recordings of Handel's "<a href="Messiah%20%28Handel%29">Messiah</a>". He began recording with the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1933, making more than 150 discs for Columbia, including music by Mozart, Rossini, Berlioz, Wagner, Handel, Beethoven, Brahms, Debussy and Delius. Among the most prominent of his pre-war recordings was the first complete recording of Mozart's "The Magic Flute" with the <a href="Berlin%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, made for <a href="The%20Gramophone%20Company">HMV</a> and supervised by Walter Legge in Berlin in 1937–38, a set described by <a href="Alan%20Blyth">Alan Blyth</a> in "Gramophone" magazine in 2006 as having "a legendary status". In 1936, during his German tour with the LPO, Beecham conducted the world's first orchestral recording on magnetic tape, made at <a href="Ludwigshafen">Ludwigshafen</a>, the home of <a href="BASF">BASF</a>, the company that developed the process.

During his stay in the US and afterwards, Beecham recorded for American <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia</a> Records and <a href="RCA%20Victor">RCA Victor</a>. His RCA recordings include major works that he did not subsequently re-record for the gramophone, including <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's Fourth</a>, <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Sibelius%29">Sibelius's Sixth</a> and Mendelssohn's <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Reformation</a> Symphonies. Some of his RCA recordings were issued only in the US, including Mozart's <a href="Symphony%20No.%2027%20%28Mozart%29">Symphony No. 27</a>, K199, the overtures to Smetana's "The Bartered Bride" and Mozart's "<a href="La%20clemenza%20di%20Tito">La clemenza di Tito</a>", the Sinfonia from Bach's "<a href="Christmas%20Oratorio">Christmas Oratorio</a>", a 1947–48 complete recording of Gounod's "Faust", and an RPO studio version of Sibelius's Second Symphony. Beecham's RCA records that were released on both sides of the Atlantic were his celebrated 1956 complete recording of Puccini's "La bohème" and an extravagantly rescored set of Handel's "Messiah". The former remains a top recommendation among reviewers, and the latter was described by "Gramophone" as "an irresistible outrage … huge fun".

For the Columbia label, Beecham recorded his last, or only, versions of many works by Delius, including "A Mass of Life", "Appalachia", "North Country Sketches", "An Arabesque", "Paris" and "<a href="Eventyr%20%28Once%20Upon%20a%20Time%29">Eventyr</a>". Other Columbia recordings from the early 1950s include Beethoven's "<a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Beethoven%29">Eroica</a>", "<a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Beethoven%29">Pastoral</a>" and <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Beethoven%29">Eighth</a> symphonies, Mendelssohn's "<a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Italian</a>" symphony, and the Brahms <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Brahms%29">Violin Concerto</a> with <a href="Isaac%20Stern">Isaac Stern</a>.

From his return to England at the end of the Second World War until his final recordings in 1959, Beecham continued his early association with HMV and British Columbia, who had merged to form EMI. From 1955, his EMI recordings made in London were recorded in stereo. He also recorded in Paris, with his own RPO and with the <a href="Orchestre%20National%20de%20France">Orchestra National de la Radiodiffusion Française</a>, though the Paris recordings were in mono until 1958. For EMI, Beecham recorded two complete operas in stereo, "Die Entführung aus dem Serail" and "Carmen". His last recordings were made in Paris in December 1959. Beecham's EMI recordings have been continually reissued on LP and CD. In 2011, to mark the 50th anniversary of Beecham's death, EMI released 34 CDs of his recordings of music from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, including works by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms, Wagner, Richard Strauss and Delius, and many of the French "lollipops" with which he was associated.

Beecham's relations with fellow British conductors were not always cordial. <a href="Sir%20Henry%20Wood">Sir Henry Wood</a> regarded him as an upstart and was envious of his success; the scrupulous <a href="Sir%20Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> found him "repulsive" as a man and a musician; and <a href="Sir%20John%20Barbirolli">Sir John Barbirolli</a> mistrusted him. <a href="Sir%20Malcolm%20Sargent">Sir Malcolm Sargent</a> worked with him in founding the London Philharmonic and was a friend and ally, but he was the subject of unkind, though witty, digs from Beecham who, for example, described the image-conscious <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a> as "a kind of musical Malcolm Sargent". Beecham's relations with foreign conductors were often excellent. He did not get on well with <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>, but he liked and encouraged <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a>, admired <a href="Pierre%20Monteux">Pierre Monteux</a>, fostered <a href="Rudolf%20Kempe">Rudolf Kempe</a> as his successor with the RPO, and was admired by <a href="Fritz%20Reiner">Fritz Reiner</a>, <a href="Otto%20Klemperer">Otto Klemperer</a> and <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a>.

Despite his lordly drawl, Beecham remained a Lancastrian at heart. "In "my" county, where "I" come from, we're all a bit vulgar, you know, but there is a certain heartiness – a sort of bonhomie about our vulgarity – which tides you over a lot of rough spots in the path. But in "Yorkshire", in a spot of bother, they're so damn-set-in-their-ways that there's no doing anything with them!"

Beecham has been much quoted. In 1929, the editor of a music journal wrote, "The stories gathered around Sir Thomas Beecham are innumerable. Wherever musicians come together, he is likely to be one of the topics of conversation. Everyone telling a Beecham story tries to imitate his manner and his tone of voice." A book, "Beecham Stories", was published in 1978 consisting entirely of his "bons mots" and anecdotes about him. Some are variously attributed to Beecham or one or more other people, including <a href="Arnold%20Bax">Arnold Bax</a> and <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>; <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> admitted to inventing some himself. Among the Beecham lines that are reliably attributed are, "A musicologist is a man who can read music but can't hear it"; his maxim, "There are only two things requisite so far as the public is concerned for a good performance: that is for the orchestra to begin together and end together; in between it doesn't matter much"; and his remark at his 70th birthday celebrations after telegrams were read out from Strauss, Stravinsky and Sibelius: "Nothing from Mozart?"

He was completely indifferent to mundane tasks such as correspondence, and was less than responsible with the property of others. On one occasion, during bankruptcy proceedings, two thousand unopened letters were discovered among his papers. <a href="Havergal%20Brian">Havergal Brian</a> sent him three scores with a view to having them performed. One of them, the "Second English Suite", was never returned and is now considered lost.

Beecham was knighted in 1916 and succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father later that year. In 1938 the President of France, <a href="Albert%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Lebrun">Albert Lebrun</a>, invested him with the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Légion d'honneur</a>. In 1955, Beecham was presented with the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20White%20Rose%20of%20Finland">Order of the White Rose of Finland</a>. He was a Commendatore of the Order of the Crown of Italy and was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> in the 1957 <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a>. He was an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Music">Doctor of Music</a> of the universities of Oxford, <a href="University%20of%20London">London</a>, <a href="University%20of%20Manchester">Manchester</a> and <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al">Montreal</a>.

"Beecham", by <a href="Caryl%20Brahms">Caryl Brahms</a> and <a href="Ned%20Sherrin">Ned Sherrin</a>, is a play celebrating the conductor and drawing on a large number of Beecham stories for its material. Its first production, in 1979, starred <a href="Timothy%20West">Timothy West</a> in the title role. It was later adapted for television, starring West, with members of the Hallé Orchestra taking part in the action and playing pieces associated with Beecham.

In 1980 the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> put Beecham's image on the 13½<a href="penny%20sterling">p</a> postage stamp in a series portraying British conductors; the other three in the series depicted Wood, Sargent and Barbirolli. The Sir Thomas Beecham Society preserves Beecham's legacy through its website and release of historic recordings.

In 2012, Beecham was voted into the inaugural "Gramophone" magazine "Hall of Fame".

Messiah (Handel)

Messiah (HWV 56) is an English-language <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> composed in 1741 by <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>, with a scriptural text compiled by <a href="Charles%20Jennens">Charles Jennens</a> from the <a href="King%20James%20Bible">King James Bible</a>, and from the <a href="Coverdale%20Bible">Coverdale Psalter</a>, the version of the "<a href="Psalms">Psalms</a>" included with the "<a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>". It was first performed in Dublin on 13 April 1742 and received its London premiere nearly a year later. After an initially modest public reception, the oratorio gained in popularity, eventually becoming one of the best-known and most frequently performed choral works in Western music.

Handel's reputation in England, where he had lived since 1712, had been established through his compositions of Italian opera. He turned to English oratorio in the 1730s in response to changes in public taste; "Messiah" was his sixth work in this genre. Although its <a href="Structure%20of%20Handel%27s%20Messiah">structure</a> resembles that of <a href="Opera%23The%20Baroque%20era">opera</a>, it is not in dramatic form; there are no impersonations of characters and no direct speech. Instead, Jennens's text is an extended reflection on <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> as the <a href="Messiah">Messiah</a> called <a href="Christ%20%28title%29">Christ</a>. The text begins in <a href="Messiah%20Part%20I">Part I</a> with prophecies by <a href="Isaiah">Isaiah</a> and others, and moves to the <a href="annunciation%20to%20the%20shepherds">annunciation to the shepherds</a>, the only "scene" taken from the <a href="Gospel">Gospel</a>s. In <a href="Messiah%20Part%20II">Part II</a>, Handel concentrates on the <a href="Passion%20of%20Jesus">Passion</a> and ends with the "<a href="Messiah%20Part%20II%2344">Hallelujah</a>" chorus. In <a href="Messiah%20Part%20III">Part III</a> he covers the <a href="Resurrection%20of%20the%20dead%23Christianity">resurrection of the dead</a> and Christ's glorification in heaven.

Handel wrote "Messiah" for modest vocal and instrumental forces, with optional settings for many of the individual numbers. In the years after his death, the work was adapted for performance on a much larger scale, with giant orchestras and choirs. In other efforts to update it, its orchestration was revised and amplified by (among others) <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> ("<a href="Der%20Messias">Der Messias</a>"). In the late 20th and early 21st centuries the trend has been towards reproducing a greater fidelity to Handel's original intentions, although "big "Messiah"" productions continue to be mounted. A near-complete version was issued on <a href="Gramophone%20record%2378%20rpm%20disc%20developments">78 rpm discs</a> in 1928; since then the work has been recorded many times.

The composer <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">George Frideric Handel</a>, born in <a href="Halle%20%28Saale%29">Halle</a>, Germany in 1685, took up permanent residence in London in 1712, and became a naturalised British subject in 1727. By 1741 his pre-eminence in British music was evident from the honours he had accumulated, including a pension from the court of <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George II</a>, the office of Composer of Musick for the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a>, and—most unusually for a living person—a statue erected in his honour in <a href="Vauxhall%20Gardens">Vauxhall Gardens</a>. Within a large and varied musical output, Handel was a vigorous champion of Italian opera, which he had introduced to London in 1711 with "<a href="Rinaldo%20%28opera%29">Rinaldo</a>". He subsequently wrote and presented more than 40 such operas in London's theatres.

By the early 1730s public taste for Italian opera was beginning to fade. The popular success of <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a> and <a href="Johann%20Christoph%20Pepusch">Johann Christoph Pepusch</a>'s "<a href="The%20Beggar%27s%20Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a>" (first performed in 1728) had heralded a spate of English-language ballad-operas that mocked the pretensions of Italian opera. With box-office receipts falling, Handel's productions were increasingly reliant on private subsidies from the nobility. Such funding became harder to obtain after the launch in 1730 of the <a href="Opera%20of%20the%20Nobility">Opera of the Nobility</a>, a rival company to his own. Handel overcame this challenge, but he spent large sums of his own money in doing so.

Although prospects for Italian opera were declining, Handel remained committed to the genre, but as alternatives to his staged works he began to introduce English-language oratorios. In Rome in 1707–08 he had written two Italian oratorios at a time when opera performances in the city were temporarily forbidden under papal decree. His first venture into English oratorio had been "<a href="Esther%20%28Handel%29">Esther</a>", which was written and performed for a private patron in about 1718. In 1732 Handel brought a revised and expanded version of "Esther" to the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">King's Theatre, Haymarket</a>, where members of the royal family attended a glittering premiere on 6 May. Its success encouraged Handel to write two more oratorios ("<a href="Deborah%20%28Handel%29">Deborah</a>" and "<a href="Athalia%20%28Handel%29">Athalia</a>"). All three oratorios were performed to large and appreciative audiences at the <a href="Sheldonian%20Theatre">Sheldonian Theatre</a> in Oxford in mid-1733. Undergraduates reportedly sold their furniture to raise the money for the five-shilling tickets.

In 1735 Handel received the text for a new oratorio named "<a href="Saul%20%28Handel%29">Saul</a>" from its <a href="librettist">librettist</a> <a href="Charles%20Jennens">Charles Jennens</a>, a wealthy landowner with musical and literary interests. Because Handel's main creative concern was still with opera, he did not write the music for "Saul" until 1738, in preparation for his 1738–39 theatrical season. The work, after opening at the King's Theatre in January 1739 to a warm reception, was quickly followed by the less successful oratorio "<a href="Israel%20in%20Egypt">Israel in Egypt</a>" (which may also have come from Jennens). Although Handel continued to write operas, the trend towards English-language productions became irresistible as the decade ended. After three performances of his last Italian opera "<a href="Deidamia%20%28opera%29">Deidamia</a>" in January and February 1741, he abandoned the genre. In July 1741 Jennens sent him a new libretto for an oratorio; in a letter dated 10 July to his friend <a href="Edward%20Holdsworth">Edward Holdsworth</a>, Jennens wrote: "I hope [Handel] will lay out his whole Genius & Skill upon it, that the Composition may excell all his former Compositions, as the Subject excells every other subject. The Subject is Messiah".

In <a href="Christian%20theology">Christian theology</a>, the <a href="Messiah%23Christianity">Messiah</a> is the saviour of the <a href="Jews">Jewish people</a> and humankind. The Messiah who is called <a href="Christ%20%28title%29">Christ</a>, is identified with the person of <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a>, known by his followers as the Christ or "Jesus Christ". Handel's "Messiah" has been described by the early-music scholar Richard Luckett as "a commentary on [Jesus Christ's] Nativity, Passion, Resurrection and Ascension", beginning with God's promises as spoken by the prophets and ending with Christ's glorification in heaven. In contrast with most of Handel's oratorios, the singers in "Messiah" do not assume dramatic roles; there is no single, dominant narrative voice; and very little use is made of <a href="direct%20speech">quoted speech</a>. In his libretto, Jennens's intention was not to dramatise the life and teachings of Jesus, but to acclaim the "Mystery of Godliness", using a compilation of extracts from the <a href="Authorized%20King%20James%20Version">Authorized (King James) Version</a> of the Bible, and from the <a href="Psalms">Psalms</a> included in the 1662 <a href="Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">Book of Common Prayer</a>.

The three-part structure of the work approximates to that of Handel's three-act operas, with the "parts" subdivided by Jennens into "<a href="Messiah%20structure%23Scenes">scenes</a>". Each scene is a collection of individual numbers or "movements" which take the form of <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s, <a href="aria">aria</a>s and choruses. There are two instrumental numbers, the opening "Sinfony" in the style of a <a href="French%20overture">French overture</a>, and the <a href="pastorale">pastoral</a> "Pifa", often called the "pastoral symphony", at the mid-point of Part I.

In Part I, the Messiah's coming and the <a href="Virgin%20birth%20of%20Jesus">virgin birth</a> are predicted by the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> prophets. The <a href="annunciation%20to%20the%20shepherds">annunciation to the shepherds</a> of the birth of the Christ is represented in the words of <a href="Gospel%20of%20Luke">Luke's gospel</a>. Part II covers <a href="Passion%20of%20Jesus">Christ's passion and his death</a>, his <a href="Resurrection%20of%20Jesus">resurrection</a> and <a href="Ascension%20of%20Jesus">ascension</a>, the first spreading of the <a href="gospel">gospel</a> through the world, and a definitive statement of God's glory summarised in the "Hallelujah". Part III begins with the promise of redemption, followed by a prediction of the <a href="Last%20Judgment">day of judgment</a> and the "<a href="Resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">general resurrection</a>", ending with the final victory over sin and death and the acclamation of Christ. According to the musicologist <a href="Donald%20Burrows%20%28musicologist%29">Donald Burrows</a>, much of the text is so allusive as to be largely incomprehensible to those ignorant of the biblical accounts. For the benefit of his audiences Jennens printed and issued a pamphlet explaining the reasons for his choices of scriptural selections.

Charles Jennens was born around 1700, into a prosperous landowning family whose lands and properties in Warwickshire and Leicestershire he eventually inherited. His religious and political views—he opposed the <a href="Act%20of%20Settlement%201701">Act of Settlement of 1701</a> which secured the accession to the British throne for the <a href="House%20of%20Hanover">House of Hanover</a>—prevented him from receiving his degree from <a href="Balliol%20College%2C%20Oxford">Balliol College, Oxford</a>, or from pursuing any form of public career. His family's wealth enabled him to live a life of leisure while devoting himself to his literary and musical interests. Although the musicologist <a href="Watkins%20Shaw">Watkins Shaw</a> dismisses Jennens as "a conceited figure of no special ability", <a href="Donald%20Burrows%20%28musicologist%29">Donald Burrows</a> has written: "of Jennens's musical literacy there can be no doubt". He was certainly devoted to Handel's music, having helped to finance the publication of every Handel score since "<a href="Rodelinda%20%28opera%29">Rodelinda</a>" in 1725. By 1741, after their collaboration on "Saul", a warm friendship had developed between the two, and Handel was a frequent visitor to the Jennens family estate at <a href="Gopsall">Gopsall</a>.

Jennens's letter to Holdsworth of 10 July 1741, in which he first mentions "Messiah", suggests that the text was a recent work, probably assembled earlier that summer. As a devout <a href="Anglican">Anglican</a> and believer in scriptural authority, Jennens intended to challenge advocates of <a href="Deism">Deism</a>, who rejected the doctrine of divine intervention in human affairs. Shaw describes the text as "a meditation of our Lord as Messiah in Christian thought and belief", and despite his reservations on Jennens's character, concedes that the finished <a href="libretto">wordbook</a> "amounts to little short of a work of genius". There is no evidence that Handel played any active role in the selection or preparation of the text, such as he did in the case of "Saul"; it seems, rather, that he saw no need to make any significant amendment to Jennens's work.

The music for "Messiah" was completed in 24 days of swift composition. Having received Jennens's text some time after 10 July 1741, Handel began work on it on 22 August. His records show that he had completed Part I in outline by 28 August, Part II by 6 September and Part III by 12 September, followed by two days of "filling up" to produce the finished work on 14 September. The <a href="autograph">autograph</a> score's 259 pages show some signs of haste such as blots, scratchings-out, unfilled bars and other uncorrected errors, but according to the music scholar Richard Luckett the number of errors is remarkably small in a document of this length. The original manuscript for "Messiah" is now held in the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>'s music collection. It is scored for 2 trumpets, timpani, 2 oboes, 2 violins, viola, and basso continuo (cello, double bass, and harpsichord).

At the end of his manuscript Handel wrote the letters "SDG"—', "To God alone the glory". This inscription, taken with the speed of composition, has encouraged belief in the apocryphal story that Handel wrote the music in a fervour of divine inspiration in which, as he wrote the "Hallelujah" chorus, "he saw all heaven before him". Burrows points out that many of Handel's operas, of comparable length and structure to "Messiah", were composed within similar timescales between theatrical seasons. The effort of writing so much music in so short a time was not unusual for Handel and his contemporaries; Handel commenced his next oratorio, "Samson", within a week of finishing "Messiah", and completed his draft of this new work in a month. In accordance with his frequent practice when writing new works, Handel adapted existing compositions for use in "Messiah", in this case drawing on two recently completed Italian duets and one written twenty years previously. Thus, ' from 1722 became the basis of "O Death, where is thy sting?"; "His yoke is easy" and "And he shall purify" were drawn from ' (July 1741), "Unto us a child is born" and "All we like sheep" from ' (July 1741). Handel's instrumentation in the score is often imprecise, again in line with contemporary convention, where the use of certain instruments and combinations was assumed and did not need to be written down by the composer; later copyists would fill in the details.

Before the first performance Handel made numerous revisions to his manuscript score, in part to match the forces available for the 1742 Dublin premiere; it is probable that his work was not performed as originally conceived in his lifetime. Between 1742 and 1754 he continued to revise and recompose individual movements, sometimes to suit the requirements of particular singers. The first published score of "Messiah" was issued in 1767, eight years after Handel's death, though this was based on relatively early manuscripts and included none of Handel's later revisions.

Handel's decision to give a season of concerts in Dublin in the winter of 1741–42 arose from an invitation from the <a href="William%20Cavendish%2C%203rd%20Duke%20of%20Devonshire">Duke of Devonshire</a>, then serving as <a href="Lord%20Lieutenant%20of%20Ireland">Lord Lieutenant of Ireland</a>. A violinist friend of Handel's, <a href="Matthew%20Dubourg">Matthew Dubourg</a>, was in Dublin as the Lord Lieutenant's bandmaster; he would look after the tour's orchestral requirements. Whether Handel originally intended to perform "Messiah" in Dublin is uncertain; he did not inform Jennens of any such plan, for the latter wrote to Holdsworth on 2 December 1741: "... it was some mortification to me to hear that instead of performing "Messiah" here he has gone into Ireland with it." After arriving in Dublin on 18 November 1741, Handel arranged a subscription series of six concerts, to be held between December 1741 and February 1742 at the Great Music Hall, <a href="Fishamble%20Street">Fishamble Street</a>. These concerts were so popular that a second series was quickly arranged; "Messiah" figured in neither series.

In early March Handel began discussions with the appropriate committees for a charity concert, to be given in April, at which he intended to present "Messiah". He sought and was given permission from <a href="St%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Dublin">St Patrick's</a> and <a href="Christ%20Church%20Cathedral%2C%20Dublin">Christ Church</a> cathedrals to use their choirs for this occasion. These forces amounted to 16 men and 16 boy choristers; several of the men were allocated solo parts. The women soloists were <a href="Christina%20Maria%20Avoglio">Christina Maria Avoglio</a>, who had sung the main soprano roles in the two subscription series, and <a href="Susannah%20Maria%20Cibber">Susannah Cibber</a>, an established stage actress and <a href="contralto">contralto</a> who had sung in the second series. To accommodate Cibber's vocal range, the recitative "Then shall the eyes of the blind" and the aria "He shall feed his flock" were transposed down to F major. The performance, also in the Fishamble Street hall, was originally announced for 12 April, but was deferred for a day "at the request of persons of Distinction". The orchestra in Dublin comprised strings, two trumpets, and timpani; the number of players is unknown. Handel had his own organ shipped to Ireland for the performances; a harpsichord was probably also used.

The three charities that were to benefit were prisoners' debt relief, the Mercer's Hospital, and the Charitable Infirmary. In its report on a public rehearsal, the "Dublin News-Letter" described the oratorio as "... far surpass[ing] anything of that Nature which has been performed in this or any other Kingdom". Seven hundred people attended the premiere on 13 April. So that the largest possible audience could be admitted to the concert, gentlemen were requested to remove their swords, and ladies were asked not to wear hoops in their dresses. The performance earned unanimous praise from the assembled press: "Words are wanting to express the exquisite delight it afforded to the admiring and crouded Audience". A Dublin clergyman, Rev. Delaney, was so overcome by Susanna Cibber's rendering of "He was despised" that reportedly he leapt to his feet and cried: "Woman, for this be all thy sins forgiven thee!" The takings amounted to around £400, providing about £127 to each of the three nominated charities and securing the release of 142 indebted prisoners.

Handel remained in Dublin for four months after the premiere. He organised a second performance of "Messiah" on 3 June, which was announced as "the last Performance of Mr Handel's during his Stay in this Kingdom". In this second "Messiah", which was for Handel's private financial benefit, Cibber reprised her role from the first performance, though Avoglio may have been replaced by a Mrs Maclaine; details of other performers are not recorded.

The warm reception accorded to "Messiah" in Dublin was not repeated in London when Handel introduced the work at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House%23The%20first%20theatre">the Covent Garden theatre</a> on 23 March 1743. Avoglio and Cibber were again the chief soloists; they were joined by the tenor <a href="John%20Beard%20%28tenor%29">John Beard</a>, a veteran of Handel's operas, the bass Thomas Rheinhold and two other sopranos, Kitty Clive and Miss Edwards. The first performance was overshadowed by views expressed in the press that the work's subject matter was too exalted to be performed in a theatre, particularly by secular singer-actresses such as Cibber and Clive. In an attempt to deflect such sensibilities, in London Handel had avoided the name "Messiah" and presented the work as the "New Sacred Oratorio". As was his custom, Handel rearranged the music to suit his singers. He wrote a new setting of "And lo, the angel of the Lord" for Clive, never used subsequently. He added a tenor song for Beard: "Their sound is gone out", which had appeared in Jennens's original libretto but had not been in the Dublin performances.

The custom of standing for the "Hallelujah" chorus originates from a belief that, at the London premiere, King <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">George II</a> did so, which would have obliged all to stand. There is no convincing evidence that the king was present, or that he attended any subsequent performance of "Messiah"; the first reference to the practice of standing appears in a letter dated 1756, three years prior to Handel's death. 

London's initially cool reception of "Messiah" led Handel to reduce the season's planned six performances to three, and not to present the work at all in 1744—to the considerable annoyance of Jennens, whose relations with the composer temporarily soured. At Jennens's request, Handel made several changes in the music for the 1745 revival: "Their sound is gone out" became a choral piece, the soprano song "Rejoice greatly" was recomposed in shortened form, and the transpositions for Cibber's voice were restored to their original soprano range. Jennens wrote to Holdsworth on 30 August 1745: "[Handel] has made a fine Entertainment of it, though not near so good as he might & ought to have done. I have with great difficulty made him correct some of the grosser faults in the composition ..." Handel directed two performances at Covent Garden in 1745, on 9 and 11 April, and then set the work aside for four years.

The 1749 revival at Covent Garden, under the proper title of "Messiah", saw the appearance of two female soloists who were henceforth closely associated with Handel's music: <a href="Giulia%20Frasi">Giulia Frasi</a> and <a href="Caterina%20Galli">Caterina Galli</a>. In the following year these were joined by the male alto <a href="Gaetano%20Guadagni">Gaetano Guadagni</a>, for whom Handel composed new versions of "But who may abide" and "Thou art gone up on high". The year 1750 also saw the institution of the annual charity performances of "Messiah" at London's <a href="Foundling%20Hospital">Foundling Hospital</a>, which continued until Handel's death and beyond. The 1754 performance at the hospital is the first for which full details of the orchestral and vocal forces survive. The orchestra included fifteen violins, five violas, three cellos, two double-basses, four bassoons, four oboes, two trumpets, two horns and drums. In the chorus of nineteen were six trebles from the Chapel Royal; the remainder, all men, were altos, tenors and basses. Frasi, Galli and Beard led the five soloists, who were required to assist the chorus. For this performance the transposed Guadagni arias were restored to the soprano voice. By 1754 Handel was severely afflicted by the onset of blindness, and in 1755 he turned over the direction of the "Messiah" hospital performance to his pupil, J.C. Smith. He apparently resumed his duties in 1757 and may have continued thereafter. The final performance of the work at which Handel was present was at Covent Garden on 6 April 1759, eight days before his death.

During the 1750s "Messiah" was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or <a href="motet">motet</a>s in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> (1772), and <a href="Mannheim">Mannheim</a> (1777), where <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> under the patronage of <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that "The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr." In a 1955 article, <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Sir Malcolm Sargent</a>, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, "Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large)." In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, "The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers".

In continental Europe, performances of "Messiah" were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, <a href="Johann%20Adam%20Hiller">Johann Adam Hiller</a> presented "Messiah" with updated scoring in <a href="Berlin%20Cathedral">Berlin Cathedral</a>. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ. In 1789, Mozart was commissioned by Baron <a href="Gottfried%20van%20Swieten">Gottfried van Swieten</a> and the to re-orchestrate several works by Handel, including "Messiah" ("<a href="Der%20Messias">Der Messias</a>"). Writing for a small-scale performance, he eliminated the organ continuo, added parts for flutes, clarinets, trombones and horns, recomposed some passages and rearranged others. The performance took place on 6 March 1789 in the rooms of Count Johann Esterházy, with four soloists and a choir of 12. Mozart's arrangement, with minor amendments from Hiller, was published in 1803, after his death. The musical scholar <a href="Moritz%20Hauptmann">Moritz Hauptmann</a> described the Mozart additions as "<a href="stucco">stucco</a> ornaments on a marble temple". Mozart himself was reportedly circumspect about his changes, insisting that any alterations to Handel's score should not be interpreted as an effort to improve the music. Elements of this version later became familiar to British audiences, incorporated into editions of the score by editors including <a href="Ebenezer%20Prout">Ebenezer Prout</a>.

In the 19th century, approaches to Handel in German and English-speaking countries diverged further. In Leipzig in 1856, the musicologist <a href="Friedrich%20Chrysander">Friedrich Chrysander</a> and the literary historian <a href="Georg%20Gottfried%20Gervinus">Georg Gottfried Gervinus</a> founded the Deutsche <a href="H%C3%A4ndel-Gesellschaft">Händel-Gesellschaft</a> with the aim of publishing authentic editions of all Handel's works. At the same time, performances in Britain and the United States moved away from Handel's performance practice with increasingly grandiose renditions. "Messiah" was presented in New York in 1853 with a chorus of 300 and in Boston in 1865 with more than 600.

In the 1860s and 1870s ever larger forces were assembled. <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a>, in his role as a music critic, commented, "The stale wonderment which the great chorus never fails to elicit has already been exhausted"; he later wrote, "Why, instead of wasting huge sums on the multitudinous dullness of a Handel Festival does not somebody set up a thoroughly rehearsed and exhaustively studied performance of the Messiah in <a href="St%20James%27s%20Hall">St James's Hall</a> with a chorus of twenty capable artists? Most of us would be glad to hear the work seriously performed once before we die." The employment of huge forces necessitated considerable augmentation of the orchestral parts. Many admirers of Handel believed that the composer would have made such additions, had the appropriate instruments been available in his day. Shaw argued, largely unheeded, that "the composer may be spared from his friends, and the function of writing or selecting 'additional orchestral accompaniments' exercised with due discretion."

One reason for the popularity of huge-scale performances was the ubiquity of amateur choral societies. The conductor <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a> wrote that for 200 years the chorus was "the national medium of musical utterance" in Britain. However, after the heyday of Victorian choral societies, he noted a "rapid and violent reaction against monumental performances ... an appeal from several quarters that Handel should be played and heard as in the days between 1700 and 1750". At the end of the century, <a href="Frederick%20Bridge">Sir Frederick Bridge</a> and T. W. Bourne pioneered revivals of "Messiah" in Handel's orchestration, and Bourne's work was the basis for further scholarly versions in the early 20th century.

Although the huge-scale oratorio tradition was perpetuated by such large ensembles as the <a href="Royal%20Choral%20Society">Royal Choral Society</a>, the <a href="Mormon%20Tabernacle%20Choir">Mormon Tabernacle Choir</a> and the <a href="Huddersfield%20Choral%20Society">Huddersfield Choral Society</a> in the 20th century, there were increasing calls for performances more faithful to Handel's conception. At the turn of the century, "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" wrote of the "additional accompaniments" of Mozart and others, "Is it not time that some of these 'hangers on' of Handel's score were sent about their business?" In 1902, the musicologist Ebenezer Prout produced a new edition of the score, working from Handel's original manuscripts rather than from corrupt printed versions with errors accumulated from one edition to another. However, Prout started from the assumption that a faithful reproduction of Handel's original score would not be practical:

Prout continued the practice of adding flutes, clarinets and trombones to Handel's orchestration, but he restored Handel's high trumpet parts, which Mozart had omitted (evidently because playing them was a lost art by 1789). There was little dissent from Prout's approach, and when Chrysander's scholarly edition was published in the same year, it was received respectfully as "a volume for the study" rather than a performing edition, being an edited reproduction of various of Handel's manuscript versions. An authentic performance was thought impossible: "The Musical Times" correspondent wrote, "Handel's orchestral instruments were all (excepting the trumpet) of a coarser quality than those at present in use; his harpsichords are gone for ever ... the places in which he performed the 'Messiah' were mere drawing-rooms when compared with the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Albert Hall</a>, the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> and the Crystal Palace. In Australia, "<a href="The%20Register%20%28Adelaide%29">The Register</a>" protested at the prospect of performances by "trumpery little church choirs of 20 voices or so".

In Germany, "Messiah" was not so often performed as in Britain; when it was given, medium-sized forces were the norm. At the <a href="Handel%20Festival%2C%20Halle">Handel Festival</a> held in 1922 in Handel's native town, Halle, his choral works were given by a choir of 163 and an orchestra of 64. In Britain, innovative broadcasting and recording contributed to reconsideration of Handelian performance. For example, in 1928, Beecham conducted a recording of "Messiah" with modestly sized forces and controversially brisk tempi, although the orchestration remained far from authentic. In 1934 and 1935, the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> broadcast performances of "Messiah" conducted by <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Adrian Boult</a> with "a faithful adherence to Handel's clear scoring." A performance with authentic scoring was given in <a href="Worcester%20Cathedral">Worcester Cathedral</a> as part of the <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> in 1935. In 1950 John Tobin conducted a performance of "Messiah" in <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a> with the orchestral forces specified by the composer, a choir of 60, a <a href="counter-tenor">counter-tenor</a> alto soloist, and modest attempts at vocal elaboration of the printed notes, in the manner of Handel's day. The Prout version sung with many voices remained popular with British choral societies, but at the same time increasingly frequent performances were given by small professional ensembles in suitably sized venues, using authentic scoring. Recordings on LP and CD were preponderantly of the latter type, and the large scale "Messiah" came to seem old-fashioned.
The cause of authentic performance was advanced in 1965 by the publication of a new edition of the score, edited by <a href="Watkins%20Shaw">Watkins Shaw</a>. In the "<a href="Grove%20Dictionary%20of%20Music%20and%20Musicians">Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians</a>", David Scott writes, "the edition at first aroused suspicion on account of its attempts in several directions to break the crust of convention surrounding the work in the British Isles." By the time of Shaw's death in 1996, "The Times" described his edition as "now in universal use".

"Messiah" remains Handel's best-known work, with performances particularly popular during the Advent season; writing in December 1993, the music critic <a href="Alex%20Ross%20%28music%20critic%29">Alex Ross</a> refers to that month's 21 performances in New York alone as "numbing repetition". Against the general trend towards authenticity, the work has been staged in opera houses, both in London (2009) and in Paris (2011). The Mozart score is revived from time to time, and in <a href="Anglophone">Anglophone</a> countries "<a href="Scratch%20Messiah">singalong</a>" performances with many hundreds of performers are popular. Although performances striving for authenticity are now usual, it is generally agreed that there can never be a definitive version of "Messiah"; the surviving manuscripts contain radically different settings of many numbers, and vocal and instrumental ornamentation of the written notes is a matter of personal judgment, even for the most historically informed performers. The Handel scholar <a href="Winton%20Dean">Winton Dean</a> has written:

The numbering of the movements shown here is in accordance with the Novello vocal score (1959), edited by Watkins Shaw, which adapts the numbering earlier devised by Ebenezer Prout. Other editions count the movements slightly differently; the <a href="B%C3%A4renreiter">Bärenreiter</a> edition of 1965, for example, does not number all the <a href="recitative">recitative</a>s and runs from 1 to 47. The division into parts and scenes is based on the 1743 word-book prepared for the first London performance. The scene headings are given as Burrows summarised the <a href="Messiah%20structure%23Scenes">scene headings</a> by Jennens.

Handel's music for "Messiah" is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist <a href="Percy%20M.%20Young">Percy M. Young</a> observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus "Glory to God", apart from the solo in "The trumpet shall sound" they are heard only in "Hallelujah" and the final chorus "Worthy is the Lamb". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: "Increase them and the thrill is diminished". In "Glory to God", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as "da lontano e un poco piano", meaning "quietly, from afar"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage ("in disparte") at this point, to highlight the effect of distance. In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, "a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III" according to Luckett.

Although "Messiah" is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist <a href="Anthony%20Hicks">Anthony Hicks</a> as "an aspiration towards D major", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the "trumpet" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the "ascending <a href="Perfect%20fourth">fourth</a>" as a unifying <a href="motif%20%28music%29">motif</a>; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of "I know that my Redeemer liveth" and on numerous other occasions. Nevertheless, Luckett finds this thesis implausible, and asserts that "the unity of "Messiah" is a consequence of nothing more arcane than the quality of Handel's attention to his text, and the consistency of his musical imagination". <a href="Allan%20Kozinn">Allan Kozinn</a>, "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" music critic, finds "a model marriage of music and text ... From the gentle falling melody assigned to the opening words ("Comfort ye") to the sheer ebullience of the "Hallelujah" chorus and the ornate celebratory counterpoint that supports the closing "Amen", hardly a line of text goes by that Handel does not amplify".

The opening "Sinfony" is composed in E minor for strings, and is Handel's first use in oratorio of the <a href="French%20overture">French overture</a> form. Jennens commented that the "Sinfony" contains "passages far unworthy of Handel, but much more unworthy of the Messiah"; Handel's early biographer <a href="Charles%20Burney">Charles Burney</a> merely found it "dry and uninteresting". A change of key to E major leads to the first prophecy, delivered by the tenor whose vocal line in the opening recitative "Comfort ye" is entirely independent of the strings accompaniment. The music proceeds through various key changes as the prophecies unfold, culminating in the G major chorus "For unto us a child is born", in which the choral exclamations (which include an ascending fourth in "the Mighty God") are imposed on material drawn from Handel's Italian cantata "Nò, di voi non vo'fidarmi". Such passages, says the music historian <a href="Donald%20Jay%20Grout">Donald Jay Grout</a>, "reveal Handel the dramatist, the unerring master of dramatic effect".

The pastoral interlude that follows begins with the short instrumental movement, the "Pifa", which takes its name from the shepherd-bagpipers, or "pifferari", who played their pipes in the streets of Rome at Christmas time. Handel wrote the movement in both 11-bar and extended 32-bar forms; according to Burrows, either will work in performance. The group of four short recitatives which follow it introduce the soprano soloist—although often the earlier aria "But who may abide" is sung by the soprano in its transposed G minor form. The final recitative of this section is in D major and heralds the affirmative chorus "Glory to God". The remainder of Part I is largely carried by the soprano in B flat, in what Burrows terms a rare instance of tonal stability. The aria "He shall feed his flock" underwent several transformations by Handel, appearing at different times as a recitative, an alto aria and a duet for alto and soprano before the original soprano version was restored in 1754. The appropriateness of the Italian source material for the setting of the solemn concluding chorus "His yoke is easy" has been questioned by the music scholar <a href="Sedley%20Taylor">Sedley Taylor</a>, who calls it "a piece of word-painting ... grievously out of place", though he concedes that the four-part choral conclusion is a stroke of genius that combines beauty with dignity.

The second Part begins in G minor, a key which, in Hogwood's phrase, brings a mood of "tragic presentiment" to the long sequence of Passion numbers which follows. The declamatory opening chorus "Behold the Lamb of God", in <a href="fugue">fugal</a> form, is followed by the alto solo "He was despised" in E flat major, the longest single item in the oratorio, in which some phrases are sung unaccompanied to emphasise Christ's abandonment. Luckett records Burney's description of this number as "the highest idea of excellence in pathetic expression of any English song". The subsequent series of mainly short choral movements cover Christ's Passion, Crucifixion, Death and Resurrection, at first in F minor, with a brief F major respite in "All we like sheep". Here, Handel's use of "Nò, di voi non vo'fidarmi" has Sedley Taylor's unqualified approval: "[Handel] bids the voices enter in solemn canonical sequence, and his chorus ends with a combination of grandeur and depth of feeling such as is at the command of consummate genius only".

The sense of desolation returns, in what Hogwood calls the "remote and barbarous" key of B flat minor, for the tenor recitative "All they that see him". The sombre sequence finally ends with the Ascension chorus "Lift up your heads", which Handel initially divides between two choral groups, the altos serving both as the bass line to a soprano choir and the treble line to the tenors and basses. For the 1754 Foundling Hospital performance Handel added two horns, which join in when the chorus unites towards the end of the number. After the celebratory tone of Christ's reception into heaven, marked by the choir's D major acclamation "Let all the angels of God worship him", the "<a href="Pentecost">Whitsun</a>" section proceeds through a series of contrasting moods—serene and pastoral in "How beautiful are the feet", theatrically operatic in "Why do the nations so furiously rage"—towards the Part II culmination of "Hallelujah". This, as Young points out, is not the climactic chorus of the work, although one cannot escape its "contagious enthusiasm". It builds from a deceptively light orchestral opening, through a short, unison <a href="cantus%20firmus">cantus firmus</a> passage on the words "For the Lord God omnipotent reigneth", to the reappearance of the long-silent trumpets at "And He shall reign for ever and ever". Commentators have noted that the musical line for this third subject is based on "<a href="Wachet%20auf%2C%20ruft%20uns%20die%20Stimme">Wachet auf</a>", <a href="Philipp%20Nicolai">Philipp Nicolai</a>'s popular <a href="Lutheran%20chorale">Lutheran chorale</a>.

The opening soprano solo in E major, "I know that my Redeemer liveth" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: "Behold, I tell you a mystery", then the long aria "The trumpet shall sound", marked ' ("dignified but not fast"). Handel originally wrote this in <a href="da%20capo">da capo</a> form, but shortened it to <a href="dal%20segno">dal segno</a>, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of "incorruptible" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet <a href="William%20Shenstone">William Shenstone</a>'s comment that he "could observe some parts in "<a href="Messiah">Messiah</a>" wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even "opposite", to what the words required". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, "O death, where is thy sting?" The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata ', and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus "But thanks be to God".

The reflective soprano solo "If God be for us" (originally written for alto) quotes <a href="Martin%20Luther">Luther</a>'s chorale "". It ushers in the D major choral finale: "Worthy is the Lamb", leading to the apocalyptic "Amen" in which, says Hogwood, "the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven". Handel's first biographer, <a href="John%20Mainwaring">John Mainwaring</a>, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer "rising still higher" than in "that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus". Young writes that the "Amen" should, in the manner of <a href="Giovanni%20Pierluigi%20da%20Palestrina">Palestrina</a>, "be delivered as though through the aisles and ambulatories of some great church".

Many early recordings of individual choruses and arias from "Messiah" reflect the performance styles then fashionable—large forces, slow tempi and liberal reorchestration. Typical examples are choruses conducted by <a href="Henry%20Wood">Sir Henry Wood</a>, recorded in 1926 for <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia</a> with the 3,500-strong choir and orchestra of the Crystal Palace Handel Festival, and a contemporary rival disc from <a href="HMV%20Records">HMV</a> featuring the <a href="Royal%20Choral%20Society">Royal Choral Society</a> under Malcolm Sargent, recorded at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>.

The first near-complete recording of the whole work (with the cuts then customary) was conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1928. It represented an effort by Beecham to "provide an interpretation which, in his opinion, was nearer the composer's intentions", with smaller forces and faster tempi than had become traditional. His contralto soloist, <a href="Muriel%20Brunskill">Muriel Brunskill</a>, later commented, "His tempi, which are now taken for granted, were revolutionary; he entirely revitalised it". Nevertheless, Sargent retained the large scale tradition in his four HMV recordings, the first in 1946 and three more in the 1950s and 1960s, all with the <a href="Huddersfield%20Choral%20Society">Huddersfield Choral Society</a> and the <a href="Royal%20Liverpool%20Philharmonic">Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra</a>. Beecham's second recording of the work, in 1947, "led the way towards more truly Handelian rhythms and speeds", according to the critic <a href="Alan%20Blyth">Alan Blyth</a>. In a 1991 study of all 76 complete "Messiahs" recorded by that date, the writer Teri Noel Towe called this version of Beecham's "one of a handful of truly stellar performances".

In 1954 the first recording based on Handel's original scoring was conducted by <a href="Hermann%20Scherchen">Hermann Scherchen</a> for <a href="Nixa%20Records">Nixa</a>, quickly followed by a version, judged scholarly at the time, under Sir Adrian Boult for <a href="Decca%20Records">Decca</a>. By the standards of 21st-century performance, however, Scherchen's and Boult's tempi were still slow, and there was no attempt at vocal ornamentation by the soloists. In 1966 and 1967 two new recordings were regarded as great advances in scholarship and performance practice, conducted respectively by <a href="Colin%20Davis">Colin Davis</a> for <a href="Philips%20Records">Philips</a> and <a href="Charles%20Mackerras">Charles Mackerras</a> for HMV. They inaugurated a new tradition of brisk, small scale performances, with vocal embellishments by the solo singers. Among recordings of older-style performances are Beecham's 1959 recording with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, with orchestration commissioned from Sir Eugene Goossens and completed by the English composer <a href="Leonard%20Salzedo">Leonard Salzedo</a>, <a href="Karl%20Richter%20%28conductor%29">Karl Richter</a>'s 1973 version for <a href="Deutsche%20Grammophon">DG</a>, and <a href="David%20Willcocks">David Willcocks</a>'s 1995 performance based on Prout's 1902 edition of the score, with a 325-voice choir and 90-piece orchestra.

By the end of the 1970s the quest for authenticity had extended to the use of period instruments and historically correct styles of playing them. The first of such versions were conducted by the early music specialists <a href="Christopher%20Hogwood">Christopher Hogwood</a> (1979) and <a href="John%20Eliot%20Gardiner">John Eliot Gardiner</a> (1982). The use of period instruments quickly became the norm on record, although some conductors, among them <a href="Georg%20Solti">Sir Georg Solti</a> (1985), continued to favour modern instruments. "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">Gramophone</a>" magazine and "<a href="The%20Penguin%20Guide%20to%20Recorded%20Classical%20Music">The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music</a>" highlighted two versions, conducted respectively by <a href="Trevor%20Pinnock">Trevor Pinnock</a> (1988) and <a href="Richard%20Hickox">Richard Hickox</a> (1992). The latter employs a chorus of 24 singers and an orchestra of 31 players; Handel is known to have used a chorus of 19 and an orchestra of 37. Performances on an even smaller scale have followed.

Several reconstructions of early performances have been recorded: the 1742 Dublin version by Scherchen in 1954, and again in 1959, and by <a href="Jean-Claude%20Malgoire">Jean-Claude Malgoire</a> in 1980 There are several recordings of the 1754 Foundling Hospital version, including those under Hogwood (1979), <a href="Andrew%20Parrott">Andrew Parrott</a> (1989), and Paul McCreesh. In 1973 David Willcocks conducted a set for HMV in which all the soprano arias were sung in unison by the boys of the <a href="Choir%20of%20King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Choir of King's College, Cambridge</a>, and in 1974, for DG, Mackerras conducted a set of Mozart's reorchestrated version, sung in German.

The first published score of 1767, together with Handel's documented adaptations and recompositions of various movements, has been the basis for many performing versions since the composer's lifetime. Modern performances which seek authenticity tend to be based on one of three 20th-century performing editions. These all use different methods of numbering movements:

The edition edited by <a href="Friedrich%20Chrysander">Friedrich Chrysander</a> and <a href="Max%20Seiffert">Max Seiffert</a> for the <a href="H%C3%A4ndel-Gesellschaft">Deutsche Händel-Gesellschaft</a> (Berlin, 1902) is not a general performing edition, but has been used as a basis of scholarship and research.

In addition to Mozart's well-known reorchestration, arrangements for larger orchestral forces exist by <a href="Eugene%20Aynsley%20Goossens">Goossens</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Davis%20%28conductor%29">Andrew Davis</a>; both have been recorded at least once, on the <a href="RCA%20Records">RCA</a> and <a href="Chandos%20Records">Chandos</a> labels respectively.

James Baird Weaver (June 12, 1833 – February 6, 1912) was a member of the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">United States House of Representatives</a> and two-time candidate for President of the United States. Born in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, he moved to <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> as a boy when his family claimed a homestead on the frontier. He became politically active as a young man and was an advocate for farmers and laborers. He joined and quit several political parties in the furtherance of the progressive causes in which he believed. After serving in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a> in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Weaver returned to Iowa and worked for the election of <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidates. After several unsuccessful attempts at Republican nominations to various offices, and growing dissatisfied with the conservative wing of the party, in 1877 Weaver switched to the <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a>, which supported increasing the <a href="money%20supply">money supply</a> and regulating <a href="big%20business">big business</a>. As a Greenbacker with <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic</a> support, Weaver won election to the House in 1878.

The Greenbackers nominated Weaver for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201880">1880</a>, but he received only 3.3 percent of the popular vote. After several more attempts at elected office, he was again elected to the House in 1884 and 1886. In Congress, he worked for expansion of the money supply and for the opening of <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a> to white settlement. As the Greenback Party fell apart, a new anti-big business third party, the <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">People's Party</a> ("Populists"), arose. Weaver helped to organize the party and was their nominee for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201892">1892</a>. This time he was more successful and gained 8.5 percent of the popular vote and won five states, but still fell far short of victory. The Populists merged with the Democrats by the end of the 19th century, and Weaver went with them, promoting the candidacy of <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a> for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">1896</a>, <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201900">1900</a>, and <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201908">1908</a>. After serving as mayor of his home town, <a href="Colfax%2C%20Iowa">Colfax, Iowa</a>, Weaver retired from his pursuit of elective office. He died in Iowa in 1912. Most of Weaver's political goals remained unfulfilled at his death, but many came to pass in the following decades.

James Baird Weaver was born in <a href="Dayton%2C%20Ohio">Dayton, Ohio</a>, on June 12, 1833, the fifth of thirteen children of Abram Weaver and Susan Imlay Weaver. Weaver's father was a farmer, also born in Ohio, and a descendant of <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">Revolutionary War</a> veterans. He married Weaver's mother, who was from New Jersey, in 1824. Shortly after Weaver's birth, in 1835, the family moved to a farm nine miles north of <a href="Cassopolis%2C%20Michigan">Cassopolis, Michigan</a>. In 1842, the family moved again to the <a href="Iowa%20Territory">Iowa Territory</a> to await the opening of former <a href="Sac%20and%20Fox%20Nation">Sac and Fox</a> land to white settlement the following year. They claimed a homestead along the Chequest Creek in <a href="Davis%20County%2C%20Iowa">Davis County</a>. Abram Weaver built a house and farmed his new land until 1848, when the family moved to <a href="Bloomfield%2C%20Iowa">Bloomfield</a>, the county seat.

Abram Weaver, a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> involved in local politics, was elected clerk of the district court in 1848; he often vied for election to other offices, usually unsuccessfully. Weaver's brother-in-law, Hosea Horn, a <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig</a>, was appointed postmaster the following year, and through him James Weaver secured his first job, delivering mail to neighboring <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Iowa">Jefferson County</a>. In 1851, Weaver quit the mail route to <a href="read%20law">read law</a> with Samuel G. McAchran, a local lawyer. Two years later, Weaver interrupted his legal career to accompany another brother-in-law, Dr. Calvin Phelps, on a cattle drive overland from Bloomfield to <a href="Sacramento%2C%20California">Sacramento, California</a>. Weaver initially intended to stay and <a href="California%20Gold%20Rush">prospect for gold</a>, but instead booked passage on a ship for <a href="Panama">Panama</a>. He crossed the isthmus, boarded another ship to New York, and returned home to Iowa.

Upon his return, Weaver worked briefly as a store clerk before resuming the study of law. He enrolled at the <a href="University%20of%20Cincinnati%20College%20of%20Law">Cincinnati Law School</a> in 1855, where he studied under <a href="Bellamy%20Storer%20%281796%E2%80%931875%29">Bellamy Storer</a>. While in Cincinnati, Weaver began to question his support for the institution of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>, a change biographers attribute to Storer's influence. After graduating in 1856, Weaver returned to Bloomfield and was admitted to the Iowa <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a>. By 1857, he broke with the Democratic party of his father to join the growing coalition that opposed the expansion of slavery, which became the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>.

Weaver traveled around southern Iowa in 1858, giving speeches on behalf of his new party's candidates. That summer, he married Clarrisa (Clara) Vinson, a schoolteacher from nearby <a href="Keosauqua%2C%20Iowa">Keosauqua, Iowa</a>, whom he had courted since he returned from Cincinnati. The marriage lasted until Weaver's death in 1912 and the couple had eight children. After the wedding, Weaver started a law firm with Hosea Horn and continued his involvement in Republican politics. He gave several speeches on behalf of <a href="Samuel%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJ.%20Kirkwood">Samuel J. Kirkwood</a> for governor in 1859 in a campaign that focused heavily on the slavery debate; although the Republicans lost Weaver's Davis County, Kirkwood narrowly won the election. The next year, Weaver served as a delegate to the state convention and, although not a national delegate, traveled with the Iowa delegation to the <a href="1860%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1860 Republican National Convention</a>, where <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> was nominated. Lincoln carried Iowa and won the election, but Southern states responded to the Republican victory by <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">seceding</a> from the Union. By April 1861, the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> had begun.

After the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">attack on Fort Sumter</a>, Lincoln called for 75,000 men to join the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>. Weaver enlisted in what became Company G of the <a href="2nd%20Iowa%20Volunteer%20Infantry%20Regiment">2nd Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment</a>, and was elected the <a href="Company%20%28military%20unit%29">company's</a> <a href="first%20lieutenant">first lieutenant</a>. The 2nd Iowa, commanded by <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20States%29">Colonel</a> <a href="Samuel%20Ryan%20Curtis">Samuel Ryan Curtis</a>, a former Congressman, was ordered to Missouri in June 1861 to secure railroad lines in that <a href="border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border state</a>. Weaver's unit spent that summer in northern Missouri and did not see action. In the meantime, Clara gave birth to the couple's second child and first son, named James Bellamy Weaver after his father and Bellamy Storer.

Weaver's first chance at action came in February 1862, when the 2nd Iowa joined <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Ulysses%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BS.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s army outside the Confederate <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Donelson">Fort Donelson</a> in Tennessee. Weaver's company was in the thick of the fight, which he described as a "holocaust to the demon of battles", and he took a minor wound in the arm. The rebels surrendered the next day, the most important Union victory of the war to date. The 2nd Iowa next joined other units in the area at <a href="Pittsburg%20Landing%2C%20Tennessee">Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee</a>, to mass for a major assault deeper into the South. Confederate forces met them there, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a>. Weaver's regiment was in the center of the Union lines, in the area later known as the "hornets' nest", and were forced to retreat amid fierce fighting. The next day, the Union forces turned the tide and forced the rebels off the field in what Weaver called a "perfect rout". The carnage at Shiloh—20,000 killed and wounded—was on a scale never before seen in American warfare, and both sides learned that the war would end neither quickly nor easily.

After Shiloh, Weaver and the 2nd Iowa slowly advanced to <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>, where he was promoted to <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a>. Rebel forces attacked the Union armies there in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Corinth">Second Battle of Corinth</a>, where Weaver's courage in that Union victory convinced his superiors to promote him to colonel after the regiment's commanding officer was killed. After Corinth, Weaver's unit took up garrison duty in northern Mississippi. In the summer of 1863, they were redeployed to the Tennessee–Alabama border, again on occupation duty around <a href="Pulaski%2C%20Tennessee">Pulaski, Tennessee</a>. They rejoined the action at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Resaca">Battle of Resaca</a>, a part of the <a href="Atlanta%20Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a>, then continued with <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>'s <a href="Sherman%27s%20March%20to%20the%20Sea">march through Georgia</a> to the sea in 1864. Weaver's enlistment ended in May 1864, and he returned to his family in Iowa. After the war ended, Weaver received a promotion to <a href="Brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> brigadier general, backdated to March 13, 1865.

Soon after returning from the war, Weaver became editor of a pro-Republican Bloomfield newspaper, the "Weekly Union Guard". At the 1865 Iowa Republican State Convention, he placed second for the nomination for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Iowa">lieutenant governor</a>. The following year, Weaver was elected district attorney for the second judicial district, covering six counties in southern Iowa. In 1867, President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> appointed him assessor of internal revenue in the first Congressional district, which extended across southeastern Iowa. The job came with a $1500 salary, plus a percentage of taxes collected over $100,000. Weaver held that lucrative position until 1872, when Congress abolished it. He also became involved in the <a href="Methodist%20Episcopal%20Church">Methodist Episcopal Church</a>, serving as a delegate to a church convention in Baltimore in 1876. Membership in the Methodist church coincided with Weaver's interest in the growing movement for <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">prohibition of the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages</a>. His income and prestige grew along with his family, which included seven children by 1877. Weaver's success allowed him to build <a href="James%20B.%20Weaver%20House">a large new home</a> for his family, which still stands.

Weaver's work for the party led many to support his nomination to represent <a href="Iowa%27s%206th%20congressional%20district">Iowa's 6th congressional district</a> in the federal <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a> in 1874. Many party insiders, however, were wary of Weaver's association with the Prohibition movement and preferred to remain uncommitted on the divisive issue. At the convention, Weaver led on the first ballot, but ultimately lost the nomination by one vote to <a href="Ezekiel%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BS.%20Sampson">Ezekiel S. Sampson</a>, a local judge. Weaver's allies attributed his loss to "the meanest kind of wire pulling", but Weaver shrugged off the defeat and aimed instead at the gubernatorial nomination in 1875. He launched a vigorous effort, courted delegates around the state, and explicitly endorsed Prohibition and greater state control of railroad rates. Weaver attracted many delegates' support, but alienated those who were friendly to the railroads and wished to avoid the liquor issue. Opposition was scattered among several lesser-known candidates, mostly members of Senator <a href="William%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BB.%20Allison">William B. Allison</a>'s conservative wing of the party. They united at the convention when a delegate unexpectedly nominated former governor Kirkwood. The nomination carried easily and, after Allison's associates persuaded him to accept it, Kirkwood was nominated, and went on to win the election. In a further defeat, the delegates refused to endorse Prohibition in the party platform. Weaver had small consolation in a nomination to the state Senate, but he lost to his Democratic opponent in the election that fall.

After his defeats in 1875, Weaver grew disenchanted with the Republican party, not only because it had spurned him, but also because of the policy choices of the dominant Allison faction. In May 1876, he traveled to Indianapolis to attend <a href="1876%20Greenback%20National%20Convention">the national convention</a> of the newly formed <a href="Greenback%20Party">Greenback Party</a>. The new party had arisen, mostly in the West, as a response to <a href="Long%20Depression">the economic depression</a> that followed the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a>. During the Civil War, Congress had authorized "<a href="greenback%20%28money%29">greenbacks</a>", a new form of <a href="fiat%20money">fiat money</a> that was redeemable not in gold but in government bonds. The greenbacks had helped to finance the war when the government's gold supply did not keep pace with the expanding costs of maintaining the armies. When the crisis had passed, many in both parties, especially in the East, wanted to place the nation's currency on a <a href="gold%20standard">gold standard</a> as soon as possible. The <a href="Specie%20Payment%20Resumption%20Act">Specie Payment Resumption Act</a>, passed in 1875, ordered that greenbacks be gradually withdrawn and replaced with gold-backed currency beginning in 1879. At the same time, the depression had made it more expensive for debtors to pay debts they had contracted when currency was less valuable. Beyond their support for a larger money supply, Greenbackers also favored an <a href="Eight-hour%20day">eight-hour work day</a>, safety regulations in factories, and an end to <a href="Child%20labour">child labor</a>. As historian Herbert Clancy put it, they "anticipated by almost fifty years the progressive legislation of the first quarter of the twentieth century".

In the 1876 presidential campaign, the Republicans nominated <a href="Rutherford%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BB.%20Hayes">Rutherford B. Hayes</a> and the Democrats chose <a href="Samuel%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJ.%20Tilden">Samuel J. Tilden</a>. Both candidates opposed the issuance of more greenbacks (candidates who favored the gold-backed currency were called "hard money" supporters, while the Greenbackers' policy of encouraging inflation was known as "soft money".) Weaver was impressed with the Greenbackers and their candidate, <a href="Peter%20Cooper">Peter Cooper</a>, but while he advocated some soft-money policies, he declined the Greenback nomination for Congress and remained a Republican; he campaigned for Hayes in the election that year. In 1877, Weaver attended the Republican state convention and saw the state party adopt a soft-money platform that also favored Prohibition. The gubernatorial nominee, however, was <a href="John%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BH.%20Gear">John H. Gear</a>, an opponent of Prohibition who had worked to defeat Weaver in his quest for the governorship two years earlier. After initially supporting Gear, Weaver joined the Greenback party in August. He gave speeches on behalf of his new party, debated former allies across the state, and establishing himself as a prominent advocate for the Greenback cause.

In May 1878, Weaver accepted the Greenback nomination for the House of Representatives in the 6th district. Although Weaver's political career up to then had been as a staunch Republican, Democrats in the 6th district thought that endorsing him was likely the only way to defeat Sampson, the incumbent Republican. Since the start of the Civil War, Democrats had been in the minority across Iowa; <a href="electoral%20fusion">electoral fusion</a> with Greenbackers represented their best chance to get their candidates into office. Hard-money Democrats objected to the idea, but some were reassured when Henry H. Trimble, a prominent Bloomfield Democrat, assured them that if elected Weaver would align with House Democrats on all issues other than the money question. Democrats declined to endorse any candidate at the 6th district convention, but soft-money leaders in the party circulated their own slate of candidates that included Democrats and Greenbackers. The Greenback–Democrat ticket prevailed, and Weaver was elected with 16,366 votes to Sampson's 14,307.

Weaver entered the <a href="46th%20United%20States%20Congress">46th Congress</a> in March 1879, one of thirteen Greenbackers elected in 1878. Although the House was closely divided, neither major party included the Greenbackers in their caucus, leaving them few committee assignments and little input on legislation. Weaver gave his first speech in April 1879, criticizing the use of the army to police Southern polling stations, while also decrying <a href="Disenfranchisement%20after%20the%20Reconstruction%20Era">the violence against black Southerners</a> that made such protection necessary; he then described the Greenback platform, which he said would put an end to the sectional and economic strife. The next month, he spoke in favor of a bill calling for an increase in the money supply by allowing the <a href="Free%20silver">unlimited coinage of silver</a>, but the bill was easily defeated. Weaver's oratorical skill drew praise, but he had no luck in advancing Greenback policy ideas.

In 1880, Weaver prepared a resolution stating that the government, not banks, should issue currency and determine its volume, and that the federal debt should be repaid in whatever currency the government chose, not just gold as the law then required. The proposed resolution would never be allowed to emerge from committees dominated by Democrats and Republicans, so Weaver planned to introduce it directly to the whole House for debate, as members were permitted to do every Monday. Rather than debate a proposition that would expose the monetary divide in the Democratic Party, <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker</a> <a href="Samuel%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJ.%20Randall">Samuel J. Randall</a> refused to recognize Weaver when he rose to propose the resolution. Weaver returned to the floor each succeeding Monday, with the same result, and the press took notice of Randall's obstruction. Eventually, Republican <a href="James%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Garfield">James A. Garfield</a> of Ohio interceded with Randall to recognize Weaver, which he reluctantly did on April 5, 1880. The Republicans, mostly united behind hard money, largely voted against the measure, while many Democrats joined the Greenbackers voting in favor. Despite support by the soft-money Democrats, the resolution was defeated 84–117 with many members abstaining. Although he lost the vote, Weaver had promoted the monetary issue in the national consciousness.

By 1879, the Greenback coalition had divided, with the faction most prominent in the South and West, led by <a href="Marcus%20M.%20Pomeroy">Marcus M. "Brick" Pomeroy</a>, splitting from the main party. Pomeroy's faction, called the "Union Greenback Labor Party", was more radical and emphasized its independence, and suggested that Eastern Greenbackers were likely to "sell out the party at any time to the Democrats". Weaver remained with the rump Greenback party, often called the "National Greenback Party", and the national reputation he had earned in Congress made him one of the party's leading presidential hopefuls.

The Union Greenbackers held their convention first and nominated <a href="Stephen%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BD.%20Dillaye">Stephen D. Dillaye</a> of New Jersey for president and <a href="Barzillai%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BJ.%20Chambers">Barzillai J. Chambers</a> of Texas for vice president, but also sent a delegation to the <a href="1880%20Greenback%20National%20Convention">National Greenback convention</a> in Chicago that June, with an eye toward reuniting the party. The two factions agreed to reunify, and also to admit a delegation from the <a href="Socialist%20Labor%20Party%20of%20America">Socialist Labor Party</a>. Thus united, the convention turned to nominations. Weaver led on the first ballot, and on the second he secured a majority. Chambers won the convention's vote for vice president.

In a departure from the political traditions of the day, Weaver himself campaigned, making speeches across the South in July and August. As the Greenbackers had the only ticket that included a Southerner, Weaver and Chambers hoped to make inroads in the South. As the campaign progressed, however, Weaver's message of racial inclusion drew violent protests in the South, as the Greenbackers faced the same obstacles the Republicans did in the face of increasing black disenfranchisement. In the autumn, Weaver campaigned in the North, but the Greenbackers' lack of support was compounded by Weaver's refusal to run a fusion ticket in states where Democratic and Greenbacker strength might have combined to outvote the Republicans.

Weaver received 305,997 votes and no electoral votes, compared to 4,446,158 for the winner, Republican James A. Garfield, and 4,444,260 for Democrat <a href="Winfield%20Scott%20Hancock">Winfield Scott Hancock</a>. The party was strongest in the West and South, but in no state did Weaver receive more than 12 percent of the vote (his best state was Texas, with 11.7 percent); his nationwide total was just 3 percent. That figure represented an improvement over the Greenback vote of 1876, but to Weaver, who expected twice as many votes as he received, it was a disappointment.

After the election, Weaver returned to the <a href="lame-duck%20session">lame-duck session</a> of Congress and proposed an unsuccessful <a href="constitutional%20amendment">constitutional amendment</a> that would have provided for the <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">direct election of Senators</a>. After his term expired in March, he resumed his speaking tour, promoting the Greenback Party across the nation. He and <a href="Edward%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BH.%20Gillette">Edward H. Gillette</a>, another Iowa Greenback Congressman, bought the "Iowa Tribune" in 1882 to help spread the Greenback message. That same year, Weaver ran for his old 6th district seat in the House against the incumbent Republican, <a href="Marsena%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BE.%20Cutts">Marsena E. Cutts</a>. This time the Democrats and Greenbackers ran separate candidates, and Weaver finished a distant second. Cutts died before taking office, and the Republicans offered to let Weaver run unopposed in the special election if he rejoined their party; he declined, and <a href="John%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BC.%20Cook">John C. Cook</a>, a Democrat, won the seat.

In 1883, Weaver was the Greenback nominee for governor of Iowa. Again, the Democrats ran a separate candidate and the incumbent Republican, <a href="Buren%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BR.%20Sherman">Buren R. Sherman</a>, was re-elected with a plurality. Weaver was a delegate to the <a href="1884%20Greenback%20National%20Convention">1884 Greenback National Convention</a> in Indianapolis and supported the eventual nominee, <a href="Benjamin%20Butler%20%28politician%29">Benjamin Butler</a> of Massachusetts. Back in Iowa, Weaver again ran for the House, this time with the Democrats' support. Greenback fortunes declined nationally, as Butler received just over half as many votes for president as Weaver had four years earlier. Weaver's House race bucked the trend: he defeated Republican <a href="Frank%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BT.%20Campbell">Frank T. Campbell</a> by just 67 votes.

Unlike in his previous congressional term, when Weaver entered the <a href="49th%20United%20States%20Congress">49th United States Congress</a>, he was the only Greenback member. The new president, Democrat <a href="Grover%20Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, was friendly to Weaver, and asked his advice on Iowa patronage. As it had been for years, Weaver's chief concern was with the nation's money and finance, and the relationship between labor and capital.

In 1885, he proposed the creation of a <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Labor">Department of Labor</a>, which he suggested would find a solution to disputes between labor and management. Labor tensions increased the following year as the <a href="Knights%20of%20Labor">Knights of Labor</a> went on strike against <a href="Jay%20Gould">Jay Gould</a>'s rail empire, and a strike against the <a href="International%20Harvester">McCormick Harvesting Machine Company</a> ended in the bloody <a href="Haymarket%20affair">Haymarket riot</a>. Weaver believed the nation's hard-money policies were responsible for labor unrest, calling it "purely a question of money, and nothing else" and declaring, "If this Congress will not protect labor, it must protect itself". He saw the triumph of one plank of the Greenback platform when Congress established the <a href="Interstate%20Commerce%20Commission">Interstate Commerce Commission</a> to regulate the railroads. Weaver thought the bill should have given the government more power, including the ability to set rates directly, but he voted for the final bill.
Weaver also took up the issue of white settlement in <a href="Indian%20Territory">Indian Territory</a>. For several years, white settlers had been claiming homesteads in the <a href="Unassigned%20Lands">Unassigned Lands</a> in what is now <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>. After the Civil War, the <a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> had been <a href="Reconstruction%20Treaties">forced to cede</a> their unused western lands to the federal government. The settlers, known as <a href="Boomers%20%28Oklahoma%20settlers%29">Boomers</a>, believed that federal ownership made the lands open to settlement under the <a href="Homestead%20Acts">Homestead Acts</a>. The federal government disagreed, as did the <a href="Cherokee%20Nation">Cherokee Nation</a>, which leased its neighboring <a href="Cherokee%20Outlet">Cherokee Outlet</a> to Kansas cattle ranchers, and many Easterners, who believed the Boomers to be the tools of railroad interests. Weaver saw the issue as one between the landless poor homesteaders and wealthy cattlemen, and took the side of the former. He introduced a bill in December 1885 to organize Indian Territory and the neighboring <a href="Oklahoma%20Panhandle">Neutral Strip</a> into a new <a href="Oklahoma%20Territory">Oklahoma Territory</a>. The bill died in committee, but Weaver reintroduced it in February 1886 and gave a speech calling for the Indian reservations to be broken up into homesteads for individual Natives and the remaining land to be open to white settlement.

The <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Territories">Committee on Territories</a> again rejected Weaver's bill, but approved a compromise measure that opened the Unassigned Lands, Cherokee Outlet, and Neutral Strip to settlement. Congress debated the bill over several months, while the tribes announced their resistance to their lands becoming a territory; according to an 1884 Supreme Court decision, "<a href="Elk%26amp%3Bnbsp%3Bv.%20Wilkins">Elk v. Wilkins</a>", Native Americans were not citizens, and thus would have no voting rights in the new territory. When Weaver returned to Iowa to campaign for re-election, the bill was still in limbo. Running again on a Democratic–Greenback fusion ticket, Weaver was re-elected to the House in 1886 with a 618-vote majority.

In the lame-duck session of 1887, Congress passed the <a href="Dawes%20Act">Dawes Act</a>, which allowed the president to terminate tribal governments, and broke up Indian reservations into homesteads for individual natives. Although the Five Civilized Tribes were exempt from the Act, the spirit of the law encouraged Weaver and the Boomers to continue their own efforts to open western Indian Territory to white settlement. Weaver reintroduced his Oklahoma bill in <a href="50th%20United%20States%20Congress">the new Congress</a> the following year, but again it stalled in committee. He returned to Iowa for another re-election campaign in September 1888, but the Greenback party had fallen apart, replaced by a new left-wing <a href="Third%20party%20%28United%20States%29">third party</a>, the <a href="Labor%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%2019th%20century%29">Union Labor Party</a>. In Iowa's 6th district, the new party agreed to fuse with Democrats to nominate Weaver, but this time the Republicans were stronger. Their candidate, <a href="John%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BF.%20Lacey">John F. Lacey</a>, was elected with an 828-vote margin. The Union Laborites and their presidential candidate, <a href="Alson%20Streeter">Alson Streeter</a>, fared poorly nationally as well, and the new party soon dissolved. Weaver returned to Congress for the lame-duck session and once more pushed to organize the Oklahoma Territory. This time he prevailed, as the House voted 147–102 to open the Unassigned Lands to homesteaders. The Senate followed suit and President Cleveland, who was about to leave office, signed the bill into law.

The new president, Republican <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>, set April 22, 1889, as the date when the <a href="Land%20Rush%20of%201889">rush for the Unassigned Lands</a> would begin. Weaver arrived at a railroad station in the territory in March with an eye toward relocating there. The would-be homesteaders welcomed him with great acclaim. Although settlers were not allowed to stake claims before noon on April 22, many scouted out the land ahead of time, and even marked off informal claims; Weaver was among them. After the rush, settlers who had waited challenged the claims of the "<a href="Sooners">Sooners</a>" who had entered early. Weaver's identification with the group harmed his popularity in the territory. His claim was ultimately denied, and he returned to Iowa in 1890.

Weaver and his wife moved their household in 1890 from Bloomfield to <a href="Colfax%2C%20Iowa">Colfax</a>, near Des Moines, as the former Congressman took up more active management of the "Iowa Tribune". The Greenback and Union Labor parties were defunct, but he still proselytized for their ideals. In August 1890, Weaver addressed a convention in Des Moines where former Greenbackers and Laborites gathered, although he declined their nomination for Congress. The economic conditions that had created the Greenback party had not gone away; many farmers and laborers believed their situation had gotten worse since the Long Depression began in 1873. Many farmers had joined the <a href="Farmers%27%20Alliance">Farmers' Alliance</a>, which sought to promote soft-money ideas on a non-partisan basis; rather than create a third party, they endorsed major party candidates who supported their ideas and hired speakers to educate the public. Alliance-backed candidates did well in the 1890 elections, especially in the South, where Democrats endorsed by the Alliance won 44 seats.

Alliance members gathered that December in <a href="Ocala%2C%20Florida">Ocala, Florida</a>, and formulated a platform, later called the <a href="Ocala%20Demands">Ocala Demands</a>, that called for looser money, government control of the railroads, a <a href="graduated%20income%20tax">graduated income tax</a>, and the direct election of senators. Weaver endorsed the message in the "Tribune" and corresponded with the group's leader, <a href="Leonidas%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BL.%20Polk">Leonidas L. Polk</a>. Weaver attended the group's convention in Cincinnati in May 1891, where he and Polk argued against forming a third party. Another delegate, <a href="Ignatius%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BL.%20Donnelly">Ignatius L. Donnelly</a>, argued forcefully for a break from the two major parties, and his argument carried the day, although Weaver and Polk kept many of Donnelly's more radical proposals out of the convention's statement of principles.

The following year, Weaver accepted the decision to form a new party (called the <a href="People%27s%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">People's Party</a> or Populist Party) and published a book, "A Call to Action", detailing the party's principles and castigating the "few haughty millionaires who are gathering up the riches of the new world". He attended <a href="1892%20Populist%20National%20Convention">their convention</a> in <a href="Omaha%2C%20Nebraska">Omaha, Nebraska</a>, in July 1892. After Polk’s sudden death in June, Weaver was considered the front-runner for the nomination. He was nominated on the first ballot, easily besting his closest rival, Senator <a href="James%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BH.%20Kyle">James H. Kyle</a> of South Dakota. Weaver accepted the nomination and promised to "visit every state in the Union and carry the banner of the people into the enemy's camp". The vice presidential nomination went to <a href="James%20G.%20Field">James G. Field</a>, a Confederate veteran and former <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Virginia">Attorney General of Virginia</a>.

The <a href="Omaha%20Platform">platform adopted in Omaha</a> was ambitious for its time, calling for a <a href="Progressive%20tax">graduated income tax</a>, public ownership of the railroads, telegraph, and telephone systems, government-issued currency, and the unlimited coinage of silver (the idea that the United States would buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins) at a favorable 16-to-1 ratio with gold. The Republicans nominated Harrison for re-election, and the Democrats put forward ex-President Cleveland; as in 1880, Weaver was confident of a good showing for the new party against their opponents. Harrison had shown some favor to the free silver cause, but his party largely supported the hard-money gold standard; Cleveland was solidly for gold, but his running mate, <a href="Adlai%20Stevenson%20I">Adlai Stevenson</a> of Illinois, was a silverite. Against these, the Populist Party stood alone as undisputed partisans of soft money, which Weaver hoped would lead to success in rural areas. Further, as <a href="Homestead%20Strike">labor disturbances broke out in Homestead, Pennsylvania</a>, and elsewhere, Weaver hoped urban laborers would rally to the Populist cause.

Weaver embarked on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, the issue of race hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to <a href="Lynching%20in%20the%20United%20States">lynchings</a>. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, but he and his wife were also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver as a threat to <a href="Redeemers">the conservative Democrats in power there</a>; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.

On election day, Cleveland triumphed, carrying the entire South and many Northern states. Weaver’s performance was better than that of any third party candidate since the Civil War, as he won over a million votes—8.5 percent of the total cast nationwide. In four states, he won a plurality, giving the Populists the electoral votes of <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a>, and <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a> along with two more votes from <a href="North%20Dakota">North Dakota</a> and <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>: twenty-two in total. Weaver believed the performance "a surprising success", and thought it portended good results in future elections. "Unaided by money," he said afterward, "our grand young party has made an enviable record and achieved a surprising success at the polls."

Weaver believed that the Populists' embrace of free silver would be the main issue to attract new members to the party. After the election, he attended a meeting of the <a href="American%20Bimetallic%20League">American Bimetallic League</a>, a pro-silver group, and gave speeches advocating an inflationist monetary policy. In the meantime, the <a href="Panic%20of%201893">Panic of 1893</a> caused bank failures, factory closures, and general economic upheaval. As the federal gold reserves dwindled, President Cleveland convinced Congress to repeal the <a href="Sherman%20Silver%20Purchase%20Act">Sherman Silver Purchase Act</a>, which ensured the government would purchase less silver for coining and which further disconcerted free silver supporters. While depletion of gold reserves slowed after the repeal, the country's economy still floundered.

The next year, 1894, saw pay cuts and labor disturbances, including a <a href="Pullman%20Strike">massive strike</a> by the workers at the Pullman Company. A group of unemployed workers, known as <a href="Coxey%27s%20Army">Coxey's Army</a>, marched on Washington that spring. Weaver met with them in Iowa and expressed sympathy with the movement, so long as they refrained from lawbreaking. He then returned to the campaign trail, stumping for Populist candidates in the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives%20elections%2C%201894">1894 midterm elections</a>. The election proved disastrous for the Democrats, but most of the gains went to the Republicans rather than to the Populists, who gained a few seats in the South but lost ground in the West. During the election, Weaver became friendly with <a href="William%20Jennings%20Bryan">William Jennings Bryan</a>, a Democratic Congressman from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.

Weaver privately supported Bryan's quest for the Democratic nomination <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201896">in 1896</a>, which <a href="1896%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">their convention</a> awarded him on the fifth ballot. When <a href="1896%20Populist%20National%20Convention">the Populist convention</a> gathered the next month in Chicago, they divided between endorsing the silverite Democrat and preserving their new party's independence. Weaver backed the former course, holding the issues the party stood for to be of more importance than the party itself. A majority of delegates agreed, but without the enthusiasm that had marked their convention of four years earlier. At the same time, Weaver joined with anti-fusionists to keep the Populist platform from deviating from the party's ideological principles. Against the fusion candidate stood Republican <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> of Ohio, a hard-money conservative. Bryan succeeded in uniting the South and West, Weaver's longtime dream, but with the more populous North solidly behind McKinley, Bryan lost the election.

Despite the loss, Weaver still believed the Populist cause would triumph. He agreed to be nominated one last time for his old 6th district House seat on a Democratic-Populist fusion ticket. As he had ten years earlier, Republican John Lacey defeated Weaver. In 1900, Weaver attended a convention of fusionist Populists in <a href="Sioux%20Falls%2C%20South%20Dakota">Sioux Falls, South Dakota</a>, the party having split on the issue of cooperation with the Democrats. The fusionists backed Bryan, the Democratic nominee, but he lost again to McKinley, this time by a greater margin. The following year, Weaver was elected to office for the last time as the mayor of his hometown, <a href="Colfax%2C%20Iowa">Colfax, Iowa</a>.

The Republican Party's popularity after the victory in the <a href="Spanish%E2%80%93American%20War">Spanish–American War</a> led Weaver, for the first time, to doubt that populist values would eventually prevail. With the demise of the Populist Party, Weaver became a Democrat and was a delegate to the <a href="1904%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1904 Democratic National Convention</a>. He was displeased at the party's nominee, <a href="Alton%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BB.%20Parker">Alton B. Parker</a>, whom he thought "plutocratic", but Weaver supported his unsuccessful campaign nevertheless. He gave serious consideration to running for the House again that year, but decided against it. In 1908, he supported Bryan's third campaign as the Democratic nominee for president, but it, too, was unsuccessful.

That same year, Weaver and his wife, Clara, celebrated their fiftieth wedding anniversary, surrounded by six of their children. The Iowa legislature honored him in 1909, and hung a portrait of him in the <a href="Ola%20Babcock%20Miller%20Building">Iowa State Historical Building</a>. He wrote a history of Jasper County, Iowa, where he lived, which was published in 1912. Weaver planned to campaign on behalf of Democratic candidates that year, but did not have the chance. On February 6, while visiting his daughter in Des Moines, he died. After a funeral at the <a href="First%20United%20Methodist%20Church%20%28Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa%29">First Methodist Church</a> in Des Moines, Weaver was buried in that city's <a href="Woodland%20Cemetery%20%28Des%20Moines%2C%20Iowa%29">Woodland Cemetery</a>.

Many of Iowa's leading statesmen, including Weaver's former adversaries, praised him at his funeral and in the years thereafter. Fusion with the Democrats had brought Populist policy into the mainstream, and several of the policies for which Weaver fought became law after his death, including the direct election of Senators, a graduated income tax, and a monetary policy not based on the gold standard; others, such as public ownership of the railroads and telephone companies, were never enacted. In a 2008 biography, Robert B. Mitchell wrote that "Weaver's legacy cannot be assessed using conventional measures" as much of what he fought for did not come to pass until after his death. Even so, Mitchell credits Weaver for beginning the political effort that led to those changes: "Weaver's most important legacy in national politics is not what he advocated, or how subsequent reforms worked, but his effect on America's continuing political conversation."

Titchwell Marsh

Titchwell Marsh is an English <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a> owned and managed by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a> (RSPB). Located on the north coast of the county of <a href="Norfolk">Norfolk</a>, between the villages of <a href="Titchwell">Titchwell</a> and <a href="Thornham%2C%20Norfolk">Thornham</a>, about east of the seaside resort of <a href="Hunstanton">Hunstanton</a>, its include <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a>s, <a href="Salt%20marsh">saltmarshes</a>, a freshwater <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a> and sandy beach, with a small woodland area near the car park. This internationally important reserve is part of the North Norfolk Coast <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) and the <a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20AONB">Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB), and is also protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) and <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> listings.

The reserve is important for some scarce breeding birds, such as <a href="pied%20avocet">pied avocet</a>s on the islands, and <a href="western%20marsh%20harrier">western marsh harrier</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20bittern">Eurasian bittern</a>s and <a href="bearded%20reedling">bearded reedling</a>s in the reeds. To encourage bitterns to breed, the reed beds have been improved to make them wetter, and the lagoon has been stocked with the <a href="common%20rudd">common rudd</a>. Typical wetland birds such as the <a href="water%20rail">water rail</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20reed%20warbler">reed warbler</a> and <a href="sedge%20warbler">sedge warbler</a> also appear, and <a href="little%20egret">little egret</a>s are common. The reserve has regularly attracted rarities, as its location is important for <a href="bird%20migration">migrating birds</a>. Ducks and geese winter at Titchwell in considerable numbers, and the reserve shelters the endangered <a href="European%20water%20vole">European water vole</a>.

Facilities include three <a href="bird%20hide">bird hide</a>s, a <a href="seawatching">seawatching</a> platform, two nature trails, and a <a href="Visitor%20center">visitor centre</a>. Because of concerns about <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, a major project in 2010 and 2011 brought improvements to the banks around the freshwater lagoon and the conversion of the <a href="brackish%20water">brackish</a> lagoon to tidal saltmarsh, a more effective barrier to encroachment by the sea.

Titchwell Marsh is <a href="archaeology">archaeologically</a> significant, with artefacts dating back to the <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a>, and has remains of military constructions from both world wars. These include brickwork from a <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> military hospital and 1940s artillery targets for <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a>s and warplanes in the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>.

Titchwell has a long history of human occupation. Populations of both <a href="anatomically%20modern%20humans">Modern</a> and <a href="Neanderthal">Neanderthal</a> people were present in Norfolk before the last <a href="glacial%20period">glaciation</a> between 100,000 and 10,000 years ago, and returned as the ice retreated north. The <a href="archaeological%20record">archaeological record</a> is poor until about 20,000 years ago, partly due to the prevailing conditions, but also because the coastline was much further north than at present, so that many sites are now under the sea. Early <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> <a href="flint">flint</a> tools with characteristic <a href="Blade%20%28archaeology%29">blades</a> up to long found on the present-day coast at Titchwell date from a time when it was from the sea. Other flint tools have been found dating from the <a href="Upper%20Paleolithic">Upper Paleolithic</a> to the <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a>. As the ice retreated during the Mesolithic, the sea level rose, filling what is now the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a>, and bringing the Norfolk coastline much closer to its present line; the remains of submerged forests can still be detected at low tide. By 11,000 BC, the makers of the long blades had gone, and peat marshes had formed behind an offshore <a href="barrier%20island">barrier island</a> or spit. A layer of peat formed between 1920 and 1680 BC and another between 1020 and 830 BC, indicating marshy conditions; polished Neolithic axes found in those layers were blackened by exposure to the peat.

Two possible timber platforms were identified within the peat at Titchwell, and may be prehistoric. Similar <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> structures are rare, and they may be significant in providing information about early timber construction methods. <a href="Medieval">Medieval</a> and later pottery has been found at Titchwell, and the peat and <a href="silt">silt</a>s which overlay the <a href="sediment">sediment</a>s deposited by the retreating <a href="glacier">glacier</a>s have signs of post-medieval ploughing.

The draining of Norfolk's coastal marshes commenced in the late 17th and 18th centuries, and sea defences including the "Old Lord's Bank" at Titchwell were shown in maps from 1786 and 1797. For the next 170 years or so, the reclaimed marsh was <a href="arable%20land">arable</a>, producing crops and beef cattle. A huge influx of <a href="Pallas%27s%20sandgrouse">Pallas's sandgrouse</a> into Britain in 1853 led to several arrivals at Titchwell, including mated pairs. The last bird seen was on the saltmarsh, and the rest were on the dunes or in <a href="Ammophila%20%28Poaceae%29">marram grass</a>; many were shot.

Thornham Marsh, immediately west of Titchwell, was used between 1914 and 1918 by the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> as a <a href="bombing%20range">bombing range</a>. Some brickwork on Titchwell Marsh is all that remains of a military hospital dating from that period. A First World War concrete building along the west bank was let as holiday accommodation until the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> returned in 1942.

During the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, military defences were constructed at Titchwell. The drainage of farmland behind the banks was stopped, reflooding the former marshland; zigzag ditches were dug, and <a href="British%20hardened%20field%20defences%20of%20World%20War%20II">pillboxes</a> built into Old Lord's Bank. Between 1942 and 1945, the marsh was used by the <a href="Royal%20Tank%20Regiment">Royal Tank Regiment</a>; an <a href="armoured%20fighting%20vehicle">armoured fighting vehicle</a> gunnery range was established and new banks were constructed for firing practice, with targets set at intervals. Some of the still extant islands were built to hold "pop-up" targets, operated by cables from winches in a building whose foundations lie below Island Hide. Remains of the triangular concrete track used by the tanks also survive. Military activities continued after the war, with the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> returning to Thornham Marsh between 1950 and 1959. Bombing practice was supervised from a control tower, which was demolished in 1962, leaving only a concrete structure opposite the end of Titchwell's west bank. The remains of two Second World War <a href="Covenanter%20tank">Covenanter tank</a>s, probably used as targets, are sometimes exposed at low tide.

The wreck of the SS "Vina", a cargo steamer built in 1894, can be seen at low tide. In 1944, she was anchored offshore for use as an RAF <a href="target%20ship">target</a> when a gale dragged her to her present location and sank her. After the war, some of the wreck was salvaged as scrap. The remains of the "Vina" are accessible at low tide, but visiting them is potentially hazardous as the wreck is quickly cut off and submerged by the incoming tide. A warning sign on the wreck advises anyone reaching it to return to the beach immediately.

Behind the sea wall, the marshes were drained after the war, and reverted to farmland, but the bank was breached in the <a href="North%20Sea%20flood%20of%201953">North Sea flood of 1953</a>, returning the whole area to tidal saltmarsh dominated by <a href="Aster%20tripolium">sea aster</a>. The construction of a new sea wall across the reserve created a shallow freshwater lagoon, with a <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a> on its northern side and a vegetation-free brackish marsh.

Between 1970 and 1972, a pair of <a href="Montagu%27s%20harrier">Montagu's harrier</a>s, Britain's rarest breeding <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, nested in the reed bed. The RSPB bought the reserve in 1973 for £53,000 (£,000 in 20). The Montagu's harriers did not return, but <a href="western%20marsh%20harrier">marsh harriers</a> did, and the RSPB commenced improving the habitat and facilities, including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then still very rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 to cope with the numbers of visitors.

In 1991, the sea broke through the dunes at the eastern end of the beach near the former Tern Hide, and the dunes started to <a href="erosion">erode</a>. The remains of the Second World War tanks first appeared around this time. In the following year the boardwalk at the beach end of the west bank was constructed to protect the dunes, and the <a href="seawatching">seawatching</a> platform was added at its northern end. of land to the east of the reserve was bought in 1993; much of this was formerly part of the firing range, and large amounts of <a href="barbed%20wire">barbed wire</a> caused problems when the area was being converted to reed bed and wet grazing meadow. Over the winter, an old hide on the West Bank was demolished and replaced with the current Island Hide. Storms in February 1996 removed most of the dunes east of the boardwalk, and eroded those to the west. The Tern Hide, now cut off at high tide, was dismantled. Developments at the end of the 20th century included the 1997 extension of the visitor centre, which included building a cafe, and the erection of Fen Hide in 1999, together with a boardwalk path to the hide, and a dragonfly pond.

The reserve covers , and is of international importance for its breeding and wintering birds. It was designated as a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI) in 1973, and in 1986 it was subsumed into the North Norfolk Coast SSSI. The larger area is now additionally protected through <a href="Natura%202000">Natura 2000</a>, <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a> (SPA) and <a href="Ramsar%20Convention">Ramsar</a> listings, and is part of the <a href="Norfolk%20Coast%20AONB">Norfolk Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> (AONB). This is the RSPB's most visited reserve, with about 92,000 visitors annually.

Titchwell Marsh is next to the <a href="A149%20road">A149 road</a> and buses stop outside the reserve. The main track to the beach is a public <a href="Right%20of%20way%20%28public%20throughway%29">right-of-way</a>, and the only part of the reserve where dogs are permitted. The reserve is open all year, and access is free, although non-members are charged for using the car park. The main part of the reserve is accessed from the visitor centre using the 1 km (1,050 yd) West Bank footpath. After leaving the woodland around the visitor centre, there are two short paths running from the main path; the Fen Trail to a hide overlooking the reed bed, and the Meadow Trail boardwalk loop through wet marsh and past the dragonfly pond. The main footpath continues north past the reedbed to the freshwater lagoon and the Island Hide, then reaches a bank running across the reserve. The new Parrinder hides are placed along this wall. The footpath continues past a tidal lagoon, and over another bank to a saltmarsh, formerly ending at a raised wooden seawatching platform on the dunes by the beach.

The visitor centre and shop are open daily except Christmas Day and <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a>. Most of the reserve and its facilities are <a href="accessibility">wheelchair accessible</a>, but the last part of the path to the beach is rough, and accessed via a steep bank.

The key breeding species are reed bed specialists such as the marsh harrier, Eurasian bittern and bearded reedling, together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat and a lack of sufficient large food fish; although <a href="European%20eel">European eel</a>s, a favoured food, are present, the numbers are too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully <a href="fledge">fledging</a> seven young.

Other breeding birds include <a href="common%20ringed%20plover">ringed plovers</a> and <a href="Eurasian%20oystercatcher">Eurasian oystercatcher</a>s in the sand dunes, and <a href="water%20rail">water rail</a>s in the reed bed. <a href="Sedge%20warbler">Sedge</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20reed%20warbler">reed</a> and <a href="Cetti%27s%20warbler">Cetti's warbler</a>s all nest in the wetland, and <a href="little%20egret">little egret</a>s are now common on the reserve. In early summer, scarcer <a href="bird%20migration">migrants</a> like the <a href="little%20gull">little gull</a>, <a href="black%20tern">black tern</a>, <a href="Eurasian%20spoonbill">Eurasian spoonbill</a>s and <a href="garganey">garganey</a> may pass through on their way to breed elsewhere.

In the autumn, species arrive from the north, some, such as <a href="black-tailed%20godwit">black-tailed godwit</a>s, <a href="curlew%20sandpiper">curlew sandpiper</a>s and <a href="little%20stint">little stint</a>s just passing through, pausing for a few days to refuel, others staying for the winter. This is also a good time to see bearded reedlings. Offshore, <a href="Great%20skua">great</a> and <a href="Arctic%20skua">Arctic skua</a>s, <a href="northern%20gannet">northern gannet</a>s and <a href="black-legged%20kittiwake">black-legged kittiwake</a>s may pass close by in favourable winds.

Large numbers of ducks winter on the reserve, including many <a href="Eurasian%20wigeon">Eurasian wigeon</a>s, <a href="Eurasian%20teal">Eurasian teal</a>s, <a href="mallard">mallard</a>s and <a href="gadwall">gadwall</a>s, and smaller counts of <a href="common%20goldeneye">goldeneyes</a> and <a href="northern%20pintail">northern pintail</a>s. Offshore, there may be large "rafts" of <a href="common%20scoter">common scoter</a>s, and smaller numbers of <a href="common%20eider">common eider</a>s, <a href="long-tailed%20duck">long-tailed duck</a>s, <a href="velvet%20scoter">velvet scoter</a>s and <a href="red-throated%20loon">red-throated divers</a>. <a href="Brant%20goose">Brent geese</a> feed on <a href="Ulva">sea lettuce</a> and other <a href="green%20algae">green algae</a>, and hundreds of <a href="European%20golden%20plover">European golden plover</a>s may roost on the reserve at high tide. In the evenings, large flocks of <a href="pink-footed%20goose">pink-footed geese</a> fly over Titchwell on their way to roost, and <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a>s and <a href="northern%20harrier">hen harriers</a> quarter the marshes. This is the season for flocks of <a href="lesser%20redpoll">lesser redpoll</a>s, sometimes accompanied by a rarer <a href="common%20redpoll">common redpoll</a>, and <a href="snow%20bunting">snow bunting</a>s are to be found on the beach.

The reserve's location means that <a href="bird%20migration">migrants</a> may be found, sometimes in huge numbers when the weather conditions are right. These may include <a href="vagrant%20species">vagrant</a> rarities. A <a href="black-winged%20stilt">black-winged stilt</a>, which acquired the nickname "Sammy", arrived in 1993 and became a permanent resident up to its disappearance in 2005. Other rarities in recent years include a <a href="Baird%27s%20sandpiper">Baird's sandpiper</a>, a <a href="broad-billed%20sandpiper">broad-billed sandpiper</a>, a <a href="thrush%20nightingale">thrush nightingale</a> and an <a href="Arctic%20redpoll">Arctic redpoll</a>, all in 2004, a <a href="stilt%20sandpiper">stilt sandpiper</a> in 2005, and a <a href="black-winged%20pratincole">black-winged pratincole</a> and a <a href="western%20yellow%20wagtail">black-headed wagtail</a> in 2009.

<a href="European%20water%20vole">Water voles</a> are a highly threatened species in the UK, with a huge decline in numbers, mainly due to predation by the introduced <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a>. They are still common at Titchwell, which is one of a number of <a href="East%20Anglia">East Anglia</a>n sites now of national importance for this species. Both <a href="harbour%20seal">common</a> and <a href="grey%20seal">grey seal</a>s can be seen off the beach. Other <a href="vertebrate">vertebrate</a>s include <a href="European%20eel">European eel</a>s, <a href="common%20toad">common toad</a>s and <a href="three-spined%20stickleback">three-spined stickleback</a>s.

In summer, the dragonfly pond can hold up to ten species of <a href="Odonata">dragonflies and damselflies</a>. The nationally scarce moth <a href="Senta%20flammea">flame wainscot</a> has bred at Titchwell since 1996; other <a href="Lepidoptera">Lepidoptera</a> may include migrants such as the <a href="Vanessa%20cardui">painted lady</a>, the <a href="diamondback%20moth">diamondback moth</a>, and especially the <a href="silver%20Y">silver Y</a>, which can occur in huge numbers; 90,000 were recorded on the reserve in July 2010, feeding on <a href="Limonium%20binervosum">sea lavender</a>.

The saltmarsh contains <a href="Salicornia">glassworts</a> and <a href="Spartina%20anglica">common cord grass</a> in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with <a href="Halimione%20portulacoides">sea purslane</a> in the creeks and smaller areas of <a href="Plantago%20maritima">sea plantain</a> and other common marsh plants. The drier areas contain maritime grasses such as <a href="Agropyron%20pungens">sea couch grass</a> and <a href="Puccinellia%20maritima">sea poa grass</a>. The reedbeds are dominated by <a href="Phragmites">common reed</a> with <a href="Juncus%20gerardii">saltmarsh rush</a>, <a href="Ranunculus%20peltatus">brackish water crowfoot</a>, <a href="Bolboschoenus%20maritimus">sea clubrush</a> and <a href="Typha%20latifolia">common bulrush</a> also common in the various wetland habitats.

As the RSPB's busiest reserve, Titchwell Marsh has a significant economic impact on its locality. A 2002 survey reported that an estimated 137,700 visitors spent £1.8 million locally in 1998. The tiny village of <a href="Titchwell">Titchwell</a> has two three-star hotels and a shop selling <a href="telescope">telescope</a>s and <a href="binoculars">binoculars</a>, although it does not have a general store or a <a href="public%20house">public house</a>.

A 2005 survey at Titchwell and five other North Norfolk coastal sites found that 39 per cent of visitors gave <a href="birdwatching">birdwatching</a> as the main purpose of their visit. The 7.7 million day visitors and 5.5 million who made overnight stays in the area in 1999 are estimated to have spent £122 million, and created the equivalent of 2,325 full-time jobs.

The soft rocks of the North Norfolk coast have been attacked by the sea for centuries; at Titchwell Marsh, the beach and sand dunes protecting the northern edge of the reserve have been eroded, and <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a> has increased the likelihood of damage to the freshwater areas of the reserve. The predicted increasingly stormy weather could damage the dune system and expose the soft earth banks to wave damage, or the sea could just over-top the defences, as it did in the 1953 floods. Either way, the <a href="Conservation%20%28ethic%29">conservation</a> value of the reserve would be adversely affected, especially through the potential loss of the bitterns. Rather than reinforce the outer bank, it was decided to undertake a managed realignment. Between 2010 and 2011, the banks on the east and west of the reserve were reinforced, and the sea wall to the north of the fresh marsh was rebuilt on the line of the old Parrinder bank. The old Parrinder Hide was replaced by a pair of modern hides, retaining the original name. Designed by HaysomWardMiller, these hides won an award from <a href="RIBA">RIBA</a> for their architectural style. The former <a href="brackish%20water">brackish</a> marsh north of the new wall has been modified by creating a breach in the east bank. This will allow tidal flooding and the eventual establishment of saltmarsh on what is now named Volunteer Marsh. The new saltmarsh will protect the rebuilt Parrinder wall, slowing erosion. Nevertheless, it is estimated that by 2060 the beach may have advanced halfway across the new tidal area. Other improvements were made to the reed beds and islands in the freshwater lagoon, and a new <a href="sluice">sluice</a> was installed. New reedbeds were created east of Fen Hide, which can be accessed by trails opened in 2012. The first part of the trail is open all year, but the "autumn trail", running up from the woodland in the southeastern corner of the reserve, is accessible only from August to October.

John Barbirolli

Sir John Barbirolli, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">CH</a> (2 December 189929 July 1970), "né" Giovanni Battista Barbirolli, was a British conductor and <a href="cellist">cellist</a>. He is remembered above all as conductor of the <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a> in Manchester, which he helped save from dissolution in 1943 and conducted for the rest of his life. Earlier in his career he was <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>'s successor as music director of the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic</a>, serving from 1936 to 1943. He was also chief conductor of the <a href="Houston%20Symphony">Houston Symphony</a> from 1961 to 1967, and was a guest conductor of many other orchestras, including the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a>, <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>, the <a href="Philharmonia%20Orchestra">Philharmonia</a>, the <a href="Berlin%20Philharmonic">Berlin Philharmonic</a> and the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic">Vienna Philharmonic</a>, with all of which he made recordings.

Born in London of Italian and French parentage, Barbirolli grew up in a family of professional musicians. After starting out as a cellist, he was given the chance to conduct, from 1926 with the <a href="British%20National%20Opera%20Company">British National Opera Company</a>, and then with <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a>'s touring company. On taking up the conductorship of the Hallé he had less opportunity to work in the opera house, but in the 1950s he conducted productions of works by <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a>, <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, <a href="Christoph%20Willibald%20Gluck">Gluck</a>, and <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Puccini</a> at Covent Garden with such success that he was invited to become the company's permanent musical director, an invitation he declined. Late in his career he made several recordings of operas, of which his 1967 set of Puccini's "<a href="Madama%20Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a>" for <a href="EMI">EMI</a> is probably the best known.

Both in the concert hall and on record, Barbirolli was particularly associated with the music of English composers such as <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Delius</a> and <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Vaughan Williams</a>. His interpretations of other late romantic composers, such as <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> and <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a>, as well as of earlier classical composers, including <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>, are also still admired.

Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in <a href="Southampton%20Row">Southampton Row</a>, <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a>, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of <a href="Bow%20Bells">Bow Bells</a>, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a <a href="Cockney">Cockney</a>. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1928), was a <a href="Venice">Venetian</a> violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, "née" Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at <a href="La%20Scala">La Scala</a>, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of "<a href="Otello">Otello</a>" in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the <a href="Empire%2C%20Leicester%20Square">Empire, Leicester Square</a>.

The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from "getting in everybody's way". His education at <a href="St%20Clement%20Danes%20School">St. Clement Danes Grammar School</a> overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at <a href="Trinity%20College%20of%20Music">Trinity College of Music</a>. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a>, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" singled him out as "that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli." The principal of the Academy, <a href="Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28composer%29">Sir Alexander Mackenzie</a>, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a>, which he regarded as "a pernicious influence". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's <a href="String%20Quartet%20%28Ravel%29">String Quartet</a> in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.

From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London. He recalled, "My first orchestral engagement was with the Queen's Hall Orchestra – I was probably the youngest orchestral musician ever, joining them in 1916. We had an enormous repertory – six concerts a week, three hours or more rehearsal a day. In those days we were happy if we began and finished together". While playing in the Queen's Hall Orchestra, Barbirolli also played in the opera pit for the <a href="Beecham%20Opera%20Company">Beecham</a> and <a href="Carl%20Rosa%20Opera%20Company">Carl Rosa</a> opera companies, in recitals with the pianist <a href="Bartlett%20and%20Robertson">Ethel Bartlett</a>, with orchestras in theatres, cinemas, hotels and dance-halls, and, as he said, "everywhere except the street". During the last year of the First World War, Barbirolli enlisted in the army and became a lance-corporal in the <a href="Suffolk%20Regiment">Suffolk Regiment</a>. Here he had his first opportunity to conduct, when an orchestra of volunteers was formed. He later described the experience:

While in the army, Barbirolli adopted the anglicised form of his first name for the sake of simplicity: "The sergeant-major had great difficulty in reading my name on the roll-call. 'Who is this Guy Vanni?' he used to ask. So I chose John." After demobilisation he reverted to the original form of his name, using it until 1922.

On re-entering civilian life, Barbirolli resumed his career as a cellist. His association with <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Edward Elgar</a>'s <a href="Cello%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">Cello Concerto</a> began with its première in 1919, when he played as a rank and file member of the <a href="London%20Symphony%20Orchestra">London Symphony Orchestra</a>. He was the soloist at another performance of the concerto just over a year later. "The Musical Times" commented, "Signor Giovanni Barbirolli was not entirely equal to the demands of the solo music, but his playing unquestionably gave a considerable amount of pleasure." At the <a href="Three%20Choirs%20Festival">Three Choirs Festival</a> of 1920 he took part in his first "<a href="The%20Dream%20of%20Gerontius">Dream of Gerontius</a>", under Elgar's baton, in the LSO cellos. He joined two newly founded string quartets as cellist: the Kutcher Quartet, led by his former fellow student at Trinity, Samuel Kutcher, and the Music Society Quartet (later called the International Quartet) led by André Mangeot. He also made several early broadcasts with Mangeot's quartet.

Barbirolli's ambition was to conduct. He was the prime mover in establishing the Guild of Singers and Players Chamber Orchestra in 1924, and in 1926 he was invited to conduct a new ensemble at the Chenil Gallery in <a href="Chelsea%2C%20London">Chelsea</a>, initially called the "Chenil Chamber Orchestra" but later renamed "John Barbirolli's Chamber Orchestra". Barbirolli's concerts impressed <a href="Frederic%20Austin">Frederic Austin</a>, director of the <a href="British%20National%20Opera%20Company">British National Opera Company</a> (BNOC), who in the same year invited him to conduct some performances with the company. Barbirolli had never conducted a chorus or a large orchestra, but had the confidence to accept. He made his operatic debut directing <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Gounod</a>'s "<a href="Rom%C3%A9o%20et%20Juliette">Roméo et Juliette</a>" at <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a>, followed within days by performances of "<a href="Aida">Aida</a>" and "<a href="Madama%20Butterfly">Madama Butterfly</a>". He conducted the BNOC frequently over the next two years, and made his debut at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, with "Madama Butterfly" in 1928. The following year he was invited to conduct the opening work in Covent Garden's international season, "<a href="Don%20Giovanni">Don Giovanni</a>", with a cast that included <a href="Mariano%20Stabile">Mariano Stabile</a>, <a href="Elisabeth%20Schumann">Elisabeth Schumann</a> and <a href="Heddle%20Nash">Heddle Nash</a>.
In 1929, after financial problems had forced the BNOC to disband, the Covent Garden management set up a touring company to fill the gap, and appointed Barbirolli as its musical director and conductor. The operas in the company's first provincial tour included "<a href="Die%20Meistersinger%20von%20N%C3%BCrnberg">Die Meistersinger</a>", "<a href="Lohengrin%20%28opera%29">Lohengrin</a>", "<a href="La%20boh%C3%A8me">La bohème</a>", "Madama Butterfly", "<a href="The%20Barber%20of%20Seville">The Barber of Seville</a>", "<a href="Tosca">Tosca</a>", "<a href="Falstaff%20%28opera%29">Falstaff</a>", "<a href="Faust%20%28opera%29">Faust</a>", "<a href="Cavalleria%20rusticana">Cavalleria rusticana</a>", "<a href="Pagliacci">Pagliacci</a>", "<a href="Il%20trovatore">Il trovatore</a>", and the first performances in English of "<a href="Turandot">Turandot</a>." In later tours with the company Barbirolli had the chance to conduct more of the German opera repertory, including "<a href="Der%20Rosenkavalier">Der Rosenkavalier</a>", "<a href="Tristan%20und%20Isolde">Tristan und Isolde</a>", and "<a href="Die%20Walk%C3%BCre">Die Walküre</a>". During his years with the touring opera companies Barbirolli did not neglect the concert hall. In 1927, deputising at short notice for <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Sir Thomas Beecham</a>, he conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in a performance of Elgar's <a href="Symphony%20No.%202%20%28Elgar%29">Symphony No. 2</a>, winning the thanks of the composer. Barbirolli also won warm praise from <a href="Pablo%20Casals">Pablo Casals</a>, whom he had accompanied in Haydn's D major cello concerto at the same concert. He conducted a <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Royal Philharmonic Society</a> concert at which <a href="Ralph%20Vaughan%20Williams">Ralph Vaughan Williams</a> was presented with the society's Gold Medal, and another RPS concert at which <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Gustav Mahler</a>'s music, rarely heard at that time, was given – "<a href="Kindertotenlieder">Kindertotenlieder</a>", with <a href="Elena%20Gerhardt">Elena Gerhardt</a> as soloist. Although Barbirolli later came to love Mahler's music, in the 1930s he thought it sounded thin.

When the <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a> announced in 1932 that its regular conductor, <a href="Hamilton%20Harty">Hamilton Harty</a>, was to spend some time conducting overseas, Barbirolli was one of four guest conductors named to direct the orchestra in Harty's absence: the other three were Elgar, Beecham and <a href="Pierre%20Monteux">Pierre Monteux</a>. Barbirolli's programmes included works by composers as diverse as <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Purcell</a>, <a href="Frederick%20Delius">Delius</a>, <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> and <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">Franck</a>. In June 1932, Barbirolli married the singer Marjorie Parry, a member of the BNOC. In 1933 Barbirolli was invited to become conductor of the <a href="Royal%20Scottish%20National%20Orchestra">Scottish Orchestra</a>. It was not then, as its successor the Scottish National Orchestra was later to be, a permanent ensemble, but gave a season lasting about six months of each year. Barbirolli remained with the Scottish Orchestra for three seasons, "rejuvenating the playing and programmes and winning most favourable opinions". Notwithstanding his growing reputation in Britain, Barbirolli's name was little known internationally, and most of the musical world was taken by surprise in 1936 when he was invited to conduct the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic">New York Philharmonic Orchestra</a> in succession to <a href="Arturo%20Toscanini">Arturo Toscanini</a>.

By the spring of 1936, the management of the New York Philharmonic was confronted with a problem. Toscanini had left in search of higher fees with the <a href="NBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">NBC Symphony Orchestra</a>. <a href="Wilhelm%20Furtw%C3%A4ngler">Wilhelm Furtwängler</a> had accepted the orchestra's invitation to fill the post, but he was politically unacceptable to a section of the Philharmonic's audience because he continued to live and work in Germany under the <a href="Nazism">Nazi</a> government. Following a campaign of protest in New York he felt unable to take up the appointment. For want of any available conductor of comparable fame the management of the orchestra invited five guest conductors to divide the season among them. Barbirolli was allotted the first ten weeks of the season, comprising 26 concerts. He was followed by the composer-conductors <a href="Igor%20Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky</a>, <a href="George%20Enescu">Georges Enescu</a> and <a href="Carlos%20Ch%C3%A1vez">Carlos Chávez</a>, each conducting for two weeks, and finally by <a href="Artur%20Rodzi%C5%84ski">Artur Rodziński</a> of the <a href="Cleveland%20Orchestra">Cleveland Orchestra</a>, for eight weeks.
Barbirolli's first concert in New York was on 5 November 1936. The programme consisted of short pieces by <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a> and <a href="Arnold%20Bax">Arnold Bax</a>, and symphonies by Mozart (the "<a href="Symphony%20No.%2036%20%28Mozart%29">Linz</a>") and <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> (the <a href="Symphony%20No.%204%20%28Brahms%29">Fourth</a>). During his ten weeks, he programmed several American novelties including <a href="Charles%20Martin%20Loeffler">Charles Martin Loeffler</a>'s tone-poem "Memories of My Childhood", a symphony by <a href="Anis%20Fuleihan">Anis Fuleihan</a>, and <a href="Philip%20James">Philip James</a>'s "Bret Harte" overture. He also conducted <a href="Serge%20Koussevitzky">Serge Koussevitzky</a>'s Double Bass Concerto. The players told the Philharmonic management that they would be happy for Barbirolli to be appointed to a permanent position. The outcome of this was an invitation to him to become Music Director and Permanent Conductor for three years starting with the 1937–38 season. At the same time as this great change in his professional life, Barbirolli's personal life was also transformed. His marriage had not lasted; within four years he and Marjorie Barbirolli had been living apart. In 1938 she sued for divorce on the grounds of his desertion. The suit was undefended, and the divorce was granted in December 1938. In 1939, Barbirolli married the British oboist <a href="Evelyn%20Barbirolli">Evelyn Rothwell</a>. The marriage lasted for the rest of Barbirolli's life.

One of the features of Barbirolli's time in New York was his regular programming of modern works. He gave the world premières of <a href="William%20Walton">Walton</a>'s second "<a href="Fa%C3%A7ade%20%28entertainment%29">Façade Suite</a>", and <a href="Benjamin%20Britten">Britten</a>'s "<a href="Sinfonia%20da%20Requiem">Sinfonia da Requiem</a>" and <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Britten%29">Violin Concerto</a>; he also introduced pieces by <a href="Jacques%20Ibert">Jacques Ibert</a>, <a href="Eugene%20Aynsley%20Goossens">Eugene Goossens</a>, and <a href="Arthur%20Bliss">Arthur Bliss</a> and by many American composers including <a href="Samuel%20Barber">Samuel Barber</a>, <a href="Deems%20Taylor">Deems Taylor</a> and <a href="Daniel%20Gregory%20Mason">Daniel Gregory Mason</a>. The new works he presented were not avant-garde, but they nevertheless alienated the conservative subscription audience, and after an initial increase in ticket sales in his early years sales declined. Barbirolli also had to cope with what "<a href="Gramophone%20%28magazine%29">The Gramophone</a>" described as "a rough press campaign in New York from interested parties who wished to evict him from his post". The influential critic <a href="Olin%20Downes">Olin Downes</a> had opposed Barbirolli's appointment from the outset, insisting that, though "we abhor chauvinism", preference should have been given to "native conductors". Downes had a grudge against the Philharmonic: shortly before Barbirolli's appointment Downes was sacked as the commentator for the orchestra's prestigious Sunday broadcasts. He and the composer <a href="Virgil%20Thomson">Virgil Thomson</a> continually wrote disparagingly about Barbirolli, comparing him unfavourably with Toscanini. The management of the orchestra nevertheless renewed Barbirolli's appointment in 1940. In 1942, when his second contract was reaching its expiry, he was offered 18 concerts for the 1943–44 season, and the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Philharmonic">Los Angeles Philharmonic</a> invited him to become its conductor, but he accepted neither offer as he had decided to return to England.

Barbirolli's first reason for leaving was local musical politics. He later said, "The Musicians Union there ... brought out a new regulation saying that everyone, even soloists and conductors, must become members. <a href="Vladimir%20Horowitz">Horowitz</a>, <a href="Jascha%20Heifetz">Heifetz</a> and the rest were shocked by this but there was little they could do about it. They also said that conductors must become American citizens. I couldn't do that during the war, or at any time for that matter." His second reason for leaving was that he felt strongly that he was needed in England. In the spring of 1942 he made a hazardous Atlantic crossing:
Barbirolli returned to New York to complete his contractual obligations to the Philharmonic. Shortly after his return he received an appeal from the Hallé Orchestra to become its conductor. The orchestra was in danger of extinction for lack of players, and Barbirolli seized the opportunity to help it.

In 1943 Barbirolli made another Atlantic crossing, avoiding death by a fluke: he changed flights from Lisbon with the actor <a href="Leslie%20Howard%20%28actor%29">Leslie Howard</a> when the latter wished to postpone his own flight for a few days. Barbirolli's plane landed safely; <a href="BOAC%20Flight%20777">Howard's</a> was shot down. In Manchester, Barbirolli immediately set about reviving the Hallé. The number of players in the orchestra was down to about 30. Most younger players were serving in the armed forces, and to compound the shortage the management of the orchestra had ended the arrangement by which many of its players were also members of the <a href="BBC%20Philharmonic">BBC Northern Orchestra</a>. The Hallé board resolved that its orchestra must follow the example of the <a href="Royal%20Liverpool%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">Liverpool Philharmonic</a>, which the Hallé's former conductor <a href="Malcolm%20Sargent">Malcolm Sargent</a> had transformed into a full-time, permanent orchestra. Only four of the players shared with the BBC chose to join the Hallé.

"<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" later wrote of Barbirolli's first actions for the orchestra: "In a couple of months of endless auditions, he rebuilt the Hallé, accepting any good player, whatever his musical background – he found himself with a schoolboy first flute, a schoolmistress hornist, and various brass players recruited from brass and military bands in the Manchester area ... The reborn Hallé's first concert somehow lived up to the Hallé's great reputation." "The Musical Times" also noted, "From his earliest days with the orchestra it was the string tone that commanded immediate attention and respect. There was a fiery intensity and glowing warmth that proclaimed the born string coach". Barbirolli retained his reputation for training orchestras: after his death, one of his former players commented, "If you wanted orchestral experience you'd be set for life, starting in the Hallé with John Barbirolli." Further afield, critics, audiences and players in Europe and the United States commented on the improvement in the playing of their orchestras when Barbirolli was in charge. Later he extended his teaching skills to the Royal Academy of Music, where he took charge of the student orchestra from 1961.

Barbirolli refused invitations to take up more prestigious and lucrative conductorships. Shortly after he took over the Hallé he received an offer from the sponsors of an ambitious scheme that would have put him in charge of the London Symphony Orchestra, and in the early 1950s the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> sought to recruit him for the <a href="BBC%20Symphony%20Orchestra">BBC Symphony Orchestra</a>. Also in the early 1950s the head of the Royal Opera House, <a href="David%20Webster%20%28opera%20manager%29">David Webster</a>, wanted him to become the musical director there. Barbirolli conducted six operas for Webster, "Turandot", "Aida", "<a href="Orfeo%20ed%20Euridice">Orfeo ed Euridice</a>", "Tristan und Isolde", "La bohème" and "Madama Butterfly", 1951–53, but he declined to be wooed away from the Hallé. His biographer Charles Reid wrote, "His Manchester kingdom is a kingdom indeed. He is not manacled or chivied in his choice of programmes. Broadly speaking he conducts only what he loves ... His kingdom approximates to a conductor's paradise." Nevertheless, in 1958, after building the orchestra up and touring continually, conducting up to 75 concerts a year, he arranged a less onerous schedule, allowing him more time to appear as a guest conductor with other orchestras. He also appeared at the <a href="Vienna%20State%20Opera">Vienna State Opera</a>, and <a href="Teatro%20dell%27Opera%20di%20Roma">Rome Opera House</a>, where he conducted "Aida" in 1969. In 1960 he accepted an invitation to succeed <a href="Leopold%20Stokowski">Leopold Stokowski</a> as chief conductor of the <a href="Houston%20Symphony">Houston Symphony</a> in Texas, a post he held until 1967, conducting an annual total of 12 weeks there in early spring and late autumn between Hallé engagements. In 1961 he began a regular association with the <a href="Berlin%20Philharmonic">Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra</a>, which lasted for the rest of his life.
From 1953 onwards, Barbirolli and the Hallé appeared regularly at the <a href="The%20Proms">Henry Wood Promenade Concerts</a> at the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a> in London. As well as major works from the mainstream repertory they gave an annual concert of music by Viennese composers, including <a href="Franz%20Leh%C3%A1r">Franz Lehár</a> and <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20II">Johann Strauss</a>, which, like Sir Malcolm Sargent's annual <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a> nights, rapidly became a firm favourite with the promenaders. At one 1958 promenade concert Barbirolli and the Hallé played a replica of <a href="Charles%20Hall%C3%A9">Charles Hallé</a>'s first concert with the orchestra in 1858.

Barbirolli's interest in new music waned in post-war years, but he and the Hallé appeared regularly at the <a href="Cheltenham%20Music%20Festival">Cheltenham Festival</a>, where he premiered new works of a mostly traditional style by <a href="William%20Alwyn">William Alwyn</a>, <a href="Richard%20Arnell">Richard Arnell</a>, <a href="Arthur%20Benjamin">Arthur Benjamin</a>, <a href="Peter%20Racine%20Fricker">Peter Racine Fricker</a>, <a href="Gordon%20Jacob">Gordon Jacob</a>, <a href="Alan%20Rawsthorne">Alan Rawsthorne</a>, <a href="Kenneth%20Leighton">Kenneth Leighton</a> and others. For its hundredth anniversary in 1958 the Hallé commissioned several new works, including Walton's virtuosic divertimento "Partita". Increasingly, Barbirolli concentrated on his core repertory of the standard symphonic classics, the works of English composers, and late-romantic music, particularly that of Mahler. In the 1960s he made a series of international tours with the <a href="Philharmonia%20Orchestra">Philharmonia</a> (Latin America, 1963), BBC Symphony Orchestra (Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR, 1967) and the Hallé (Latin America and West Indies, 1968). It was a lasting disappointment to him that it never proved possible to take the Hallé on a tour of the United States.

In 1968, after 25 years with the Hallé, Barbirolli retired from the principal conductorship; no successor was appointed in his lifetime. He was appointed the orchestra's Conductor Laureate. He reduced the number of his appearances with the Hallé, but nevertheless took it on another European tour in 1968, this time to Switzerland, Austria and Germany. In his last years a propensity to concentrate on detail at the expense of the whole of a piece became marked. His loyal friend and admirer the critic <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> wrote privately in 1969, "he seems so much to love a single phrase that he lingers over it, caressing it; meanwhile the general momentum is lost." His final year, 1970, was dogged by heart trouble; he suffered collapses in April, May, June and July. His last two concerts were with the Hallé at the 1970 <a href="King%27s%20Lynn">King's Lynn</a> Festival. He produced "inspired" renderings of Elgar's <a href="Symphony%20No.%201%20%28Elgar%29">Symphony No. 1</a> and "<a href="Sea%20Pictures">Sea Pictures</a>". The last work he conducted in public was <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Beethoven%29">Symphony No. 7</a> on the Saturday before his death. On the day he died, 29 July 1970, he spent several hours rehearsing the New Philharmonia Orchestra for a forthcoming tour of Japan that he was scheduled to lead.

Barbirolli died at his London home of a heart attack, aged 70. He was cremated and his ashes interred in his parents' grave at <a href="Kensal%20Green%20Cemetery">Kensal Green Cemetery</a>, London. Among planned engagements forestalled by his death were a production of "Otello" at the Royal Opera House, which would have been his first appearance there for nearly 20 years, and opera recordings for EMI, including Puccini's "<a href="Manon%20Lescaut%20%28Puccini%29">Manon Lescaut</a>" and Verdi's "Falstaff".

Among Barbirolli's state awards were a British <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a> in 1949 and <a href="Companion%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> in 1969; the Finnish Grand Star and Collar of Commander 1st Class of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20White%20Rose">Order of the White Rose</a> in 1963; from Italy the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit%20of%20the%20Italian%20Republic">Order of Merit</a> in 1964; and from France, Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, 1966, and Officier de l'<a href="Ordre%20national%20du%20M%C3%A9rite">Ordre national du Mérite</a>, 1968. Awards from musical institutions included the Freedom of the <a href="Worshipful%20Company%20of%20Musicians">Worshipful Company of Musicians</a>, 1966; Honorary Academician of the <a href="Accademia%20Nazionale%20di%20Santa%20Cecilia">Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia</a>, 1960; Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society, 1950; Bruckner Medal, Bruckner Society of America, 1959; and the Mahler Medal, Mahler-Bruckner Society of America, 1965.

There are memorials to Barbirolli in Manchester and London. Barbirolli Square in Manchester is named in his honour and features a sculpture of him by Byron Howard (2000). The square includes the present base of the Hallé Orchestra, the <a href="Bridgewater%20Hall">Bridgewater Hall</a>, in which the Barbirolli Room commemorates the conductor. At his old school, St Clement Danes, now relocated in Chorleywood, the main hall is named in his honour. A commemorative <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> was placed on the wall of the Bloomsbury Park Hotel in Southampton Row in May 1993 to mark Barbirolli's birthplace. The Sir John Barbirolli Memorial Foundation of the Royal Philharmonic Society was instituted after his death to assist young musicians with the purchase of instruments. In 1972 the Barbirolli Society was set up with the principal aim of promoting the continued release of Barbirolli's recorded performances. Its honorary officers have included Evelyn Barbirolli, <a href="Daniel%20Barenboim">Daniel Barenboim</a> and <a href="Michael%20Kennedy%20%28music%20critic%29">Michael Kennedy</a>. In April 2012, he was voted into the inaugural "Gramophone" "Hall of Fame".

Barbirolli is remembered as an interpreter of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Mahler, as well as <a href="Franz%20Schubert">Schubert</a>, Beethoven, <a href="Jean%20Sibelius">Sibelius</a>, <a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a> and <a href="Giacomo%20Puccini">Puccini</a>, and as a staunch supporter of new works by British composers. Vaughan Williams dedicated his <a href="Sinfonia%20antartica">Seventh</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%208%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Eighth</a> Symphonies to Barbirolli, whose nickname, "Glorious John", comes from the inscription Vaughan Williams wrote at the head of the score of the Eighth: "For glorious John, with love and admiration from Ralph." Barbirolli did not disdain lighter repertoire. The music critic Richard Osborne wrote that, if all Barbirolli's recordings were to be lost except that of Lehár's "Gold and Silver Waltz", "there would be reason enough to say, 'Now, "there" was a conductor!'"

Barbirolli's repertoire was not as wide as that of many of his colleagues because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague <a href="Adrian%20Boult">Sir Adrian Boult</a> liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: "We can't all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For some of us they're only sporting events." Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, "it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade." He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler's <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Mahler%29">Ninth</a> took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal.

From almost the start of his career Barbirolli was a frequent recording artist. As a young cellist he made four records for Edison Bell in 1911, with piano accompaniment by his sister Rosa, and as part of the Kutcher and the Music Society string quartets he recorded music by Mozart, Purcell, Vaughan Williams and others in 1925 and 1926. As a conductor he began recording in 1927 for the National Gramophonic Society (an offshoot of "The Gramophone)." Among his records from that period was the first to be made of Elgar's "<a href="Introduction%20and%20Allegro%20%28Elgar%29">Introduction and Allegro for Strings</a>". On hearing it, the composer said, "I'd never realised it was such a big work." Elgar, despite an extensive discography as a conductor, never recorded the work himself, and some have speculated that "the breadth, nobility and lyrical poetry" of Barbirolli's interpretation left the composer disinclined to compete. In 1928 Barbirolli made some recordings for the Edison Bell label. The same year, he began his long association with the <a href="Gramophone%20Company">His Master's Voice</a> (HMV) label. Immediately after the LSO concert at which he had stood in for Beecham, he was approached by <a href="Fred%20Gaisberg">Fred Gaisberg</a>, the chief recording producer for HMV who signed him for his company shortly afterwards. An HMV colleague of Gaisberg described Barbirolli as "a treasure", because he "could accompany <a href="Feodor%20Chaliapin">Chaliapin</a> without provoking an uproar, win golden opinions from Jascha Heifetz, <a href="Arthur%20Rubinstein">Artur Rubinstein</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Kreisler">Fritz Kreisler</a> and Pablo Casals, and conduct one of the finest recorded performances of the Quintet from "Meistersinger"".
Many of Barbirolli's pre-war recordings for HMV were of concertos. His reputation as an accompanist tended to obscure his talents as a symphonic conductor, and later, his detractors in New York "damned him with faint praise by exalting his powers as an accompanist and then implying that that was where it all stopped." Barbirolli became very sensitive on this point, and for many years after the war he was reluctant to accompany anyone in the recording studio. Among his early HMV records are works, mainly concertos, by Brahms, <a href="Max%20Bruch">Bruch</a>, <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a>, <a href="Anton%C3%ADn%20Dvo%C5%99%C3%A1k">Dvořák</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Glazunov">Glazunov</a>, <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, Mozart, <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, Sibelius, <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a> and <a href="Henri%20Vieuxtemps">Vieuxtemps</a>. From the 1990s onwards, archive recordings of Barbirolli's early concerts in New York have been issued on CD. Kennedy wrote in 2004 that they "prove that the orchestra played superbly for him and that the criticism of him was largely unjustified." Recordings from this period include symphonies by Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Schubert, Schumann, Sibelius and Tchaikovsky, and other orchestral music by Berlioz, <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Debussy</a>, <a href="Gian%20Carlo%20Menotti">Menotti</a>, Purcell, Ravel, <a href="Ottorino%20Respighi">Respighi</a>, and <a href="Nikolai%20Rimsky-Korsakov">Rimsky-Korsakov</a>.

Within six months of his return to Britain in 1943, Barbirolli resumed his contract with HMV, conducting the Hallé in the <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Bax%29">Third</a> Symphony of Bax and the <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Vaughan%20Williams%29">Fifth</a> of Vaughan Williams, followed by works by a wide range of composers from <a href="Arcangelo%20Corelli">Corelli</a> to Stravinsky. In 1955 he signed a contract with <a href="Pye%20Records">Pye Records</a>, with whom he and the Hallé recorded a wide repertoire, and made their first stereophonic recordings. These records were distributed in the US by <a href="Vanguard%20Records">Vanguard Records</a>. A company was formed, named Pye-Barbirolli, of which he was a director: the arrangement was designed to ensure an equal partnership between the company and the musicians. They made many recordings, including symphonies by Beethoven, Dvořák, Elgar, Mozart, <a href="Carl%20Nielsen">Nielsen</a>, Sibelius, Mahler, Tchaikovsky and Vaughan Williams, as well as a few concertos, short orchestral pieces and operatic excerpts.

In 1962, HMV persuaded Barbirolli to return. With the Hallé he recorded a Sibelius symphony cycle, Elgar's Second Symphony, "<a href="Falstaff%20%28Elgar%29">Falstaff</a>" and "The Dream of Gerontius", Schubert's <a href="Symphony%20No.%209%20%28Schubert%29">Ninth Symphony</a>, Vaughan Williams's "<a href="A%20London%20Symphony">A London Symphony</a>", and works by <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Grieg</a> and Delius. With other orchestras, Barbirolli recorded a wide range of his repertoire, including many recordings still in the catalogues in 2012. Of these, his Elgar recordings include the Cello Concerto with <a href="Jacqueline%20du%20Pr%C3%A9">Jacqueline du Pré</a>, "Sea Pictures" with <a href="Janet%20Baker">Janet Baker</a>, and orchestral music including the First Symphony, "<a href="Enigma%20Variations">Enigma Variations</a>" and many of the shorter works. His Mahler recordings include the <a href="Symphony%20No.%205%20%28Mahler%29">Fifth</a> and <a href="Symphony%20No.%206%20%28Mahler%29">Sixth</a> Symphonies (with the New Philharmonia) and Ninth Symphony (with the Berlin Philharmonic). With the <a href="Vienna%20Philharmonic">Vienna Philharmonic</a>, he recorded a Brahms symphony cycle, and with Daniel Barenboim, the two Brahms Piano Concertos. He made three operatic sets for HMV: Purcell's "<a href="Dido%20and%20Aeneas">Dido and Aeneas</a>" with <a href="Victoria%20de%20los%20%C3%81ngeles">Victoria de los Ángeles</a> (1966), Verdi's "Otello" with <a href="James%20McCracken">James McCracken</a>, <a href="Gwyneth%20Jones%20%28soprano%29">Gwyneth Jones</a> and <a href="Dietrich%20Fischer-Dieskau">Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau</a> (1969), and a set of "Madama Butterfly" with <a href="Renata%20Scotto">Renata Scotto</a>, <a href="Carlo%20Bergonzi">Carlo Bergonzi</a> and Rome Opera forces that has remained in the catalogues since its first issue in 1967. The impact of the last was such that the head of the Rome Opera invited him to come and conduct "any opera you care to name with as much rehearsal as you wish." HMV planned to record "Die Meistersinger" with Barbirolli in <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> in 1970, but following the <a href="Warsaw%20Pact%20invasion%20of%20Czechoslovakia">Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia</a> in 1968 he refused to conduct in the Soviet bloc, and his place was taken by <a href="Herbert%20von%20Karajan">Herbert von Karajan</a>.

Emmy Noether

Amalie Emmy Noether (; 23 March 1882 – 14 April 1935) was a German <a href="mathematician">mathematician</a> who made important contributions to <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a> and <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a>. She invariably used the name "Emmy Noether" in her life and publications. She was described by <a href="Pavel%20Alexandrov">Pavel Alexandrov</a>, <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="Jean%20Dieudonn%C3%A9">Jean Dieudonné</a>, <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a> and <a href="Norbert%20Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a> as the most important woman in the history of mathematics. As one of the leading mathematicians of her time, she developed the theories of <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">rings</a>, <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">fields</a>, and <a href="algebra%20over%20a%20field">algebras</a>. In physics, <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a> explains the connection between <a href="symmetry%20in%20physics">symmetry</a> and <a href="Conservation%20law%20%28physics%29">conservation laws</a>.

Noether was born to a <a href="Jewish%20family">Jewish family</a> in the <a href="Franconia">Franconia</a>n town of <a href="Erlangen">Erlangen</a>; her father was a mathematician, <a href="Max%20Noether">Max Noether</a>. She originally planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the <a href="University%20of%20Erlangen">University of Erlangen</a>, where her father lectured. After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of <a href="Paul%20Gordan">Paul Gordan</a>, she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a> and <a href="Felix%20Klein">Felix Klein</a> to join the mathematics department at the <a href="University%20of%20G%C3%B6ttingen">University of Göttingen</a>, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. Her "<a href="habilitation">habilitation</a>" was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of "<a href="Privatdozent">Privatdozent</a>".

Noether remained a leading member of the <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a> mathematics department until 1933; her students were sometimes called the "Noether boys". In 1924, Dutch mathematician <a href="Bartel%20Leendert%20van%20der%20Waerden">B.L. van der Waerden</a> joined her circle and soon became the leading expositor of Noether's ideas: Her work was the foundation for the second volume of his influential 1931 textbook, "<a href="Moderne%20Algebra">Moderne Algebra</a>". By the time of her plenary address at the 1932 <a href="International%20Congress%20of%20Mathematicians">International Congress of Mathematicians</a> in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>, her algebraic acumen was recognized around the world. The following year, Germany's Nazi government dismissed Jews from university positions, and Noether moved to the United States to take up a position at <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a> in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>. In 1935 she underwent surgery for an <a href="ovarian%20cyst">ovarian cyst</a> and, despite signs of a recovery, died four days later at the age of 53.

Noether's mathematical work has been divided into three "epochs". In the first (1908–1919), she made contributions to the theories of <a href="algebraic%20invariant">algebraic invariant</a>s and <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">number fields</a>. Her work on differential invariants in the <a href="calculus%20of%20variations">calculus of variations</a>, "<a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a>", has been called "one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of modern physics". In the second epoch (1920–1926), she began work that "changed the face of [abstract] algebra". In her classic 1921 paper "Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen" ("Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains") Noether developed the theory of <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideals</a> in <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a>s into a tool with wide-ranging applications. She made elegant use of the <a href="ascending%20chain%20condition">ascending chain condition</a>, and objects satisfying it are named "<a href="Noetherian%20%28disambiguation%29">Noetherian</a>" in her honor. In the third epoch (1927–1935), she published works on <a href="noncommutative%20algebra">noncommutative algebra</a>s and <a href="hypercomplex%20number">hypercomplex number</a>s and united the <a href="representation%20theory">representation theory</a> of <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">groups</a> with the theory of <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">modules</a> and ideals. In addition to her own publications, Noether was generous with her ideas and is credited with several lines of research published by other mathematicians, even in fields far removed from her main work, such as <a href="algebraic%20topology">algebraic topology</a>.

Emmy's father, <a href="Max%20Noether">Max Noether</a>, was descended from a family of wholesale traders in Germany. At age 14, he had been paralyzed by <a href="poliomyelitis">polio</a>. He regained mobility, but one leg remained affected. Largely self-taught, he was awarded a <a href="doctorate">doctorate</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Heidelberg">University of Heidelberg</a> in 1868. After teaching there for seven years, he took a position in the Bavarian city of <a href="Erlangen">Erlangen</a>, where he met and married Ida Amalia Kaufmann, the daughter of a prosperous merchant.

Max Noether's mathematical contributions were to <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a> mainly, following in the footsteps of <a href="Alfred%20Clebsch">Alfred Clebsch</a>. His best known results are the <a href="Brill%E2%80%93Noether%20theorem">Brill–Noether theorem</a> and the residue, or <a href="AF%2BBG%20theorem">AF+BG theorem</a>; several other theorems are associated with him; see <a href="Max%20Noether%27s%20theorem%20%28disambiguation%29">Max Noether's theorem</a>.

Emmy Noether was born on 23 March 1882, the first of four children. Her first name was "Amalie", after her mother and paternal grandmother, but she began using her middle name at a young age.

As a girl, Noether was well liked. She did not stand out academically although she was known for being clever and friendly. She was <a href="near-sighted">near-sighted</a> and talked with a minor <a href="lisp">lisp</a> during childhood. A family friend recounted a story years later about young Noether quickly solving a brain teaser at a children's party, showing logical acumen at that early age. She was taught to cook and clean, as were most girls of the time, and she took piano lessons. She pursued none of these activities with passion, although she loved to dance.

She had three younger brothers: The eldest, Alfred, was born in 1883, was awarded a doctorate in <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a> from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. <a href="Fritz%20Noether">Fritz Noether</a>, born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments; after studying in <a href="Munich">Munich</a> he made a reputation for himself in <a href="applied%20mathematics">applied mathematics</a>. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. Very little is known about his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928.

Noether showed early proficiency in French and English. In the spring of 1900, she took the examination for teachers of these languages and received an overall score of "sehr gut" (very good). Her performance qualified her to teach languages at schools reserved for girls, but she chose instead to continue her studies at the <a href="University%20of%20Erlangen">University of Erlangen</a>.

This was an unconventional decision; two years earlier, the Academic Senate of the university had declared that allowing <a href="mixed-sex%20education">mixed-sex education</a> would "overthrow all academic order". One of only two women in a university of 986 students, Noether was only allowed to <a href="academic%20audit">audit</a> classes rather than participate fully, and required the permission of individual professors whose lectures she wished to attend. Despite these obstacles, on 14 July 1903 she passed the graduation exam at a "<a href="Realgymnasium">Realgymnasium</a>" in <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a>.

During the 1903–1904 winter semester, she studied at the University of Göttingen, attending lectures given by astronomer <a href="Karl%20Schwarzschild">Karl Schwarzschild</a> and mathematicians <a href="Hermann%20Minkowski">Hermann Minkowski</a>, <a href="Otto%20Blumenthal">Otto Blumenthal</a>, <a href="Felix%20Klein">Felix Klein</a>, and <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>. Soon thereafter, restrictions on women's participation in that university were rescinded.

Noether returned to Erlangen. She officially reentered the university in October 1904, and declared her intention to focus solely on mathematics. Under the supervision of <a href="Paul%20Gordan">Paul Gordan</a> she wrote her dissertation, "Über die Bildung des Formensystems der ternären biquadratischen Form" ("On Complete Systems of Invariants for Ternary Biquadratic Forms", 1907). Gordan was a member of the "computational" school of invariant researchers, and Noether's thesis ended with a list of over 300 explicitly worked out invariants. This approach to invariants was later superseded by the more abstract and general approach pioneered by Hilbert. Although it had been well received, Noether later described her thesis and a number of subsequent similar papers she produced as "crap".

For the next seven years (1908–1915) she taught at the University of Erlangen's Mathematical Institute without pay, occasionally substituting for her father when he was too ill to lecture. In 1910 and 1911 she published an extension of her thesis work from three variables to "n" variables.
Gordan retired in the spring of 1910, but continued to teach occasionally with his successor, <a href="Erhard%20Schmidt">Erhard Schmidt</a>, who left shortly afterward for a position in <a href="Breslau">Breslau</a>. Gordan retired from teaching altogether in 1911 when Schmidt's successor <a href="Ernst%20Sigismund%20Fischer">Ernst Fischer</a> arrived; Gordan died a year later in December 1912.

According to <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a>, Fischer was an important influence on Noether, in particular by introducing her to the work of <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>. From 1913 to 1916 Noether published several papers extending and applying Hilbert's methods to mathematical objects such as <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">fields</a> of <a href="rational%20function">rational function</a>s and the <a href="invariant%20theory">invariants</a> of <a href="finite%20group">finite group</a>s. This phase marks the beginning of her engagement with <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>, the field of mathematics to which she would make groundbreaking contributions.

Noether and Fischer shared lively enjoyment of mathematics and would often discuss lectures long after they were over; Noether is known to have sent postcards to Fischer continuing her train of mathematical thoughts.

In the spring of 1915, Noether was invited to return to the University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and <a href="Felix%20Klein">Felix Klein</a>. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the <a href="Philology">philologists</a> and <a href="historian">historian</a>s among the philosophical faculty: Women, they insisted, should not become "<a href="privatdozent">privatdozent</a>en". One faculty member protested: ""What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?"" Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, ""I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as "privatdozent". After all, we are a university, not a bath house.""
Noether left for Göttingen in late April; two weeks later her mother died suddenly in Erlangen. She had previously received medical care for an eye condition, but its nature and impact on her death is unknown. At about the same time Noether's father retired and her brother joined the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> to serve in <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. She returned to Erlangen for several weeks, mostly to care for her aging father.

During her first years teaching at Göttingen she did not have an official position and was not paid; her family paid for her room and board and supported her academic work. Her lectures often were advertised under Hilbert's name, and Noether would provide "assistance".

Soon after arriving at Göttingen, however, she demonstrated her capabilities by proving the <a href="theorem">theorem</a> now known as <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a>, which shows that a <a href="Conservation%20law%20%28physics%29">conservation law</a> is associated with any <a href="derivative">differentiable</a> <a href="symmetry%20in%20physics">symmetry of a physical system</a>. The paper was presented by a colleague, F. Klein on 26 July 1918 to a meeting of the Royal Society of Sciences at Göttingen. Noether presumably did not present it herself because she was not a member of the society. American physicists <a href="Leon%20M.%20Lederman">Leon M. Lederman</a> and <a href="Christopher%20T.%20Hill">Christopher T. Hill</a> argue in their book "Symmetry and the Beautiful Universe" that Noether's theorem is "certainly one of the most important mathematical theorems ever proved in guiding the development of <a href="modern%20physics">modern physics</a>, possibly on a par with the <a href="Pythagorean%20theorem">Pythagorean theorem</a>".
When World War I ended, the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%931919">German Revolution of 1918–1919</a> brought a significant change in social attitudes, including more rights for women. In 1919 the University of Göttingen allowed Noether to proceed with her "<a href="habilitation">habilitation</a>" (eligibility for tenure). Her oral examination was held in late May, and she successfully delivered her "habilitation" lecture in June 1919.

Three years later she received a letter from , the <a href="Prussia">Prussia</a>n Minister for Science, Art, and Public Education, in which he conferred on her the title of "nicht beamteter ausserordentlicher Professor" (an untenured professor with limited internal administrative rights and functions). This was an unpaid "extraordinary" professorship, not the higher "ordinary" professorship, which was a civil-service position. Although it recognized the importance of her work, the position still provided no salary. Noether was not paid for her lectures until she was appointed to the special position of "Lehrbeauftragte für Algebra" a year later.

Although Noether's theorem had a significant effect upon classical and quantum mechanics, among mathematicians she is best remembered for her contributions to <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>. In his introduction to Noether's "Collected Papers", <a href="Nathan%20Jacobson">Nathan Jacobson</a> wrote thatThe development of abstract algebra, which is one of the most distinctive innovations of twentieth century mathematics, is largely due to her – in published papers, in lectures, and in personal influence on her contemporaries. She sometimes allowed her colleagues and students to receive credit for her ideas, helping them develop their careers at the expense of her own.

Noether's work in algebra began in 1920. In collaboration with W. Schmeidler, she then published a paper about the <a href="ideal%20theory">theory of ideals</a> in which they defined <a href="Ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">left and right ideals</a> in a <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a>.

The following year she published a paper called "Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen", analyzing <a href="ascending%20chain%20condition">ascending chain condition</a>s with regard to (mathematical) ideals. Noted algebraist <a href="Irving%20Kaplansky">Irving Kaplansky</a> called this work "revolutionary"; the publication gave rise to the term "<a href="Noetherian%20ring">Noetherian ring</a>" and the naming of several other mathematical objects as "<a href="Noetherian%20%28disambiguation%29">Noetherian</a>".

In 1924 a young Dutch mathematician, <a href="Bartel%20Leendert%20van%20der%20Waerden">B.L. van der Waerden</a>, arrived at the University of Göttingen. He immediately began working with Noether, who provided invaluable methods of abstract conceptualization. Van der Waerden later said that her originality was "absolute beyond comparison". In 1931 he published "Moderne Algebra", a central text in the field; its second volume borrowed heavily from Noether's work. Although Noether did not seek recognition, he included as a note in the seventh edition "based in part on lectures by <a href="Emil%20Artin">E. Artin</a> and E. Noether".

Van der Waerden's visit was part of a convergence of mathematicians from all over the world to Göttingen, which became a major hub of mathematical and physical research. From 1926 to 1930 Russian <a href="topology">topologist</a> <a href="Pavel%20Alexandrov">Pavel Alexandrov</a> lectured at the university, and he and Noether quickly became good friends. He began referring to her as "der Noether", using the masculine German article as a term of endearment to show his respect. She tried to arrange for him to obtain a position at Göttingen as a regular professor, but was only able to help him secure a scholarship from the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a>. They met regularly and enjoyed discussions about the intersections of algebra and topology. In his 1935 memorial address, Alexandrov named Emmy Noether "the greatest woman mathematician of all time".

In addition to her mathematical insight, Noether was respected for her consideration of others. Although she sometimes acted rudely toward those who disagreed with her, she nevertheless gained a reputation for constant helpfulness and patient guidance of new students. Her loyalty to mathematical precision caused one colleague to name her "a severe critic", but she combined this demand for accuracy with a nurturing attitude. A colleague later described her this way:Completely unegotistical and free of vanity, she never claimed anything for herself, but promoted the works of her students above all.

In Göttingen, Noether supervised more than a dozen doctoral students; her first was <a href="Grete%20Hermann">Grete Hermann</a>, who defended her dissertation in February 1925. She later spoke reverently of her "dissertation-mother". Noether also supervised <a href="Max%20Deuring">Max Deuring</a>, who distinguished himself as an undergraduate and went on to contribute significantly to the field of <a href="arithmetic%20geometry">arithmetic geometry</a>; <a href="Hans%20Fitting">Hans Fitting</a>, remembered for <a href="Fitting%27s%20theorem">Fitting's theorem</a> and the <a href="Fitting%20lemma">Fitting lemma</a>; and <a href="Chiungtze%20C.%20Tsen">Zeng Jiongzhi</a> (also rendered "Chiungtze C. Tsen" in English), who proved <a href="Tsen%27s%20theorem">Tsen's theorem</a>. She also worked closely with <a href="Wolfgang%20Krull">Wolfgang Krull</a>, who greatly advanced <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a> with his <a href="Krull%27s%20principal%20ideal%20theorem">"Hauptidealsatz"</a> and his <a href="Krull%20dimension">dimension theory</a> for commutative rings.

Her frugal lifestyle at first was due to being denied pay for her work; however, even after the university began paying her a small salary in 1923, she continued to live a simple and modest life. She was paid more generously later in her life, but saved half of her salary to bequeath to her nephew, <a href="Gottfried%20E.%20Noether">Gottfried E. Noether</a>.

Mostly unconcerned about appearance and manners, biographers suggest she focused on her studies. A distinguished algebraist <a href="Olga%20Taussky-Todd">Olga Taussky-Todd</a> described a luncheon, during which Noether, wholly engrossed in a discussion of mathematics, "gesticulated wildly" as she ate and "spilled her food constantly and wiped it off from her dress, completely unperturbed". Appearance-conscious students cringed as she retrieved the handkerchief from her blouse and ignored the increasing disarray of her hair during a lecture. Two female students once approached her during a break in a two-hour class to express their concern, but they were unable to break through the energetic mathematics discussion she was having with other students.

According to van der Waerden's obituary of Emmy Noether, she did not follow a lesson plan for her lectures, which frustrated some students. Instead, she used her lectures as a spontaneous discussion time with her students, to think through and clarify important problems in mathematics. Some of her most important results were developed in these lectures, and the lecture notes of her students formed the basis for several important textbooks, such as those of van der Waerden and Deuring.

Several of her colleagues attended her lectures, and she allowed some of her ideas, such as the <a href="crossed%20product">crossed product</a> ("verschränktes Produkt" in German) of associative algebras, to be published by others. Noether was recorded as having given at least five semester-long courses at Göttingen:

These courses often preceded major publications on the same subjects.

Noether spoke quickly – reflecting the speed of her thoughts, many said – and demanded great concentration from her students. Students who disliked her style often felt alienated. Some pupils felt that she relied too much on spontaneous discussions. Her most dedicated students, however, relished the enthusiasm with which she approached mathematics, especially since her lectures often built on earlier work they had done together.

She developed a close circle of colleagues and students who thought along similar lines and tended to exclude those who did not. "Outsiders" who occasionally visited Noether's lectures usually spent only 30 minutes in the room before leaving in frustration or confusion. A regular student said of one such instance: "The enemy has been defeated; he has cleared out."

Noether showed a devotion to her subject and her students that extended beyond the academic day. Once, when the building was closed for a state holiday, she gathered the class on the steps outside, led them through the woods, and lectured at a local coffee house. Later, after she had been dismissed by the <a href="Third%20Reich">Third Reich</a>, she invited students into her home to discuss their plans for the future and mathematical concepts.

In the winter of 1928–1929 Noether accepted an invitation to <a href="Moscow%20State%20University">Moscow State University</a>, where she continued working with <a href="Pavel%20Alexandrov">P.S. Alexandrov</a>. In addition to carrying on with her research, she taught classes in abstract algebra and <a href="algebraic%20geometry">algebraic geometry</a>. She worked with the topologists <a href="Lev%20Pontryagin">Lev Pontryagin</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Chebotaryov">Nikolai Chebotaryov</a>, who later praised her contributions to the development of <a href="Galois%20theory">Galois theory</a>.
Although politics was not central to her life, Noether took a keen interest in political matters and, according to Alexandrov, showed considerable support for the <a href="Russian%20Revolution">Russian Revolution</a>. She was especially happy to see <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> advances in the fields of science and mathematics, which she considered indicative of new opportunities made possible by the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a> project. This attitude caused her problems in Germany, culminating in her eviction from a <a href="Pension%20%28lodging%29">pension lodging</a> building, after student leaders complained of living with "a Marxist-leaning Jewess".

Noether planned to return to Moscow, an effort for which she received support from Alexandrov. After she left Germany in 1933 he tried to help her gain a chair at Moscow State University through the <a href="Narkompros">Soviet Education Ministry</a>. Although this effort proved unsuccessful, they corresponded frequently during the 1930s, and in 1935 she made plans for a return to the Soviet Union. Meanwhile, her brother <a href="Fritz%20Noether">Fritz</a> accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in <a href="Tomsk">Tomsk</a>, in the Siberian Federal District of Russia, after losing his job in Germany, and was subsequently executed during the <a href="Great%20Purge">Great Purge</a>.

In 1932 Emmy Noether and <a href="Emil%20Artin">Emil Artin</a> received the <a href="Ackermann%E2%80%93Teubner%20Memorial%20Award">Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award</a> for their contributions to mathematics. The prize included a monetary reward of 500 <a href="German%20Reichsmark">Reichsmarks</a> and was seen as a long-overdue official recognition of her considerable work in the field. Nevertheless, her colleagues expressed frustration at the fact that she was not elected to the <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Göttingen "Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften"</a> (academy of sciences) and was never promoted to the position of "Ordentlicher Professor" (full professor).
Noether's colleagues celebrated her fiftieth birthday in 1932, in typical mathematicians' style. <a href="Helmut%20Hasse">Helmut Hasse</a> dedicated an article to her in the "<a href="Mathematische%20Annalen">Mathematische Annalen</a>", wherein he confirmed her suspicion that some aspects of <a href="noncommutative%20algebra">noncommutative algebra</a> are simpler than those of <a href="commutative%20algebra">commutative algebra</a>, by proving a noncommutative <a href="quadratic%20reciprocity">reciprocity law</a>. This pleased her immensely. He also sent her a mathematical riddle, which he called the "m-riddle of syllables". She solved immediately, but the riddle has been lost.

In November of the same year, Noether delivered a plenary address ("großer Vortrag") on "Hyper-complex systems in their relations to commutative algebra and to number theory" at the <a href="International%20Congress%20of%20Mathematicians">International Congress of Mathematicians</a> in <a href="Z%C3%BCrich">Zürich</a>. The congress was attended by 800 people, including Noether's colleagues <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a>, <a href="Edmund%20Landau">Edmund Landau</a>, and <a href="Wolfgang%20Krull">Wolfgang Krull</a>. There were 420 official participants and twenty-one plenary addresses presented. Apparently, Noether's prominent speaking position was a recognition of the importance of her contributions to mathematics. The 1932 congress is sometimes described as the high point of her career.

When <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> became the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany%20%28German%20Reich%29">German "Reichskanzler"</a> in January 1933, <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> activity around the country increased dramatically. At the University of Göttingen the German Student Association led the attack on the "un-German spirit" attributed to Jews and was aided by a <a href="privatdozent">privatdozent</a> named <a href="Werner%20Weber%20%28mathematician%29">Werner Weber</a>, a former student of Noether. <a href="Antisemitism">Antisemitic</a> attitudes created a climate hostile to Jewish professors. One young protester reportedly demanded: "Aryan students want Aryan mathematics and not Jewish mathematics."

One of the first actions of Hitler's administration was the <a href="Law%20for%20the%20Restoration%20of%20the%20Professional%20Civil%20Service">Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service</a> which removed Jews and politically suspect government employees (including university professors) from their jobs unless they had "demonstrated their loyalty to Germany" by serving in World War I. In April 1933 Noether received a notice from the Prussian Ministry for Sciences, Art, and Public Education which read: "On the basis of paragraph 3 of the Civil Service Code of 7 April 1933, I hereby withdraw from you the right to teach at the University of Göttingen." Several of Noether's colleagues, including <a href="Max%20Born">Max Born</a> and <a href="Richard%20Courant">Richard Courant</a>, also had their positions revoked.

Noether accepted the decision calmly, providing support for others during this difficult time. <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a> later wrote that "Emmy Noether—her courage, her frankness, her unconcern about her own fate, her conciliatory spirit—was in the midst of all the hatred and meanness, despair and sorrow surrounding us, a moral solace." Typically, Noether remained focused on mathematics, gathering students in her apartment to discuss <a href="class%20field%20theory">class field theory</a>. When one of her students appeared in the uniform of the Nazi <a href="paramilitary">paramilitary</a> organization "<a href="Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a>" (SA), she showed no sign of agitation and, reportedly, even laughed about it later. This, however, was before the bloody events of <a href="Kristallnacht">Kristallnacht</a> in 1938, and their praise from Propaganda Minister <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>.

As dozens of newly unemployed professors began searching for positions outside of Germany, their colleagues in the United States sought to provide assistance and job opportunities for them. <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> and <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a> were appointed by the <a href="Institute%20for%20Advanced%20Study">Institute for Advanced Study</a> in <a href="Princeton%2C%20New%20Jersey">Princeton</a>, while others worked to find a sponsor required for legal <a href="immigration">immigration</a>. Noether was contacted by representatives of two educational institutions: <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College">Bryn Mawr College</a>, in the United States, and <a href="Somerville%20College">Somerville College</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">University of Oxford</a>, in England. After a series of negotiations with the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, a grant to Bryn Mawr was approved for Noether and she took a position there, starting in late 1933.

At Bryn Mawr, Noether met and befriended <a href="Anna%20Johnson%20Pell%20Wheeler">Anna Wheeler</a>, who had studied at Göttingen just before Noether arrived there. Another source of support at the college was the Bryn Mawr president, Marion Edwards Park, who enthusiastically invited mathematicians in the area to "see Dr. Noether in action!" Noether and a small team of students worked quickly through van der Waerden's 1930 book "Moderne Algebra I" and parts of <a href="Erich%20Hecke">Erich Hecke</a>'s "Theorie der algebraischen Zahlen" ("Theory of algebraic numbers").

In 1934, Noether began lecturing at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton upon the invitation of <a href="Abraham%20Flexner">Abraham Flexner</a> and <a href="Oswald%20Veblen">Oswald Veblen</a>. She also worked with and supervised <a href="Abraham%20Adrian%20Albert">Abraham Albert</a> and <a href="Harry%20Vandiver">Harry Vandiver</a>. However, she remarked about <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> that she was not welcome at "the men's university, where nothing female is admitted".

Her time in the United States was pleasant, surrounded as she was by supportive colleagues and absorbed in her favorite subjects. In the summer of 1934 she briefly returned to Germany to see Emil Artin and her brother <a href="Fritz%20Noether">Fritz</a> before he left for Tomsk. Although many of her former colleagues had been forced out of the universities, she was able to use the library as a "foreign scholar".

In April 1935 doctors discovered a <a href="tumor">tumor</a> in Noether's <a href="human%20pelvis">pelvis</a>. Worried about complications from surgery, they ordered two days of bed rest first. During the operation they discovered an <a href="ovarian%20cyst">ovarian cyst</a> "the size of a large <a href="cantaloupe">cantaloupe</a>". Two smaller tumors in her <a href="uterus">uterus</a> appeared to be benign and were not removed, to avoid prolonging surgery. For three days she appeared to convalesce normally, and she recovered quickly from a <a href="circulatory%20collapse">circulatory collapse</a> on the fourth. On 14 April she fell unconscious, her temperature soared to , and she died. "[I]t is not easy to say what had occurred in Dr. Noether", one of the physicians wrote. "It is possible that there was some form of unusual and virulent infection, which struck the base of the brain where the heat centers are supposed to be located."

A few days after Noether's death her friends and associates at Bryn Mawr held a small memorial service at College President Park's house. Hermann Weyl and <a href="Richard%20Brauer">Richard Brauer</a> traveled from Princeton and spoke with Wheeler and Taussky about their departed colleague. In the months that followed, written tributes began to appear around the globe: Albert Einstein joined van der Waerden, Weyl, and <a href="Pavel%20Alexandrov">Pavel Alexandrov</a> in paying their respects. Her body was cremated and the ashes interred under the walkway around the cloisters of the <a href="Bryn%20Mawr%20College%23M.%20Carey%20Thomas%20Library">M. Carey Thomas Library</a> at Bryn Mawr.

Noether's work in <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a> and <a href="topology">topology</a> was influential in mathematics, while in physics, <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a> has consequences for <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a> and <a href="dynamical%20system">dynamical system</a>s. She showed an acute propensity for abstract thought, which allowed her to approach problems of mathematics in fresh and original ways. Her friend and colleague <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a> described her scholarly output in three epochs:
In the first epoch (1907–1919), Noether dealt primarily with <a href="invariant%20theory">differential and algebraic invariants</a>, beginning with her dissertation under <a href="Paul%20Gordan">Paul Gordan</a>. Her mathematical horizons broadened, and her work became more general and abstract, as she became acquainted with the work of <a href="David%20Hilbert">David Hilbert</a>, through close interactions with a successor to Gordan, <a href="Ernst%20Sigismund%20Fischer">Ernst Sigismund Fischer</a>. After moving to Göttingen in 1915, she produced her work for physics, the two <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's theorem</a>s.

In the second epoch (1920–1926), Noether devoted herself to developing the theory of <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">mathematical rings</a>.

In the third epoch (1927–1935), Noether focused on <a href="noncommutative%20algebra">noncommutative algebra</a>, <a href="linear%20map">linear transformations</a>, and commutative number fields.

Although the results of Noether's first epoch were impressive and useful, her fame among mathematicians rests more on the groundbreaking work she did in her second and third epochs, as noted by Hermann Weyl and B.L. van der Waerden in their obituaries of her.

In these epochs, she was not merely applying ideas and methods of earlier mathematicians; rather, she was crafting new systems of mathematical definitions that would be used by future mathematicians. In particular, she developed a completely new theory of <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideals</a> in <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">rings</a>, generalizing earlier work of <a href="Richard%20Dedekind">Richard Dedekind</a>. She is also renowned for developing ascending chain conditions, a simple finiteness condition that yielded powerful results in her hands. Such conditions and the theory of ideals enabled Noether to generalize many older results and to treat old problems from a new perspective, such as <a href="elimination%20theory">elimination theory</a> and the <a href="algebraic%20variety">algebraic varieties</a> that had been studied by her father.

In the century from 1832 to Noether's death in 1935, the field of mathematics – specifically <a href="algebra">algebra</a> – underwent a profound revolution, whose reverberations are still being felt. Mathematicians of previous centuries had worked on practical methods for solving specific types of equations, e.g., <a href="cubic%20function">cubic</a>, <a href="quartic%20equation">quartic</a>, and <a href="quintic%20equation">quintic equation</a>s, as well as on the <a href="root%20of%20unity">related problem</a> of constructing <a href="regular%20polygon">regular polygon</a>s using <a href="compass%20and%20straightedge%20constructions">compass and straightedge</a>. Beginning with <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a>'s 1832 proof that <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s such as five can be <a href="integer%20factorization">factored</a> in <a href="Gaussian%20integer">Gaussian integer</a>s, <a href="%C3%89variste%20Galois">Évariste Galois</a>'s introduction of <a href="permutation%20group">permutation group</a>s in 1832 (although, because of his death, his papers were published only in 1846, by Liouville), <a href="William%20Rowan%20Hamilton">William Rowan Hamilton</a>'s discovery of <a href="quaternion">quaternion</a>s in 1843, and <a href="Arthur%20Cayley">Arthur Cayley</a>'s more modern definition of groups in 1854, research turned to determining the properties of ever-more-abstract systems defined by ever-more-universal rules. Noether's most important contributions to mathematics were to the development of this new field, <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a>.

Two of the most basic objects in abstract algebra are groups and rings.

A "group" consists of a set of elements and a single operation which combines a first and a second element and returns a third. The operation must satisfy certain constraints for it to determine a group: It must be <a href="Closure%20%28mathematics%29">closed</a> (when applied to any pair of elements of the associated set, the generated element must also be a member of that set), it must be <a href="associativity">associative</a>, there must be an <a href="identity%20element">identity element</a> (an element which, when combined with another element using the operation, results in the original element, such as adding zero to a number or multiplying it by one), and for every element there must be an <a href="inverse%20element">inverse element</a>.

A "ring" likewise, has a set of elements, but now has "two" operations. The first operation must make the set a group, and the second operation is associative and <a href="distributivity">distributive</a> with respect to the first operation. It may or may not be <a href="commutativity">commutative</a>; this means that the result of applying the operation to a first and a second element is the same as to the second and first – the order of the elements does not matter. If every non-zero element has a <a href="multiplicative%20inverse">multiplicative inverse</a> (an element "x" such that "a x" = "x a" = 1 ), the ring is called a "<a href="division%20ring">division ring</a>". A "<a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a>" is defined as a commutative division ring.

Groups are frequently studied through "<a href="group%20representation">group representation</a>s". In their most general form, these consist of a choice of group, a set, and an "action" of the group on the set, that is, an operation which takes an element of the group and an element of the set and returns an element of the set. Most often, the set is a <a href="vector%20space">vector space</a>, and the group represents symmetries of the vector space. For example, there is a group which represents the rigid rotations of space. This is a type of symmetry of space, because space itself does not change when it is rotated even though the positions of objects in it do. Noether used these sorts of symmetries in her work on invariants in physics.

A powerful way of studying rings is through their "<a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">modules</a>". A module consists of a choice of ring, another set, usually distinct from the underlying set of the ring and called the underlying set of the module, an operation on pairs of elements of the underlying set of the module, and an operation which takes an element of the ring and an element of the module and returns an element of the module.

The underlying set of the module and its operation must form a group. A module is a ring-theoretic version of a group representation: Ignoring the second ring operation and the operation on pairs of module elements determines a group representation. The real utility of modules is that the kinds of modules that exist and their interactions, reveal the structure of the ring in ways that are not apparent from the ring itself. An important special case of this is an "<a href="algebra%20over%20a%20field">algebra</a>". (The word algebra means both a subject within mathematics as well as an object studied in the subject of algebra.) An algebra consists of a choice of two rings and an operation which takes an element from each ring and returns an element of the second ring. This operation makes the second ring into a module over the first. Often the first ring is a field.

Words such as "element" and "combining operation" are very general, and can be applied to many real-world and abstract situations. Any set of things that obeys all the rules for one (or two) operation(s) is, by definition, a group (or ring), and obeys all theorems about groups (or rings). Integer numbers, and the operations of addition and multiplication, are just one example. For example, the elements might be <a href="Word%20%28data%20type%29">computer data words</a>, where the first combining operation is <a href="exclusive%20or">exclusive or</a> and the second is <a href="logical%20conjunction">logical conjunction</a>. Theorems of abstract algebra are powerful because they are general; they govern many systems. It might be imagined that little could be concluded about objects defined with so few properties, but precisely therein lay Noether's gift to discover the maximum that could be concluded from a given set of properties, or conversely, to identify the minimum set, the essential properties responsible for a particular observation. Unlike most mathematicians, she did not make abstractions by generalizing from known examples; rather, she worked directly with the abstractions. In his obituary of Noether, her student van der Waerden recalled that
This is the "begriffliche Mathematik" (purely conceptual mathematics) that was characteristic of Noether. This style of mathematics was consequently adopted by other mathematicians, especially in the (then new) field of abstract algebra.

The <a href="integer">integer</a>s form a commutative ring whose elements are the integers, and the combining operations are addition and multiplication. Any pair of integers can be <a href="addition">added</a> or <a href="multiplication">multiplied</a>, always resulting in another integer, and the first operation, addition, is <a href="commutativity">commutative</a>, i.e., for any elements "a" and "b" in the ring, "a" + "b" = "b" + "a". The second operation, multiplication, also is commutative, but that need not be true for other rings, meaning that "a" combined with "b" might be different from "b" combined with "a". Examples of noncommutative rings include <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrices</a> and <a href="quaternion">quaternion</a>s. The integers do not form a division ring, because the second operation cannot always be inverted; there is no integer "a" such that 3 × "a" = 1.

The integers have additional properties which do not generalize to all commutative rings. An important example is the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a>, which says that every positive integer can be factored uniquely into <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s. Unique factorizations do not always exist in other rings, but Noether found a unique factorization theorem, now called the "<a href="Lasker%E2%80%93Noether%20theorem">Lasker–Noether theorem</a>", for the <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideals</a> of many rings. Much of Noether's work lay in determining what properties "do" hold for all rings, in devising novel analogs of the old integer theorems, and in determining the minimal set of assumptions required to yield certain properties of rings.

Much of Noether's work in the first epoch of her career was associated with <a href="invariant%20theory">invariant theory</a>, principally <a href="algebraic%20invariant%20theory">algebraic invariant theory</a>. Invariant theory is concerned with expressions that remain constant (invariant) under a <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a> of transformations. As an everyday example, if a rigid yardstick is rotated, the coordinates ("x", "y", "z") and ("x", "y", "z") of its endpoints change, but its length "L" given by the formula "L" = Δ"x" + Δ"y" + Δ"z" remains the same. Invariant theory was an active area of research in the later nineteenth century, prompted in part by <a href="Felix%20Klein">Felix Klein</a>'s <a href="Erlangen%20program">Erlangen program</a>, according to which different types of <a href="geometry">geometry</a> should be characterized by their invariants under transformations, e.g., the <a href="cross-ratio">cross-ratio</a> of <a href="projective%20geometry">projective geometry</a>.

An example of an "invariant" is the <a href="discriminant">discriminant</a> "B" − 4 "A C" of a binary <a href="quadratic%20form">quadratic form</a> x·A x + y·B x + y·C y , where x and y are <a href="Euclidean%20vector">vectors</a> and "·" is the <a href="dot%20product">dot product</a> or "<a href="inner%20product">inner product</a>" for the vectors. A, B, and C are <a href="linear%20operator">linear operator</a>s on the vectors – typically <a href="matrix%20%28mathematics%29">matrices</a>.

The discriminant is called "invariant" because it is not changed by linear substitutions x → "a" x + "b" y, "y" → "c" x + "d" y with determinant "a" "d" − "b" "c" = 1 . These substitutions form the <a href="special%20linear%20group">special linear group</a> "SL".

One can ask for all polynomials in A, B, and C that are unchanged by the action of "SL"; these are called the invariants of binary quadratic forms and turn out to be the polynomials in the discriminant.

More generally, one can ask for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials A "x" "y" + ... + A x "y" of higher degree, which will be certain polynomials in the coefficients A, ..., A, and more generally still, one can ask the similar question for homogeneous polynomials in more than two variables.

One of the main goals of invariant theory was to solve the ""finite basis problem"". The sum or product of any two invariants is invariant, and the finite basis problem asked whether it was possible to get all the invariants by starting with a finite list of invariants, called "generators", and then, adding or multiplying the generators together. For example, the discriminant gives a finite basis (with one element) for the invariants of binary quadratic forms.

Noether's advisor, Paul Gordan, was known as the "king of invariant theory", and his chief contribution to mathematics was his 1870 solution of the finite basis problem for invariants of homogeneous polynomials in two variables. He proved this by giving a constructive method for finding all of the invariants and their generators, but was not able to carry out this constructive approach for invariants in three or more variables. In 1890, David Hilbert proved a similar statement for the invariants of homogeneous polynomials in any number of variables. Furthermore, his method worked, not only for the special linear group, but also for some of its subgroups such as the <a href="special%20orthogonal%20group">special orthogonal group</a>.

<a href="Galois%20theory">Galois theory</a> concerns transformations of <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">number fields</a> that <a href="permutation">permute</a> the roots of an equation. Consider a polynomial equation of a variable "x" of <a href="Degree%20of%20a%20polynomial">degree</a> "n", in which the coefficients are drawn from some <a href="ground%20field">ground field</a>, which might be, for example, the field of <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s, <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s, or the <a href="integer">integer</a>s <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modulo</a> 7. There may or may not be choices of "x", which make this polynomial evaluate to zero. Such choices, if they exist, are called <a href="root%20of%20a%20function">roots</a>. If the polynomial is "x" + 1 and the field is the real numbers, then the polynomial has no roots, because any choice of "x" makes the polynomial greater than or equal to one. If the field is <a href="field%20extension">extended</a>, however, then the polynomial may gain roots, and if it is extended enough, then it always has a number of roots equal to its degree.

Continuing the previous example, if the field is enlarged to the complex numbers, then the polynomial gains two roots, +"i" and −"i", where "i" is the <a href="imaginary%20unit">imaginary unit</a>, that is, "i" = −1 . More generally, the extension field in which a polynomial can be factored into its roots is known as the <a href="splitting%20field">splitting field</a> of the polynomial.

The <a href="Galois%20group">Galois group</a> of a polynomial is the set of all transformations of the splitting field which preserve the ground field and the roots of the polynomial. (In mathematical jargon, these transformations are called <a href="automorphism">automorphism</a>s.) The Galois group of consists of two elements: The identity transformation, which sends every complex number to itself, and <a href="complex%20conjugation">complex conjugation</a>, which sends +"i" to −"i". Since the Galois group does not change the ground field, it leaves the coefficients of the polynomial unchanged, so it must leave the set of all roots unchanged. Each root can move to another root, however, so transformation determines a <a href="permutation">permutation</a> of the "n" roots among themselves. The significance of the Galois group derives from the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20Galois%20theory">fundamental theorem of Galois theory</a>, which proves that the fields lying between the ground field and the splitting field are in one-to-one correspondence with the <a href="subgroup">subgroup</a>s of the Galois group.

In 1918, Noether published a paper on the <a href="inverse%20Galois%20problem">inverse Galois problem</a>. Instead of determining the Galois group of transformations of a given field and its extension, Noether asked whether, given a field and a group, it always is possible to find an extension of the field that has the given group as its Galois group. She reduced this to "<a href="Noether%27s%20problem">Noether's problem</a>", which asks whether the fixed field of a subgroup "G" of the <a href="symmetric%20group">permutation group</a> "S" acting on the field "k"("x", ... , "x") always is a pure <a href="transcendental%20extension">transcendental extension</a> of the field "k". (She first mentioned this problem in a 1913 paper, where she attributed the problem to her colleague <a href="Ernst%20Sigismund%20Fischer">Fischer</a>.) She showed this was true for "n" = 2, 3, or 4. In 1969, <a href="R.G.%20Swan">R.G. Swan</a> found a counter-example to Noether's problem, with "n" = 47 and "G" a <a href="cyclic%20group">cyclic group</a> of order 47 (although this group can be realized as a <a href="Galois%20group">Galois group</a> over the rationals in other ways). The inverse Galois problem remains unsolved.

Noether was brought to <a href="G%C3%B6ttingen">Göttingen</a> in 1915 by David Hilbert and Felix Klein, who wanted her expertise in invariant theory to help them in understanding <a href="general%20relativity">general relativity</a>, a geometrical theory of <a href="gravitation">gravitation</a> developed mainly by <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>. Hilbert had observed that the <a href="conservation%20of%20energy">conservation of energy</a> seemed to be violated in general relativity, because gravitational energy could itself gravitate. Noether provided the resolution of this paradox, and a fundamental tool of modern <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a>, with <a href="Noether%27s%20theorem">Noether's first theorem</a>, which she proved in 1915, but did not publish until 1918. She not only solved the problem for general relativity, but also determined the conserved quantities for "every" system of physical laws that possesses some continuous symmetry. Upon receiving her work, Einstein wrote to Hilbert:

For illustration, if a physical system behaves the same, regardless of how it is oriented in space, the physical laws that govern it are rotationally symmetric; from this symmetry, Noether's theorem shows the <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a> of the system must be conserved. The physical system itself need not be symmetric; a jagged asteroid tumbling in space <a href="Conservation%20of%20angular%20momentum">conserves angular momentum</a> despite its asymmetry. Rather, the symmetry of the "physical laws" governing the system is responsible for the conservation law. As another example, if a physical experiment has the same outcome at any place and at any time, then its laws are symmetric under continuous translations in space and time; by Noether's theorem, these symmetries account for the <a href="Conservation%20law%20%28physics%29">conservation laws</a> of <a href="momentum">linear momentum</a> and <a href="energy">energy</a> within this system, respectively.

Noether's theorem has become a fundamental tool of modern <a href="theoretical%20physics">theoretical physics</a>, both because of the insight it gives into conservation laws, and also, as a practical calculation tool. Her theorem allows researchers to determine the conserved quantities from the observed symmetries of a physical system. Conversely, it facilitates the description of a physical system based on classes of hypothetical physical laws. For illustration, suppose that a new physical phenomenon is discovered. Noether's theorem provides a test for theoretical models of the phenomenon:If the theory has a continuous symmetry, then Noether's theorem guarantees that the theory has a conserved quantity, and for the theory to be correct, this conservation must be observable in experiments.

In this epoch, Noether became famous for her deft use of ascending ("Teilerkettensatz") or descending ("Vielfachenkettensatz") chain conditions. A sequence of <a href="empty%20set">non-empty</a> <a href="subset">subset</a>s "A", "A", "A", etc. of a <a href="Set%20%28mathematics%29">set</a> "S" is usually said to be "ascending", if each is a subset of the next

Conversely, a sequence of subsets of "S" is called "descending" if each contains the next subset:

A chain "becomes constant after a finite number of steps" if there is an "n" such that formula_3 for all "m" ≥ "n". A collection of subsets of a given set satisfies the <a href="ascending%20chain%20condition">ascending chain condition</a> if any ascending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps. It satisfies the descending chain condition if any descending sequence becomes constant after a finite number of steps.

Ascending and descending chain conditions are general, meaning that they can be applied to many types of mathematical objects—and, on the surface, they might not seem very powerful. Noether showed how to exploit such conditions, however, to maximum advantage.

For example: How to use chain conditions to show that every set of sub-objects has a maximal/minimal element or that a complex object can be generated by a smaller number of elements. These conclusions often are crucial steps in a proof.

Many types of objects in <a href="abstract%20algebra">abstract algebra</a> can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, they are called "<a href="Noetherian%20%28disambiguation%29">Noetherian</a>" in her honor. By definition, a <a href="Noetherian%20ring">Noetherian ring</a> satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a <a href="Noetherian%20group">Noetherian group</a> is defined as a group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A <a href="Noetherian%20module">Noetherian module</a> is a <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">module</a> in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A <a href="Noetherian%20space">Noetherian space</a> is a <a href="topological%20space">topological space</a> in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the <a href="spectrum%20of%20a%20ring">spectrum</a> of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.

The chain condition often is "inherited" by sub-objects. For example, all subspaces of a Noetherian space, are Noetherian themselves; all subgroups and quotient groups of a Noetherian group are likewise, Noetherian; and, "<a href="mutatis%20mutandis">mutatis mutandis</a>", the same holds for submodules and quotient modules of a Noetherian module. All quotient rings of a Noetherian ring are Noetherian, but that does not necessarily hold for its subrings. The chain condition also may be inherited by combinations or extensions of a Noetherian object. For example, finite direct sums of Noetherian rings are Noetherian, as is the ring of formal <a href="power%20series">power series</a> over a Noetherian ring.

Another application of such chain conditions is in <a href="Noetherian%20induction">Noetherian induction</a>—also known as <a href="well-founded%20induction">well-founded induction</a>—which is a generalization of <a href="mathematical%20induction">mathematical induction</a>. It frequently is used to reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that "S" is a <a href="partially%20ordered%20set">partially ordered set</a>. One way of proving a statement about the objects of "S" is to assume the existence of a <a href="counterexample">counterexample</a> and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the <a href="contrapositive">contrapositive</a> of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction is that every non-empty subset of "S" contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the "minimal counterexample". In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counter-example, there is a smaller counter-example.

Noether's paper, "Idealtheorie in Ringbereichen" ("Theory of Ideals in Ring Domains", 1921), is the foundation of general commutative ring theory, and gives one of the first general definitions of a <a href="commutative%20ring">commutative ring</a>. Before her paper, most results in commutative algebra were restricted to special examples of commutative rings, such as polynomial rings over fields or rings of algebraic integers. Noether proved that in a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideals</a>, every ideal is finitely generated. In 1943, French mathematician <a href="Claude%20Chevalley">Claude Chevalley</a> coined the term, "<a href="Noetherian%20ring">Noetherian ring</a>", to describe this property. A major result in Noether's 1921 paper is the <a href="Lasker%E2%80%93Noether%20theorem">Lasker–Noether theorem</a>, which extends Lasker's theorem on the primary decomposition of ideals of polynomial rings to all Noetherian rings. The Lasker–Noether theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the <a href="fundamental%20theorem%20of%20arithmetic">fundamental theorem of arithmetic</a> which states that any positive integer can be expressed as a product of <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s, and that this decomposition is unique.

Noether's work "Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern" ("Abstract Structure of the Theory of Ideals in Algebraic Number and Function Fields", 1927) characterized the rings in which the ideals have unique factorization into prime ideals as the <a href="Dedekind%20domain">Dedekind domain</a>s: integral domains that are Noetherian, 0- or 1-<a href="Krull%20dimension">dimensional</a>, and <a href="Integrality">integrally closed</a> in their quotient fields. This paper also contains what now are called the <a href="isomorphism%20theorem">isomorphism theorem</a>s, which describe some fundamental <a href="natural%20isomorphism">natural isomorphism</a>s, and some other basic results on Noetherian and <a href="Artinian%20module">Artinian module</a>s.

In 1923–1924, Noether applied her ideal theory to <a href="elimination%20theory">elimination theory</a> in a formulation that she attributed to her student, Kurt Hentzelt. She showed that fundamental theorems about the <a href="polynomial%20factorization">factorization of polynomials</a> could be carried over directly. Traditionally, elimination theory is concerned with eliminating one or more variables from a system of polynomial equations, usually by the method of <a href="resultant">resultant</a>s.

For illustration, a system of equations often can be written in the form   M v = 0   where a matrix (or <a href="linear%20transform">linear transform</a>)   M   (without the variable "x") times a vector v (that only has non-zero powers of "x") is equal to the zero vector, 0. Hence, the <a href="determinant">determinant</a> of the matrix   M   must be zero, providing a new equation in which the variable "x" has been eliminated.

Techniques such as Hilbert's original non-constructive solution to the finite basis problem could not be used to get quantitative information about the invariants of a group action, and furthermore, they did not apply to all group actions. In her 1915 paper, Noether found a solution to the finite basis problem for a finite group of transformations   "G"   acting on a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero. Her solution shows that the ring of invariants is generated by homogeneous invariants whose degree is less than, or equal to, the order of the finite group; this is called Noether's bound. Her paper gave two proofs of Noether's bound, both of which also work when the characteristic of the field is <a href="coprime">coprime</a> to   |"G"|!   (the <a href="factorial">factorial</a> of the order   |"G"|   of the group "G"). The degrees of generators need not satisfy Noether's bound when the characteristic of the field divides the number   |"G"| , but Noether was not able to determine whether this bound was correct when the characteristic of the field divides   |"G"|!   but not   |"G"| . For many years, determining the truth or falsehood of this bound for this particular case was an open problem, called "Noether's gap". It was finally solved independently by Fleischmann in 2000 and Fogarty in 2001, who both showed that the bound remains true.

In her 1926 paper, Noether extended Hilbert's theorem to representations of a finite group over any field; the new case that did not follow from Hilbert's work is when the characteristic of the field divides the order of the group. Noether's result was later extended by <a href="William%20Haboush">William Haboush</a> to all reductive groups by his proof of the <a href="Haboush%27s%20theorem">Mumford conjecture</a>. In this paper Noether also introduced the "<a href="Noether%20normalization%20lemma">Noether normalization lemma</a>", showing that a finitely generated <a href="integral%20domain">domain</a> "A" over a field "k" has a set   { "x", ... , "x" }   of <a href="algebraic%20independence">algebraically independent</a> elements such that "A" is <a href="integrality">integral</a> over   "k" ["x", ... , "x"] .

As noted by <a href="Pavel%20Alexandrov">Pavel Alexandrov</a> and <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a> in their obituaries, Noether's contributions to <a href="topology">topology</a> illustrate her generosity with ideas and how her insights could transform entire fields of mathematics. In topology, mathematicians study the properties of objects that remain invariant even under deformation, properties such as their <a href="connected%20space">connectedness</a>. An old joke is that ""a topologist cannot distinguish a donut from a coffee mug"", since they can be continuously deformed into one another.

Noether is credited with fundamental ideas that led to the development of <a href="algebraic%20topology">algebraic topology</a> from the earlier <a href="combinatorial%20topology">combinatorial topology</a>, specifically, the idea of <a href="Homology%20theory%23Towards%20algebraic%20topology">homology groups</a>. According to the account of Alexandrov, Noether attended lectures given by <a href="Heinz%20Hopf">Heinz Hopf</a> and by him in the summers of 1926 and 1927, where "she continually made observations which were often deep and subtle" and he continues that,
Noether's suggestion that topology be studied algebraically was adopted immediately by Hopf, Alexandrov, and others, and it became a frequent topic of discussion among the mathematicians of Göttingen. Noether observed that her idea of a <a href="Betti%20group">Betti group</a> makes the <a href="Euler%20characteristic">Euler–Poincaré formula</a> simpler to understand, and Hopf's own work on this subject "bears the imprint of these remarks of Emmy Noether". Noether mentions her own topology ideas only as an aside in a 1926 publication, where she cites it as an application of <a href="group%20theory">group theory</a>.

This algebraic approach to topology was also developed independently in <a href="Austria">Austria</a>. In a 1926–1927 course given in <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a>, <a href="Leopold%20Vietoris">Leopold Vietoris</a> defined a <a href="homology%20group">homology group</a>, which was developed by <a href="Walther%20Mayer">Walther Mayer</a>, into an axiomatic definition in 1928.

Much work on <a href="hypercomplex%20number">hypercomplex number</a>s and <a href="group%20representation">group representation</a>s was carried out in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, but remained disparate. Noether united these results and gave the first general representation theory of groups and algebras.

Briefly, Noether subsumed the structure theory of <a href="associative%20algebra">associative algebra</a>s and the representation theory of groups into a single arithmetic theory of <a href="module%20%28mathematics%29">modules</a> and <a href="ideal%20%28ring%20theory%29">ideals</a> in <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">rings</a> satisfying <a href="ascending%20chain%20condition">ascending chain condition</a>s. This single work by Noether was of fundamental importance for the development of modern algebra.

Noether also was responsible for a number of other advances in the field of algebra. With <a href="Emil%20Artin">Emil Artin</a>, <a href="Richard%20Brauer">Richard Brauer</a>, and <a href="Helmut%20Hasse">Helmut Hasse</a>, she founded the theory of <a href="central%20simple%20algebra">central simple algebra</a>s.

A paper by Noether, Helmut Hasse, and <a href="Richard%20Brauer">Richard Brauer</a> pertains to <a href="division%20algebra">division algebra</a>s, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a <a href="Hasse%20principle">local-global theorem</a> stating that if a finite-dimensional central division algebra over a <a href="Algebraic%20number%20field">number field</a> splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their "Hauptsatz" ("main theorem"):every finite dimensional <a href="central%20simple%20algebra">central</a> <a href="division%20algebra">division algebra</a> over an <a href="algebraic%20number">algebraic number</a> <a href="field%20%28mathematics%29">field</a> F splits over a <a href="Abelian%20extension">cyclic cyclotomic extension</a>.These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra "D" are <a href="central%20simple%20algebra%23Splitting%20field">splitting fields</a>. This paper also contains the <a href="Skolem%E2%80%93Noether%20theorem">Skolem–Noether theorem</a> which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field "k" into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over "k", are conjugate. The <a href="Brauer%E2%80%93Noether%20theorem">Brauer–Noether theorem</a> gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.

Noether's work continues to be relevant for the development of theoretical physics and mathematics and she is consistently ranked as one of the greatest mathematicians of the twentieth century. In his obituary, fellow algebraist <a href="Bartel%20Leendert%20van%20der%20Waerden">BL van der Waerden</a> says that her mathematical originality was "absolute beyond comparison", and Hermann Weyl said that Noether "changed the face of <a href="abstract%20algebra">algebra</a> by her work". During her lifetime and even until today, Noether has been characterized as the greatest woman mathematician in recorded history by mathematicians such as <a href="Pavel%20Alexandrov">Pavel Alexandrov</a>, <a href="Hermann%20Weyl">Hermann Weyl</a>, and <a href="Jean%20Dieudonn%C3%A9">Jean Dieudonné</a>.

In a letter to "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", <a href="Albert%20Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> wrote:
On 2 January 1935, a few months before her death, mathematician <a href="Norbert%20Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a> wrote that 
At an exhibition at the <a href="1964%20World%27s%20Fair">1964 World's Fair</a> devoted to , Noether was the only woman represented among the notable mathematicians of the modern world.

Noether has been honored in several memorials,

In fiction, Emmy Nutter, the physics professor in "The God Patent" by <a href="Ransom%20Stephens">Ransom Stephens</a>, is based on Emmy Noether.

Catherine Zeta-Jones

Catherine Zeta-Jones (; born 25 September 1969) is a Welsh actress. Born and raised in <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a>, Zeta-Jones aspired to be an actress from a young age. As a child, she played roles in the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> productions of the musicals "<a href="Annie%20%28musical%29">Annie</a>" and "<a href="Bugsy%20Malone">Bugsy Malone</a>". She studied musical theatre at the <a href="Arts%20Educational%20Schools%2C%20London">Arts Educational Schools, London</a>, and made her stage breakthrough with a leading role in a 1987 production of "<a href="42nd%20Street%20%28musical%29">42nd Street</a>". Her screen debut came in the unsuccessful French-Italian film "<a href="1001%20Nights%20%28film%29">1001 Nights</a>" (1990), and she went on to find greater success as a regular in the British television series "<a href="The%20Darling%20Buds%20of%20May%20%28TV%20series%29">The Darling Buds of May</a>" (1991–1993). Dismayed at being <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles.

Zeta-Jones established herself in Hollywood with roles that highlighted her sex appeal, such as in the action film "<a href="The%20Mask%20of%20Zorro">The Mask of Zorro</a>" (1998) and the heist film "<a href="Entrapment%20%28film%29">Entrapment</a>" (1999). She received acclaim for her performances as a vengeful pregnant woman in "<a href="Traffic%20%282000%20film%29">Traffic</a>" (2000) and a murderous singer in the musical "<a href="Chicago%20%282002%20film%29">Chicago</a>" (2002); for the latter she won <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Academy</a> and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA</a> Awards for Best Supporting Actress. She starred in high-profile films for much of the decade, including the black comedy "<a href="Intolerable%20Cruelty">Intolerable Cruelty</a>" (2003), the heist film "<a href="Ocean%27s%20Twelve">Ocean's Twelve</a>" (2004), the comedy "<a href="The%20Terminal">The Terminal</a>" (2004), and the romantic comedy "<a href="No%20Reservations%20%28film%29">No Reservations</a>" (2007). Parts in smaller-scale features were followed by a decrease in workload, during which she returned to stage and played an ageing actress in "<a href="A%20Little%20Night%20Music">A Little Night Music</a>" (2009), winning a <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Musical">Tony Award</a>. Zeta-Jones continued to work intermittently in the 2010s, starring in the psychological thriller "<a href="Side%20Effects%20%282013%20film%29">Side Effects</a>" (2013) and the action film "<a href="Red%202%20%28film%29">Red 2</a>" (2013), and portrayed actress <a href="Olivia%20de%20Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> in the <a href="FX%20%28TV%20channel%29">FX</a> television series "<a href="Feud%20%28TV%20series%29">Feud</a>" (2017).

Zeta-Jones is the recipient of <a href="List%20of%20roles%20and%20awards%20of%20Catherine%20Zeta-Jones%23Awards%20and%20nominations">several accolades</a>, including an <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>, a <a href="British%20Academy%20Film%20Award">British Academy Film Award</a> and a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>, and in 2010, she was appointed <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) for her film and humanitarian endeavours. She supports various charities and causes, and is a prominent celebrity endorser of brands. Her struggle with <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a> and <a href="bipolar%20II%20disorder">bipolar II disorder</a> has been well documented by the media. She is married to American actor <a href="Michael%20Douglas">Michael Douglas</a>, with whom she has two children.

Zeta-Jones was born in <a href="Swansea">Swansea</a>, Wales, on 25 September 1969 to David Jones, the owner of a sweet factory, and his wife Patricia ( Fair), a <a href="seamstress">seamstress</a>. Her father is <a href="Welsh%20people">Welsh</a> and her mother is of <a href="Irish%20Catholic">Irish Catholic</a> descent. She was named after her grandmothers, Zeta Jones and Catherine Fair. She has an older brother, David, and a younger brother, Lyndon, who worked as a sales representative before venturing into film production. Zeta-Jones was raised in the suburban area of <a href="Mumbles%20%28district%29">Mumbles</a>. Because Zeta-Jones was a hyperactive child, her mother sent her to the Hazel Johnson School of Dance when she was four years old. She was educated at the <a href="Dumbarton%20House%20School">Dumbarton House School</a>, a private school in Swansea. The family came from a modest background, but their fortunes improved when they won £100,000 in a <a href="Bingo%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">bingo</a> competition, allowing them to pay for Zeta-Jones' dance and <a href="ballet">ballet</a> lessons.

Zeta-Jones participated in school stage shows from a young age and gained local media attention when her rendition of a <a href="Shirley%20Bassey">Shirley Bassey</a> song won a Junior Star Trail talent competition. As part of a dance troupe, she routinely took trips to London, where she auditioned for roles in the theatre. At the age of nine, she was selected to play one of the orphan girls in a <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> production of the musical "<a href="Annie%20%28musical%29">Annie</a>", and in her early teens, she became a national <a href="tap-dancing">tap-dancing</a> champion. In 1981 she played the lead role of <a href="Little%20Orphan%20Annie%23Characters">Annie</a> in a Swansea production of the musical, which was staged at the <a href="Swansea%20Grand%20Theatre">Swansea Grand Theatre</a>. Two years later, she played the lead role of Tallulah in a West End production of "<a href="Bugsy%20Malone">Bugsy Malone</a>". When she was 15, Zeta-Jones dropped out of school without obtaining <a href="O-levels">O-levels</a> and decided to live in London to pursue a full-time acting career; she was also engaged to perform in a touring production of "<a href="The%20Pajama%20Game">The Pajama Game</a>". Describing her teenage years in London, Zeta-Jones said, "I would queue up for auditions and then change my costume or put on a different leotard and audition again. It might take me two tries, but I always got the job. I figured out what they wanted". She went on to attend the independent <a href="Arts%20Educational%20Schools">Arts Educational Schools</a> in <a href="Chiswick">Chiswick</a>, London, for a three-year course in <a href="musical%20theatre">musical theatre</a>.

In 1987, when she was 17 years old, Zeta-Jones was picked as the second understudy to the lead actress in a West End production of "<a href="42nd%20Street%20%28musical%29">42nd Street</a>". During one of the performances, both the star and the first understudy were unavailable, and Zeta-Jones was asked to play the role of Peggy Sawyera chorus girl who becomes a star. The producer was impressed by her acting ability and allowed her to play the role for the next two years. Her next stage appearance was with the <a href="English%20National%20Opera">English National Opera</a> at the <a href="London%20Coliseum">London Coliseum</a> in 1989 where she played Mae Jones in <a href="Kurt%20Weill">Kurt Weill</a>'s "<a href="Street%20Scene%20%28opera%29">Street Scene</a>".

In 1990, Zeta-Jones made her film debut in the director <a href="Philippe%20de%20Broca">Philippe de Broca</a>'s film "<a href="1001%20Nights%20%28film%29">1001 Nights</a>". An adaptation of the Persian fable "<a href="One%20Thousand%20and%20One%20Nights">One Thousand and One Nights</a>", the French-Italian production recounts the tale from the perspective of <a href="Scheherazade">Scheherazade</a> (Zeta-Jones), one of the brides of King Sharir (<a href="Thierry%20Lhermitte">Thierry Lhermitte</a>). The film was not well received at the box office, and according to de Broca's obituary in "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>", the film "is best remembered for its enjoyable nude scenes". Greater success followed when she starred opposite <a href="David%20Jason">David Jason</a> and <a href="Pam%20Ferris">Pam Ferris</a> in the British period comedy-drama television series "<a href="The%20Darling%20Buds%20of%20May%20%28TV%20series%29">The Darling Buds of May</a>" from 1991 to 1993. Adapted from <a href="H.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BE.%20Bates">H. E. Bates</a> <a href="The%20Darling%20Buds%20of%20May%20%28novel%29">novel of the same name</a>, Zeta-Jones played the role of the eldest daughter of a family living in the countryside in 1950s Britain. The series was the highest-rated television show in the country at the time, and Zeta-Jones gained wide public recognition for it; she said, "Literally, with one hour of television my life completely changed. I couldn't go anywhere".

Following a brief appearance as <a href="Beatriz%20Enr%C3%ADquez%20de%20Arana">Beatriz Enríquez de Arana</a> in the unsuccessful adventure film "" (1992), Zeta-Jones featured as a belly dancer in disguise in a 1992 episode of <a href="George%20Lucas">George Lucas</a> television series "<a href="The%20Young%20Indiana%20Jones%20Chronicles">The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles</a>". She next took on the part of an aspiring duchess in "<a href="Splitting%20Heirs">Splitting Heirs</a>" (1993), a farcical period drama from the director <a href="Robert%20Young%20%28director%29">Robert Young</a> about two children (<a href="Eric%20Idle">Eric Idle</a> and <a href="Rick%20Moranis">Rick Moranis</a>) who are separated at birth. Reviews for the film were negative, though the critic <a href="Vincent%20Canby">Vincent Canby</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" found her to be "very funny". In 1994, Zeta-Jones played the melancholic Eustacia Vye in the television film "The Return of the Native", an adaptation of the <a href="The%20Return%20of%20the%20Native">novel of the same name</a> (1878) by <a href="Thomas%20Hardy">Thomas Hardy</a>, and the wife of <a href="Lloyd%20Owen">Lloyd Owen</a>'s character in the television war drama "<a href="The%20Cinder%20Path%20%28film%29">The Cinder Path</a>". She was then cast as the <a href="Catherine%20the%20Great">eponymous protagonist</a> of the 1995 television biopic "<a href="Catherine%20the%20Great%20%281995%20film%29">Catherine the Great</a>". In a mixed review, critic Lisa Nesselson of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" found the miniseries to be "brightly colored" but "wooden and hollow", though thought that Zeta-Jones "imparts a certain grace and resolve to her sovereign-in-the-making". Zeta-Jones next starred as the pragmatic girlfriend of <a href="Sean%20Pertwee">Sean Pertwee</a>'s character in "<a href="Blue%20Juice">Blue Juice</a>" (1995), publicised as Britain's first <a href="surf%20film">surf film</a>, which the critic <a href="Leonard%20Maltin">Leonard Maltin</a> described as a "superficial and predictable" production.

Dismayed at being <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones relocated to Los Angeles. She remarked, "There was all this fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I was a pretty face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again." She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (<a href="Treat%20Williams">Treat Williams</a>) in the superhero film "<a href="The%20Phantom%20%281996%20film%29">The Phantom</a>" (1996), starring <a href="Billy%20Zane">Billy Zane</a> in the titular role. A reviewer for "Variety" considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The <a href="CBS">CBS</a> television miniseries "<a href="Titanic%20%281996%20miniseries%29">Titanic</a>" (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite <a href="Peter%20Gallagher">Peter Gallagher</a> and <a href="George%20C.%20Scott">George C. Scott</a>, she portrayed the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother engaged in an extramarital affair on the .

<a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a> took notice of Zeta-Jones in "Titanic" and recommended her to <a href="Martin%20Campbell">Martin Campbell</a>, who was directing "<a href="The%20Mask%20of%20Zorro">The Mask of Zorro</a>" (1998) for Spielberg's production company. Campbell cast her as the leading lady instead of <a href="Izabella%20Scorupco">Izabella Scorupco</a>, who was his original choice for the part. Co-starring <a href="Anthony%20Hopkins">Anthony Hopkins</a> and <a href="Antonio%20Banderas">Antonio Banderas</a>, the film tells the story of <a href="Zorro">Zorro</a> (Hopkins), a Mexican warrior who sets out to avenge the death of his wife and find his lost daughter Elena (Zeta-Jones). She found similarities between her "volatile" Celtic personality and her Latin character's temperament, and in preparation she studied dancing, riding and sword-fighting, and took diction lessons in Spanish. Filming the action and dance sequences while wearing heavy corsets in the humid Mexican desert proved to be a challenge for Zeta-Jones, but she found the experience "worth suffering for". "The Mask of Zorro" was positively received by the critics and earned over US$250 million worldwide. The role proved to be a breakthrough for her and she was nominated for the <a href="MTV%20Movie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Breakthrough%20Performance">MTV Movie Award for Best Breakthrough Performance</a>.

Zeta-Jones' first release of 1999 was the <a href="heist%20film">heist film</a> "<a href="Entrapment%20%28film%29">Entrapment</a>", in which she starred opposite <a href="Sean%20Connery">Sean Connery</a> as a seductive insurance agent on the lookout for an art thief. Despite a negative critical reception, the film was a commercial success; <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "The New York Times" thought that the film provided Zeta-Jones a platform to "show off her slithery skills", and Desson Howe of "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" called on viewers to appreciate the sex appeal she brought to the role. Later that year, Zeta-Jones appeared alongside <a href="Liam%20Neeson">Liam Neeson</a> and <a href="Lili%20Taylor">Lili Taylor</a> in "<a href="The%20Haunting%20%281999%20film%29">The Haunting</a>", a remake of the <a href="The%20Haunting%20%281963%20film%29">1963 film of the same name</a> about a team of paranormal experts who look into strange occurrences in an ill-fated mansion. The horror feature received generally poor reviews but found a significant worldwide audience. In a scathing review, the critic <a href="Mick%20LaSalle">Mick LaSalle</a> wrote that "Zeta-Jones seems less an actress and more a pretty face, and not an interesting one at that".

After taking the supporting part of star <a href="John%20Cusack">John Cusack</a>'s romantic interest in the comedy-drama "<a href="High%20Fidelity%20%28film%29">High Fidelity</a>" (2000), Zeta-Jones starred in <a href="Steven%20Soderbergh">Steven Soderbergh</a>'s "<a href="Traffic%20%282000%20film%29">Traffic</a>" (2000). In the ensemble thriller on drug abuse starring <a href="Michael%20Douglas">Michael Douglas</a> and <a href="Benicio%20del%20Toro">Benicio del Toro</a>, she played Helena Ayala, the pregnant wife of a <a href="drug%20lord">drug lord</a> who takes over the business when her husband is arrested. Initially written by Soderbergh as a mother of two, he changed the part to that of a pregnant woman on Zeta-Jones' suggestion, to accommodate her own pregnancy. Highly profitable at the box office and critically acclaimed, "Traffic" was described by the "<a href="Dallas%20Observer">Dallas Observer</a>" as "a remarkable achievement in filmmaking, a beautiful and brutal work". Edward Guthman of the "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" found Zeta-Jones to be a standout among the ensemble and labelled her "sensational" in a scene in which she confronts a <a href="Tijuana">Tijuana</a> dealer, adding that "through sheer conviction, she electrifies a moment that could have been absurd". The ensemble of "Traffic" won the <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Cast%20in%20a%20Motion%20Picture">SAG Award for Outstanding Cast</a> and Zeta-Jones was nominated for the <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20ActressMotion%20Picture">Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress</a>.

The romantic comedy "<a href="America%27s%20Sweethearts">America's Sweethearts</a>" was Zeta-Jones' sole film project of 2001. She starred as a shrewd movie star, opposite <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a> who featured as her character's under-confident sibling. The critic <a href="Roger%20Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> compared the film unfavourably to the musical "<a href="Singin%27%20in%20the%20Rain">Singin' in the Rain</a>" (1952), but thought that Zeta-Jones was aptly "chilly and manipulative" in her part. The following year, Zeta-Jones starred alongside <a href="Ren%C3%A9e%20Zellweger">Renée Zellweger</a> as the murderous nightclub singer <a href="Velma%20Kelly">Velma Kelly</a> in "<a href="Chicago%20%282002%20film%29">Chicago</a>" (2002), a film adaptation of the Broadway musical of the <a href="Chicago%20%28musical%29">same name</a> from the director <a href="Rob%20Marshall">Rob Marshall</a>. She based her character's look and mannerisms on the actress <a href="Louise%20Brooks">Louise Brooks</a>, and as the script did not provide a backstory to Kelly, she worked to convey her character's "flamboyance" and "desperation" through "little looks and nuances". The film and her performance received critical acclaim. William Arnold of the "<a href="Seattle%20Post-Intelligencer">Seattle Post-Intelligencer</a>" felt that the actress made "a wonderfully statuesque and bitchy saloon goddess", and David Edelstein of "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" magazine wrote that she has "a smoldering confidence that takes your mind off her not-always-fluid dancingalthough she's a perfectly fine hoofer, with majestic limbs and a commanding cleavage" and particularly praised her rendition of the song "<a href="All%20That%20Jazz%20%28song%29">All That Jazz</a>". "Chicago" earned worldwide, and was the recipient of the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>. For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Academy Award</a>, <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">SAG Award</a>, and the <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA Award</a> for Best Supporting Actress, among other awards and nominations.

Following the success of "Chicago", Zeta-Jones voiced the part of Princess Marina in "" (2003), an animated film featuring <a href="Brad%20Pitt">Brad Pitt</a> as the voice of <a href="Sinbad%20the%20Sailor">Sinbad the Sailor</a>. She was drawn to the project to give her young children an opportunity to "hear [her] and get a sense of [her] on film", although the film proved to be a <a href="box%20office%20bomb">box office bomb</a>. Also in 2003, Zeta-Jones starred alongside <a href="George%20Clooney">George Clooney</a> in the <a href="Coen%20Brothers">Coen Brothers</a> black comedy "<a href="Intolerable%20Cruelty">Intolerable Cruelty</a>". A commercial success, the film saw her play the role of a serial divorcée who is drawn towards a divorce attorney (Clooney). Writing for "<a href="Empire%20magazine">Empire</a>" magazine, the critic Damon Wise labelled the film a "dazzling screwball comedy" and felt that Zeta-Jones showed "an admirable facility for old-school quickfire patter". Other reviewers praised her onscreen chemistry with Clooney.
In 2004, Spielberg approached her to play an insecure air hostess in his comedy "<a href="The%20Terminal">The Terminal</a>", a film about a man (<a href="Tom%20Hanks">Tom Hanks</a>) who is trapped at the <a href="JFK%20International%20Airport">JFK International Airport</a> when he is denied entry into the United States. Spielberg was intent on her playing against type as a strong-willed woman, with a vulnerability in her character, but the critic <a href="A.%20O.%20Scott">A. O. Scott</a> felt that it came across as using her for "her looks rather than for the arch, self-mocking wit that is her secret weapon as a comic actress". Commercially, "The Terminal" performed well. She next worked with Soderbergh to film "<a href="Ocean%27s%20Twelve">Ocean's Twelve</a>", a sequel to his heist film "<a href="Ocean%27s%20Eleven%20%282001%20film%29">Ocean's Eleven</a>" (2001), which also reunited her with stars Clooney, Pitt, and Roberts. The production, which was filmed in several European countries, saw Zeta-Jones play Isabel Lahiri, a <a href="Europol">Europol</a> agent, and the love interest of Pitt's character. Paul Clinton of <a href="CNN">CNN</a> noted that her sex appeal benefited the film. Conversely, Ken Tucker of "<a href="New%20York%20%28magazine%29">New York</a>" magazine argued that her character was redundant to the film's plot. Despite dividing critics, the sequel earned over US$360 million globally.

"<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zorro">The Legend of Zorro</a>" (2005), a sequel to "The Mask of Zorro", saw Zeta-Jones reprise her role of Eléna opposite Banderas. Set 10 years after the first film, the sequel follows Eléna struggling with married life. Unlike the original, the film was disliked by critics and was a commercial disappointment. She did not have any film releases in 2006. A biopic of <a href="Harry%20Houdini">Harry Houdini</a>, entitled "<a href="Death%20Defying%20Acts">Death Defying Acts</a>" (2007), starring <a href="Guy%20Pearce">Guy Pearce</a> as the <a href="escapologist">escapologist</a> Houdini, featured Zeta-Jones as a Scottish con artist who claims psychic powers. The unsuccessful production was given only a limited theatrical release.

In 2007, Zeta-Jones starred alongside <a href="Aaron%20Eckhart">Aaron Eckhart</a> and <a href="Abigail%20Breslin">Abigail Breslin</a> in the romantic comedy "<a href="No%20Reservations%20%28film%29">No Reservations</a>", a remake of the German film "<a href="Mostly%20Martha%20%28film%29">Mostly Martha</a>" (2001). "No Reservations" tells the story of an ambitious chef (Zeta-Jones) whose life changes for the better when she takes in her young niece (Breslin) after her sister's death. In preparation for her part, Zeta-Jones worked in the kitchen and waited on tables at New York's Fiamma Osteria restaurant. Claudia Puig of "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" thought that Zeta-Jones "shines as a character that finely balances off-putting reserve with sympathetic appeal", and Roger Ebert, despite disliking the film, found her "convincing" in her role. With a global gross of US$92 million, the film marked Zeta-Jones' final commercial success of the decade.

Following "No Reservations", Zeta-Jones significantly decreased her workload in the next five years. She instead chose to focus on her family and health, having been diagnosed with <a href="bipolar%20II%20disorder">bipolar II disorder</a>, and her infrequent acting appearances were in smaller-scale and less successful productions. She took on the role of a 40-year-old mother attracted to a younger man (<a href="Justin%20Bartha">Justin Bartha</a>) in the romantic comedy "<a href="The%20Rebound">The Rebound</a>". The production was released theatrically in markets outside of the United States in 2009–10, but due to financial troubles of its distributor, The Film Development, the film failed to release theatrically in America.

Zeta-Jones returned to stage in 2009 with a revival of the musical "<a href="A%20Little%20Night%20Music">A Little Night Music</a>", which marked her Broadway debut. Set in <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> during the early twentieth century, the musical follows the relationship between three people (Zeta-Jones, <a href="Angela%20Lansbury">Angela Lansbury</a> and Alexander Hanson) during the course of an evening. She played Desirée Armfeldt, an ageing actress, and was particularly drawn to the complexities of the play, saying, "There's no jazzy hands, no high kicks, no fishnet stockings, ... It's not one of those shows where you can dig about three inches and come out the other end. You can keep digging and digging and digging". She did not listen to past recordings of the songs in the play so she could bring her own interpretation to them. The critic Claire Prentice of "The Daily Telegraph" wrote that Zeta-Jones brought in a "quiet, reflective poignancy" in her rendition of the song "<a href="Send%20in%20the%20Clowns">Send in the Clowns</a>", but Emma Brocks of "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" was more critical, remarking that "with her pretty voice, head wresting this way and that, [she] seems to be auditioning for stage school". For her performance, Zeta-Jones won the <a href="Drama%20Desk%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Actress%20in%20a%20Musical">Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical</a> and the <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Musical">Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical</a>.

Following a three-year sabbatical from acting, Zeta-Jones made her screen comeback in "<a href="Lay%20the%20Favorite">Lay the Favorite</a>" (2012), a comedy co-starring <a href="Bruce%20Willis">Bruce Willis</a> and <a href="Rebecca%20Hall">Rebecca Hall</a>, in which she played the jealous wife of a gambler (Willis). Reviews for the film were negative, and the critic Betsy Sharkey of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" found Zeta-Jones to be "far too shrill to amuse". In the ensemble musical comedy "<a href="Rock%20of%20Ages%20%282012%20film%29">Rock of Ages</a>", co-starring <a href="Tom%20Cruise">Tom Cruise</a> and <a href="Bryan%20Cranston">Bryan Cranston</a>, Zeta-Jones played the part of a religiously conservative wife of a mayor. She was attracted to the idea of playing a "nightmare of a woman" and based the role on the politician <a href="Michele%20Bachmann">Michele Bachmann</a>; the film received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Her final release of 2012 was "<a href="Playing%20for%20Keeps%20%282012%20film%29">Playing for Keeps</a>", a romantic comedy with <a href="Gerard%20Butler">Gerard Butler</a>, which proved to be her third box office failure of the year.

In 2013, Zeta-Jones took on a leading role in the crime thriller "<a href="Broken%20City%20%28film%29">Broken City</a>", co-starring <a href="Mark%20Wahlberg">Mark Wahlberg</a> and <a href="Russell%20Crowe">Russell Crowe</a>. The film tells the story of a private detective (Wahlberg) who is hired by the mayor of New York (Crowe) to spy on his wife (Zeta-Jones). <a href="Todd%20McCarthy">Todd McCarthy</a> of "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" thought that Zeta-Jones "looks like class itself and nicely underplays", and Liam Lacey of "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>" observed that the actress "does a fair, if incongruous, impersonation of a forties vamp". However, as with Zeta-Jones' previous few projects, the film was not widely seen, and received poor reviews. This changed when Zeta-Jones collaborated with Soderbergh for the third time to film the critically acclaimed thriller "<a href="Side%20Effects%20%282013%20film%29">Side Effects</a>" (2013). Co-starring with <a href="Channing%20Tatum">Channing Tatum</a>, <a href="Jude%20Law">Jude Law</a> and <a href="Rooney%20Mara">Rooney Mara</a>, the film saw her play a mysterious psychiatrist who recommends an <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a> drug with serious side effects. Peter Travers found the film to be a "hell of a thriller, twisty, terrific and packed with surprises" and considered Zeta-Jones to be "dynamite" in it.

In the action-comedy film "<a href="Red%202%20%28film%29">Red 2</a>" (2013), which served as a sequel to the 2010 film "<a href="Red%20%282010%20film%29">Red</a>", Zeta-Jones played a seductive Russian double agent, alongside Bruce Willis, <a href="Helen%20Mirren">Helen Mirren</a>, and <a href="Mary-Louise%20Parker">Mary-Louise Parker</a>. She was drawn to the project, which follows the comic adventures of retired spies, for "the action, the humour, [and] the tongue-in-cheek quality of it". Writing for "The Hollywood Reporter", Justin Lowe remarked that Zeta-Jones "nicely pulls off Russian spy Katja's mix of allure and menace", and with a worldwide gross of US$148 million, "Red 2" emerged as her most widely seen film since "No Reservations".

Following "Red 2", Zeta-Jones took another sabbatical from acting, saying: "If I'm going to leave my family for any length of time it had better be for a role that I haven't played before, [otherwise] I would prefer to stay at home". She found the role opposite <a href="Bill%20Nighy">Bill Nighy</a> and <a href="Toby%20Jones">Toby Jones</a> in the British war comedy film "<a href="Dad%27s%20Army%20%282016%20film%29">Dad's Army</a>" (2016), based on the television sitcom of the <a href="Dad%27s%20Army">same name</a>. She was cast as a glamorous journalist reporting on a British Home Guard platoon based in <a href="Walmington-on-Sea">Walmington-on-Sea</a>. Catherine Bray of "Variety" found the film to be an "amiable but creaky resurrection" of the popular sitcom, and thought that while Zeta-Jones "hits the required single note with some spirit" she was "generally underused" in it.

Zeta-Jones returned to television in 2017 by portraying the actress <a href="Olivia%20de%20Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> in the first season of <a href="Ryan%20Murphy%20%28writer%29">Ryan Murphy</a>'s anthology drama series "<a href="Feud%20%28TV%20series%29">Feud</a>", subtitled "Bette and Joan", about the rivalry between the actresses <a href="Joan%20Crawford">Joan Crawford</a> and <a href="Bette%20Davis">Bette Davis</a> (played by <a href="Jessica%20Lange">Jessica Lange</a> and <a href="Susan%20Sarandon">Susan Sarandon</a>, respectively). Dominic Patten of "<a href="Deadline%20Hollywood">Deadline Hollywood</a>" found Zeta-Jones to be "wonderfully cast" and Sonia Saraiya of "Variety" praised her for providing "the best turn in the show". Displeased with an "unauthorized use of her name and identity" in the series, de Havilland, at 101 years old, sued the network and producers of "Feud" for <a href="invasion%20of%20privacy">invasion of privacy</a> and other <a href="personality%20rights">personality rights</a>. The lawsuit was later dismissed by a California <a href="appellate%20court">appellate court</a>.

In 2018, Zeta-Jones starred as the drug lord <a href="Griselda%20Blanco">Griselda Blanco</a> in the <a href="Lifetime%20%28TV%20network%29">Lifetime</a> television film "<a href="Cocaine%20Godmother">Cocaine Godmother</a>". Despite her character's misdeeds, she was drawn to her character's fortitude and ability to stand out in a male-dominated business. Writing for <a href="IndieWire">IndieWire</a>, Hanh Nguyen criticised the decision to cast Zeta-Jones in the part of a Latino woman, adding that "she’s not just unconvincing; she’s outlandish". She was later nominated as Best Actress in a Television Movie at the <a href="Women%27s%20Image%20Network%20Awards">Women's Image Awards</a>. She next played the lead role of Vicki Ellis, an unrelenting pageant coach, in the <a href="Facebook%20Watch">Facebook Watch</a> comedy-drama series "<a href="Queen%20America">Queen America</a>". To play a character who has <a href="bulimia%20nervosa">bulimia</a>, she drew on her teenage experiences of interacting with dancers who suffered from eating disorders. In a positive review, Jen Chaney of "<a href="Vulture.com">Vulture</a>" wrote that "Zeta-Jones is always at her best when she’s fiery, and this part gives her plenty of opportunities to shift into beast mode".

In addition to her acting career, Zeta-Jones supports various charities and causes. She is a patron of Swansea's Longfields Day Centre for the disabled, and has made sizeable donations to the centre. In 2001, she auctioned an outfit she wore in "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) to raise funds for <a href="HIV/AIDS%20in%20Africa">AIDS patients in Africa</a>. In 2005, she became the ambassador of the <a href="National%20Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Children">National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children</a> charity, and launched the Full Stop appeal in Wales to raise awareness on child abuse. She has also given her support to other charitable organisations for children such as the <a href="International%20Centre%20for%20Missing%20%26amp%3B%20Exploited%20Children">International Centre for Missing & Exploited Children</a> and the <a href="Noah%27s%20Ark%20Appeal">Noah's Ark Appeal</a>, among others. Zeta-Jones is also the founding host for "A Fine Romance", an annual charitable program that helps raise funds for the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20%26amp%3B%20Television%20Fund">Motion Picture & Television Fund</a>, and is one of the members of the <a href="Cinema%20for%20Peace%20Foundation">Cinema for Peace Foundation</a>.

Zeta-Jones briefly dabbled with a singing career in the early 1990s. In 1992, she provided her voice to the character of actress <a href="Jean%20Simmons">Jean Simmons</a> in <a href="Jeff%20Wayne">Jeff Wayne</a>'s musical retelling of "<a href="Spartacus%20%28film%29">Spartacus</a>", entitled "<a href="Jeff%20Wayne%27s%20Musical%20Version%20of%20Spartacus">Jeff Wayne's Musical Version of Spartacus</a>". Three years later, she released her first single, "In the Arms of Love", on Wayne's Wow! Records. She later sang "<a href="True%20Love%20Ways">True Love Ways</a>", a duet with <a href="David%20Essex">David Essex</a> in 1994.

Zeta-Jones has featured as an advertising spokeswoman for several brands and products. She was named the global ambassador for the cosmetics company <a href="Elizabeth%20Arden%2C%20Inc.">Elizabeth Arden, Inc.</a> in 2002. Also that year, she was signed on by the phone company <a href="T-Mobile">T-Mobile</a> for an estimated US$10 million per year, making her the highest-paid celebrity endorser at the time. In 2017, Zeta-Jones launched her own line of home decoration products named Casa Zeta-Jones. Also that year, she featured in a theatrical production of "<a href="The%20Children%27s%20Monologues">The Children's Monologues</a>", in which she performed a monologue as a mathematically inclined young girl. The event raised funds for <a href="Dramatic%20Need">Dramatic Need</a>, a charity that helps African children pursue a career in the arts.

The success of the television series "The Darling Buds of May" (199193) made Zeta-Jones a popular celebrity in Britain, and her personal life has since been chronicled by the media. Her relationships in the early 1990s with television personality <a href="John%20Leslie%20%28TV%20presenter%29">John Leslie</a>, singer <a href="David%20Essex">David Essex</a>, and pop star <a href="Mick%20Hucknall">Mick Hucknall</a> were widely reported by the British press. In the mid-1990s she was briefly engaged to Scottish actor <a href="Angus%20Macfadyen">Angus Macfadyen</a>. In an interview with the "<a href="Daily%20Mirror">Daily Mirror</a>" in 1995, she described her lifestyle: "I drink, I swear, I like sex".

Zeta-Jones met actor <a href="Michael%20Douglas">Michael Douglas</a>, with whom she shares a birthday and who is 25 years her senior, at the <a href="Deauville%20Film%20Festival">Deauville Film Festival</a> in France in August 1998, after being introduced by <a href="Danny%20DeVito">Danny DeVito</a>. They became engaged on 31 December 1999, and were married at the <a href="Plaza%20Hotel">Plaza Hotel</a> in New York on 18 November 2000 after Douglas' divorce was finalised. The high-profile ceremony, which cost an estimated £1.5 million, was labelled as the "wedding of the year" by the BBC. The couple signed a £1 million deal with "<a href="OK%21">OK!</a>" magazine to release pictures of the event, and the rest of the press were not permitted to enter. Despite this, journalists of "<a href="Hello%21%20%28magazine%29">Hello!</a>" magazine surreptitiously took pictures of the ceremony, and the couple successfully sued the magazine for invasion of privacy.

Douglas and Zeta-Jones have two children: a son, Dylan Michael (born August 2000), and a daughter, Carys Zeta (born April 2003). The family lived in <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> until 2009, and , live in rural New York State. In 2010, Douglas was diagnosed with tongue cancer, and Zeta-Jones faced an emotionally turbulent time; she said, "When you get sideswiped like that [with the illness] it's an obvious trigger for your balance to be a little bit off – not sleeping, worry, stress." This trigger led to Zeta-Jones suffering from <a href="depression%20%28mood%29">depression</a>, and despite initial apprehension, she spoke publicly about suffering from <a href="bipolar%20II%20disorder">bipolar II disorder</a>. She sought treatment by checking herself into hospital in 2011, and again in 2013. Owing to the stress of both their illnesses, the couple decided to live separately in 2013, though without taking legal action towards separation or divorce. They reconciled in 2014, with Douglas stating that they were "stronger than ever".

Zeta-Jones' beauty and sex appeal have been described by several sources, including "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine, who ranked her first in their listing of the "Most Beautiful People" in 1998. She continued to feature in the list from 200004. In 2003, the magazine "<a href="Esquire%20%28magazine%29">Esquire</a>" labelled her the most beautiful woman on the planet. In 2011, she was named the most beautiful British woman by a poll conducted by the television network <a href="QVC">QVC</a>.

The journalist Sheila Johnston of "The Daily Telegraph", in 2010, described Zeta-Jones as "the ultimate self-made success" who "constantly made bold decisions, and scrubbed up very nicely into a luscious star who radiates a classic […] brand of big-screen glamour." Guy Adams of "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" considers her personality to be "self-effacing and energetic" but takes note of her "steely core" in her off-screen persona. Zeta-Jones' success in her early Hollywood films "The Mask of Zorro" (1998) and "Entrapment" (1999) relied predominantly on her sex appeal, but she was later appreciated for her versatility.

Zeta-Jones' career graph and marriage to Douglas have been a subject of satire. A 2006 episode of the satirical British television show "<a href="Star%20Stories">Star Stories</a>" (2006–2008) was entitled "Catherine Zeta-Jones—Her Quest to Prove Herself ... And Also Find Love", about a fictitious life story of Zeta-Jones. Addressing her perceived media image, Zeta-Jones remarked in a 2004 interview to "<a href="USA%20Weekend">USA Weekend</a>": "The biggest misconception of me is that I'm some die-hard, ambitious, do-anything-to-get-anything kind of person, I'm not. I'm very shy socially." Zeta-Jones is protective of her public image, and the use of her likeness is carefully controlled. As well as taking legal action against "Hello!" magazine, she sued a <a href="Nevada">Nevada</a>-based topless club for including her image on their advertising. In 2003, the celebrity biographer Cliff Goodwin wrote an unauthorised biography of the actress, entitled "Catherine Zeta Jones: The Biography", but the publication was indefinitely postponed when she issued a legal notice prohibiting its release.

Zeta-Jones' films that have earned the most at the box office, , include:

For her role in "Chicago" (2002), Zeta-Jones was awarded the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Academy Award</a>, <a href="Screen%20Actors%20Guild%20Award%20for%20Outstanding%20Performance%20by%20a%20Female%20Actor%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">Screen Actors Guild Award</a>, and <a href="BAFTA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20in%20a%20Supporting%20Role">BAFTA Award</a> for Best Supporting Actress. She has received two <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award">Golden Globe Award</a> nominations: <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture">Best Supporting Actress</a> for "Traffic" (2000) and <a href="Golden%20Globe%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress%20%E2%80%93%20Motion%20Picture%20Comedy%20or%20Musical">Best Actress in a Comedy or Musical</a> for "Chicago" (2002). She was appointed <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) by the <a href="Monarchy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Monarchy of the United Kingdom</a> in <a href="2010%20Birthday%20Honours">2010</a> for her film and charity work.

Frederick Delius

Frederick Theodore Albert Delius, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">CH</a> ( 29 January 1862 – 10 June 1934), originally Fritz Delius, was an English composer. Born in the north of England to a prosperous mercantile family, he resisted attempts to recruit him to commerce. He was sent to <a href="Florida">Florida</a> in the United States in 1884 to manage an orange plantation. He soon neglected his managerial duties and in 1886 returned to Europe.

Having been influenced by <a href="African-American%20music">African-American music</a> during his short stay in Florida, he began composing. After a brief period of formal musical study in Germany beginning in 1886, he embarked on a full-time career as a composer in Paris and then in nearby <a href="Grez-sur-Loing">Grez-sur-Loing</a>, where he and his wife <a href="Jelka%20Rosen">Jelka</a> lived for the rest of their lives, except during the First World War.

Delius's first successes came in Germany, where <a href="Hans%20Haym">Hans Haym</a> and other conductors promoted his music from the late 1890s. In Delius's native Britain, his music did not make regular appearances in concert programmes until 1907, after <a href="Thomas%20Beecham">Thomas Beecham</a> took it up. Beecham conducted the full premiere of "<a href="A%20Mass%20of%20Life">A Mass of Life</a>" in London in 1909 (he had premiered Part II in Germany in 1908); he staged the opera "<a href="A%20Village%20Romeo%20and%20Juliet">A Village Romeo and Juliet</a>" at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> in 1910; and he mounted a six-day Delius festival in London in 1929, as well as making gramophone recordings of many of the composer's works. After 1918, Delius began to suffer the effects of <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>, contracted during his earlier years in Paris. He became paralysed and blind, but completed some late compositions between 1928 and 1932 with the aid of an <a href="amanuensis">amanuensis</a>, <a href="Eric%20Fenby">Eric Fenby</a>.

The lyricism in Delius's early compositions reflected the music he had heard in America and the influences of European composers such as <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Edvard Grieg</a> and <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>. As his skills matured, he developed a style uniquely his own, characterised by his individual orchestration and his uses of <a href="Diatonic%20and%20chromatic">chromatic harmony</a>. Delius's music has been only intermittently popular, and often subject to critical attacks. The Delius Society, formed in 1962 by his more dedicated followers, continues to promote knowledge of the composer's life and works, and sponsors the annual Delius Prize competition for young musicians.

Delius was born in <a href="Bradford">Bradford</a> in <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>. He was baptised as "Fritz Theodor Albert Delius", and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, "née" Krönig (1838–1929). Delius's parents were born in <a href="Bielefeld">Bielefeld</a>, <a href="Westphalia">Westphalia</a>, of Dutch origin; the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine. Julius's father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under <a href="Gebhard%20Leberecht%20von%20Bl%C3%BCcher">Blücher</a> in the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.

The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a> and <a href="Carlo%20Alfredo%20Piatti">Carlo Alfredo Piatti</a> were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Chopin</a> and <a href="Edvard%20Grieg">Grieg</a> rather than the Austro-German music of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé Orchestra</a>, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of <a href="Leeds">Leeds</a>. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at <a href="Bradford%20Grammar%20School">Bradford Grammar School</a>, where the singer <a href="John%20Coates%20%28tenor%29">John Coates</a> was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the <a href="London%20International%20College">International College</a> at <a href="Isleworth">Isleworth</a> (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.

Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's representative in <a href="Stroud">Stroud</a> in <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, where he did moderately well. After being sent in a similar capacity to <a href="Chemnitz">Chemnitz</a>, he neglected his duties in favour of trips to the major musical centres of Germany, and musical studies with <a href="Hans%20Sitt">Hans Sitt</a>. His father sent him to Sweden, where he again put his artistic interests ahead of commerce, coming under the influence of the Norwegian dramatists <a href="Henrik%20Ibsen">Henrik Ibsen</a> and <a href="Gunnar%20Heiberg">Gunnar Heiberg</a>. Ibsen's denunciations of social conventions further alienated Delius from his commercial background. Delius was then sent to represent the firm in France, but he frequently absented himself from business for excursions to the <a href="French%20Riviera">French Riviera</a>. After this, Julius Delius recognised that there was no prospect that his son would succeed in the family business, but he remained opposed to music as a profession, and instead sent him to America to manage an orange plantation.

Whether the move to America was Julius's idea or his son's is unknown. A leading Florida property firm had branches in several English cities including Bradford; in an article on Delius's time in Florida, William Randel conjectures that either Julius Delius visited the Bradford office and conceived the notion of sending his wayward son to grow oranges in Florida, or that Fritz himself saw it as a way to escape the hated family wool business and suggested the idea to his father. Delius was in Florida from the spring of 1884 to the autumn of 1885, living on a plantation at Solano Grove () between <a href="Picolata%2C%20Florida">Picolata</a> and <a href="Tocoi%2C%20Florida">Tocoi</a> on the <a href="Saint%20Johns%20River">Saint Johns River</a>, about 35 miles (55 kilometers) south of <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville</a>. He continued to be engrossed in music, and in Jacksonville he met Thomas Ward, who became his teacher in <a href="counterpoint">counterpoint</a> and <a href="musical%20composition">composition</a>. Delius later said that Ward's teaching was the only useful music instruction he ever had.

Delius later liked to represent his house at Solano Grove as "a shanty", but it was a substantial cottage of four rooms, with plenty of space for Delius to entertain guests. Ward sometimes stayed there, as did an old Bradford friend, Charles Douglas, and Delius's brother Ernest. Protected from excessive summer heat by river breezes and a canopy of oak trees, the house was an agreeable place to live in. Delius paid little attention to the business of growing oranges, and continued to pursue his musical interests. Jacksonville had a rich, though to a European, unorthodox musical life. Randel notes that in local hotels, the African-American waiters doubled as singers, with daily vocal concerts for patrons and passers-by, giving Delius his introduction to <a href="Spiritual%20%28music%29">spirituals</a>. Additionally, ship owners encouraged their deckhands to sing as they worked. "Delius never forgot the singing as he heard it, day or night, carried sweet and clear across the water to his verandah at Solano Grove, whenever a steam-ship passed; it is hard to imagine conditions less conducive to cultivating oranges—or more conducive to composing."

While in Florida, Delius had his first composition published, a polka for piano called "Zum Carnival". In late 1885 he left a caretaker in charge of Solano Grove and moved to <a href="Danville%2C%20Virginia">Danville, Virginia</a>. Thereafter he pursued a wholly musical career. An advertisement in the local paper announced, "Fritz Delius will begin at once giving instruction in Piano, Violin, Theory and Composition. He will give lessons at the residences of his pupils. Terms reasonable." Delius also offered lessons in French and German. Danville had a thriving musical life, and early works of his were publicly performed there.

During his time in Florida, Delius is said to have fathered a son with a local African-American woman named Chloe, although details of this legend are scarce. Violinist <a href="Tasmin%20Little">Tasmin Little</a> embarked on a search for descendants of Delius's alleged love-child in the 1990s. Upon Delius's return to Florida some years later to sell the plantation, it was suggested that Chloe, fearing that he had come to take her son away from her, fled with the child and disappeared. Little believes that this tragic occurrence was a significant influence in the tone of his works thereafter.

In 1886, Julius Delius finally agreed to allow his son to pursue a musical career, and paid for him to study music formally. Delius left Danville and returned to Europe via New York, where he paused briefly to give a few lessons. Back in Europe he enrolled at the <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn%20College%20of%20Music%20and%20Theatre">conservatoire</a> in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Germany. Leipzig was a major musical centre, where <a href="Artur%20Nikisch">Nikisch</a> and <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> were conductors at the <a href="Semperoper">Opera House</a>, and <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> and <a href="Pyotr%20Ilyich%20Tchaikovsky">Tchaikovsky</a> conducted their works at the <a href="Leipzig%20Gewandhaus">Gewandhaus</a>. At the conservatoire, Delius made little progress in his piano studies under <a href="Carl%20Reinecke">Carl Reinecke</a>, but <a href="Salomon%20Jadassohn">Salomon Jadassohn</a> praised his hard work and grasp of counterpoint; Delius also resumed studies under Hans Sitt. Delius's early biographer, the composer <a href="Patrick%20Hadley">Patrick Hadley</a>, observed that no trace of his academic tuition can be found in Delius's mature music "except in certain of the weaker passages". Much more important to Delius's development was meeting the composer Edvard Grieg in Leipzig. Grieg, like Ward before him, recognised Delius's potential. In the spring of 1888, Sitt conducted Delius's "<a href="Florida%20Suite">Florida Suite</a>" for an audience of three: Grieg, <a href="Christian%20Sinding">Christian Sinding</a> and the composer. Grieg and Sinding were enthusiastic and became warm supporters of Delius. At a dinner party in London in April 1888, Grieg finally convinced Julius Delius that his son's future lay in music.

After leaving Leipzig in 1888, Delius moved to Paris where his uncle, Theodore, took him under his wing and looked after him socially and financially. Over the next eight years, Delius befriended many writers and artists, including <a href="August%20Strindberg">August Strindberg</a>, <a href="Edvard%20Munch">Edvard Munch</a> and <a href="Paul%20Gauguin">Paul Gauguin</a>. He mixed very little with French musicians, although <a href="Florent%20Schmitt">Florent Schmitt</a> arranged the piano scores of Delius's first two operas, "Irmelin" and "The Magic Fountain" (<a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Ravel</a> later did the same for his "<a href="verismo">verismo</a>" opera "Margot la rouge"). As a result, his music never became widely known in France. Delius's biographer Diana McVeagh says of these years that Delius "was found to be attractive, warm-hearted, spontaneous, and amorous." It is generally believed that during this period he contracted the <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a> that caused the collapse of his health in later years.

Delius's Paris years were musically productive. His symphonic poem "Paa Vidderne" was performed in <a href="Oslo">Christiania</a> in 1891 and in Monte Carlo in 1894; Gunnar Heiberg commissioned Delius to provide <a href="incidental%20music">incidental music</a> for his play "Folkeraadet" in 1897; and Delius's second opera, "The Magic Fountain", was accepted for staging at <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, but the project fell through for unknown reasons. Other works of the period were the fantasy overture "Over the Hills and Far Away" (1895–97) and orchestral variations, "Appalachia: Variations on an Old Slave Song" (1896, rewritten in 1904 for voices and orchestra).

In 1897, Delius met the German artist <a href="Jelka%20Rosen">Jelka Rosen</a>, who later became his wife. She was a professional painter, a friend of <a href="Auguste%20Rodin">Auguste Rodin</a>, and a regular exhibitor at the <a href="Salon%20des%20Ind%C3%A9pendants">Salon des Indépendants</a>. Jelka quickly declared her admiration for the young composer's music, and the couple were drawn closer together by a shared passion for the works of the German philosopher <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> and the music of Grieg. Jelka bought a house in <a href="Grez-sur-Loing">Grez-sur-Loing</a>, a village outside Paris on the edge of <a href="Forest%20of%20Fontainebleau">Fontainebleau</a>. Delius visited her there, and after a brief return visit to Florida, he moved in with her. In 1903 they married, and, apart from a short period when the area was threatened by the advancing German army during the First World War, Delius lived in Grez for the rest of his life. The marriage was not conventional: Jelka was, at first, the principal earner; there were no children; and Delius was not a faithful husband. Jelka was often distressed by his affairs, but her devotion did not waver.

In the same year, Delius began a fruitful association with German supporters of his music, the conductors <a href="Hans%20Haym">Hans Haym</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Cassirer">Fritz Cassirer</a> and <a href="Alfred%20Hertz">Alfred Hertz</a> at <a href="Elberfeld">Elberfeld</a>, and <a href="Julius%20Buths">Julius Buths</a> at <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>. Haym conducted "Over the Hills and Far Away", which he gave under its German title "Über die Berge in die Ferne" on 13 November 1897, believed to be the first time Delius's music was heard in Germany. In 1899 Hertz gave a Delius concert in <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Hall">St. James's Hall</a> in London, which included "Over the Hills and Far Away", a choral piece, "Mitternachtslied", and excerpts from the opera "<a href="Koanga">Koanga</a>". This occasion was an unusual opportunity for an unknown composer at a time when any sort of orchestral concert was a rare event in London. In spite of encouraging reviews, Delius's orchestral music was not heard again in an English concert hall until 1907.

The orchestral work "" was composed in 1899 and dedicated to Haym. He gave the premiere at Elberfeld on 14 December 1901. It provoked some critical comment from the local newspaper, which complained that the composer put his listeners on a bus and shuttled them from one Parisian night-spot to another, "but he does not let us hear the tuneful gypsy melodies in the boulevard cafés, always just cymbals and tambourine and mostly from two cabarets at the same time at that". The work was given under <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Busoni</a> in Berlin less than a year later.

Most of Delius's premieres of this period were given by Haym and his fellow German conductors. In 1904 Cassirer premiered "Koanga", and in the same year the Piano Concerto was given in Elberfeld, and "Lebenstanz" in Düsseldorf. "Appalachia" (choral orchestral variations on an old slave song, also inspired by Florida) followed there in 1905. "<a href="Sea%20Drift%20%28Delius%29">Sea Drift</a>" (a cantata with words taken from a poem by <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>) was premiered at <a href="Essen">Essen</a> in 1906, and the opera "<a href="A%20Village%20Romeo%20and%20Juliet">A Village Romeo and Juliet</a>" in Berlin in 1907. Delius's reputation in Germany remained high until the First World War; in 1910 his rhapsody "<a href="Brigg%20Fair">Brigg Fair</a>" was given by 36 different German orchestras.

By 1907, thanks to performances of his works in many German cities, Delius was, as Thomas Beecham said, "floating safely on a wave of prosperity which increased as the year went on". <a href="Henry%20Wood">Henry Wood</a> premiered the revised version of Delius's Piano Concerto that year. Also in 1907, Cassirer conducted some concerts in London, at one of which, with Beecham's New Symphony Orchestra, he presented "Appalachia". Beecham, who had until then heard not a note of Delius's music, expressed his "wonderment" and became a lifelong devotee of the composer's works. In January 1908, he conducted the British premiere of "Paris: The Song of a Great City". Later that year, Beecham introduced "Brigg Fair" to London audiences, and <a href="Enrique%20Fern%C3%A1ndez%20Arb%C3%B3s">Fernández Arbós</a> presented "Lebenstanz".

In 1909, Beecham conducted the first complete performance of "<a href="A%20Mass%20of%20Life">A Mass of Life</a>", the largest and most ambitious of Delius's concert works, written for four soloists, a double choir, and a large orchestra. Although the work was based on the same <a href="Thus%20Spoke%20Zarathustra">Nietzsche work</a> as Richard Strauss's "<a href="Also%20sprach%20Zarathustra%20%28Strauss%29">Also sprach Zarathustra</a>", Delius distanced himself from the Strauss work, which he considered a complete failure. Nor was Strauss an admirer of Delius, as he was of <a href="Edward%20Elgar">Elgar</a>; he told Delius that he did not wish to conduct "Paris"—"the symphonic development seems to me to be too scant, and it seems moreover to be an imitation of <a href="Gustave%20Charpentier">Charpentier</a>".

In the early years of the 20th century, Delius composed some of his most popular works, including "Brigg Fair" (1907), "<a href="In%20a%20Summer%20Garden">In a Summer Garden</a>" (1908, revised 1911), "Summer Night on the River" (1911), and "<a href="On%20Hearing%20the%20First%20Cuckoo%20in%20Spring">On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring</a>" (1912), of which McVeagh comments, "These exquisite idylls, for all their composer's German descent and French domicile, spell 'England' for most listeners." In 1910, Beecham put on an opera season at the <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Royal Opera House</a> in London. Having access to the Beecham family's considerable fortune, he ignored commercial considerations and programmed several works of limited box-office appeal, including "A Village Romeo and Juliet". The reviews were polite, but "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>", having praised the orchestral aspects of the score, commented, "Mr. Delius seems to have remarkably little sense of dramatic writing for the voice". Other reviewers agreed that the score contained passages of great beauty, but was ineffective as drama.

During the First World War, Delius and Jelka moved from Grez to avoid the hostilities. They took up temporary residence in the south of England, where Delius continued to compose. In 1915, "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" published a profile of him by his admirer, the composer <a href="Peter%20Warlock">Philip Heseltine</a> (known as "Peter Warlock"), who commented:

[H]e holds no official position in the musical life of the country [i.e. Britain]; he does not teach in any of the academies, he is not even an honorary professor or doctor of music. He never gives concerts or makes propaganda for his music; he never conducts an orchestra, or plays an instrument in public (even <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a> played the tambourine!)
Heseltine depicted Delius as a composer uncompromisingly focused on his own music. "There can be no superficial view of Delius's music: either one feels it in the very depths of one's being, or not at all. This may be a part of the reason why one so seldom hears a really first-rate performance of Delius's work, save under Mr. Beecham".

One of Delius's major wartime works was his "<a href="Requiem%20%28Delius%29">Requiem</a>", dedicated "to the memory of all young Artists fallen in the war". The work owes nothing to the traditional Christian liturgy, eschewing notions of an afterlife and celebrating instead a pantheistic renewal of Nature. When <a href="Albert%20Coates%20%28musician%29">Albert Coates</a> presented the work in London in 1922, its atheism offended some believers. This attitude persisted long after Delius's death, as the "Requiem" did not receive another performance in the UK until 1965, and by 1980 had still had only seven performances world-wide. In Germany, the regular presentation of Delius's works ceased at the outbreak of the war, and never resumed. Nevertheless, his standing with some continental musicians was unaffected; Beecham records that <a href="B%C3%A9la%20Bart%C3%B3k">Bartók</a> and <a href="Zolt%C3%A1n%20Kod%C3%A1ly">Kodály</a> were admirers of Delius, and the former grew into the habit of sending his compositions to Delius for comment and tried to interest him in both Hungarian and Romanian popular music.

By the end of the war, Delius and Jelka had returned to Grez. He had begun to show symptoms of syphilis that he had probably contracted in the 1880s. He took treatment at clinics across Europe, but by 1922 he was walking with two sticks, and by 1928 he was paralysed and blind. There was no return to the prosperity of pre-war years: Delius's medical treatment was an additional expense, his blindness prevented him from composing, and his royalties were curtailed by the lack of continental performances of his music. Beecham gave discreet financial help, and the composer and musical benefactor <a href="H.%20Balfour%20Gardiner">H. Balfour Gardiner</a> bought the house at Grez and allowed Delius and Jelka to live there rent-free.

Beecham was temporarily absent from the concert hall and opera house between 1920 and 1923, but Coates gave the first performance of "<a href="A%20Song%20of%20the%20High%20Hills">A Song of the High Hills</a>" in 1920, and Henry Wood and <a href="Hamilton%20Harty">Hamilton Harty</a> programmed Delius's music with the <a href="Queen%27s%20Hall">Queen's Hall</a> and <a href="The%20Hall%C3%A9">Hallé</a> Orchestras. Wood gave the British première of the Double Concerto for violin and cello in 1920, and of "A Song Before Sunrise" and the "Dance Rhapsody No. 2" in 1923. Delius had a financial and artistic success with his incidental music for <a href="James%20Elroy%20Flecker">James Elroy Flecker</a>'s play "Hassan" (1923), with 281 performances at <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">His Majesty's Theatre</a>. With Beecham's return the composer became, in Hadley's words, "what his most fervent admirers had never envisaged—a genuine popular success." Hadley cites, in particular, the six-day Delius festival at the Queen's Hall in 1929 under Beecham's general direction, in the presence of the composer in his bath-chair. "[T]he cream of his orchestral output with and without soli and chorus was included", and the hall was filled. Beecham was assisted in the organisation of the festival by Philip Heseltine, who wrote the detailed programme notes for three of the six concerts. The festival included chamber music and songs, an excerpt from "A Village Romeo and Juliet", the Piano and Violin Concertos, and premières of "Cynara" and "A Late Lark", concluding with "A Mass of Life".
The "<a href="The%20Guardian">Manchester Guardian</a>" music critic, <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a>, met Delius during the festival. He describes the wreck of the composer's physique, yet "there was nothing pitiable about him ... his face was strong and disdainful, every line graven on it by intrepid living". Delius, Cardus says, spoke with a noticeable Yorkshire accent as he dismissed most English music as paper music that should never be heard, written by people "afraid of their feelin's".

A young English admirer, <a href="Eric%20Fenby">Eric Fenby</a>, learning that Delius was trying to compose by dictating to Jelka, volunteered his services as an unpaid amanuensis. For five years, from 1928, he worked with Delius, taking down his new compositions from dictation, and helping him revise earlier works. Together they produced "Cynara" (a setting of words by <a href="Ernest%20Dowson">Ernest Dowson</a>), "A Late Lark" (a setting of <a href="William%20Ernest%20Henley">W. E. Henley</a>), "<a href="A%20Song%20of%20Summer">A Song of Summer</a>", a third violin sonata, the "Irmelin" prelude, and "Idyll" (1932), which reused music from Delius's short opera "Margot la rouge", composed thirty years earlier. McVeagh rates their greatest joint production as "The Songs of Farewell", settings of Whitman poems for chorus and orchestra, which were dedicated to Jelka. Other works produced in this period include a "Caprice and Elegy" for cello and orchestra written for the distinguished British cellist <a href="Beatrice%20Harrison">Beatrice Harrison</a>, and a short orchestral piece, "Fantastic Dance", which Delius dedicated to Fenby. The violin sonata incorporates the first, incomprehensible, melody that Delius had attempted to dictate to Fenby before their "modus operandi" had been worked out. Fenby's initial failure to pick up the tune led Delius to the view that "[the] boy is no good ... he cannot even take down a simple melody". Fenby later wrote a book about his experiences of working with Delius. Among other details, Fenby reveals Delius's love of cricket. The pair followed the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201930">1930 Test series</a> between England and Australia with great interest, and regaled a bemused Jelka with accounts of their boyhood exploits in the game.
In 1933, the year before both composers died, Elgar, who had flown to Paris to conduct a performance of his <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Elgar%29">Violin Concerto</a>, visited Delius at Grez. Delius was not on the whole an admirer of Elgar's music, but the two men took to each other, and there followed a warm correspondence until Elgar's death in February 1934. Elgar described Delius as "a poet and a visionary".

Delius died at Grez on 10 June 1934, aged 72. He had wished to be buried in his own garden, but the French authorities forbade it. His alternative wish, despite his atheism, was to be buried "in some country churchyard in the south of England, where people could place wild flowers". At this time Jelka was too ill to make the journey across the <a href="English%20Channel">Channel</a>, and Delius was temporarily buried in the local cemetery at Grez.

By May 1935, Jelka felt she had enough strength to undertake the crossing to attend a reburial in England. She chose St Peter's Church, <a href="Limpsfield">Limpsfield</a>, <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> as the site for the grave. She sailed to England for the service, but became ill "en route", and on arrival was taken to hospital in Dover and then Kensington in London, missing the reburial on 26 May. The ceremony took place at midnight; the headline in the "Sunday Dispatch" was "Sixty People Under Flickering Lamps In A Surrey Churchyard". The vicar offered a prayer: "May the souls of the departed through the mercy of God rest in peace." Jelka died two days later, on 28 May. She was buried in the same grave as Delius.

After the 1929 London festival "The Times" music critic wrote that Delius "belongs to no school, follows no tradition and is like no other composer in the form, content or style of his music". This "extremely individual and personal idiom" was, however, the product of a long musical apprenticeship, during which the composer absorbed many influences. The earliest significant experiences in his artistic development came, Delius later asserted, from the sounds of the plantation songs carried down the river to him at Solano Grove. It was this singing, he told Fenby, that first gave him the urge to express himself in music; thus, writes Fenby, many of Delius's early works are "redolent of Negro hymnology and folk-song", a sound "not heard before in the orchestra, and seldom since". Delius's familiarity with "black" music possibly predates his American adventures; during the 1870s a popular singing group, the <a href="Fisk%20Jubilee%20Singers">Fisk Jubilee Singers</a> from <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, toured Britain and Europe, giving several well-received concerts in Bradford. When Delius wrote to Elgar in 1933 of the "beautiful four-part harmonies" of the black plantation workers, he may have been unconsciously alluding to the spirituals sung by the Fisk group.

At <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>, Delius became a fervent disciple of <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a>, whose technique of continuous music he sought to master. An ability to construct long musical paragraphs is, according to the Delius scholar <a href="Christopher%20Palmer">Christopher Palmer</a>, Delius's lasting debt to Wagner, from whom he also acquired a knowledge of chromatic harmonic technique, "an endlessly proliferating sensuousness of sound". Grieg, however, was perhaps the composer who influenced him more than any other. The Norwegian composer, like Delius, found his primary inspiration in nature and in folk-melodies, and was the stimulus for the Norwegian flavour that characterises much of Delius's early music. The music writer <a href="Anthony%20Payne">Anthony Payne</a> observes that Grieg's "airy texture and non-developing use of chromaticism showed [Delius] how to lighten the Wagnerian load". Early in his career Delius drew inspiration from Chopin, later from his own contemporaries Ravel and Richard Strauss, and from the much younger <a href="Percy%20Grainger">Percy Grainger</a>, who first brought the tune of "Brigg Fair" to Delius's notice.

According to Palmer, it is arguable that Delius gained his sense of direction as a composer from his French contemporary <a href="Claude%20Debussy">Claude Debussy</a>. Palmer identifies aesthetic similarities between the two, and points to several parallel characteristics and enthusiasms. Both were inspired early in their careers by Grieg, both admired Chopin; they are also linked in their musical depictions of the sea, and in their uses of the wordless voice. The opening of "Brigg Fair" is described by Palmer as "perhaps the most Debussian moment in Delius". Debussy, in a review of Delius's "Two Danish Songs" for soprano and orchestra given in a concert on 16 March 1901, wrote: "They are very sweet, very pale—music to soothe convalescents in well-to-do neighbourhoods". Delius admired the French composer's orchestration, but thought his works lacking in melody—the latter a comment frequently directed against Delius's own music. Fenby, however, draws attention to Delius's "flights of melodic poetic-prose", while conceding that the composer was contemptuous of public taste, of "giving the public what they wanted" in the form of pretty tunes.

From the conventional forms of his early music, over the course of his creative career Delius developed a style easily recognisable and "unlike the work of any other", according to Payne. As he gradually found his voice, Delius replaced the methods developed during his creative infancy with a more mature style in which Payne discerns "an increasing richness of chord structure, bearing with it its own subtle means of contrast and development". <a href="Hubert%20J.%20Foss">Hubert Foss</a>, the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Press">Oxford University Press</a>'s musical editor during the 1920s and 1930s, writes that rather than creating his music from the known possibilities of instruments, Delius "thought the sounds first" and then sought the means for producing these particular sounds. Delius's full stylistic maturity dates from around 1907, when he began to write the series of works on which his main reputation rests. In the more mature works Foss observes Delius's increasing rejection of conventional forms such as <a href="sonata">sonata</a> or concerto; Delius's music, he comments, is "certainly not architectural; nearer to painting, especially to the "<a href="Pointillism">pointilliste</a>" style of design". The painting analogy is echoed by Cardus.

Delius's first orchestral compositions were, in <a href="Christopher%20Palmer">Christopher Palmer</a>'s words, the work of "an insipid if charming water-colourist". The "<a href="Florida%20Suite">Florida Suite</a>" (1887, revised 1889) is "an expertly crafted synthesis of Grieg and Negroid Americana", while Delius's first opera "Irmelin" (1890–92) lacks any identifiably Delian passages. Its harmony and modulation are conventional, and the work bears the clear fingerprints of Wagner and Grieg. Payne asserts that none of the works prior to 1895 are of lasting interest. The first noticeable stylistic advance is evident in "<a href="Koanga">Koanga</a>" (1895–97), with richer chords and faster harmonic rhythms; here we find Delius "feeling his way towards the vein that he was soon to tap so surely". In "Paris" (1899), the orchestration owes a debt to <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>; its passages of quiet beauty, says Payne, nevertheless lack the deep personal involvement of the later works. "Paris", the final work of Delius's apprentice years, is described by Foss as "one of the most complete, if not the greatest, of Delius's musical paintings".

In each of the major works written in the years after "Paris", Delius combined orchestral and vocal forces. The first of these works was "<a href="A%20Village%20Romeo%20and%20Juliet">A Village Romeo and Juliet</a>", a music drama which departs from the normal operatic structure of acts and scenes and tells its story of tragic love in a series of tableaux. Musically it shows a considerable advance in style from the early operas of the apprentice years. The entr'acte known as "The Walk to the Paradise Garden" is described by Heseltine as showing "all the tragic beauty of mortality ... concentrated and poured forth in music of overwhelming, almost intolerable poignancy". In this work Delius begins to achieve the texture of sound that characterised all his later compositions. Delius's music is often assumed to lack melody and form. Cardus argues that melody, while not a primary factor, is there abundantly, "floating and weaving itself into the texture of shifting harmony" – a characteristic which Cardus believes is shared only by Debussy.

Delius's next work, "Appalachia", introduces a further feature that recurred in later pieces—the use of the voice instrumentally in wordless singing, in this case depicting the distant plantation songs that had inspired Delius at Solano Grove. Although Payne argues that "Appalachia" shows only a limited advance in technique, Fenby identifies one orchestral passage as the first expression of Delius's idea of "the transitoriness of all mortal things mirrored in nature". Hereafter, whole works rather than brief passages would be informed by this idea. The transitional phase of the composer's career concludes with three further vocal pieces: "<a href="Sea%20Drift%20%28Delius%29">Sea Drift</a>" (1903), "<a href="A%20Mass%20of%20Life">A Mass of Life</a>" (1904–05), and "<a href="Songs%20of%20Sunset">Songs of Sunset</a>" (1906–07). Payne salutes each of these as masterpieces, in which the Delian style struggles to emerge in its full ripeness. Fenby describes "A Mass of Life" as standing outside the general progression of Delius's work, "a vast parenthesis", unlike anything else he wrote, but nevertheless an essential ingredient in his development.

"Brigg Fair" (1907) announced the composer's full stylistic maturity, the first of the pieces for small orchestra that confirm Delius's status as a musical poet, with the influences of Wagner and Grieg almost entirely absent. The work was followed in the next few years by "<a href="In%20a%20Summer%20Garden">In a Summer Garden</a>" (1908), "Life's Dance" (1911), "Summer Night on the River" (1911) and "<a href="On%20Hearing%20the%20First%20Cuckoo%20in%20Spring">On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring</a>" (1912). The critic R.W.S. Mendl described this sequence as "exquisite nature studies", with a unity and shape lacking in the earlier formal tone poems. These works became part of the standard English concert repertory, and helped to establish the character of Delius's music in the English concert-goer's mind, although according to <a href="Ernest%20Newman">Ernest Newman</a>, the concentration on these works to the neglect of his wider output may have done Delius as much harm as good. The typical mature Delian orchestral sound is apparent in these works, through the division of the strings into ten or more sections, punctuated by woodwind comments and decorations. In the "North Country Sketches" of 1913–14, Delius divides the strings into 12 parts, and harps, horns, clarinets and bassoons evoke a lifeless winter scene. In Payne's view, the "Sketches" are the high water mark of Delius's compositional skill, although Fenby awards the accolade to the later "<a href="Eventyr%20%28Once%20Upon%20a%20Time%29">Eventyr (Once Upon a Time)</a>" (1917).

During this period Delius did not confine himself to purely orchestral works; he produced his final opera, "<a href="Fennimore%20and%20Gerda">Fennimore and Gerda</a>" (1908–10), like "A Village Romeo and Juliet" written in tableau form, but in his mature style. His choral works of the period, notably "An Arabesque" (1911) and "<a href="A%20Song%20of%20the%20High%20Hills">A Song of the High Hills</a>" (1911) are among the most radical of Delius's writings in their juxtapositions of unrelated chords. The latter work, entirely wordless, contains some of the most difficult choral music in existence, according to Heseltine. After 1915, Delius turned his attention to traditional sonata, chamber and concerto forms, which he had largely left alone since his apprentice days. Of these pieces Payne highlights two: the Violin Concerto (1916), as an example of how, writing in unfamiliar genres, Delius remained stylistically true to himself; and the Cello Sonata of 1917, which, lacking the familiarity of an orchestral palate, becomes a melodic triumph. Cardus's verdict, however, is that Delius's chamber and concerto works are largely failures. After 1917, according to Payne, there was a general deterioration in the quantity and quality of Delius's output as illness took hold, although Payne exempts the incidental music to "Hassan" (1920–23) from condemnation, believing it to contain some of Delius's best work.

The four-year association with Fenby from 1929 produced two major works, and several smaller pieces often drawn from unpublished music from Delius's early career. The first of the major works was the orchestral "<a href="A%20Song%20of%20Summer">A Song of Summer</a>", based on sketches that Delius had previously collected under the title of "A Poem of Life and Love". In dictating the new beginning of this work, Delius asked Fenby to "imagine that we are sitting on the cliffs in the heather, looking out over the sea". This does not, says Fenby, indicate that the dictation process was calm and leisurely; the mood was usually frenzied and nerve-wracking. The other major work, a setting of <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a> poems with the title "Songs of Farewell", was an even more alarming prospect to Fenby: "the complexity of thinking in so many strands, often all at once; the problems of orchestral and vocal balance; the wider area of possible misunderstandings ..." combined to leave Delius and his helper exhausted after each session of work—yet both these works were ready for performance in 1932. Of the music in this final choral work, Beecham wrote of its "hard, masculine vigour, reminiscent in mood and fibre of some of the great choral passages in "<a href="A%20Mass%20of%20Life">A Mass of Life</a>"". Payne describes the work as "bracing and exultant, with in places an almost <a href="Gustav%20Holst">Holstian</a> clarity".

Recognition came late to Delius; before 1899, when he was already 37, his works were largely unpublished and unknown to the public. When the symphonic poem "Paa Vidderne" was performed at <a href="Monte%20Carlo">Monte Carlo</a> on 25 February 1894 in a programme of works from British composers, "<a href="The%20Musical%20Times">The Musical Times</a>" listed the composers as "... <a href="Michael%20William%20Balfe">Balfe</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Mackenzie%20%28composer%29">Mackenzie</a>, Oakeley, <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Sullivan</a> ... and one Delius, whoever he may be". The work was well received in Monte Carlo, and brought the composer a congratulatory letter from <a href="Alice%20Heine">Princess Alice</a> of <a href="Monaco">Monaco</a>, but this did not lead to demands for further performances of this or other Delius works. Some of his individual songs (he wrote more than 60) were occasionally included in vocal recitals; referring to "the strange songs of Fritz Delius", "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" critic expressed regret "that the powers the composer undoubtedly possesses should not be turned to better account or undergo proper development at the hands of some musician competent to train them".

Of the May 1899 concert at <a href="St.%20James%27s%20Hall">St. James's Hall</a>, London, "The Musical Times" reviewer remarked on the rawness of some of the music, but praised the "boldness of conception and virile strength that command and hold attention." Beecham, however, records that despite this "fair show of acclaim", for all the impetus it gave to future performances of Delius's work the event might never have happened; none of the music was heard again in England for many years. Delius was much better received in Germany, where a series of successful performances of his works led to what Beecham describes as a Delius vogue there, "second only to that of Richard Strauss".

In England, a performance of the <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20%28Delius%29">Piano Concerto</a> on 22 October 1907 at the Queen's Hall was praised for the brilliance of the soloist, <a href="Theodor%20Sz%C3%A1nt%C3%B3">Theodor Szántó</a>, and for the power of the music itself. From that point onwards the music of Delius became increasingly familiar to both British and European audiences, as performances of his works proliferated. Beecham's presentation of "A Mass of Life" at the Queen's Hall in June 1909 did not inspire Hans Haym, who had come from Elberfeld for the concert, though Beecham says that many professional and amateur musicians thought it "the most impressive and original achievement of its genre written in the last fifty years" Some reviewers continued to doubt the popular appeal of Delius's music, while others were more specifically hostile.

From 1910, Delius's works began to be heard in America: "Brigg Fair" and "In a Summer Garden" were performed in 1910–11 by the <a href="New%20York%20Philharmonic%20Orchestra">New York Philharmonic Orchestra</a> under <a href="Walter%20Damrosch">Walter Damrosch</a>. In November 1915 Grainger gave the first American performance of the Piano Concerto, again with the New York Philharmonic. The "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" critic described the work as uneven; richly harmonious, but combining colour and beauty with effects "of an almost crass unskillfulness and ugliness".

For the rest of his lifetime Delius's more popular pieces were performed in England and abroad, often under the sponsorship of Beecham, who was primarily responsible for the Delius festival in October–November 1929. In a retrospective comment on the festival "The Times" critic wrote of full houses and an apparent enthusiasm for "music which hitherto has enjoyed no exceptional vogue", but wondered whether this new acceptance was based on a solid foundation. After Delius's death Beecham continued to promote his works; a second festival was held in 1946, and a third (after Beecham's death) at Bradford in 1962, to celebrate the centenary of Delius's birth. These occasions were in the face of a general indifference to the music; writing in the centenary year, the musicologist <a href="Deryck%20Cooke">Deryck Cooke</a> opined that at that time, "to declare oneself a confirmed Delian is hardly less self-defamatory than to admit to being an addict of cocaine and marihuana".

Beecham had died in 1961, and Fenby writes that it "seemed to many then that nothing could save Delius's music from extinction", such was the conductor's unique mastery over the music. However, other conductors have continued to advocate Delius, and since the centenary year, the Delius Society has pursued the aim of "develop[ing] a greater knowledge of the life and works of Delius". The music has never become fashionable, a fact often acknowledged by promoters and critics. To suggestions that Delius's music is an "acquired taste", Fenby answers: "The music of Delius is not an acquired taste. One either likes it the moment one first hears it, or the sound of it is once and for ever distasteful to one. It is an art which will never enjoy an appeal to the many, but one which will always be loved, and dearly loved, by the few." Writing in 2004 on the 70th anniversary of Delius's death, the "Guardian" journalist Martin Kettle recalls Cardus arguing in 1934 that Delius as a composer was unique, both in his technique and in his emotionalism. Although he eschewed classical formalism, it was wrong, Cardus believed, to regard Delius merely as "a tone-painter, an impressionist or a maker of programme music". His music's abiding feature is, Cardus wrote, that it "recollects emotion in tranquillity ... Delius is always reminding us that beauty is born by contemplation after the event".

Just before his death, Delius prepared a <a href="Codicil%20%28will%29">codicil</a> to his <a href="Will%20and%20testament">will</a> whereby the royalties on future performances of his music would be used to support an annual concert of works by young composers. Delius died before this provision could be legally effected; Fenby says that Beecham then persuaded Jelka in her own will to abandon the concerts idea and apply the royalties towards the editing and recording of Delius's main works. After Jelka's death in 1935 the Delius Trust was established, to supervise this task. As stipulated in Jelka's will, the Trust operated largely under Beecham's direction. After Beecham's death in 1961 advisers were appointed to assist the trustees, and in 1979 the administration of the Trust was taken over by the <a href="Musicians%27%20Benevolent%20Fund">Musicians' Benevolent Fund</a>. Over the years the Trust's objectives have been extended so that it can promote the music of other composers who were Delius's contemporaries. The Trust is a co-sponsor of the Royal Philharmonic Society's Composition Prize for young composers.

<a href="Herbert%20Stothart">Herbert Stothart</a> made arrangements of Delius's music, particularly "Appalachia", for the 1946 film "<a href="The%20Yearling%20%28film%29">The Yearling</a>".

In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who had gone to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is independent from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general objectives are the furtherance of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the <a href="Grand%20Theatre%2C%20Leeds">Grand Theatre, Leeds</a>, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of "A Village Romeo and Juliet" by <a href="Opera%20North">Opera North</a>, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.

Public interest in Delius's life was stimulated in the UK in 1968, with the showing of the <a href="Ken%20Russell">Ken Russell</a> film "<a href="Song%20of%20Summer">Song of Summer</a>" on BBC Television. The film depicted the years of the Delius–Fenby collaboration; Fenby co-scripted with Russell. <a href="Max%20Adrian">Max Adrian</a> played Delius, with <a href="Christopher%20Gable">Christopher Gable</a> as Fenby and <a href="Maureen%20Pryor">Maureen Pryor</a> as Jelka.

In America, a small memorial to Delius stands in Solano Grove. The Delius Association of Florida has for many years organised an annual festival at Jacksonville, to mark the composer's birthday. At Jacksonville University, the Music Faculty awards an annual Delius Composition Prize. In February 2012 Delius was one of ten prominent Britons honoured by the <a href="Royal%20Mail">Royal Mail</a> in the "Britons of Distinction" stamps set.

Beecham stresses Delius's role as an innovator: "The best of Delius is undoubtedly to be found in those works where he disregarded classical traditions and created his own forms". Fenby echoes this: "the people who really count are those who discover new ways of making our lives more beautiful. Frederick Delius was such a man". Palmer writes that Delius's true legacy is the ability of his music to inspire the creative urge in its listeners and to enhance their awareness of the wonders of life. Palmer concludes by invoking <a href="George%20Eliot">George Eliot</a>'s poem "The Choir Invisible": "Frederick Delius ... belongs to the company of those true artists for whose life and work the world is a better place to live in, and of whom surely is composed, in a literal sense, 'the choir invisible/Whose music is the gladness of the world'".

The first recordings of Delius's works, in 1927, were conducted by Beecham for the <a href="Columbia%20Graphophone%20Company">Columbia label</a>: the "Walk to the Paradise Garden" interlude from "A Village Romeo and Juliet", and "On Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring", performed by the orchestra of the Royal Philharmonic Society. These began a long series of Delius recordings under Beecham that continued for the rest of the conductor's life. He was not alone, however; <a href="Geoffrey%20Toye">Geoffrey Toye</a> in 1929–30 recorded "Brigg Fair", "In a Summer Garden", "Summer Night on the River" and the "Walk to the Paradise Garden". Fenby recounts that on his first day in Grez, Jelka played Beecham's "First Cuckoo" recording. In May 1934, when Delius was close to death, Fenby played him Toye's "In a Summer Garden", the last music, Fenby says, that Delius ever heard. By the end of the 1930s Beecham had issued versions for Columbia of most of the main orchestral and choral works, together with several songs in which he accompanied the soprano <a href="Dora%20Labbette">Dora Labbette</a> on the piano. By 1936 Columbia and <a href="HMV">HMV</a> had issued recordings of Violin Sonatas 1 and 2, the "Elegy and Caprice", and of some of the shorter works.

Full recordings of the operas were not available until after the Second World War. Once again Beecham, now with the HMV label, led the way, with "A Village Romeo and Juliet" in 1948, performed by the new Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus. Later versions of this work include those of <a href="Meredith%20Davies">Meredith Davies</a> for <a href="EMI">EMI</a> in 1971, <a href="Charles%20Mackerras">Charles Mackerras</a> for Argo in 1989, and a German-language version conducted by <a href="Klauspeter%20Seibel">Klauspeter Seibel</a> in 1995. Beecham's former protégé <a href="Norman%20Del%20Mar">Norman Del Mar</a> recorded a complete "Irmelin" for BBC Digital in 1985. In 1997 EMI reissued Meredith Davies's 1976 recording of "Fennimore and Gerda", which <a href="Richard%20Hickox">Richard Hickox</a> conducted in German the same year for <a href="Chandos%20Records">Chandos</a>. Recordings of all the major works, and of many of the individual songs, have been issued at regular intervals since the Second World War. Many of these recordings have been issued in conjunction with the Delius Society, which has prepared various discographies of Delius's recorded music.

Rongorongo

Rongorongo (; <a href="Rapa%20Nui%20language">Rapa Nui</a>: ) is a system of <a href="glyph">glyph</a>s discovered in the 19th century on <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a> that appears to be <a href="writing%20system">writing</a> or <a href="proto-writing">proto-writing</a>. Numerous attempts at <a href="Decipherment%20of%20rongorongo">decipherment</a> have been made, none successfully. Although some calendrical and what might prove to be genealogical information has been identified, none of these glyphs can actually be read. If rongorongo does prove to be writing and proves to be an independent invention, it would be one of very few independent <a href="Invention%20of%20writing">inventions of writing</a> in human history.

Two dozen wooden objects bearing rongorongo inscriptions, some heavily weathered, burned, or otherwise damaged, were collected in the late 19th century and are now scattered in museums and private collections. None remain on Easter Island. The objects are mostly tablets shaped from irregular pieces of wood, sometimes driftwood, but include a chieftain's staff, a <a href="Tangata%20manu">bird-man</a> statuette, and two "<a href="reimiro">reimiro</a>" ornaments. There are also a few <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s which may include short rongorongo inscriptions. Oral history suggests that only a small elite was ever literate and that the tablets were sacred.

Authentic rongorongo texts are written in alternating directions, a system called reverse <a href="boustrophedon">boustrophedon</a>. In a third of the tablets, the lines of text are inscribed in shallow <a href="fluting%20%28architecture%29">fluting</a> carved into the wood. The glyphs themselves are outlines of human, animal, plant, <a href="cultural%20artifact">artifact</a> and geometric forms. Many of the human and animal figures, such as glyphs and have characteristic protuberances on each side of the head, possibly representing eyes.

Individual texts are conventionally known by a single uppercase letter and a name, such as Tablet C, the "Mamari" Tablet. The somewhat variable names may be descriptive or indicate where the object is kept, as in the Oar, the Snuffbox, the Small Santiago Tablet, and the Santiago Staff.

"Rongorongo" is the modern name for the inscriptions. In the <a href="Rapa%20Nui%20language">Rapa Nui language</a> it means "to recite, to declaim, to chant out".

The original name—or perhaps description—of the script is said to have been "kohau motu mo rongorongo", "lines incised for chanting out", shortened to "kohau rongorongo" or "lines [for] chanting out". There are also said to have been more specific names for the texts based on their topic. For example, the "kohau ta‘u" ("lines of years") were annals, the "kohau îka" ("lines of fishes") were lists of persons killed in war "(îka" "fish" was homophonous with or used figuratively for "war casualty"), and the "kohau ranga" "lines of fugitives" were lists of war refugees.

Some authors have understood the "ta‘u" in "kohau ta‘u" to refer to a separate form of writing distinct from "rongorongo." <a href="Thomas%20Barthel">Barthel</a> recorded that, "The Islanders had another writing (the so-called 'ta‘u script') which recorded their annals and other secular matters, but this has disappeared." However, Fischer writes that "the "ta‘u" was originally a type of "rongorongo" inscription. In the 1880s, a group of elders invented a derivative 'script' [also] called "ta‘u" with which to decorate carvings in order to increase their trading value. It is a primitive imitation of "rongorongo."" An alleged third script, the "mama" or "va‘eva‘e" described in some mid-twentieth-century publications, was "an early twentieth-century geometric [decorative] invention".

The forms of the glyphs are standardized contours of living organisms and geometric designs about one centimeter high. The wooden tablets are irregular in shape and, in many instances, <a href="fluting%20%28architecture%29">fluted</a> (tablets B, E, G, H, O, Q, and possibly T), with the glyphs carved in shallow channels running the length of the tablets, as can be seen in the image of tablet G at right. It is thought that irregular and often blemished pieces of wood were used in their entirety rather than squared off due to the scarcity of wood on the island.

Except for a few possible glyphs cut in stone (see <a href="%23Petroglyphs">petroglyphs</a>), all surviving texts are inscribed in wood. According to tradition, the tablets were made of <a href="toromiro">toromiro</a> wood. However, Orliac (2005) examined seven objects (tablets B, C, G, H, K, Q, and "reimiro" L) with <a href="Comparison%20microscope">stereo optical</a> and <a href="scanning%20electron%20microscope">scanning electron microscope</a>s and determined that all were instead made from <a href="Thespesia%20populnea">Pacific rosewood "(Thespesia populnea)"</a>; the same identification had been made for tablet M in 1934. This 15-meter tree, known as "Pacific rosewood" for its color and called "mako‘i" in Rapanui, is used for sacred groves and carvings throughout eastern Polynesia and was evidently brought to Easter Island by the first settlers. However, not all the wood was native: Orliac (2007) established that tablets N, P, and S were made of <a href="Podocarpus%20latifolius">South African Yellowwood "(Podocarpus latifolius)"</a> and therefore that the wood had arrived with Western contact. Fischer describes P as "a damaged and reshapen European or American oar", as are A (which is <a href="Fraxinus%20excelsior">European ash, "Fraxinus excelsior"</a>) and V; notes that wood from the wreck of a Western boat was said to have been used for many tablets; and that both P and S had been recycled as planking for a Rapanui driftwood canoe, suggesting that by that time the tablets had little value to the islanders as texts. Several texts, including O, are carved on gnarled <a href="driftwood">driftwood</a>. The fact that the islanders were reduced to inscribing driftwood, and were regardless extremely economical in their use of wood, may have had consequences for the structure of the script, such as the abundance of <a href="Typographic%20ligature">ligatures</a> and potentially a <a href="Telegraphese">telegraphic style</a> of writing that would complicate textual analysis.

Oral tradition holds that, because of the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on <a href="banana%20leaf">banana leaves</a>. German <a href="ethnologist">ethnologist</a> <a href="Thomas%20Barthel">Thomas Barthel</a> believed that carving on wood was a secondary development in the evolution of the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the texts of the wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.

Barthel speculated that the banana leaf might even have served as a prototype for the tablets, with the fluted surface of the tablets an emulation of the veined structure of a leaf:

Rongorongo glyphs were written in <a href="boustrophedon">reverse boustrophedon</a>, left to right and bottom to top. That is, the reader begins at the bottom left-hand corner of a tablet, reads a line from left to right, then rotates the tablet 180 degrees to continue on the next line. When reading one line, the lines above and below it would appear upside down, as can be seen in the image at left.

However, the writing continues onto the second side of a tablet at the point where it finishes off the first, so if the first side has an odd number of lines, as is the case with tablets K, N, P, and Q, the second will start at the "upper" left-hand corner, and the direction of writing shifts to top to bottom.

Larger tablets and staves may have been read without turning, if the reader were able to read upside-down.

According to oral tradition, scribes used <a href="Obsidian%23historical%20use">obsidian flakes</a> or small <a href="shark%20tooth%23Tool%20use%20by%20humans">shark teeth</a>, presumably the <a href="hilt">hafted</a> tools still used to carve wood in Polynesia, to flute and polish the tablets and then to incise the glyphs. The glyphs are most commonly composed of deep smooth cuts, though superficial hair-line cuts are also found. In the closeup image at right, a glyph is composed of two parts connected by a hair-line cut; this is a typical convention for this shape. Several researchers, including Barthel, believe that these superficial cuts were made by obsidian, and that the texts were carved in a two-stage process, first sketched with obsidian and then deepened and finished with a worn shark tooth. The remaining hair-line cuts were then either errors, design conventions (as at right), or decorative embellishments. Vertical strings of chevrons or lozenges, for example, are typically connected with hair-line cuts, as can be seen repeatedly in the closeup of one end of tablet B below. However, Barthel was told that the last literate Rapanui king, <a href="King%20Nga%27ara">Nga‘ara</a>, sketched out the glyphs in soot applied with a fish bone and then engraved them with a shark tooth.

<a href="Rongorongo%20text%20N">Tablet N</a>, on the other hand, shows no sign of shark teeth. Haberlandt noticed that the glyphs of this text appear to have been incised with a sharpened bone, as evidenced by the shallowness and width of the grooves. N also "displays secondary working with obsidian flakes to elaborate details within the finished contour lines. No other "rongo-rongo" inscription reveals such graphic extravagance".

Other tablets appear to have been cut with a steel blade, often rather crudely. Although steel knives were available after the arrival of the Spanish, this does cast suspicion on the authenticity of these tablets.

The glyphs are stylized human, animal, vegetable and geometric shapes, and often form <a href="Typographical%20ligature">compounds</a>. Nearly all those with heads are oriented head up and are either seen face on or in profile to the right, in the direction of writing. It is not known what significance turning a glyph head-down or to the left may have had. Heads often have characteristic projections on the sides which may be eyes (as on the <a href="sea%20turtle">sea turtle</a> glyph below, and more clearly on sea-turtle petroglyphs) but which often resemble ears (as on the anthropomorphic petroglyph in the next section). Birds are common; many resemble the <a href="frigatebird">frigatebird</a> (see image directly below) which was associated with the supreme god <a href="Makemake%20%28mythology%29">Makemake</a>. Other glyphs look like fish or arthropods. A few are similar to <a href="Petroglyph">petroglyphs</a> found throughout the island.

Oral tradition holds that either <a href="Hotu%20Matu%27a">Hotu Matu‘a</a> or <a href="Kings%20of%20Easter%20Island%23Tu%E2%80%98u%20ko%20Iho">Tu‘u ko Iho</a>, the legendary founder(s) of Rapa Nui, brought 67 tablets from their homeland. The same founder is also credited with bringing indigenous plants such as the <a href="toromiro">toromiro</a>. However, there is no homeland likely to have had a tradition of writing in Polynesia or even in South America. Thus rongorongo appears to have been an internal development. Given that few if any of the Rapanui people remaining on the island in the 1870s could read the glyphs, it is likely that only a small minority were ever literate. Indeed, early visitors were told that literacy was a privilege of the ruling families and priests who were all kidnapped in the <a href="Blackbirding">Peruvian slaving raids</a> or died soon afterwards in the resulting epidemics.

Little direct dating has been done. The start of forest-clearing for agriculture on Easter Island, and thus presumably colonization, has been dated to "circa" 1200, implying a date for the invention of rongorongo no earlier than the 13th century. <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20Q">Tablet Q</a> (Small Saint Petersburg) is the sole item that has been <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">carbon dated</a>, but the results only constrain the date to sometime after 1680. Glyph 67 () is thought to represent the extinct <a href="Paschalococos">Easter Island palm</a>, which disappeared from the island's <a href="Palynology">pollen record</a> "circa" 1650, suggesting that the script itself is at least that old.

Texts A, P, and V can be dated to the 18th or 19th century by virtue of being inscribed on European oars. Orliac (2005) argued that the wood for <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20C">tablet C</a> "(Mamari)" was cut from the trunk of a tree some tall, and Easter Island has long been deforested of trees that size. Analysis of charcoal indicates that the forest disappeared in the first half of the 17th century. <a href="Jakob%20Roggeveen">Roggeveen</a>, who discovered Easter Island in 1722, described the island as "destitute of large trees" and in 1770 <a href="Felipe%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20de%20Ahedo">González de Ahedo</a> wrote, "Not a single tree is to be found capable of furnishing a plank so much as six inches [15 cm] in width." Forster, with <a href="James%20Cook">Cook</a>'s expedition of 1774, reported that "there was not a tree upon the island which exceeded the height of 10 feet [3 m]."

All of these methods date the wood, not the inscriptions themselves. Pacific rosewood is not durable, and is unlikely to survive long in Easter Island's climate.

In 1770 the Spanish annexed Easter Island under Captain <a href="Felipe%20Gonz%C3%A1lez%20de%20Ahedo">González de Ahedo</a>. A signing ceremony was held in which a treaty of annexation was signed by an undisclosed number of chiefs "by marking upon it certain characters in their own form of script." (Reproduction at right.)

Several scholars have suggested that rongorongo may have been an invention inspired by this visit and the signing of the treaty of annexation. As circumstantial evidence, they note that no explorer reported the script prior to <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Eyraud">Eugène Eyraud</a> in 1864, and are of the opinion that the marks with which the chiefs signed the Spanish treaty do not resemble rongorongo. The hypothesis of these researchers is not that rongorongo was itself a copy of the Latin alphabet, or of any other form of writing, but that the "concept" of writing had been conveyed in a process anthropologists term <a href="trans-cultural%20diffusion">trans-cultural diffusion</a>, which then inspired the islanders to invent their own system of writing. If this is the case, then rongorongo emerged, flourished, fell into oblivion, and was all but forgotten within a span of less than a hundred years.

However, known cases of the diffusion of writing, such as <a href="Sequoyah">Sequoyah</a>'s invention of the <a href="Cherokee%20syllabary">Cherokee syllabary</a> after seeing the power of English-language newspapers, or <a href="Uyaquk">Uyaquk</a>'s invention of the <a href="Yugtun%20script">Yugtun script</a> inspired by readings from Christian scripture, involved greater contact than the signing of a single treaty. The glyphs could be crudely written rongorongo, as might be expected for Rapa Nui representatives writing with the novel instrument of pen on paper. The fact that the script was not otherwise observed by early explorers, who spent little time on the island, may reflect that it was <a href="Tapu%20%28Polynesian%20culture%29">taboo</a>; such taboos may have lost power along with the "tangata rongorongo" (scribes) by the time Rapanui society collapsed following European slaving raids and the resulting epidemics, so that the tablets had become more widely distributed by Eyraud's day. Orliac points out that Tablet C would appear to predate the Spanish visit by at least a century.

Easter Island has the richest assortment of <a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s in Polynesia. Nearly every suitable surface has been carved, including the stone walls of some houses and a few of the famous "<a href="moai">mo‘ai</a>" statues and their fallen <a href="pukao">topknots</a>. Around one thousand sites with over four thousand glyphs have been catalogued, some in <a href="bas-relief">bas-</a> or <a href="sunken-relief">sunken-relief</a>, and some painted red and white. Designs include a concentration of <a href="Chimera%20%28mythology%29">chimeric</a> bird-man figures at <a href="Orongo">Orongo</a>, a ceremonial center of the "<a href="tangata%20manu">tangata manu</a>" ("bird-man") cult; faces of the creation deity <a href="Makemake%20%28deity%29">Makemake</a>; marine animals like turtles, tuna, swordfish, sharks, whales, dolphins, crabs, and octopi (some with human faces); roosters; canoes, and over five hundred "komari" (vulvas). Petroglyphs are often accompanied by carved divots ("cupules") in the rock. Changing traditions are preserved in bas-relief birdmen, which were carved over simpler outline forms and in turn carved over with "komari." Although the petroglyphs cannot be directly dated, some are partially obscured by pre-colonial stone buildings, suggesting they are relatively old.

Several of the anthropomorphic and animal-form petroglyphs have parallels in rongorongo, for instance a double-headed frigatebird (glyph 680) on a fallen "mo‘ai" topknot, a figure which also appears on a dozen tablets. McLaughlin (2004) illustrates the most prominent correspondences with the petroglyph corpus of Lee (1992). However, these are mostly isolated glyphs; few text-like sequences or ligatures have been found among the petroglyphs. This has led to the suggestion that rongorongo must be a recent creation, perhaps inspired by petroglyph designs or retaining individual petroglyphs as <a href="logogram">logogram</a>s (Macri 1995), but not old enough to have been incorporated into the petroglyphic tradition. The most complex candidate for petroglyphic rongorongo is what appears to be a short sequence of glyphs, one of which is a ligature, carved on the wall of a cave. However, the sequence does not appear to have been carved in a single hand (see image at right), and the cave is located near the house that produced the <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20Z">"Poike" tablet</a>, a crude imitation of rongorongo, so the "Ana o Keke" petroglyphs may not be authentic.

<a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Eyraud">Eugène Eyraud</a>, a lay friar of the <a href="Congregation%20of%20the%20Sacred%20Hearts%20of%20Jesus%20and%20Mary">Congrégation de Picpus</a>, landed on Easter Island on January 2, 1864, on the 24th day of his departure from <a href="Valpara%C3%ADso">Valparaíso</a>. He was to remain on Easter Island for nine months, evangelizing its inhabitants. He wrote an account of his stay in which he reports his discovery of the tablets that year:

There is no other mention of the tablets in his report, and the discovery went unnoticed. Eyraud left Easter Island on October 11, in extremely poor health. Ordained a priest in 1865, he returned to Easter Island in 1866 where he died of tuberculosis in August 1868, aged 48.

In 1868 the Bishop of Tahiti, <a href="Florentin-%C3%89tienne%20Jaussen">Florentin-Étienne "Tepano" Jaussen</a>, received a gift from the recent Catholic converts of Easter Island. It was a long cord of human hair, a fishing line perhaps, wound around a small wooden board covered in hieroglyphic writing. Stunned at the discovery, he wrote to Father <a href="Hippolyte%20Roussel">Hippolyte Roussel</a> on Easter Island to collect all the tablets and to find natives capable of translating them. But Roussel could only recover a few, and the islanders could not agree on how to read them.

Yet Eyraud had seen hundreds of tablets only four years earlier. What happened to the missing tablets is a matter of conjecture. Eyraud had noted how little interest their owners had in them. <a href="St%C3%A9phen%20Chauvet">Stéphen Chauvet</a> reports that,

Orliac has observed that the deep black indentation, about long, on lines 5 and 6 of the recto of <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20H">tablet H</a> is a groove made by the rubbing of a fire stick, showing that tablet H had been used for fire-making. Tablets S and P had been cut into lashed planking for a canoe, which fits the story of a man named Niari who made a canoe out of abandoned tablets.

As European-introduced diseases and raids by Peruvian slavers, including a final devastating raid in 1862 and a subsequent smallpox epidemic, had reduced the Rapa Nui population to under two hundred by the 1870s, it is possible that literacy had been wiped out by the time Eyraud discovered the tablets in 1866.

Thus in 1868 Jaussen could recover only a few tablets, with three more acquired by Captain Gana of the Chilean corvette "<a href="Chilean%20corvette%20O%27Higgins%20%281866%29">O'Higgins</a>" in 1870. In the 1950s Barthel found the decayed remains of half a dozen tablets in caves, in the context of burials. However, no glyphs could be salvaged.

Of the 26 commonly accepted texts that survive, only half are in good condition and authentic beyond doubt.

British archaeologist and anthropologist <a href="Katherine%20Routledge">Katherine Routledge</a> undertook a 1914–1915 scientific expedition to Rapa Nui with her husband to catalog the art, customs, and writing of the island. She was able to interview two elderly informants, Kapiera and a leper named Tomenika, who allegedly had some knowledge of rongorongo. The sessions were not very fruitful, as the two often contradicted each other. From them Routledge concluded that rongorongo was an idiosyncratic mnemonic device that did not directly represent language, in other words, <a href="proto-writing">proto-writing</a>, and that the meanings of the glyphs were reformulated by each scribe, so that the "kohau rongorongo" could not be read by someone not trained in that specific text. The texts themselves she believed to be litanies for priest-scribes, kept apart in special houses and strictly "<a href="Tapu%20%28Polynesian%20culture%29">tapu</a>," that recorded the island's history and mythology. By the time of later ethnographic accounts, such as Métraux (1940), much of what Routledge recorded in her notes had been forgotten, and the oral history showed a strong external influence from popular published accounts.

The 26 rongorongo texts with letter codes are inscribed on wooden objects, each with between 2 and 2320 simple glyphs and components of compound glyphs, for over 15,000 in all. The objects are mostly oblong wooden tablets, with the exceptions of I, a possibly sacred chieftain's staff known as the "Santiago Staff"; J and L, inscribed on "<a href="reimiro">reimiro</a>" pectoral ornaments worn by the elite; X, inscribed on various parts of a "<a href="tangata%20manu">tangata manu</a>" ("birdman") statuette; and Y, a European <a href="Decorative%20boxes%23Snuff%20box">snuff box</a> assembled from sections cut from a rongorongo tablet. The tablets, like the pectorals, statuettes, and staves, were works of art and valued possessions, and were apparently given individual proper names in the same manner as jade ornaments in New Zealand. Two of the tablets, C and S, have a documented pre-missionary provenance, though others may be as old or older. There are in addition a few isolated glyphs or short sequences which might prove to be rongorongo.

Barthel referred to each of 24 texts he accepted as genuine with a letter of the alphabet; two texts have been added to the corpus since then. The two faces of the tablets are distinguished by suffixing r (<a href="Recto%20and%20verso">recto</a>) or v (<a href="Recto%20and%20verso">verso</a>) when the reading sequence can be ascertained, to which the line being discussed is appended. Thus Pr2 is item P (the Great Saint Petersburg Tablet), recto, second line. When the reading sequence cannot be ascertained, a and b are used for the faces. Thus Ab1 is item A "(Tahua)," side b, first line. The six sides of the Snuff Box are lettered as sides a to f. Nearly all publications follow the Barthel convention, though a popular book by Fischer uses an idiosyncratic numbering system.

Crude glyphs have been found on a few stone objects and some additional wooden items, but most of these are thought to be fakes created for the early tourism market. Several of the 26 wooden texts are suspect due to uncertain provenance (X, Y, and Z), poor quality craftsmanship (F, K, V, W, Y, and Z), or to having been carved with a steel blade (K, V, and Y), and thus, although they may prove to be genuine, should not be trusted in initial attempts at decipherment. Z resembles many early forgeries in not being boustrophedon, but it may be a <a href="palimpsest">palimpsest</a> on an authentic but now illegible text.

In addition to the petroglyphs mentioned above, there are a few other very short uncatalogued texts that may be rongorongo. Fischer reports that "many statuettes reveal "rongorongo" or "rongorongo"-like glyphs on their crown." He gives the example of a compound glyph, , on the crown of a "mo‘ai pakapaka" statuette. Many human skulls are inscribed with the single 'fish' glyph 700 , which may stand for "îka" "war casualty". There are other designs, including some tattoos recorded by early visitors, which are possibly single rongorongo glyphs, but since they are isolated and pictographic, it is difficult to know whether or not they are actually writing.

The only published reference to the glyphs which is even close to comprehensive remains Barthel (1958). Barthel assigned a three-digit numeric code to each glyph or to each group of similar-looking glyphs that he believed to be <a href="Allography">allographs</a> (variants). In the case of allography, the bare numeric code was assigned to what Barthel believed to be the basic form "(Grundtypus)," while variants were specified by alphabetic suffixes. Altogether he assigned 600 numeric codes. The hundreds place is a digit from 0 to 7, and categorizes the head, or overall form if there is no head: 0 and 1 for geometric shapes and inanimate objects; 2 for figures with "ears"; 3 and 4 for figures with open mouths (they are differentiated by their legs/tails); 5 for figures with miscellaneous heads; 6 for figures with beaks; and 7 for fish, arthropods, etc. The digits in tens and units places were allocated similarly, so that, for example, glyphs 206, 306, 406, 506, and 606 all have a downward-pointing wing or arm on the left, and a raised four-fingered hand on the right:

There is some arbitrariness to which glyphs are grouped together, and there are inconsistencies in the assignments of numerical codes and the use of affixes which make the system rather complex. However, despite its shortcomings, Barthel's is the only effective system ever proposed to categorize rongorongo glyphs.

Barthel (1971) claimed to have parsed the corpus of glyphs to 120, of which the other 480 in his inventory are allographs or <a href="Typographical%20ligature">ligatures</a>. The evidence was never published, but similar counts have been obtained by other scholars, such as Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov (2007).

For almost a century only a few of the texts were published. In 1875, the director of the <a href="Chilean%20National%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Chilean National Museum of Natural History</a> in <a href="Santiago%2C%20Chile">Santiago</a>, Rudolf Philippi, published the Santiago Staff, and Carroll (1892) published part of the Oar. Most texts remained beyond the reach of would-be decipherers until 1958, when Thomas Barthel published line drawings of almost all the known corpus in his "Grundlagen zur Entzifferung der Osterinselschrift" ("Bases for the Decipherment of the Easter Island script") which remains the fundamental reference to rongorongo. He transcribed texts A through X, over 99% of the corpus; the <a href="CEIPP">CEIPP</a> estimates that it is 97% accurate. Barthel's line drawings were not produced free-hand but copied from <a href="rubbing">rubbing</a>s, which helped ensure their faithfulness to the originals.

Fischer (1997) published new line drawings. These include lines scored with obsidian but not finished with a shark tooth, which had not been recorded by Barthel because the rubbings he used often did not show them, for example on tablet N. (However, in line Gv4 shown in the section on <a href="%23writing%20instruments">writing instruments</a> above, the light lines were recorded by both Fischer and Barthel.) There are other omissions in Barthel which Fischer corrects, such as a sequence of glyphs at the transition from line Ca6 to Ca7 which is missing from Barthel, presumably because the carving went over the side of the tablet and was missed by Barthel's rubbing. (This missing sequence is right in the middle of Barthel's calendar.) However, other discrepancies between the two records are straightforward contradictions. For instance, the initial glyph of I12 (line 12 of the Santiago Staff) in Fischer does not correspond with that of Barthel or Philippi, which agree with each other, and Barthel's rubbing (below) is incompatible with Fischer's drawing. Barthel's annotation, "Original doch 53.76!" ("original indeed 53.76!"), suggests that he specifically verified Philippi's reading:

In addition, the next glyph (glyph 20, a "spindle with three knobs") is missing its right-side "sprout" (glyph 10) in Philippi's drawing. This may be the result of an error in the inking, since there is a blank space in its place. The corpus is thus tainted with quite some uncertainty. It has never been properly checked for want of high-quality photographs.

As with most undeciphered scripts, there are many fanciful interpretations and claimed translations of rongorongo. However, apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to have to do with a <a href="lunar%20calendar">lunar</a> <a href="Rapa%20Nui%20calendar">Rapa Nui calendar</a>, none of the texts are understood. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming rongorongo is truly writing: the small number of remaining texts, the lack of context such as illustrations in which to interpret them, and the poor attestation of the Old Rapanui language, since modern <a href="Rapa%20Nui%20language">Rapanui</a> is heavily mixed with <a href="Tahitian%20language">Tahitian</a> and is therefore unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets.

The prevailing opinion is that rongorongo is not true writing but <a href="proto-writing">proto-writing</a>, or even a more limited <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> device for genealogy, choreography, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. For example, the "Atlas of Languages" states, "It was probably used as a memory aid or for decorative purposes, not for recording the Rapanui language of the islanders." If this is the case, then there is little hope of ever deciphering it. For those who believe it to be writing, there is debate as to whether rongorongo is essentially <a href="logographic">logographic</a> or <a href="syllabary">syllabic</a>, though it appears to be compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary.

The <a href="Unicode%20Consortium">Unicode Consortium</a> has tentatively allocated range 1CA80–1CDBF of the <a href="Supplementary%20Multilingual%20Plane">Supplementary Multilingual Plane</a> for encoding the Rongorongo script. An encoding proposal has been written by <a href="Michael%20Everson">Michael Everson</a>.

Kennet and Avon Canal

The Kennet and Avon Canal is a <a href="waterway">waterway</a> in southern England with an overall length of , made up of two lengths of <a href="Navigability">navigable river</a> linked by a <a href="canal">canal</a>. The name is commonly used to refer to the entire length of the navigation rather than solely to the central canal section. From <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> the waterway follows the natural course of the <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Bristol%29">River Avon</a> before the canal links it to the <a href="River%20Kennet">River Kennet</a> at <a href="Newbury%2C%20Berkshire">Newbury</a>, and from there to <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> on the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>. In all, the waterway incorporates 105 <a href="Lock%20%28water%20transport%29">locks</a>.

The two river stretches were made navigable in the early 18th century, and the canal section was constructed between 1794 and 1810. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the canal gradually fell into disuse after the opening of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a>. In the latter half of the 20th century the canal was restored in stages, largely by volunteers. After decades of dereliction and much restoration work, it was fully reopened in 1990. The Kennet and Avon Canal has been developed as a popular heritage tourism destination for boating, <a href="canoeing">canoeing</a>, fishing, walking and cycling, and is also important for <a href="wildlife%20conservation">wildlife conservation</a>.

The idea of an east-to-west waterway link across southern England was first mentioned in <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> times, between 1558 and 1603, to take advantage of the proximity of tributaries of the rivers <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Bristol%29">Avon</a> and <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a>, only apart at their closest. Later, around 1626, <a href="Henry%20Briggs%20%28mathematician%29">Henry Briggs</a> made a survey of the two rivers and noted that the land between them was level and easy to dig. He proposed a canal to connect them, but following his death in 1630 the plan was dropped. After the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a> four <a href="Bill%20%28law%29">bills</a> were presented to parliament, but all failed after opposition from gentry, farmers and traders worried about cheaper water transport reducing the value of fees on <a href="Toll%20road">turnpike roads</a> they controlled, and cheaper produce from Wales undercutting locally produced food.

The main alternative to road transport for the carriage of goods between <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> and London was a hazardous sea route through the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>. The small coastal <a href="sailing%20ship">sailing ship</a>s of the day were often damaged by Atlantic storms, and risked being attacked by <a href="warship">warship</a>s of the <a href="French%20Navy">French Navy</a> and <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s during a succession of conflicts with France.

Plans for a waterway were shelved until the early 18th century. However, in 1715, work was authorised to make the <a href="River%20Kennet">River Kennet</a> navigable from <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a> to Newbury. Work commenced in 1718, under the supervision of surveyor and engineer <a href="John%20Hore">John Hore</a> of Newbury. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened, comprising stretches of natural riverbed alternating with of artificially created lock cuts.

The <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Bristol%29">River Avon</a> had historically been navigable from <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> to <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a>, but construction of <a href="watermill">watermill</a>s on the river in the early years of the 13th century had forced its closure. In 1727, navigation was restored, with the construction of six locks, again under the supervision of John Hore. The first cargo of "Deal boards, Pig-Lead and Meal" reached Bath in December.

The two river navigations were built independently of one another, in order to meet local needs, but they eventually led to plans to connect them and form a through route.

In 1788 a "Western Canal" was proposed to improve trade and communication links to towns such as <a href="Hungerford">Hungerford</a>, <a href="Marlborough%2C%20Wiltshire">Marlborough</a>, <a href="Calne">Calne</a>, <a href="Chippenham">Chippenham</a> and <a href="Melksham">Melksham</a>. The following year the engineers Barns, Simcock and Weston submitted a proposed route for this canal, although there were doubts about the adequacy of the water supply. The name was changed from Western Canal to Kennet and Avon Canal to avoid confusion with the <a href="Grand%20Western%20Canal">Grand Western Canal</a>, which was being proposed at the same time.

In 1793 a further survey was conducted by <a href="John%20Rennie%20the%20Elder">John Rennie</a>, and the route of the canal was altered to take a more southerly course through <a href="Great%20Bedwyn">Great Bedwyn</a>, <a href="Devizes">Devizes</a>, <a href="Trowbridge">Trowbridge</a> and <a href="Newbury%2C%20Berkshire">Newbury</a>. The proposed route was accepted by the Kennet and Avon Canal Company, chaired by <a href="Charles%20Dundas%2C%201st%20Baron%20Amesbury">Charles Dundas</a>, and the company started to take <a href="Subscription%20%28finance%29">subscriptions</a> from prospective shareholders. In July 1793 Rennie suggested further alterations to the route, including the construction of a tunnel in the <a href="Savernake%20Forest">Savernake Forest</a>. On 17 April 1794 the Kennet and Avon Canal Act received the <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a> and construction began. The Newbury to Hungerford section was completed in 1798, and was extended to Great Bedwyn in 1799. The section from Bath to Foxhangers was finished in 1804, and Devizes Locks were completed in 1810.

The canal opened in 1810 after 16 years of construction. Major structures included the <a href="Dundas%20Aqueduct">Dundas</a> and <a href="Avoncliff%20Aqueduct">Avoncliff</a> <a href="Navigable%20aqueduct">aqueducts</a>, the <a href="Bruce%20Tunnel">Bruce Tunnel</a> under Savernake Forest, and the <a href="pumping%20station">pumping station</a>s at <a href="Claverton%20Pumping%20Station">Claverton</a> and <a href="Crofton%20Pumping%20Station">Crofton</a>, needed to overcome water supply problems. The final engineering task was the completion of the <a href="Caen%20Hill%20Locks">Caen Hill Locks</a> at Devizes.

In 1801, trade along the canal commenced; goods initially had to be unloaded at Foxhangers at the bottom of what is now Caen Hill Locks, transported up the hill by a <a href="Wagonway">horse-drawn railway</a>, and reloaded into barges at the top. When the flight of locks opened in 1810, allowing the same vessel to navigate the entire canal, the rate of carriage per ton from London to Bath was £2 9s 6d. This compared well with carriage by road, which cost £6 3s to £7 per <a href="long%20ton">ton</a>, and trade on the canal flourished. In 1812, the Kennet and Avon Canal Company bought the Kennet Navigation, which stretched from Newbury to the junction with the Thames at Kennet Mouth, near Reading. The purchase from Frederick Page cost £100,000, of which £70,000 was paid in cash with the balance paid back gradually. The purchase was authorised by the Kennet Navigation Act of June 1813, which enabled the company to raise the funds through the sale of 5,500 shares at £24 each. At the same time work was undertaken to improve the Avon Navigation, from Bristol to Bath, with the Kennet and Avon Canal Company purchasing a majority shareholding in the Avon Navigation in 1816.

By 1818, seventy 60-ton barges were working on the canal, the majority of the tonnage being coal and stone travelling via the <a href="Somerset%20Coal%20Canal">Somerset Coal Canal</a>. The journey from Bath to Newbury took an average of three and a half days. By 1832, 300,000 tons of freight was being carried each year and, between 1825 and 1834, the company had an annual revenue of around £45,000.

The opening of the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> in 1841 removed much of the canal's traffic, even though the canal company lowered tariffs. In 1852 the railway company took over the canal's operation, levying high tolls at every <a href="toll%20point">toll point</a> and reducing the amount spent on maintenance. Ice-breaking was stopped in 1857, and traders were further encouraged by preferential tolls to use the railway rather than the canal. In 1861 a new order prohibited any traffic on the canal at night, and, in 1865, boats were forced to pass through locks in pairs to reduce water loss. By 1868 the annual tonnage had fallen from 360,610 in 1848 to 210,567. In the 1870s <a href="water%20abstraction">water abstraction</a> from the canal near <a href="Fobney%20Lock">Fobney Lock</a> followed the regulations introduced in the Reading Local Board Waterworks, Sewerage, Drainage and Improvements Act of 1870, and contributed to the silting up of locks and stretches of the canal. Several wharves and stretches of towpath were closed. In 1877 the canal recorded a deficit of £1,920 and never subsequently made any profit.

The <a href="Somerset%20Coal%20Canal">Somerset Coal Canal</a> and <a href="Wilts%20%26amp%3B%20Berks%20Canal">Wilts & Berks Canal</a>, which each supplied some of the trade from the <a href="Somerset%20Coalfield">Somerset Coalfield</a> to the Kennet and Avon, closed in 1904 and 1906 respectively. In 1926, following a loss of £18,041 the previous year, the Great Western Railway sought to close the canal by obtaining a Ministry of Transport Order, but the move was resisted and the company charged with improving its maintenance of the canal. Cargo trade continued to decline, but a few pleasure boats started to use the canal.
During the Second World War <a href="British%20hardened%20field%20defences%20of%20World%20War%20II">a large number of concrete pillboxes</a> were built as part of the <a href="GHQ%20Line">GHQ Line - Blue</a> to defend against an expected German invasion; many of these are still visible along the banks of the canal. They were generally built close to road and rail bridges, which would have formed important crossing points for enemy troops and vehicles. After the war the Transport Act of 1947 transferred control of the canal to the <a href="British%20Transport%20Commission">British Transport Commission</a>, but by the 1950s large sections of the canal had been closed because of poor lock maintenance following a breach in the bank west of the <a href="Avoncliff%20Aqueduct">Avoncliff Aqueduct</a>. The last through passage was made in 1951 by "nb Queen".

A group supporting the restoration of the canal had been set up in the early 1950s independently of the <a href="Inland%20Waterways%20Association">Inland Waterways Association</a>, with which it was subsequently merged. In 1955 John Gould, a trader on the eastern section of the waterway, successfully petitioned against the commission's failure to maintain the waterway and obtained damages for loss of business. In March 1956 a clause in the British Transport Commission (no 2) Act was presented to Parliament that would have removed the right of navigation between Reading and Bath. The Act was opposed by Gould and by the local authorities along the canal. They were supported by a 22,000-signature petition to the Queen, brought to London from Bristol by water; parts of the canal had to be traversed by canoe. This campaign led to an inquiry by a Parliamentary <a href="Select%20committees%20of%20the%20Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Select Committee</a>. The committee supported the suspension of the right of navigation, and the Bill passed through the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> but was amended by the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a> to include a clause to enforce "no further deterioration". In July 1958, the Bowes Committee published their "Inquiry into Inland Waterways" which specifically mentioned the Kennet and Avon finding "no justification for restoring the section from Reading to Bath".

A government <a href="white%20paper">white paper</a> followed the Bowes Report in February 1959, recommending that an Inland Waterways Redevelopment Advisory Committee should assist schemes to regenerate canals that were no longer able to collect enough fees from tolls to pay for their upkeep. Further reports followed, and in 1962 the Advisory Committee reported that the canal should be redeveloped, and allocated £20,000 for maintenance and £20,000 to begin restoration. The <a href="Kennet%20and%20Avon%20Canal%20Trust">Kennet and Avon Canal Trust</a> was formed in 1962 to restore the canal from Reading to Bristol as a through navigation and as a public amenity. It was originally a voluntary group which had previously been known as the Kennet and Avon Canal Association. The Trust gained <a href="Charitable%20organization">charitable status</a> in April and was incorporated under the <a href="Companies%20Act%201948">Companies Act</a> on 6 June 1962. In 1963 the newly formed <a href="British%20Waterways">British Waterways</a>, which was created by the <a href="Transport%20Act%201962">Transport Act</a> of the previous year, and replaced the British Transport Commission as the statutory body for inland waterways, took over the canal and, in partnership with the Trust and <a href="Riparian%20zone">riparian</a> local authorities, restoration work began.

Restoration work involved a collaboration between staff from British Waterways and volunteer labour. In 1966 <a href="Sulhamstead%20Lock">Sulhamstead Lock</a> was rebuilt and the <a href="Puddling%20%28engineering%29">re-puddling</a> of the dry section at <a href="Limpley%20Stoke">Limpley Stoke</a> was begun. In 1968, restoration work was undertaken on the <a href="Bath%20Locks">Bath Locks</a> and <a href="Burghfield%20Lock">Burghfield Lock</a>. In Reading at Bridge Street the navigable headroom had been reduced from to by girders added to the underside of the bridge. This was replaced with a new bridge, enabling craft to pass more easily. The canal was reopened from the Thames to Hungerford Wharf in July 1974. Re-puddling was a long process, so experiments with the use of heavy gauge <a href="polyethylene">polythene</a> to line the canal were undertaken. The <a href="Avoncliff%20Aqueduct">Avoncliff Aqueduct</a> was lined with a concrete "cradle" and made water-tight in 1980.

Further works continued during the 1980s. The County Council in <a href="Berkshire">Berkshire</a>, supported by local councils, estimated that £1,275,000 was needed for works at the eastern end of the canal and commenced work on replacing some of the bridges. In <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> concerns over the limited water supply to the <a href="Route%20summit">summit</a>, at the highest point of the canal, indicated that back-pumping would be required, which increased the estimated cost for the county to £761,560. The <a href="Wilton%20Water">Wilton Water</a> reservoir was estimated to produce less than per day, and the Seend feeder only . <a href="Wessex%20Water">Wessex Water Authority</a> agreed to the extraction of per day from the Avon at Claverton to be pumped east; the costs of the pumps was £175,000.

Various fund-raising schemes, along with some financial support from local authorities, allowed small-scale work on the locks to continue, but the projected timescales for completion were missed. In 1983 the <a href="Manpower%20Services%20Commission">Manpower Services Commission</a>, which had a remit to co-ordinate employment and training services in the United Kingdom, agreed to employ 50 men on work that included restoration of <a href="Aldermaston%20Lock">Aldermaston Lock</a>, its adjacent wharf, and <a href="Widmead%20Lock">Widmead Lock</a>. The restoration of the <a href="Dundas%20Aqueduct">Dundas Aqueduct</a> and several smaller schemes were later added to the list. Maintenance agreements were signed with local authorities along the route, while fund-raising activities continued. The <a href="Nacro">National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders</a> sponsored a workshop, which opened in <a href="Shrivenham">Shrivenham</a> in 1987, to create new lock gates for the Crofton and Devizes flights. In 1988 the restoration of <a href="Woolhampton%20Lock">Woolhampton Lock</a> was completed, but obstructions remained on either side. Frounds <a href="swing%20bridge">swing bridge</a> could not be opened and the restoration of <a href="Midgham%20Lock">Midgham Lock</a> had not been finished; both were completed the following year. Re-puddling of the Crofton pounds was carried out in 1989, along with the reconstruction of Midgham Bridge. Restoration of the turf-sided <a href="Monkey%20Marsh%20Lock">Monkey Marsh Lock</a> proved difficult because of its status as a <a href="Scheduled%20monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>, and the consequent need to protect the historic site while improving safety.
The stretch between Reading and Newbury was completed on 17 July 1990; at a ceremony held at <a href="Monkey%20Marsh%20Lock">Monkey Marsh Lock</a> several boats competed to be the first craft through. Concerns about the adequacy of the water supply still remained when Queen <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a> formally reopened the canal on 8 August 1990. The Queen was able to travel on the Trust's boat, "The Rose of Hungerford", through locks 44 and 43 on the Caen Hill flight, breaking a ceremonial tape between them. The shortage of water was addressed in 1996 by the installation of new back pumps at the flight of 29 locks at Caen Hill in Devizes, at a cost of £1 million. The pumps raise water at a rate of per hour (380 litres per second). In October 1996, the Kennet & Avon Canal Partnership attracted the largest single <a href="National%20Lottery%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">National Lottery</a> grant awarded by the <a href="Heritage%20Lottery%20Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a>, £25 million towards a £29 million project, to complete the restoration and to make it operational, sustainable and accessible for the enjoyment of future generations. The work funded included complete rebuilding of Foxhangers Lock and bridge at Caen Hill, replacement of lock gates at Seend and Crofton, channel lining at Claverton, embankment repairs at Martinslade, improvements at Claverton pumping station and dredging at various sites. The restoration's completion was celebrated in May 2003 by a visit from <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">HRH Prince Charles</a>, but upgrading and maintenance continues. Between 2002 and 2004 the <a href="Dundas%20Aqueduct">Dundas Aqueduct</a>, which had been relined with polythene and concrete in 1984 without disturbing a colony of bats living under the aqueduct, was further restored by the replacement of engineering bricks used by the <a href="Great%20Western%20Railway">Great Western Railway</a> with <a href="Bath%20Stone">Bath Stone</a> to match the original work.

In 2011 the <a href="Department%20for%20Environment%2C%20Food%20and%20Rural%20Affairs">Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs</a> designated the canal a national "cruiseway" as defined by the <a href="Transport%20Act%201968">Transport Act 1968</a>. The listing imposes a legal requirement on British Waterways to maintain the canal to a standard that ensures cruising craft can safely navigate the entire length of the waterway. In November 2011 the navigation between Bath and Bristol was closed for several months because of safety concerns about <a href="Victoria%20Bridge%2C%20Bath">Victoria Bridge</a>.

The <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Bristol%29">River Avon</a> was navigable from Bristol to Bath during the early years of the 13th century, until the construction of mills on the river forced its closure.
The modern Avon is navigable from its mouth at <a href="Avonmouth">Avonmouth</a>, through the <a href="Bristol%20Harbour">Floating Harbour</a> in Bristol, as far as <a href="Pulteney%20Bridge">Pulteney Weir</a> in the centre of Bath and just beyond the start of the canal. Beyond Pulteney Weir the Avon is still navigable as far as the weir and site of the old "flash lock" at Bathampton but the lock at Pulteney has been replaced only with a small boat slide for dinghies and canoes. The stretch from Bristol to Bath is made navigable by the use of locks and <a href="weir">weir</a>s at <a href="Hanham%20Lock">Hanham</a>, <a href="Keynsham%20Lock">Keynsham</a>, <a href="Swineford%20Lock">Swineford</a>, <a href="Saltford%20Lock">Saltford</a>, <a href="Kelston%20Lock">Kelston</a> and <a href="Weston%20Lock">Weston</a>, which together overcome a rise of within .
Lock number one on the Kennet and Avon Canal is <a href="Hanham%20Lock">Hanham Lock</a>, first opened as part of the Avon Navigation in 1727. It is the first lock east of <a href="Easton%2C%20Bristol">Netham</a>, the upstream limit of the Floating Harbour, beyond the suburbs of the city of Bristol. A colliery <a href="wharf">wharf</a> was sited just west of the lock, but the nearby <a href="Coal%20mining">coal mines</a> closed in the 19th century. The river below Hanham Lock is considered to be <a href="tide">tidal</a>, as high tides often pass over the weir at Netham. Some <a href="spring%20tide">spring tide</a>s pass over the weir at Hanham, making the river tidal up to <a href="Keynsham%20Lock">Keynsham Lock</a>. Heading east, the river passes the <a href="Somerdale%20Factory">Somerdale Factory</a>, on its southern bank, which was a chocolate production factory for <a href="Cadbury">Cadbury</a> – originally built by the <a href="J.%20S.%20Fry%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">Fry family</a> in the 1920s and 1930s. On the northern bank is <a href="Cleeve%20Wood%2C%20Hanham">Cleeve Wood</a>, the primary scientific importance of which lies in its particularly large population of Bath asparagus ("<a href="Ornithogalum%20pyrenaicum">Ornithogalum pyrenaicum</a>").
A public house has been built on the island between Keynsham Lock and the weir. The weir side of the island is also the mouth of the <a href="River%20Chew">River Chew</a>.
The river then passes through <a href="Avon%20Valley%20Country%20Park">Avon Valley Country Park</a> and past <a href="Stidham%20Farm">Stidham Farm</a>, another SSSI that contains <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> terrace-gravels of the river. A depth of at least of sandy gravels are recorded, consisting mainly of <a href="limestone">limestone</a> <a href="Clastic%20rock">clasts</a>, but also with <a href="Millstone%20Grit">Millstone Grit</a>, Pennant <a href="Sandstone">Sandstone</a>, flint, and chert clasts. The river passes under the old railway line that now forms the <a href="Avon%20Valley%20Railway">Avon Valley Railway</a>, a <a href="heritage%20railway">heritage railway</a>, before reaching <a href="Swineford%20Lock">Swineford Lock</a>. Here, between 1709 and 1859, there was an active <a href="brass">brass</a> and copper industry served by the river, which also provided water power for the cloth industry. The remains of <a href="Kelston%20Brass%20Mill">Kelston Brass Mill</a>, which was working until 1925, are next to <a href="Saltford%20Lock">Saltford Lock</a>. The lock was opened in 1727 but destroyed by rival coal dealers in 1738, to prevent the river being used for transportation.

The <a href="Bristol%20and%20Bath%20Railway%20Path">Bristol and Bath Railway Path</a> crosses the navigation several times before reaching the suburb of <a href="Newbridge%2C%20Bath">Newbridge</a> on the outskirts of Bath. Here the <a href="A4%20road%20%28England%29">A4</a> crosses close to the <a href="Newton%20St%20Loe%20SSSI">Newton St Loe SSSI</a>, which is designated an SSSI because it represents the only remaining known exposure of fossiliferous <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> gravels containing the remains of <a href="mammoth">mammoth</a>s ("Mammuthus") and horses ("Equus") along the river, and has aided the development of a scientific understanding of the history of early <a href="Glacial%20period">glaciation</a> in <a href="South%20West%20England">South West England</a>. The final lock before entering Bath is <a href="Weston%20Lock">Weston Lock</a>, opened in 1727. Its construction created an island between the <a href="Cut%20%28earthmoving%29">cut</a> and the river weir, which became known as Dutch Island after the owner of the brass mill established on the riverside in the early 18th century.

The restored <a href="Bath%20Locks">Bath Bottom Lock</a> marks the divergence of the River Avon and the canal. It is situated south of <a href="Pulteney%20Bridge">Pulteney Bridge</a>. Just upstream of the Bottom Lock are a side <a href="Canal%20pound">pound</a> and a pumping station that pumps water "upstream" of the locks, to replace that used each time a boat passes through. The next of the six <a href="Bath%20Locks">Bath Locks</a> is Bath Deep Lock, numbered 8/9 as two locks were combined when the canal was restored in 1976. The new chamber has a depth of , making it the UK's second-deepest canal lock. Just above the Deep Lock is another side pound as a reservoir for refilling the lock, followed by Wash House Lock. After a slightly longer pound is Abbey View Lock, beside which there is another pumping station and then, in quick succession, Pulteney Lock and Bath Top Lock.

Above the Top Lock the canal passes through <a href="Sydney%20Gardens">Sydney Gardens</a> via two short tunnels and under two cast iron footbridges dating from 1800. Cleveland Tunnel is long and runs under Cleveland House, the former headquarters of the Kennet and Avon Canal Company and now a Grade II* listed building. A trap-door in the tunnel roof was used to pass paperwork between clerks above and bargees below. Many of the bridges over the canal are listed buildings.
On the eastern outskirts of Bath a toll bridge near the George Inn links <a href="Bathampton">Bathampton</a> to <a href="Batheaston">Batheaston</a>, on the north bank of the canal. When the <a href="A4%20road%20%28England%29">A4</a> Batheaston by-pass was built, the Bathampton Meadow was created to provide additional flood relief. The resultant wet meadows and <a href="oxbow%20lake">oxbow lake</a> have proved attractive to a number of migrants; <a href="Wader">wading birds</a> such as <a href="dunlin">dunlin</a>, ringed and little ringed <a href="plover">plover</a>, and green and common <a href="sandpiper">sandpiper</a> are frequent visitors in spring and autumn. <a href="Sand%20martin">Sand martin</a> and <a href="kingfisher">kingfisher</a> have been seen regularly by the lake, and other migrants have included <a href="Western%20yellow%20wagtail">yellow wagtail</a>, <a href="whinchat">whinchat</a> and <a href="Hobby%20%28bird%29">hobby</a>. The canal turns south into a valley between Bathampton Wood and Bathford Hill which includes <a href="Brown%27s%20Folly">Brown's Folly</a>, a biological and geological <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>.

In the Avon Valley to the east of Bath the classic geographical example of a valley with all four forms of ground transport is found: road, rail, river, canal. The canal passes the remains of a loading dock, once used for <a href="Bath%20Stone">Bath Stone</a> from the quarries on <a href="Bathampton%20Down">Bathampton Down</a>, which was carried down a straight track to the canal over the Dry Arch rock bridge (demolished in 1958 to allow <a href="double-decker%20bus">double-decker bus</a>es to use the <a href="A36%20road">A36</a>). Next, the canal passes the waterwheel-powered <a href="Claverton%20Pumping%20Station">Claverton Pumping Station</a>, which pumped water from the River Avon into the canal. The building was completed in 1810 and the pump was working by 1813.

On the eastern bank Warleigh Wood and <a href="Inwood%2C%20Warleigh">Inwood</a> are ash-wych elm and ash-maple dry woodland, which comes right down to the canal.

The canal then crosses over the river and the <a href="Wessex%20Main%20Line">Wessex Main Line</a> railway at the <a href="Dundas%20Aqueduct">Dundas Aqueduct</a>, past Conkwell Wood, before recrossing the river and railway at the <a href="Avoncliff%20Aqueduct">Avoncliff Aqueduct</a>. At the western end of the Dundas Aqueduct it is joined by the remains of the <a href="Somerset%20Coal%20Canal">Somerset Coal Canal</a>, a short stretch of which has been restored to create the Brassknocker Basin. Excavations of the old stop lock showed that it was originally a broad lock that at some point was narrowed to by moving the lock wall. The Somerset Coal Canal was built around 1800 from basins at <a href="Paulton">Paulton</a> and <a href="Timsbury%2C%20Somerset">Timsbury</a>, giving access to London from the <a href="Somerset%20Coalfield">Somerset Coalfield</a>, which at its peak contained 80 collieries.

After the Avoncliff Aqueduct the canal passes through Barton Farm <a href="Country%20park">Country Park</a>, past <a href="Gripwood%20Quarry">Gripwood Quarry</a> and a 14th-century Grade II* listed <a href="tithe%20barn">tithe barn</a>, long and wide, on its way into <a href="Bradford%20on%20Avon">Bradford on Avon</a>.

The first sod for the Kennet and Avon Canal was turned in Bradford on Avon in 1794, and soon there were wharves above and below <a href="Bradford%20Lock">Bradford Lock</a>. Further east, an aqueduct carries the canal over the <a href="River%20Biss">River Biss</a>. There are locks at <a href="Semington%20Locks">Semington</a> and <a href="Seend%20Locks">Seend</a>, where water flows into the canal from the Summerham Brook, otherwise known as the Seend Feeder. In the village of <a href="Semington">Semington</a> the <a href="Wilts%20%26amp%3B%20Berks%20Canal">Wilts & Berks Canal</a> joined the canal, linking the Kennet and Avon to the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> at <a href="Abingdon-on-Thames">Abingdon</a>. The <a href="Wilts%20%26amp%3B%20Berks%20Canal">North Wilts Canal</a> merged with it to become a branch to the <a href="Thames%20and%20Severn%20Canal">Thames and Severn Canal</a> at <a href="Latton%2C%20Wiltshire">Latton</a> near <a href="Cricklade">Cricklade</a>. The canal was opened in 1810, but abandoned in 1914 – a fate hastened by the collapse of <a href="Stanley%20Aqueduct">Stanley Aqueduct</a> in 1901. In 1977 the <a href="Wilts%20%26amp%3B%20Berks%20Canal%20Trust">Wilts & Berks Canal Amenity Group</a> was formed with the aim of fully restoring the canal to re-connect the Kennet and Avon to the upper reaches of the Thames.

<a href="Caen%20Hill%20Locks">Caen Hill Locks</a>, at <a href="Devizes">Devizes</a>, provides an insight into the engineering needed to build and maintain the canal. The main flight of 16 locks, which take 5–6 hours to navigate in a boat, is part of a longer series of 29 locks built in three groups: seven at Foxhangers, sixteen at Caen Hill, and six at the town end of the flight. The total rise is in or a 1 in 30 <a href="slope">gradient</a>. The locks were the last part of the route of the canal to be completed. The steepness of the terrain meant that there was no space to use the normal arrangement of water pounds between the locks. As a result, the 16 locks utilise unusually large side ponds to store the water needed for their operation. Because a large volume of water is needed a back pump was installed at Foxhangers in 1996, capable of returning of water per day to the top of the flight, equivalent to one lockful every 11 minutes. While the locks were under construction in the early 19th century a tramroad provided a link between Foxhangers at the bottom of the flight and Devizes at the top, the remains of which can be seen in the towpath arches in the road bridges over the canal. From 1829 until 1843 the flight, which includes the narrowest lock on the canal, Lock 41, was illuminated by gas lights.

At the top of the flight is Devizes Wharf, home to the <a href="Kennet%20%26amp%3B%20Avon%20Canal%20Museum">Kennet & Avon Canal Museum</a>, which has a range of exhibits on the conception, design, usage, and eventual commercial decline of the Kennet and Avon Canal, as well as its subsequent restoration. It is operated by the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust, which has its headquarters and a shop within the Canal Centre. The Wharf Theatre is in an old warehouse on the same site. Devizes wharf is the starting point for the <a href="Devizes%20to%20Westminster%20International%20Canoe%20Marathon">Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon</a>, which has been held since 1948.

Heading east from Devizes the canal passes through the <a href="Wiltshire">Wiltshire</a> countryside and a series of locks and <a href="swing%20bridge">swing bridge</a>s before another flight of locks at <a href="Crofton%20Locks">Crofton</a>.

At <a href="Alton%2C%20Wiltshire">Honeystreet</a> is the remains of a wharf that was the home of boat builders Robbins, Lane and Pinnegar, which served as the boat building headquarters of the Canal Company. They built many of the boats used on the canals of southern England before closing in about 1950. Next to the wharf is the Barge Inn, a substantial <a href="Pub">public house</a> once known as the George Inn. It was roughly half-way along the canal and served as a bakehouse, slaughterhouse and shop for provisions for those living and working on the canal. The building was destroyed by fire in 1858 and rebuilt within six months. It was built just within the parish boundary of <a href="Stanton%20St%20Bernard">Stanton St Bernard</a> to "serve the Honey Street wharf in <a href="Alton%2C%20Wiltshire">Alton</a> parish, which refused to allow drinking establishments".

<a href="Jones%27s%20Mill">Jones's Mill</a> is a area of fen vegetation, scrub and woodland lying along the headwaters of the <a href="River%20Avon%20%28Hampshire%29">Salisbury Avon</a> northeast of <a href="Pewsey">Pewsey</a>. It has been designated a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">biological Site of Special Scientific Interest</a> because it is "the best known example of a calcareous valley mire in Wiltshire".

The four locks at <a href="Wootton%20Rivers">Wootton Rivers</a> mark the end of the climb from the Avon. Between <a href="Wootton%20Top%20Lock">Wootton Top Lock</a> and Crofton is the <a href="summit%20pound">summit pound</a> of the canal at above sea level, stretching for about and including the <a href="Bruce%20Tunnel">Bruce Tunnel</a>. The tunnel is named after the local land owner, <a href="Thomas%20Brudenell-Bruce%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Ailesbury">Thomas Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury</a> (1729–1814), who refused to allow a deep cutting through his property and insisted on a tunnel. The tunnel has <a href="Brick">red brick</a> portals, capped with <a href="Bath%20stone">Bath stone</a>, each with a decorative plaque of <a href="Pennant%20stone">Pennant stone</a>. The tunnel was begun in 1806 and finished in 1809. It is lined with <a href="English%20bond">English bond</a> brickwork and has a wide bore to cope with the Newbury barges used on the canal. There is no towpath through the tunnel, so walkers and cyclists must walk across the top of the hill. When canal boats were pulled by horses the boatmen had to haul their barges through the tunnel by hand, pulling on chains that ran along the inside walls.

The <a href="Crofton%20Locks">Crofton Locks</a> flight marks the start of the descent from the summit to the Thames; the nine locks have a total rise/fall of . When the canal was built there were no reliable water sources available to fill the summit by normal gravitational means. A number of usable springs were found adjacent to the canal route about east of the summit pound, and about below it, and arrangements were made for them to feed the pound below lock 60 at Crofton. Some years later the <a href="Wilton%20Water">Wilton Water</a> <a href="reservoir">reservoir</a> was created to enhance the supply to this pound using the springs and the <a href="River%20Dun%20%28River%20Kennet%29">River Dun</a>.
Water is pumped to the summit at the western end of the locks, from Wilton Water, by the restored <a href="Crofton%20Pumping%20Station">Crofton Pumping Station</a>. The original steam-powered pumping station is preserved and contains one of the oldest operational <a href="Watt%20steam%20engine">Watt-style beam engines</a> in the world, dating from 1812. The steam engines still pump water on selected weekends, but for day-to-day operation electric pumps are used, automatically controlled by the water level in the summit pound.

Near Crofton is <a href="Savernake%20Forest">Savernake Forest</a> and the remains of a railway bridge that carried the <a href="Midland%20and%20South%20Western%20Junction%20Railway">Midland and South Western Junction Railway</a> over the canal. Mill Bridge at <a href="Great%20Bedwyn">Great Bedwyn</a> is unusual in being a <a href="skew%20arch">skew arch</a>; on its completion in 1796 it was the first of its kind. From there to <a href="Hungerford">Hungerford</a> the canal follows the valley of the <a href="River%20Dun%20%28River%20Kennet%29">River Dun</a> through <a href="Freeman%27s%20Marsh">Freeman's Marsh</a>, which consists of unimproved meadows, marsh and reedbed. It is an important site for overwintering, migratory and breeding birds, and supports many varieties of flora scarce in Southern England. It was cited by <a href="English%20Nature">English Nature</a> in 1986, and forms part of the <a href="North%20Wessex%20Downs">North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a>. There are plans to construct a marina and hotel complex adjacent to the site, but the potential environmental impacts (particularly to <a href="European%20water%20vole">water voles</a>) of such a development on Freeman's Marsh have led to local opposition. To the north of the canal are seven separate small areas, four in the Kennet Valley and three in the <a href="River%20Lambourn">Lambourn Valley</a>, which make up the <a href="Kennet%20and%20Lambourn%20Floodplain">Kennet and Lambourn Floodplain</a> SSSI. Occupying a total of , it supports particularly large populations of <a href="Desmoulin%27s%20whorl%20snail">Desmoulin's whorl snail</a>.
There are several locks and bridges in Hungerford, including one which carries the <a href="A338%20road">A338</a>. <a href="Hungerford%20Marsh%20Lock">Hungerford Marsh Lock</a> is unique on the Kennet and Avon Canal in that it has a swing bridge directly over the centre of the lock that must be opened before the lock may be used. In the area around the lock, called Hungerford Marsh Nature Reserve, more than 120 bird species have been recorded.

Between <a href="Kintbury%20Lock">Kintbury Lock</a> and Newbury, passing to the north of <a href="Hamstead%20Marshall">Hamstead Marshall</a>, the canal is very close to the River Kennet, which flows into the canal via several channels. The canal passes through an area known as the <a href="Kennet%20Valley%20Alderwoods">Kennet Valley Alderwoods</a>, the largest remaining fragments of damp, ash-alder woodland in the River Kennet <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>. The SSSI includes two woods – the Wilderness and part of Ryott's Plantation – which are important because they support a very great diversity of plants associated with this woodland type, dominated by alder ("<a href="Alnus%20glutinosa">Alnus glutinosa</a>"); though ash ("<a href="Fraxinus%20excelsior">Fraxinus excelsior</a>") is abundant in places and there is occasional <a href="Quercus%20robur">oak</a> ("Quercus robur") and <a href="Ulmus%20glabra">wych elm</a> ("Ulmus glabra"). In addition to the wide range of higher plants the woods support a diverse <a href="bryophyte">bryophyte</a> flora including the uncommon <a href="epiphyte">epiphyte</a>s "Radula complanata", "Zygodon viridissimus" and "Orthotrichum affine". Nearby is <a href="Irish%20Hill%20Copse">Irish Hill Copse</a>. This site of coppiced <a href="ancient%20woodland">ancient woodland</a> includes an extensive area of calcareous ash/wych elm coppice on the hill sides, merging into wet <a href="Fraxinus">ash</a>/<a href="maple">maple</a> and acid <a href="oak">oak</a>/ash/<a href="hazel">hazel</a> woodland with <a href="aspen">aspen</a>, on the higher parts of the site. The lower slopes are dominated by <a href="Mercurialis%20perennis">dog's mercury</a> ("Mercurialis perennis"), with abundant <a href="Paris%20quadrifolia">herb paris</a> ("Paris quadrifolia"), <a href="toothwort">toothwort</a> ("Lathraea squamaria"), <a href="Polygonatum">Solomon's seal</a> ("Polygonatum multiflorum"), <a href="Neottia">twayblade</a> and <a href="Orchis%20mascula">early purple orchids</a> ("Listera ovata") and "Orchis mascula" and, locally, <a href="Narcissus%20pseudonarcissus">wild daffodil</a> ("Narcissus pseudonarcissus").

A wooden bridge was built over the Kennet at Newbury in 1726, replaced in stone between 1769 and 1772 by James Clarke, and now known as the Town Bridge or Water Bridge. As there is no tow path, a line to haul the barge had to be floated under the bridge and then re-attached to the horse where the tow path resumed.

The River Kennet is navigable from <a href="Newbury%2C%20Berkshire">Newbury</a> downstream to the confluence with the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> at Kennet Mouth, in <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>.

The stretch from Newbury to <a href="High%20Bridge%2C%20Reading">High Bridge</a> in Reading is an improved river navigation known as the "Kennet Navigation", opened in 1723. Throughout this navigation stretches of natural riverbed alternate with of artificial lock cuts and a series of locks that overcome a fall of .

East of Newbury town centre the Kennet passes through the <a href="Thatcham%20Reed%20Beds">Thatcham Reed Beds</a> a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>, nationally important for its extensive reedbed, and species-rich <a href="alder">alder</a> woodland and fen habitats. The latter supports <a href="Desmoulin%27s%20whorl%20snail">Desmoulin's whorl snail</a> ("Vertigo moulinsiana"), which is of national and European importance. A large assemblage of breeding birds including nationally rare species such as <a href="Cetti%27s%20warbler">Cetti's warbler</a> ("Cettia cetti") make use of the reedbed, fen and open water habitats found at Thatcham Reed Beds. Thatcham's network of <a href="gravel%20pit">gravel pit</a>s, <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a>, woodland, hedges and <a href="grassland">grassland</a> is rich in wildlife and has been made into <a href="The%20Nature%20Discovery%20Centre">The Nature Discovery Centre</a> by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20for%20the%20Protection%20of%20Birds">Royal Society for the Protection of Birds</a>.
<a href="Monkey%20Marsh%20Lock">Monkey Marsh Lock</a> at <a href="Thatcham">Thatcham</a> is one of only two remaining working examples of turf-sided locks on the canal today. It is listed as a <a href="Scheduled%20monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a> by English Heritage.

Below <a href="Colthrop%20Lock">Colthrop Lock</a> in <a href="Thatcham">Thatcham</a> the river leaves behind the built-up area of Newbury and runs in generally rural surroundings. It passes through the <a href="Woolhampton%20Reed%20Bed">Woolhampton Reed Bed</a>, another SSSI which consists of dense <a href="reed%20bed">reed bed</a> with smaller areas of tall <a href="fen">fen</a> vegetation and <a href="Carr%20%28landform%29">carr woodland</a>. It is notable for the diversity of insects it supports and its nesting <a href="passerine">passerine</a> bird populations, which include several uncommon species such as <a href="Acrocephalus%20%28bird%29">reed warbler</a> ("Acrocephalus scirpaceus"), a species that in Britain nests almost exclusively in this habitat.

<a href="Aldermaston%20Gravel%20Pits">Aldermaston Gravel Pits</a> consist of mature flooded <a href="gravel">gravel</a> workings surrounded by dense fringing vegetation, trees and scrub, affording a variety of habitats for breeding birds and a refuge for wildfowl. The irregular shoreline with islands, promontories, sheltered <a href="/Eutrophic%23Eutrophic">eutrophic</a> pools and narrow lagoons, provides undisturbed habitat for many water birds, including surface-feeding ducks such as <a href="Eurasian%20teal">teal</a> ("Anas crecca") and <a href="shoveler">shoveler</a> ("Anas clypeata"). The surrounding marsh and scrub are important for numerous birds including nine breeding species of <a href="warbler">warbler</a>s, <a href="water%20rail">water rail</a>s ("Rallus aquaticus"), <a href="kingfisher">kingfisher</a>s ("Alcedoa atthis") and an important breeding colony of <a href="Common%20nightingale">nightingales</a> ("Luscinia megarhynchos"). In 2002 <a href="English%20Nature">English Nature</a> bought Aldermaston Gravel Pits from the mineral extraction company <a href="Grundon">Grundon</a> and it is managed as a <a href="nature%20reserve">nature reserve</a> by the <a href="Berkshire%2C%20Buckinghamshire%20and%20Oxfordshire%20Wildlife%20Trust">Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Wildlife Trust</a>. The <a href="River%20Kennet">River Kennet</a> itself, from near its sources west of Marlborough down to Woolhampton, has been designated as a SSSI primarily because it has an extensive range of rare plants and animals that are unique to <a href="chalk">chalk</a> watercourses.
The village of <a href="Woolhampton">Woolhampton</a> and the canal settlement of <a href="Aldermaston%20Wharf">Aldermaston Wharf</a> are the only significant settlements until the river enters the built-up area of Reading at <a href="Sheffield%20Lock">Sheffield Lock</a> in <a href="Theale%2C%20Berkshire">Theale</a>. Even after this, the river is isolated from Reading's suburbs by a wide <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> surrounding the river. In this stretch is <a href="Garston%20Lock">Garston Lock</a>, the other turf-sided lock on the navigation.

Shortly after passing <a href="Fobney%20Lock">Fobney Lock</a> and the associated <a href="water%20treatment">water treatment</a> works, the Kennet flood plain narrows and the river enters a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames flood plain. At <a href="County%20Lock">County Lock</a> the river enters the centre of Reading, where it formerly flowed through the centre of a large brewery. This narrow and twisting stretch of the river became known as <a href="County%20Lock">Brewery Gut</a>. Because of poor visibility and the difficulty of boats passing in this stretch, traffic has long been controlled by a set of maritime <a href="traffic%20light">traffic light</a>s. Today the Brewery Gut is a major feature of Reading's <a href="The%20Oracle%2C%20Reading">The Oracle</a> shopping centre.
Immediately after The Oracle the river flows under the arched High Bridge, which forms a historical and administrative divide on the river. The last of the River Kennet in Reading below the bridge has been navigable since at least the 13th century. Because there is no wide floodplain, wharves could be built during the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> that allowed Reading to establish itself as a river port. Originally this short stretch of river, which includes <a href="Blake%27s%20Lock">Blake's Lock</a>, was under the control of <a href="Reading%20Abbey">Reading Abbey</a>, but today it is administered by the <a href="Environment%20Agency">Environment Agency</a> as if it were part of the River Thames. The Horseshoe Bridge at Kennet Mouth was built as a railway bridge in 1839, and the timber-clad iron-truss <a href="accommodation%20bridge">accommodation bridge</a> was added in 1892.

The canal today is a <a href="heritage%20tourism">heritage tourism</a> destination. Boating, with <a href="narrowboat">narrowboat</a>s and <a href="Cabin%20cruiser">cruisers</a>, is a popular tourist attraction particularly in the summer months. It is a favourite haunt of several famous canal enthusiasts including canal boat veterans and original Kennet and Avon restoration supporters, <a href="Prunella%20Scales">Prunella Scales</a> and <a href="Timothy%20West">Timothy West</a>.
Privately owned craft and hire boats from the range of <a href="marina">marina</a>s are much in evidence, and there are numerous <a href="canoe">canoe</a> clubs along its length. The annual <a href="Devizes%20to%20Westminster%20International%20Canoe%20Marathon">Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon</a> starts from Devizes Wharf, the site of the <a href="Kennet%20%26amp%3B%20Avon%20Canal%20Museum">Kennet & Avon Canal Museum</a>, at first light on <a href="Good%20Friday">Good Friday</a> each year and the competitors have to negotiate 75 locks in the route between Devizes and the finish at <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>. The winning time is usually around 17½ hours.

Cycling is permitted along the canal <a href="towpath">towpath</a> except for a section near <a href="Woolhampton">Woolhampton</a>. Some sections of the canal towpath have been improved and widened to make them more suitable for cyclists and disabled users. Under a partnership arrangement involving British Waterways, <a href="Sustrans">Sustrans</a>, and the riparian local authorities, two main sections of the canal have been improved, and, with a few short diversions, run from Reading to <a href="Marsh%20Benham">Marsh Benham</a> and from Devizes to Bath as part of the <a href="National%20Cycle%20Network">National Cycle Network</a> (NCN) <a href="National%20Cycle%20Route%204">Route 4</a>. Fishing for <a href="Common%20bream">bream</a>, <a href="tench">tench</a>, <a href="Common%20roach">roach</a>, <a href="Scardinius">rudd</a>, <a href="perch">perch</a>, <a href="Gudgeon%20%28fish%29">gudgeon</a>, <a href="Esox">pike</a> and <a href="carp">carp</a> is permitted throughout the year from the towpath of the canal, but almost its whole length is leased to angling associations or fishing clubs. There are a variety of riverside <a href="Pub">public houses</a>, shops and tea rooms. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust operates shops and tearooms at <a href="Aldermaston%20Lock">Aldermaston Lock</a>, <a href="Newbury%20Lock">Newbury Wharf</a>, <a href="Crofton%20Pumping%20Station">Crofton Pumping Station</a>, <a href="Devizes">Devizes</a>, and <a href="Bradford%20on%20Avon">Bradford on Avon</a>.

The canal and its environs are important for wildlife conservation. There are several <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Sites of Special Scientific Interest</a> (SSSI), which exhibit great <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. Key sites that are home to several rare species include the <a href="Aldermaston%20Gravel%20Pits">Aldermaston Gravel Pits</a>, <a href="Woolhampton%20Reed%20Bed">Woolhampton</a>, <a href="Thatcham%20Reed%20Beds">Thatcham Reed Beds</a>, and <a href="Freeman%27s%20Marsh">Freeman's Marsh</a>, <a href="Hungerford">Hungerford</a>. There are also many non-statutory nature reserves along the canal. More than 100 different species of bird have been recorded in surveys over the length of the canal, of which 38 could be classified as specialist waterway birds, including <a href="grey%20heron">grey heron</a> ("Ardea cinerea"), <a href="reed%20bunting">reed bunting</a> ("Emberiza schoeniclus") and <a href="common%20kingfisher">common kingfisher</a> ("Alcedo atthis"). Fourteen species have been confirmed as breeding including <a href="sand%20martin">sand martin</a>s ("Riparia riparia"), which nest in drain-pipes in the brick walls of the canal in the centre of Reading. <a href="Wilton%20Water">Wilton Water</a> by <a href="Crofton%20Locks">Crofton Locks</a> and the Kennet Valley <a href="gravel%20pit">gravel pit</a>s provide habitats for breeding and wintering waterfowl. Several species of <a href="Odonata">Odonata</a> (<a href="Dragonfly">dragonflies</a> and <a href="Damselfly">damselflies</a>) and other invertebrates have also been recorded. <a href="Phragmites">Common reed</a> ("Phragmites australis") is among the plant species growing along the edges of the canal. Measures to preserve and create <a href="European%20water%20vole">water vole</a> ("Arvicola amphibius or A. terrestrisis") habitat have had considerable impact on the restoration of the canal, and new "vole-friendly" techniques of bank protection have been developed.

Galaxy Science Fiction

Galaxy Science Fiction was an American <a href="digest%20size">digest-size</a> <a href="science%20fiction%20magazine">science fiction magazine</a>, published from 1950 to 1980. It was founded by a French-Italian company, World Editions, which was looking to break into the American market. World Editions hired as editor <a href="H.%20L.%20Gold">H. L. Gold</a>, who rapidly made "Galaxy" the leading science fiction (sf) magazine of its time, focusing on stories about social issues rather than technology.

Gold published many notable stories during his tenure, including <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s "The Fireman", later expanded as "<a href="Fahrenheit%20451">Fahrenheit 451</a>"; <a href="Robert%20A.%20Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>'s "<a href="The%20Puppet%20Masters">The Puppet Masters</a>"; and <a href="Alfred%20Bester">Alfred Bester</a>'s "<a href="The%20Demolished%20Man">The Demolished Man</a>". In 1952, the magazine was acquired by Robert Guinn, its printer. By the late 1950s, <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a> was helping Gold with most aspects of the magazine's production. When Gold's health worsened, Pohl took over as editor, starting officially at the end of 1961, though he had been doing the majority of the production work for some time.

Under Pohl "Galaxy" had continued success, regularly publishing fiction by writers such as <a href="Cordwainer%20Smith">Cordwainer Smith</a>, <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>, <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>, and <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a>. Pohl never won the annual <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo Award</a> for his stewardship of "Galaxy", winning three Hugos instead for its sister magazine, "<a href="If%20%28magazine%29">If</a>". In 1969 Guinn sold "Galaxy" to Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD) and Pohl resigned, to be replaced by <a href="Ejler%20Jakobsson">Ejler Jakobsson</a>. Under Jakobsson the magazine declined in quality. It recovered under <a href="James%20Baen">James Baen</a>, who took over in mid-1974, but when he left at the end of 1977 the deterioration resumed, and there were financial problems—writers were not paid on time and the schedule became erratic. By the end of the 1970s the gaps between issues were lengthening, and the title was finally sold to "<a href="Galileo%20%28magazine%29">Galileo</a>" publisher Vincent McCaffrey, who brought out only a single issue in 1980. A brief revival as a semi-professional magazine followed in 1994, edited by H. L. Gold's son, <a href="E.%20J.%20Gold">E. J. Gold</a>; this lasted for eight bimonthly issues.

At its peak, "Galaxy" greatly influenced the science fiction genre. It was regarded as one of the leading sf magazines almost from the start, and its influence did not wane until Pohl's departure in 1969. Gold brought a "sophisticated intellectual subtlety" to magazine science fiction according to Pohl, who added that "after "Galaxy" it was impossible to go on being naive." SF historian <a href="David%20Kyle">David Kyle</a> agreed, commenting that "of all the editors in and out of the post-war scene, the most influential beyond any doubt was H. L. Gold". Kyle suggested that the new direction Gold set "inevitably" led to the experimental <a href="New%20Wave%20science%20fiction">New Wave</a>, the defining science fiction literary movement of the 1960s.

The first science fiction magazine, "<a href="Amazing%20Stories">Amazing Stories</a>", appeared in 1926. By the end of the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, but World War II and its resulting paper shortages led to the demise of several magazines. In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. "Galaxy" appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic <a href="Mike%20Ashley%20%28writer%29">Mike Ashley</a>, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, when the market dipped again as a side effect of <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Subcommittee%20on%20Juvenile%20Delinquency">US Senate hearings</a> into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.

<a href="H.%20L.%20Gold">H. L. Gold</a>, "Galaxy" first editor, had worked at <a href="Thrilling%20Publications">Standard Magazines</a> in the early 1940s as an assistant editor, reading for Standard's three science fiction pulps: "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>", "<a href="Thrilling%20Wonder">Thrilling Wonder</a>", and "<a href="Captain%20Future%20%28magazine%29">Captain Future</a>". With the advent of the war, Gold left publishing and went into the army, but in late 1949 he was approached by Vera Cerutti, who had once worked for him. Cerutti was now working for a French-Italian publisher, Éditions Mondiales Del Duca founded by <a href="Cino%20Del%20Duca">Cino Del Duca</a>, that had opened an office in New York as World Editions. She initially asked Gold for guidance on how to produce a magazine, which he provided. World Editions took a heavy loss on "Fascination", its first attempt to launch a US magazine, and Cerutti returned to Gold asking for recommendations for new titles. Gold knew about "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20%26amp%3B%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction</a>", a digest launched in the fall of 1949, but felt that there was still room in the market for another serious science fiction magazine. He sent a prospectus to World Editions that included a proposal for a series of paperback sf novels as well as a periodical, and proposed paying three cents a word, an impressively high rate, given that most competing magazines were paying only one cent a word. World Editions agreed, hired Gold as the editor, and the first issue appeared in October 1950. The novel series subsequently appeared as "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction%20Novels">Galaxy Science Fiction Novels</a>".

Gold initially suggested two titles for the magazine, "If" and "Galaxy". Gold's art director, Washington Irving van der Poel, mocked up multiple layouts and Gold invited hundreds of writers, editors, artists, and fans to view them and vote for their favorite; the vote was strongly for "Galaxy" as the title. For the first issue, Gold obtained stories by several well-known authors, including <a href="Isaac%20Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a>, <a href="Fritz%20Leiber">Fritz Leiber</a>, and <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, as well as part one of "Time Quarry" by <a href="Clifford%20D.%20Simak">Clifford D. Simak</a> (later published in book form as "Time and Again"). Along with an essay by Gold, "Galaxy" premiere issue introduced a book review column by anthologist <a href="Groff%20Conklin">Groff Conklin</a>, which ran until 1955, and a <a href="Willy%20Ley">Willy Ley</a> science column. Gold sought to implement high-quality printing techniques, though the quality of the available paper was insufficient for the full benefits to be seen. Within months, the outbreak of the Korean War led to paper shortages that forced Gold to find a new printer, Robert M. Guinn. The new paper was of even lower quality, a disappointment to Gold. According to Gold, the magazine was profitable within five issues: an "incredible" achievement, in his words.

In the summer of 1951, disagreements within World Editions led to attempts to disrupt "Galaxy" distribution. According to Gold, the circulation director and the head of the American office stockpiled many issues instead of distributing them, and made sure that the ones that did get distributed went to areas of the United States, such as the South, where there was little or no audience for the magazine. The head of the French office of World Editions came to the United States to find out what the problem was, and recommended that the magazine be sold to the two Americans, for $3,000—a very low price. They tried to recruit Gold, but he contacted the Italian office, which rejected the sale and eventually agreed to sell "Galaxy" to the printer, Robert M. Guinn. It was only after the sale was complete that the sabotaged distribution came to light; World Editions wanted to buy back the magazine, but Guinn quoted a price four times as high as he had paid. In Gold's words, "he, Guinn, knew what he was buying, whereas World Editions hadn't known what they were selling".

Guinn's new company was named Galaxy Publishing Corporation, and it took over beginning with the October 1951 issue. Gold remained as editor, but lost the assistance of staff at World Editions, relying instead on help from <a href="Jerome%20Bixby">Jerome Bixby</a>, <a href="Algis%20Budrys">Algis Budrys</a>, <a href="Theodore%20Sturgeon">Theodore Sturgeon</a>, and Gold's wife, Evelyn Paige. Science fiction author <a href="Frederik%20Pohl">Frederik Pohl</a>, then working as a literary agent, was also helpful in connecting writers with Gold.

By the late 1950s, the science fiction magazine boom was over, and the relatively low circulation of the magazines did not endear them to distributors, the middlemen who transported magazines from the publishers to the newsstands and other outlets. Gold changed the title from "Galaxy Science Fiction" to "Galaxy Magazine" with the September 1958 issue, commenting that the term "science fiction" "scares many people away from buying". "Galaxy" circulation, at about 90,000, was the highest of the science fiction magazines, but Guinn decided to cut costs, and in 1959 raised the cover price and changed the magazine to a bimonthly schedule, while increasing the page count. Guinn also cut the rates paid to authors from three (and occasionally four) cents a word to one and a half cents a word. These changes saved "Galaxy" over $12,000 a year. The result was a fall in circulation to about 80,000 within two years, but this was sustainable because of the savings from the fiction budget.

Guinn acquired "<a href="If%20%28magazine%29">If</a>", another science fiction magazine, in 1959, and gave it to Gold to edit as well. The July 1959 issue of "If" was the first under Gold's editorship. "Galaxy" shift to a bimonthly schedule had been intended to help reduce the workload on Gold, who was not in good health; he was able to take on "If" as well because the two magazines alternated months of publication. Towards the end of the 1950s Frederik Pohl began to help Gold, occasionally to the extent of performing all the editorial duties, including writing the editorials and blurbs and working with the printer. Gold, who was agoraphobic, was making efforts at this time to leave his apartment, but in 1960 he was seriously injured in a taxi accident, and proved unable to continue as editor. Pohl took over at some point in early 1961, though he was not listed on the masthead as editor until the December 1961 issue.

Pohl attempted to persuade Guinn to double the pay rate of one and a half cents a word back to the former level of three. Guinn refused, but Pohl was able to find enough material that he could purchase at a low rate to allow him to offer some authors three cents per word. The strategy was successful in improving circulation, and Guinn eventually acceded to the rate increase.

Pohl also tried hard to persuade Guinn and <a href="Sol%20Cohen">Sol Cohen</a>, whom Guinn had hired to help with the publishing duties, to switch both "Galaxy" and "If" to monthly schedules. In late 1962, they agreed, but soon changed their minds and decided to start a third science fiction magazine instead. This was "<a href="Worlds%20of%20Tomorrow%20%28magazine%29">Worlds of Tomorrow</a>", which was launched in April 1963 and lasted until mid-1967 (it was briefly revived in 1970–71). Another companion magazine, "<a href="International%20Science%20Fiction">International Science Fiction</a>", was tried in late 1967, but lasted only two issues; it showcased stories translated from other languages, and sales were very weak. Finally, in 1968 Guinn launched "<a href="Worlds%20of%20Fantasy">Worlds of Fantasy</a>", edited initially by <a href="Lester%20del%20Rey">Lester del Rey</a>, "Galaxy" managing editor; only four issues appeared. In the middle of 1968, "Galaxy" was restored to a monthly schedule.

In 1969, Guinn sold "Galaxy" to Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> at a World Science Fiction Symposium when the sale went through; he heard the news when he returned to the "Galaxy" office afterwards and within a few days decided to resign. He remained on the masthead as "editor emeritus", a post invented to keep Pohl from moving to one of the other sf magazines, and went back to his writing career. His place was taken by <a href="Ejler%20Jakobsson">Ejler Jakobsson</a>, who was working in UPD's book department. Lester del Rey stayed on as features editor, and <a href="Judy-Lynn%20del%20Rey">Judy-Lynn Benjamin</a> took his place as managing editor. <a href="Jack%20Gaughan">Jack Gaughan</a> was made art editor.

"Galaxy" circulation had held relatively steady in the mid-1960s, ranging between 73,000 and 78,000, but the UPD acquisition coincided with a precipitous drop—from 75,300 for the year ended October 1968, circulation fell to 51,479 just one year later. Difficulties with distribution also cut into income, and Arnold Abramson, UPD's owner, decided to cut costs and maximize profits. "Galaxy" went bimonthly in August 1970, ending a two-year spell of monthly scheduling (though a couple of months had been missed). The page count, which had been cut from 196 to 160 when UPD bought it, was increased again, and the price was raised from 60 cents to 75 cents. A British edition began in May 1972, published by Tandem Books, which was owned by UPD. The net effect of all these changes was a substantial increase in profitability. Circulation in 1972 also rose by about 6,000 issues, though it is possible that this was solely due to the new British edition.

UPD began to have financial difficulties in the early 1970s, and when Judy-Lynn del Rey (formerly Judy-Lynn Benjamin) left in May 1973 to work at Ballantine Books, Jakobsson's workload increased greatly. He resigned less than a year later, citing overwork and other issues, and was replaced by <a href="James%20Baen">James Baen</a>, who took over with the June 1974 issue after Pohl declined the post. Baen also took over the editorship of "If", but rising paper costs forced the closure of "If" at the end of 1974, and the title was merged with "Galaxy". The magazine had returned to a monthly schedule in September 1973, but it was only patchily adhered to, with at least a couple of issues missed every year except 1974. Baen was successful at increasing circulation again, bringing it from 47,789 when he took over to 81,035 when he left. The magazine was profitable for UPD, but the financial pressure on the parent company took its toll and Baen left in late 1977 to work for <a href="Ace%20Books">Ace Books</a>—the October issue was his last.

Baen was replaced by John J. Pierce, but the situation only worsened. Pierce resigned within a year: the company was in increasing debt, and his office assistant recalls that the office appeared inefficiently run, though he commented that Pierce "clearly loved what he did and knew what he was talking about". Pierce's replacement was <a href="Hank%20Stine">Hank Stine</a>, who took over in late 1978, though because of "Galaxy" irregular schedule Pierce's last issue was March–April 1979. Stine managed to produce only two more issues, June–July 1979 and September–October 1979, before UPD's financial problems spelled the end. Rights to the title were transferred to a new company, Galaxy Magazine, Inc., owned by Vincent McCaffrey, proprietor of Avenue Victor Hugo, a second-hand book store in Boston; UPD retained a ten percent interest in order to receive income from future sales to pay off their debts. Stine had compiled two more issues, but neither ever appeared; McCaffrey, who had also launched a separate magazine, "Galileo", had cash-flow problems that prevented him from distributing the magazine as he had planned. One more issue did finally appear from McCaffrey, in July 1980, in a large format; it was edited by Floyd Kemske. A subsequent issue, to be dated October 1980, was assembled, but never distributed.

The last few years of "Galaxy" life were marked by stories of unpaid contributors. <a href="John%20Varley%20%28author%29">John Varley</a>, for example, reported that he was still owed money for his stories five years after they appeared. Submissions from well-known writers fell away, and the lack of financial support from UPD meant that the pay rate was an unattractive one cent per word. Higher postal rates, higher paper costs, and continuing competition from the paperback science fiction market all added to the pressure on "Galaxy". These problems were not resolved by the sale to McCaffrey, who did not even have enough money to pay for circulation postage, with the result that not every "Galaxy" subscriber received a copy of the final issue. Frederik Pohl places the blame for "Galaxy" demise on Arnie Abramson, who, Pohl contends, "simply did not perform [the] basic functions of a publisher": paying the authors, ensuring subscribers received copies, and meeting other obligations.

In 1994, the magazine reappeared briefly as a semi-professional publication under the editorship of <a href="E.%20J.%20Gold">E. J. Gold</a>, son of H. L. Gold. E. J. Gold produced eight issues on a regular bimonthly schedule, starting with the January–February 1994 issue, and ending with March–April 1995.

Gold intended "Galaxy" to publish stories of sufficient literary quality to attract readers of the slick magazines, as well as those who came to "Galaxy" already familiar with genre science fiction. His editorial policy was broader than that of <a href="John%20W.%20Campbell%2C%20Jr.">John W. Campbell</a>, the editor of the leading magazine in the field, "<a href="Astounding%20Science%20Fiction">Astounding Science Fiction</a>": Gold was interested in sociology, psychology, and other "soft" sciences, and was also willing to publish humorous and satirical stories. Gold managed to persuade the publisher to let him offer three to four cents a word, which exceeded the highest rates paid in the field at that time. In addition to the high rates, "Galaxy" was an attractive market for writers because Gold bought only first magazine rights, unlike the other leading magazines. "Galaxy" was quickly established as one of the three leading science fiction magazines, along with Campbell's "Astounding" and "<a href="The%20Magazine%20of%20Fantasy%20and%20Science%20Fiction">The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction</a>" (usually abbreviated to "F&SF"). Campbell had been enormously influential over the previous decade, but the appearance of "Galaxy" and "F&SF", launched just a year before, marked the end of his dominance of the genre.

The cover for the first issue was by David Stone, depicting a scene from Simak's "Time Quarry". The image was muted, in contrast to the sensational art typically found on the covers of the sf pulps; the intention was that "Galaxy" should look like an sf magazine, but one "that you were not embarrassed to hold", in the words of Mike Ashley. The early artwork was generally unremarkable, though <a href="Ed%20Emshwiller">Ed Emshwiller</a>'s humorous cover for the June 1951 issue, his first professional sale as an artist, was a positive sign. "Emsh", as he was known to science fiction readers, soon became a regular contributor. The relatively expensive production processes that Gold had insisted on enabled more sophisticated internal artwork, which could be integrated with type in ways not possible with cheaper <a href="letterpress%20printing">letterpress printing</a>. 

On the rear cover of the first issue, Gold ran a feature called "You'll Never See It In "Galaxy"!", with two paragraphs side by side—one a parody of the introduction to a space western, the other the same story translated to become a true western, with spaceships replaced by horses. A sample: "He cut out his super-hyper-drive for the landing ... and at that point, a tall, lean spaceman stepped out of the tail assembly, proton gun-blaster in a space-tanned hand" became "He spurred hard for a low overhang of rimrock ... and at that point a tall, lean wrangler stepped out from behind a high boulder, six-shooter in a sun-tanned hand". The feature drew much attention, though <a href="James%20Blish">James Blish</a> commented that "Galaxy" did not always avoid printing the kind of fiction it parodied.

In the first issue, Gold asked for reader feedback on what should be included in the magazine—letters, editorials, book reviews, or other features. The response was against a letter column, but the readers wanted editorials, and short book reviews with recommendations that would help them identify what books to buy, as opposed to in-depth criticism. Gold was also concerned that harsh critical reviews would scare away new authors who might otherwise submit their work. Groff Conklin began a book review column, called ""Galaxy" Five Star Shelf", in the first issue; Floyd Gale took it over with the November 1955 issue—Gale was in fact Gold's brother, using a slightly modified surname. The inaugural issue also included a competition for readers to explain UFOs in under 200 words, the first of many contests Gold would run.

The first six issues contained stories by well-known authors, including some that became highly regarded such as Fritz Leiber's "Coming Attraction", <a href="Damon%20Knight">Damon Knight</a>'s "<a href="To%20Serve%20Man">To Serve Man</a>", and <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a>'s "The Fireman", later expanded as "<a href="Fahrenheit%20451">Fahrenheit 451</a>". Gold considered these early issues exploratory, and some of the material by major names was clearly lesser work. With its second volume, beginning in April 1951, "Galaxy" achieved consistently high quality, with virtually every issue featuring a story that would have a lasting reputation, including <a href="Cyril%20M.%20Kornbluth">C. M. Kornbluth</a>'s "<a href="The%20Marching%20Morons">The Marching Morons</a>", <a href="Wyman%20Guin">Wyman Guin</a>'s "Beyond Bedlam", and <a href="Robert%20Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>'s "<a href="The%20Puppet%20Masters">The Puppet Masters</a>", whose serialization overlapped volumes 2 and 3. Early feedback from readers had been opposed to serialized novels, but here Gold did not follow their opinion, and "Galaxy" is remembered for featuring some very successful serials. A contemporary anthology of science fiction stories, <a href="E.%20F.%20Bleiler">E. F. Bleiler</a> and <a href="T.%20E.%20Dikty">T. E. Dikty</a>'s "The Best Science Fiction Stories: 1951", commented in an editorial that Gold's work "will succeed in placing science-fiction on an equal basis with any other field of modern literature". With a circulation of over 100,000 in its second year, "Galaxy" surpassed "Astounding".

Gold maintained "Galaxy" high standards for most of the 1950s. <a href="Alfred%20Bester">Alfred Bester</a>'s "<a href="The%20Demolished%20Man">The Demolished Man</a>"—according to critic <a href="Peter%20Nicholls%20%28writer%29">Peter Nicholls</a>, "among the few genuine classics of genre sf"—was serialized in early 1952. Pohl and Kornbluth's "<a href="The%20Space%20Merchants">The Space Merchants</a>" followed a few months later, serialized as "Gravy Planet"; <a href="Brian%20Aldiss">Brian Aldiss</a>, in his critical genre study "Trillion Year Spree", calls it "one of the most famous books in SF". James Blish's "<a href="Surface%20Tension%20%28short%20story%29">Surface Tension</a>" and Theodore Sturgeon's "Baby is Three", both widely acclaimed, also appeared in 1952. Readers had expressed support for science articles, and in March 1952, Willy Ley, who had contributed occasional essays since the first issue, began a column, "For Your Information", in which he replied to readers' scientific questions. Running uninterrupted until Ley's death in 1969, Frederik Pohl describes it as "the most popular single feature "Galaxy" ever had". The <a href="Hugo%20Awards">Hugo Awards</a> were inaugurated the following year: "The Demolished Man" won the first <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Novel">Hugo for Best Novel</a> and "Galaxy" shared the first <a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Professional%20Magazine">Hugo for Best Magazine</a> with "Astounding".

Gold published a wide range of material, and "Galaxy" became known for irony and satire; the work of authors able to adopt the wry style he favored, such as Knight and <a href="Robert%20Sheckley">Robert Sheckley</a>, appeared regularly in the magazine and were obvious commentaries on contemporary society. In 1953, with <a href="McCarthyism">McCarthyism</a> at its height, Gold refused to publish "<a href="The%20Liberation%20of%20Earth">The Liberation of Earth</a>", a story by William Tenn satirizing both the Russian and American sides in the Korean War. Tenn quotes Gold, an ex-radical, as saying the idea made him "sweat green", though the year before he had published Isaac Asimov's "The Martian Way", a thinly veiled anti-<a href="Joseph%20McCarthy">McCarthy</a> story.

<a href="L.%20Sprague%20de%20Camp">L. Sprague de Camp</a> commented that Gold "sets an extremely high standard of literary excellence for his writers", and observed that he often demanded multiple revisions and rewrites. Gold was also infamous for making sweeping changes to the stories he printed. In meetings and in phone calls he became well known as a difficult editor whose determination to achieve perfection sometimes alienated his writers. He was unapologetic, declaring, "I worked hard with writers, and they didn't always enjoy it". The results were often very positive: some successful stories are said to have begun with an idea he provided to one of his authors. In the case of "The Demolished Man", his involvement extended almost to the point of collaboration. Gold was agoraphobic, and rarely left his apartment, but writers often visited him, and he held regular parties and weekly poker games; in addition to the members of the science fiction community, the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> composer <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a> often attended.

In March 1953 Gold announced a novel-writing contest, but it failed to attract any usable submissions. He asked Pohl and Kornbluth if they would be willing to allow him to print "Gladiator-at-Law", which they had just completed, under a pseudonym, so he could claim that the contest had found a new talent. They refused, but shortly afterwards Pohl and Lester del Rey agreed to let Gold take their recently completed novel "Preferred Risk" and publish it as the winner, under the pseudonym Edson McCann. Pohl and del Rey constructed a fake identity for McCann, but the news leaked out and Gold never ran another fiction competition. In July 1953, he launched a companion magazine, "<a href="Beyond%20Fantasy%20Fiction">Beyond Fantasy Fiction</a>", dedicated to fantasy material, which "Galaxy" editorial policy did not favor. It lasted for ten bimonthly issues, with the final one appearing in January 1955. After it failed, Gold opened "Galaxy" to more fantasy, publishing writers such as <a href="Cordwainer%20Smith">Cordwainer Smith</a>.

The <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> radio series "<a href="Tales%20of%20Tomorrow">Tales of Tomorrow</a>", which began in 1952 as an offshoot of the TV series of the same name, used stories from "Galaxy"; the connection was announced at the start of each of its fifteen episodes. On April 24, 1955, another radio series, <a href="NBC">NBC</a>'s "<a href="X%20Minus%20One">X Minus One</a>", started a much longer run of 125 episodes, lasting until January 1958. From February 1956 onwards the scripts were adapted exclusively from stories in "Galaxy", and from the April 1956 issue "Galaxy" ran advertisements for the series, which included work by Pohl, Sturgeon, and <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>.

Through the 1950s, "Galaxy" contributors routinely dominated the Hugo ballots, but neither the magazine nor the fiction it published won many awards, despite what sf historians <a href="Marshall%20Tymn">Marshall Tymn</a> and Mike Ashley describe as its "deserved reputation for excellence". After several years of being shut out of the Hugos, "Galaxy" published two works in 1958 that won the honor: Fritz Leiber's novel "<a href="The%20Big%20Time">The Big Time</a>" and <a href="Avram%20Davidson">Avram Davidson</a>'s short story "<a href="Or%20All%20the%20Seas%20with%20Oysters">Or All the Seas with Oysters</a>".

When Pohl took over as editor in 1961, he broadened the magazine's scope, including more fantasy material. Regular contributors in the 1960s included <a href="Jack%20Vance">Jack Vance</a>, <a href="Larry%20Niven">Larry Niven</a>, <a href="Frank%20Herbert">Frank Herbert</a>, <a href="Robert%20Silverberg">Robert Silverberg</a>, and Cordwainer Smith. "Galaxy" stories from this era that won awards include Vance's "The Dragon Masters" and "The Last Castle"; Clifford Simak's "Way Station", serialized as "Here Gather the Stars"; <a href="Harlan%20Ellison">Harlan Ellison</a>'s "'Repent, Harlequin,' Said the Ticktockman" and "The Beast That Shouted Love at the Heart of the World"; and Silverberg's "Nightwings". Pohl never succeeded in winning a Hugo Award as editor of "Galaxy", although he won the award three consecutive times from 1966 to 1968 as editor of "<a href="If%20%28magazine%29">If</a>", "Galaxy" sister magazine, and in theory the junior of the two publications.

The quality of fiction in "Galaxy" had dipped towards the end of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's difficult editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he would almost invariably buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in "Galaxy" throughout the 1960s.

In February 1965, Pohl brought in Algis Budrys as book reviewer, after a year in which no review column had appeared. Budrys's insightful reviews drew much praise, and editor David Hartwell has ranked him as one of the best sf critics of his generation.

The difference between Pohl's approach and Gold's was apparent in the editorials Pohl wrote, which were informal, entertaining, and rooted in his deep familiarity with the genre. With Pohl at the helm, "Galaxy" moved back toward the knowledgeable <a href="science%20fiction%20fandom">science fiction fan</a>, and away from the mainstream market that Gold had targeted. Pohl said that he tried to "cover the full spectrum of science fiction", however, unlike Gold's "specialist magazine" of the 1950s; his "Galaxy" published both Sheckley's "Mindswap" and Herbert's "<a href="Do%20I%20Wake%20or%20Dream%3F">Do I Wake or Dream?</a>" when Gold would not have purchased the latter, Pohl said.

Ejler Jakobsson's tenure began with a large backlog of stories that Pohl had acquired, but within a year or two substantial changes were apparent. In the early 1970s, Jakobsson attempted to update "Galaxy" image, adding a comic strip, "Sunpot", by <a href="Vaughn%20Bod%C3%A9">Vaughn Bodé</a>, for example. Theodore Sturgeon took over from Budrys as the regular book reviewer in January 1972 and held the post until mid-1975. Jakobsson did not manage to give "Galaxy" a new and distinctive character: "Sunpot" lasted only four issues, Sturgeon's reviews were undistinguished, and many of the new authors he published have been, in the words of Mike Ashley, "mercifully unknown ever since". The paper quality and printing quality also dropped, and early cover designs were very weak. Jakobsson initially printed guest editorials rather than writing his own; when he took over the editorial page his work was unremarkable. He managed to attract some of the new writers who were becoming well known in the sf scene, including <a href="George%20R.R.%20Martin">George R.R. Martin</a>, <a href="Joe%20Haldeman">Joe Haldeman</a>, and <a href="Joanna%20Russ">Joanna Russ</a>. Three novels published in Jakobsson's "Galaxy" won awards: Isaac Asimov's "<a href="The%20Gods%20Themselves">The Gods Themselves</a>" and <a href="Arthur%20C.%20Clarke">Arthur C. Clarke</a>'s "<a href="Rendezvous%20with%20Rama">Rendezvous with Rama</a>" each won both the Hugo and Nebula awards, in 1972 and 1973 respectively, and Robert Silverberg's "<a href="A%20Time%20of%20Changes">A Time of Changes</a>" won the Nebula in 1971. Sturgeon's short story "<a href="Slow%20Sculpture">Slow Sculpture</a>" won both the Hugo and the Nebula in 1970.

A letter column was added at the end of 1971; this was the first time "Galaxy" had published reader's letters. "Galaxy" long-time science columnist, Willy Ley, died in 1969, and was replaced by <a href="Donald%20Menzel">Donald Menzel</a>. He was replaced in turn by <a href="Jerry%20Pournelle">Jerry Pournelle</a> in April 1974.

Jakobsson's successor, James Baen, was able to publish some high-quality fiction, including material by <a href="Roger%20Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>, John Varley, Larry Niven, and Pohl, whose novel, "Gateway", won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. Baen raised the level of the magazine substantially, and Ashley refers to his editorship as "Galaxy" "Indian summer". Under Baen the review columnist was <a href="Spider%20Robinson">Spider Robinson</a>, who won a <a href="Locus%20Award">Locus Award</a> in 1977, primarily for his work in "Galaxy". Baen also published a series of essays by authors discussing their own work. Apart from "Gateway", Baen published only one award-winning story: <a href="Ursula%20K.%20Le%20Guin">Ursula K. Le Guin</a>'s "The Day Before the Revolution", which appeared in August 1974 and won the Nebula.

Baen's successors, Pierce, Stine, and Kemske, were unable to maintain his standard. Pohl remained loyal to the magazine, but the serialization of his novel "Jem" exemplified "Galaxy" growing problems. Due to the magazine's increasingly erratic schedule, the serialization stretched from the last issue of 1978 into 1980, well after it had appeared in book form. In November 1977, Paul Walker took over the book column from Spider Robinson, and Jerry Pournelle left the science column at the end of 1978. The artwork quality dropped to an amateurish level, and despite the appearance of a few successful stories and novels, such as <a href="C.%20J.%20Cherryh">C. J. Cherryh</a>'s "The Faded Sun: Kesrith", the overall quality was dramatically worse than it had been under Baen. "Galaxy" deterioration was largely due to the financial troubles of the publisher, Arnold Abramson, who reduced the pay rate (at a time of high inflation) to a penny a word. Even that low rate did not guarantee timely disbursement, and many writers stopped submitting because of "Galaxy" reputation for paying slowly, if at all. Costs were increasing for paper, postage, and production, and the paperback anthology market was booming, adding to the competition that "Galaxy" faced. Floyd Kemske's only issue never received newsstand distribution, doomed by the financial troubles of the magazine's publisher, Vincent McCaffrey.

"Galaxy" had a characteristic cover style in the 1950s with an inverted white "L" shape (Greek gamma) framing the cover art; this style was copied by several magazines, including "<a href="Authentic%20Science%20Fiction">Authentic Science Fiction</a>" and "<a href="Startling%20Stories">Startling Stories</a>". When "Astounding" followed suit in late 1951, Gold commented sarcastically in an editorial that "Galaxy" "would like to know when we may have it [the format] back again". The first variation came with the September 1956 issue, which widened the left hand strip of white to allow room to print story titles and author names. The December 1961 issue was the first to eliminate the strip on the left, and until July 1969 the magazine varied between this layout, the inverted "L", and a version with no white at all, first used on the August 1965 issue. Another change visible in that issue is the reversal of the title coloring to white lettering on a block of red; this was used from August 1963 to December 1965. In August 1969 the title was enlarged to fill the width of the magazine; this issue had the white inverted "L", but it was the last one to do so till 1980. After August 1969 the cover paintings spanned the entire cover, though with some minor variations in layout such as can be seen in the October 1976 issue. Then in September 1978 (undated on the cover, but numbered vol. 39 no. 7) the original typeface for "Galaxy" was abandoned for the last few issues. The final issue, edited by Kemske, returned to the previous layout and typeface, although with a magazine twice the size of the original digest. When E. J. Gold revived "Galaxy" in 1994, he restored the inverted "L" and employed a predominantly black-and-white look for the eight issues he published.

Notable artists who contributed regularly to "Galaxy" included Ed Emshwiller, who won several Hugo Awards for his work, Hugo nominee Wallace Wood, and Jack Gaughan, who won three Hugos in the late 1960s, partly for his work in "Galaxy". Gaughan was commissioned by Pohl to provide the cover and interior art for Jack Vance's "The Dragon Masters" in 1962; the resulting illustrations made Gaughan immediately famous in the science fiction field. In the 1950s and 1960s, "Galaxy" retained the original artwork sent in by its artists, though Emshwiller, much of whose best color work appeared there, was able to negotiate an exception to this rule, retaining the art for his portfolios. In 1972 much of this artwork—including both interior and cover illustrations—was sold off by Robert Guinn, who had kept it when he sold "Galaxy" to UPD in 1969.

Isaac Asimov, in his memoirs, recalled being deeply impressed by the first issue of "Galaxy", and that many fans, including himself, believed that the magazine became the field's leader almost immediately. In critic John Clute's assessment, "Galaxy" indeed swiftly supplanted "Astounding" and remained the leading magazine in the field until Pohl resigned as editor in 1969. Science fiction historian and critic Mike Ashley regarded "Galaxy" success as the main reason for the subsequent boom in science fiction magazines, commenting that it "revolutionized the field overnight". Under Gold "Galaxy" provided a market for social science fiction stories that might not have been accepted by "Astounding" and "Fantasy & Science Fiction", the other leading magazines. 

Pohl stated in 1965 that almost every major science fiction writer whose career began after 1950 primarily wrote for "Galaxy", and that others closely imitated Gold's magazine. He described "Galaxy" as where "the stunning new kinds of science fiction ... flowered, and changed everything in science fiction". In his opinion, Gold's innovation was to ask writers to consider not just new technology, but the subsequent impact of that technology on society. He adds, "What "Galaxy" brought to magazine science fiction was a kind of sophisticated intellectual subtlety. ... After "Galaxy" it was impossible to go on being naive." Science fiction author <a href="Brian%20Stableford">Brian Stableford</a> argues that "Galaxy" quickly usurped "Astounding"s position as "pioneer of hardcore sf's progress" because it "embraced and gleefully pursued a new series of challenges to moral orthodoxy."

SF historian David Kyle ascribes "Galaxy" influence specifically to Gold, saying that "of all the editors in and out of the post-war scene, the most influential beyond any doubt was H. L. Gold" and that the new direction he set led, "inevitably", to the <a href="New%20Wave%20%28science%20fiction%29">New Wave</a>, the celebrated science fiction literary movement of the 1960s. Kyle's assessment of Gold is echoed by writer <a href="Barry%20N.%20Malzberg">Barry N. Malzberg</a>, who calls Gold "perhaps the greatest editor in the history of all fields for the first half of his tenure". SF authors and historians Brian Aldiss and <a href="David%20Wingrove">David Wingrove</a> summarize "Galaxy" history by saying that it lasted for "thirty mainly glorious years": it "brought into the sunlight a number of excellent satirists, comedians and ironists" and, through the influence of its reduced focus on technology, played an important role in attracting women to write science fiction.

The list below, and the charts above, follow the mastheads in the magazines. Because of Gold's poor health, Pohl was acting as editor for some time before he officially took over the role at the end of 1961.

"Galaxy" had multiple foreign editions. This was in part because the original publisher, World Editions, had a European base, which Gold had planned to take advantage of when the magazine launched. Overseas editions included:

The following table shows which issues appeared from which publisher.

The title changed multiple times, and was frequently inconsistently given between the cover, spine, indicia, and masthead.
"Galaxy" remained a digest-sized magazine from the beginning until 1979; the very last issue was published in pulp format, as were the semi-professional issues produced by E. J. Gold. The page count began at 160; it dropped to 144 in January 1955, but went up to 192 in February 1959. In July 1969 the count went back down to 160; it returned to 192 pages with the August–September 1970 issue and stayed there till May–June 1971, when it dropped to 176. From June 1974 to June–July 1979 it was back at 160 pages, and then went to 128 pages for the final digest issue, September–October 1979. The single 1980 issue was 72 pages long. The eight issues published in the 1990s all had 96 pages, except the first, January–February 1994, which had 56 pages. The initial price was 25 cents. Price changes were as follows: 35 cents from May 1958; 50 cents from February 1959; 60 cents from December 1964; 75 cents from August–September 1970; $1.00 from April 1975; 79 cents for the August 1975 issue; 95 cents from September 1975; $1.00 from May 1976; $1.25 from June 1977, and $1.50 for the final professional issue in 1980.

Several anthologies of stories from "Galaxy" have been published. The following list does not include reprint editions though in some cases these varied in contents, as for example with the UK editions of some of the early volumes.

Two series of companion novels were issued by the publishers. The first series, "<a href="Galaxy%20Science%20Fiction%20Novels">Galaxy Science Fiction Novels</a>", began in 1950 with <a href="Eric%20Frank%20Russell">Eric Frank Russell</a>'s "Sinister Barrier"; seven titles were released by World Editions, and a further twenty-eight by Guinn's Galaxy Publishing Corporation. The books were initially in digest format but this was changed to a standard paperback format for the last four titles. In 1959 the line was sold to <a href="Beacon%20Books">Beacon Books</a>, which produced another 11 volumes. Beacon specialized in softcore pornography, and changed the titles of most of the books they published to be more suggestive. The last title, "Sin in Space" (originally "Outpost Mars"), by Cyril Judd (a pseudonym for Cyril Kornbluth and <a href="Judith%20Merril">Judith Merril</a>) appeared in 1961. Two years later a second series, Galaxy Magabooks, appeared; each of these consisted of two short novels, both by the same author, published in a single volume. Only three were released; the last, "And My Fear Is Great/Baby Is Three" by Theodore Sturgeon, appeared in 1964.

St Kilda, Scotland

St Kilda () is an isolated <a href="archipelago">archipelago</a> situated west-northwest of <a href="North%20Uist">North Uist</a>, in the North Atlantic Ocean. It contains the westernmost islands of the <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a> of Scotland. The largest island is <a href="Hirta">Hirta</a>, whose sea cliffs are the highest in the United Kingdom. Three other islands (<a href="D%C3%B9n%2C%20St%20Kilda">Dùn</a>, <a href="Soay%2C%20St%20Kilda">Soay</a> and <a href="Boreray%2C%20St%20Kilda">Boreray</a>) were also used for grazing and seabird hunting. The islands are administratively a part of the <a href="Comhairle%20nan%20Eilean%20Siar">Comhairle nan Eilean Siar</a> local authority area.

The origin of the name "St Kilda" is a matter of conjecture. The islands' human heritage includes numerous unique architectural features from the historic and prehistoric periods, although the earliest written records of island life date from the <a href="Scotland%20in%20the%20Late%20Middle%20Ages">Late Middle Ages</a>. The medieval village on Hirta was rebuilt in the 19th century, but illnesses brought by increased external contacts through tourism, and the upheaval of the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> contributed to the island's evacuation in 1930. The story of St Kilda has attracted artistic interpretations, including <a href="Michael%20Powell">Michael Powell</a>'s film "<a href="The%20Edge%20of%20the%20World">The Edge of the World</a>" and an opera.

Permanent habitation on the islands possibly extends back at least two millennia, the population probably never exceeding 180 (and certainly no more than 100 after 1851). The entire remaining population was <a href="Emergency%20evacuation">evacuated</a> from Hirta (the only inhabited island) in 1930. The islands house a unique form of stone structure known as cleitean. A <a href="cleit">cleit</a> is a stone storage hut or <a href="bothy">bothy</a>; whilst many are still to be found, they are slowly falling into disrepair. There are known to be 1,260 cleitean on <a href="Hirta">Hirta</a> and a further 170 on the other group islands. Currently, the only year-round residents are military personnel; a variety of conservation workers, volunteers and scientists spend time there in the summer months.

The entire archipelago is owned by the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Scotland">National Trust for Scotland</a>. It became one of <a href="World%20Heritage%20Sites%20in%20Scotland">Scotland</a>'s six <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>s in 1986, and is one of the few in the world to hold mixed status for both its natural and cultural qualities. Parties of volunteers work on the islands in the summer to restore the many ruined buildings that the native St Kildans left behind. They share the island with a small military base established in 1957.

Two different early sheep types have survived on these remote islands, the <a href="Soay%20sheep">Soay</a>, a <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> type, and the <a href="Boreray%20%28sheep%29">Boreray</a>, an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> type. The islands are a breeding ground for many important <a href="seabird">seabird</a> species including <a href="northern%20gannet">northern gannet</a>s, <a href="Atlantic%20puffin">Atlantic puffin</a>s, and <a href="northern%20fulmar">northern fulmar</a>s. The <a href="St%20Kilda%20wren">St Kilda wren</a> and <a href="St%20Kilda%20field%20mouse">St Kilda field mouse</a> are endemic <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>.

Various theories have been proposed for the origin of the name "Kilda", which dates from the late 16th century. No <a href="saint">saint</a> is known by the name. Haswell-Smith (2004) notes that the full name "St Kilda" first appears on a Dutch map dated 1666, and that it might have been derived from Norse "sunt kelda" ("sweet wellwater") or from a mistaken Dutch assumption that the spring "Tobar Childa" was dedicated to a saint. ("Tobar Childa" is a <a href="List%20of%20tautological%20place%20names">tautological placename</a>, consisting of the <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Scottish Gaelic</a> and <a href="Old%20Norse">Norse</a> words for "well", i.e., "well well"). <a href="Martin%20Martin">Martin Martin</a>, who visited in 1697, believed that the name "is taken from one Kilder, who lived here; and from him the large well Toubir-Kilda has also its name".
Maclean (1972) similarly suggests it comes from a corruption of the <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> name for the spring on Hirta, "Childa", and states that a 1588 map identifies the archipelago as "Kilda". He also speculates that it refers to the "<a href="Culdee">Culdee</a>s", <a href="anchorite">anchorite</a>s who might have brought Christianity to the island, or be a corruption of the Gaelic name for the main island of the group, since the islanders tended to pronounce "r" as "l", and thus habitually referred to the island as "Hilta." Steel (1988) adds weight to the idea, noting that the islanders pronounced the "H" with a "somewhat guttural quality", making the sound they used for "Hirta" "almost" "Kilta". Similarly, St Kilda speakers interviewed by the <a href="School%20of%20Scottish%20Studies">School of Scottish Studies</a> in the 1960s show individual speakers using t-initial forms, <a href="Lenition">leniting</a> to /h/, e.g. "ann an Tirte" () and "gu Hirte" ().

Maclean (1972) further suggests that the Dutch simply made a cartographical error, and confused Hirta with "Skildar", the old name for <a href="Haskeir">Haskeir</a> island much nearer the main <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Outer Hebrides</a> archipelago. Quine (2000) hypothesises that the name is derived from a series of cartographical errors, starting with the use of the Old <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>ic "Skildir" ("shields") and appearing as "Skildar" on a map by Nicholas de Nicolay (1583). This, so the hypothesis goes, was transcribed in error by Lucas J. Waghenaer in his 1592 charts without the trailing "r" and with a <a href="full%20stop">full stop</a> after the "S", creating "S.Kilda". This was in turn assumed to stand for a saint by others, creating the form that has been used for several centuries, "St Kilda".

The origin of "Hirta", which long pre-dates "St Kilda", is similarly open to interpretation. Martin (1703) avers that "Hirta is taken from the Irish "Ier", which in that language signifies west". Maclean offers several options, including an (unspecified) Celtic word meaning "gloom" or "death", or the Scots Gaelic "h-Iar-Tìr" ("westland"). Drawing on an Icelandic <a href="Icelanders%27%20sagas">saga</a> describing an early 13th-century voyage to Ireland that mentions a visit to the islands of "Hirtir", he speculates that the shape of Hirta resembles a <a href="stag">stag</a>, ("Hirtir" meaning "stags" in Norse). Steel (1998) quotes the view of Reverend Neil Mackenzie, who lived there from 1829 to 1844, that the name is derived from the Gaelic "Ì Àrd" ("high island"), and a further possibility that it is from the Norse "Hirt" ("shepherd"). In a similar vein, Murray (1966) speculates that the Norse "Hirðö", pronounced 'Hirtha' ("herd island"), could be the origin. All the names of and on the islands are fully discussed by Coates (1990).

It has been known for some time that St Kilda was continuously inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found to the east of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay "cleitean"—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.

The first written record of St Kilda may date from 1202 when an Icelandic cleric wrote of taking shelter on "the islands that are called Hirtir". Early reports mentioned finds of brooches, an iron sword and Danish coins, and the enduring Norse place names indicate a sustained Viking presence on Hirta, but the visible evidence has been lost. In the late 14th century <a href="John%20of%20Fordun">John of Fordun</a> referred to it as 'the isle of Irte ("insula de Irte"), which is agreed to be under the Circius and on the margins of the world'. The islands were historically part of the domain of the <a href="Clan%20MacLeod">MacLeods</a> of <a href="Harris%2C%20Outer%20Hebrides">Harris</a>, whose steward was responsible for the collection of rents in kind and other duties. The first detailed report of a visit to the islands dates from 1549, when <a href="Donald%20Monro%20%28Dean%29">Donald Munro</a> suggested that: "The inhabitants thereof ar simple poor people, scarce learnit in aney religion, but M’Cloyd of Herray, his stewart, or he quhom he deputs in sic office, sailes anes in the zear ther at midsummer, with some chaplaine to baptize bairnes ther."

Despite the chaplain's best efforts, the islanders' isolation and dependence on the bounty of the natural world meant their philosophy bore as much relationship to <a href="Druidism">Druidism</a> as it did to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> until the arrival of Rev. <a href="John%20MacDonald%20%28Gaelic%20Moderator%29">John MacDonald</a> in 1822. Macauley (1764) reported the existence of five druidic altars, including a large circle of stones fixed perpendicularly in the ground near the Stallir House on <a href="Boreray%2C%20St%20Kilda">Boreray</a>.

Coll MacDonald of <a href="Colonsay">Colonsay</a> raided Hirta in 1615, removing 30 sheep and a quantity of barley. Thereafter, the islands developed a reputation for abundance. At the time of Martin's visit in 1697 the population was 180 and the steward travelled with a "company" of up to 60 persons to which he "elected the most 'meagre' among his friends in the neighbouring islands, to that number and took them periodically to St. Kilda to enjoy the nourishing and plentiful, if primitive, fare of the island, and so be restored to their wonted health and strength."

Visiting ships in the 18th century brought <a href="cholera">cholera</a> and <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. In 1727, the loss of life was so high that too few residents remained to man the boats, and new families were brought in from <a href="Harris%2C%20Outer%20Hebrides">Harris</a> to replace them. By 1758 the population had risen to 88 and reached just under 100 by the end of the century. This figure remained fairly constant from the 18th century until 1851, when 36 islanders emigrated to Australia on board the "Priscilla", a loss from which the island never fully recovered. The emigration was in part a response to the <a href="laird">laird</a>'s closure of the church and <a href="manse">manse</a> for several years during the <a href="Disruption%20of%201843">Disruption</a> that created the <a href="Free%20Church%20of%20Scotland%20%281843-1900%29">Free Church of Scotland</a>.

A missionary called Alexander Buchan went to St Kilda in 1705, but despite his long stay, the idea of organised religion did not take hold. This changed when Rev. <a href="John%20MacDonald%20%28Gaelic%20Moderator%29">John MacDonald</a>, the "Apostle of the North", arrived in 1822. He set about his mission with zeal, preaching 13 lengthy sermons during his first 11 days. He returned regularly and raised funds on behalf of the St Kildans, although privately he was appalled by their lack of religious knowledge. The islanders took to him with enthusiasm and wept when he left for the last time eight years later. His successor, who arrived on 3 July 1830, was Rev. Neil Mackenzie, a resident <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> minister who greatly improved the conditions of the inhabitants. He reorganised island agriculture, was instrumental in the rebuilding of the village (see below) and supervised the building of a new church and manse. With help from the Gaelic School Society, MacKenzie and his wife introduced formal education to Hirta, beginning a daily school to teach reading, writing and arithmetic and a <a href="Sunday%20school">Sunday school</a> for religious education.

Mackenzie left in 1844, and although he had achieved a great deal, the weakness of the St Kildans' dependence on external authority was exposed in 1865 with the arrival of Rev. John Mackay. Despite their fondness for Mackenzie, who stayed in the Church of Scotland, the St Kildans "came out" in favour of the new Free Church during the Disruption. Mackay, the new Free Church minister, placed an uncommon emphasis on religious observance. He introduced a routine of three two-to-three-hour services on Sunday at which attendance was effectively compulsory. One visitor noted in 1875 that: "The Sabbath was a day of intolerable gloom. At the clink of the bell the whole flock hurry to Church with sorrowful looks and eyes bent upon the ground. It is considered sinful to look to the right or to the left." 

Time spent in religious gatherings interfered seriously with the practical routines of the island. Old ladies and children who made noise in church were lectured at length and warned of dire punishments in the afterworld. During a period of food shortages on the island, a relief vessel arrived on a Saturday, but the minister said that the islanders had to spend the day preparing for church on the Sabbath, and it was Monday before supplies were landed. Children were forbidden to play games and required to carry a Bible wherever they went. Mackay remained minister on St Kilda for 24 years.

Most modern commentators feel that the predominant theme of life on St Kilda was isolation. When <a href="Martin%20Martin">Martin Martin</a> visited the islands in 1697, the only means of making the journey was by open boat, which could take several days and nights of rowing and sailing across the ocean and was next to impossible in autumn and winter. According to a St Kilda diarist writing in 1908, vicious storms could be expected at any time between September and March. More modern records from the National Trust for Scotland record gales for 75 days a year with peak winds around whilst peak wave heights on the Scottish west coast have been recorded at 16m.

Separated by distance and weather, the natives knew little of mainland and international politics. After the <a href="Battle%20of%20Culloden">Battle of Culloden</a> in 1746, it was rumoured that <a href="Prince%20Charles%20Edward%20Stuart">Prince Charles Edward Stuart</a> and some of his senior <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> aides had escaped to St Kilda. An expedition was launched, and in due course British soldiers were ferried ashore to Hirta. They found a deserted village, as the St Kildans, fearing pirates, had fled to caves to the west. When the St Kildans were persuaded to come down, the soldiers discovered that the isolated natives knew nothing of the prince and had never heard of <a href="George%20II%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George II</a> either.

Even in the late 19th century, the islanders could communicate with the rest of the world only by lighting a bonfire on the summit of Conachair which would, weather permitting, be visible to those on the isles of Harris and the Uists, or by using the "St Kilda mailboat". This was the invention of <a href="John%20Sands%20%28journalist%29">John Sands</a>, who visited in 1877. During his stay, a shipwreck left nine Austrian sailors marooned there, and by February supplies were running low. Sands attached a message to a <a href="lifebuoy">lifebuoy</a> salvaged from the "Peti Dubrovacki" and threw it into the sea. Nine days later it was picked up in <a href="Birsay">Birsay</a>, Orkney, and a rescue was arranged. The St Kildans, building on this idea, would fashion a piece of wood into the shape of a boat, attach it to a bladder made of sheepskin, and place in it a small bottle or tin containing a message. Launched when the wind came from the north-west, two-thirds of the messages were later found on the west coast of Scotland or, less conveniently, in Norway.
Another significant feature of St Kildan life was the diet. The islanders kept sheep and a few cattle and were able to grow a limited amount of food crops such as <a href="barley">barley</a> and <a href="potatoes">potatoes</a> on the better-drained land in Village Bay; in many ways the islands can be seen as a large mixed farm. <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Samuel Johnson</a> reported that in the 18th century <a href="Domestic%20sheep%23As%20food">sheep's milk</a> was made "into small cheeses" by the St Kildans. They generally eschewed fishing because of the heavy seas and unpredictable weather. The mainstay of their food supplies was the profusion of island birds, especially <a href="gannet">gannet</a> and <a href="fulmar">fulmar</a>. These they harvested as eggs and young birds and ate both fresh and cured. Adult puffins were also caught by the use of <a href="fowling">fowling</a> rods. A 1764 census described a daily consumption for each of the 90 inhabitants at the same of "36 wild fouls eggs and 18 fouls" (i.e. seabirds).

This feature of island life came at a price. When <a href="Henry%20Brougham%2C%201st%20Baron%20Brougham%20and%20Vaux">Henry Brougham</a> visited in 1799 he noted that "the air is infected by a stench almost insupportable – a compound of rotten fish, filth of all sorts and stinking seafowl". An excavation of the "Taigh an t-Sithiche" (the "house of the faeries" – see below) in 1877 by Sands unearthed the remains of gannet, sheep, cattle and limpets amidst various stone tools. The building is between 1,700 and 2,500 years old, which suggests that the St Kildan diet had changed little over the millennia. Indeed, the tools were recognised by the St Kildans, who could put names to them as similar devices were still in use.

These fowling activities involved considerable skills in climbing, especially on the precipitous sea stacks. An important island tradition involved the 'Mistress Stone', a door-shaped opening in the rocks north-west of Ruival over-hanging a gully. Young men of the island had to undertake a ritual there to prove themselves on the crags and worthy of taking a wife. Martin Martin wrote:

Another important aspect of St Kildan life was the daily "parliament". This was a meeting held in the street every morning after prayers and attended by all the adult males during the course of which they would decide upon the day's activities. No one led the meeting, and all men had the right to speak. According to Steel (1988), "Discussion frequently spread discord, but never in recorded history were feuds so bitter as to bring about a permanent division in the community". This notion of a free society influenced <a href="Enric%20Miralles">Enric Miralles</a>' vision for the new <a href="Scottish%20Parliament%20Building">Scottish Parliament Building</a>, opened in October 2004.

Whatever the privations, the St Kildans were fortunate in some respects, for their isolation spared them some of the evils of life elsewhere. Martin noted in 1697 that the citizens seemed "happier than the generality of mankind as being almost the only people in the world who feel the sweetness of true liberty", and in the 19th century their health and well being was contrasted favourably with conditions elsewhere in the <a href="Hebrides">Hebrides</a>. Theirs was not a utopian society; the islanders had ingenious wooden locks for their property, and financial penalties were exacted for misdemeanours. Nonetheless, no resident St Kildan is known to have fought in a war, and in four centuries of history, no serious crime committed by an islander was recorded there.

In 1898 and again in 1899 <a href="Norman%20Heathcote">Norman Heathcote</a> visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of <a href="Tweed%20%28cloth%29">tweeds</a> and birds' eggs but at the expense of their <a href="self-esteem">self-esteem</a> as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. "For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially "<a href="Neonatal%20tetanus">tetanus infantum</a>", which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The "cnatan na gall" or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.

By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native <a href="Scottish%20Gaelic%20language">Scottish Gaelic</a>. Improved <a href="midwifery">midwifery</a> skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of <a href="childhood%20tetanus">childhood tetanus</a>. From the 1880s, <a href="Commercial%20trawler">trawlers</a> fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

Early in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a>, the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> erected a <a href="Transmitter%20station">signal station</a> on Hirta, and the first daily communications with the mainland were established. In a belated response, the German submarine <a href="SM%20U-90">SM U-90</a> arrived in Village Bay on the morning of 15 May 1918 and, after issuing a warning, started shelling the island. Seventy-two shells were fired, and the wireless station was destroyed. The manse, church, and jetty storehouse were damaged, but there was no loss of life. One eyewitness recalled: "It wasn't what you would call a bad submarine because it could have blowed every house down because they were all in a row there. He only wanted Admiralty property. One lamb was killed... all the cattle ran from one side of the island to the other when they heard the shots."

As a result of this attack, a <a href="QF%204%20inch%20naval%20gun%20Mk%20I%20-%20III">4-inch Mark III QF gun</a> was erected on a promontory overlooking Village Bay, but it never saw action against the enemy. Of greater long-term significance to the islanders were the introduction of regular contact with the outside world and the slow development of a money-based economy. This made life easier for the St Kildans but also made them less self-reliant. Both were factors in the evacuation of the island little more than a decade later.

Numerous factors led to the evacuation of St Kilda. The islands' inhabitants had existed for centuries in relative isolation until tourism and the presence of the military during the First World War led the islanders to seek alternatives to privations they routinely suffered. The changes made to the island by visitors in the nineteenth century disconnected the islanders from the way of life that had allowed their forebears to survive in this unique environment. Despite construction of a small jetty in 1902, the islands remained at the weather's mercy.

After the War, most of the young men left the island, and the population fell from 73 in 1920 to 37 in 1928. After the death of four men from <a href="influenza">influenza</a> in 1926, there was a succession of crop failures in the 1920s. Investigations by the <a href="University%20of%20Aberdeen">University of Aberdeen</a> into the soil where crops had been grown have shown that there had been contamination by <a href="lead">lead</a> and other pollutants, caused by the use of seabird carcasses and peat ash in the manure used on the fields. This occurred over a lengthy period of time, as manuring practices became more intensive, and may have been a factor in the evacuation. The last straw came with the death of a young woman, Mary Gillies, who fell ill with <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a> in January 1930 and was taken to the mainland for treatment. She later died in hospital. For many years it was assumed that she had died of appendicitis, but her son Norman John Gillies discovered in 1991 that she had in fact died of pneumonia, having given birth to a daughter who also died. All the cattle and sheep were taken off the island two days before the evacuation by the tourist boat, "Dunara Castle", for sale on the mainland. However, all the island's working dogs were drowned in the bay because they could not be taken. On 29 August 1930, a ship called "Harebell" took the remaining 36 inhabitants to <a href="Morvern">Morvern</a> on the Scottish mainland, a decision they took collectively themselves. 

The morning of the evacuation promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. The sky was hopelessly blue and the sight of Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7 am boarded the "Harebell". Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.
The last of the native St Kildans, Rachel Johnson, died in April 2016 at the age of 93, having been evacuated at the age of 8.

In 1931, the islands' laird, <a href="Reginald%20MacLeod%20of%20MacLeod">Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod</a>, sold them to <a href="John%20Crichton-Stuart%2C%205th%20Marquess%20of%20Bute">Lord Dumfries</a>, who later became the 5th <a href="Marquess%20of%20Bute">Marquess of Bute</a>. For the next 26 years they saw few people, save for the occasional summer visitors or a returning St Kildan family.

The islands saw no military activity during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, remaining uninhabited, but three aircraft crash sites remain from that period. A <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Beaufighter</a> LX798 based at Port Ellen on <a href="Islay">Islay</a> crashed into Conachair within of the summit on the night of 3–4 June 1943. A year later, just before midnight on 7 June 1944, the day after <a href="Normandy%20Landings">D-Day</a>, a <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Sunderland</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> ML858 was wrecked at the head of Gleann Mòr. A small plaque in the church is dedicated to those who died in this accident. A <a href="Vickers%20Wellington">Wellington</a> <a href="bomber">bomber</a> crashed on the south coast of Soay in 1942 or 1943. Not until 1978 was any formal attempt made to investigate the wreck, and its identity has not been absolutely determined. Amongst the wreckage, a <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a> cap badge was discovered, which suggests it may have been HX448 of 7 OTU which went missing on a navigation exercise on 28 September 1942. Alternatively, it has been suggested that the Wellington is LA995 of 303 FTU which was lost on 23 February 1943.

In 1955 the British government decided to incorporate St Kilda into a missile tracking range based in <a href="Benbecula">Benbecula</a>, where test firings and flights are carried out. Thus in 1957 St Kilda became permanently inhabited once again. A variety of military buildings and masts have since been erected, including a canteen (which is not open to the public), the Puff Inn. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Defence</a> (MOD) leases St Kilda from the National Trust for Scotland for a nominal fee.

The main island of Hirta is still occupied year-round by a small number of civilians employed by defence contractor <a href="QinetiQ">QinetiQ</a> working in the military base (<a href="Deep%20Sea%20Range">Deep Sea Range</a>) on a monthly rotation. In 2009 the MoD announced that it was considering closing down its missile testing ranges in the Western Isles, potentially leaving the Hirta base unmanned.

In 2015 the base had to be temporarily evacuated due to adverse weather conditions.

By 2018, plans to rebuild the MoD base were underway and, with no permanent population, the number of people living on the island could vary between 20 and 70, including MoD employees, <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Scotland">National Trust for Scotland</a> employees, and several scientists working on a research project involving <a href="Soay%20sheep">Soay sheep</a>.

The oldest structures on St Kilda are the most enigmatic. Large <a href="sheepfold">sheepfold</a>s lie inland from the existing village at "An Lag Bho'n Tuath" (English: the hollow in the north) and contain curious 'boat-shaped' stone rings, or 'settings'. Soil samples suggest a date of 1850 BC, but they are unique to St Kilda, and their purpose is unknown. In Gleann Mòr, (north-west of Village Bay beyond Hirta's central ridge), there are 20 'horned structures', essentially ruined buildings with a main court measuring about , two or more smaller cells and a forecourt formed by two curved or horn-shaped walls. Again, nothing like them exists anywhere else in Britain or Europe, and their original use is unknown. Also in Gleann Mòr is "Taigh na Banaghaisgeich", the 'Amazon's House'. As Martin (1703) reported, many St Kilda tales are told about this female warrior.
This Amazon is famous in their traditions: her house or dairy of stone is yet extant; some of the inhabitants dwell in it all summer, though it be some hundred years old; the whole is built of stone, without any wood, lime, earth, or mortar to cement it, and is built in form of a circle pyramid-wise towards the top, having a vent in it, the fire being always in the centre of the floor; the stones are long and thin, which supplies the defect of wood; the body of this house contains not above nine persons sitting; there are three beds or low vaults that go off the side of the wall, a pillar betwixt each bed, which contains five men apiece; at the entry to one of these low vaults is a stone standing upon one end fix’d; upon this they say she ordinarily laid her helmet; there are two stones on the other side, upon which she is reported to have laid her sword: she is said to have been much addicted to hunting, and that in her time all the space betwixt this isle and that of Harries, was one continued tract of dry land.
Similar stories of a female warrior who hunted the now submerged land between the Outer Hebrides and St Kilda are reported from <a href="Harris%2C%20Outer%20Hebrides">Harris</a>. The structure's forecourt is akin to the other 'horned structures' in the immediate area, but like Martin's "Amazon" its original purpose is the stuff of legend rather than archaeological fact.

Much more is known of the hundreds of unique <a href="Cleit">"cleitean"</a> that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, <a href="Food%20grain">grain</a>, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact "cleitean" remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into the front wall, which may date from the 7th century.

A medieval village lay near Tobar Childa, about from the shore, at the foot of the slopes of Conachair. The oldest building is an underground passage with two small annexes called "Taigh an t-Sithiche" (house of the faeries) which dates to between 500 BC and 300 AD. The St Kildans believed it was a house or hiding place, although a more recent theory suggests that it was an <a href="Ice%20house%20%28building%29">ice house</a>.

Extensive ruins of field walls and "cleitean" and the remnants of a <a href="medieval">medieval</a> 'house' with a beehive-shaped annexe remain. Nearby is the 'Bull's House', a roofless rectangular structure in which the island's bull was kept during winter. Tobar Childa itself is supplied by two springs that lie just outside the Head Wall that was constructed around the Village to prevent sheep and cattle gaining access to the cultivated areas within its boundary. There were 25 to 30 houses altogether. Most were <a href="blackhouse">blackhouse</a>s of typical Hebridean design, but some older buildings were made of corbelled stone and turfed rather than thatched. The turf was used to prevent ingress of wind and rain, and the older "beehive" buildings resembled green hillocks rather than dwellings.

The Head Wall was built in 1834 when the medieval village was abandoned and a new one planned between Tobar Childa and the sea some 700 feet (200 m) down the slope. This came about as the result of a visit by <a href="Sir%20Thomas%20Dyke%20Acland%2C%2010th%20Baronet">Sir Thomas Dyke Ackland</a>, one of the <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">members of parliament</a> for <a href="Devon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Devon</a>. Appalled by the primitive conditions, he gave money for the building of a completely new settlement of thirty new <a href="blackhouse">blackhouse</a>s. These houses were made of <a href="dry%20stone">dry stone</a>, had thick walls, and were roofed with turf. Each typically had only one tiny window and a small opening for letting out smoke from the peat fire that burnt in the middle of the room. As a result, the interiors were blackened by soot. The cattle occupied one end of the house in winter, and once a year the straw from the floor was stripped out and spread on the ground. In October 1860, several of the new dwellings were damaged by a severe gale, and repairs were sufficient only to make them suitable for use as <a href="byre">byre</a>s. According to <a href="Alasdair%20Alpin%20MacGregor">Alasdair MacGregor</a>'s analysis of the settlement, the sixteen modern, zinc-roofed cottages amidst the black houses and new <a href="Factor%20%28Scotland%29">Factor's</a> house seen in most photographs of the native islanders were constructed around 1862.
One of the more poignant ruins on Hirta is the site of 'Lady Grange's House'. <a href="Rachel%20Chiesley%2C%20Lady%20Grange">Lady Grange</a> had been married to the <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> sympathiser <a href="James%20Erskine%2C%20Lord%20Grange">James Erskine, Lord Grange</a>, for 25 years when he decided that she might have overheard too many of his treasonable plottings. He had her kidnapped and secretly confined in <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> for six months. From there she was sent to the <a href="Monach%20Isles">Monach Isles</a>, where she lived in isolation for two years. She was then taken to Hirta from 1734 to 1740, which she described as "a vile neasty, stinking poor isle". After a failed rescue attempt, she was removed on her husband's orders to the <a href="Isle%20of%20Skye">Isle of Skye</a>, where she died. The "house" on Hirta which carries her name is a large <a href="cleit">cleit</a> in the Village meadows.

<a href="James%20Boswell">Boswell</a> and <a href="Samuel%20Johnson">Johnson</a> discussed the subject during their 1773 tour of the Hebrides. Boswell wrote: "After dinner to-day, we talked of the extraordinary fact of Lady Grange’s being sent to St Kilda, and confined there for several years, without any means of relief. Dr Johnson said, if M’Leod would let it be known that he had such a place for naughty ladies, he might make it a very profitable island."
In the 1860s unsuccessful attempts were made to improve the landing area by blasting rocks. A small <a href="jetty">jetty</a> was erected in 1877, but it was washed away in a storm two years later. In 1883 representations to the <a href="Napier%20Commission">Napier Commission</a> suggested the building of a replacement, but it was 1901 before the <a href="Congested%20Districts%20Board%20%28Scotland%29">Congested Districts Board</a> provided an engineer to enable one to be completed the following year. Nearby on the shore line are some huge boulders which were known throughout the <a href="Highlands%20and%20Islands">Highlands and Islands</a> in the 19th century as "Doirneagan Hirt", Hirta's pebbles.

At one time, three churches stood on Hirta. Christ Church, in the site of the graveyard at the centre of the village, was in use in 1697 and was the largest, but this thatched-roof structure was too small to hold the entire population, and most of the congregation had to gather in the churchyard during services. St Brendan's Church lay over a kilometre away on the slopes of Ruival, and St Columba's at the west end of the village street, but little is left of these buildings. A new <a href="kirk">kirk</a> and <a href="rectory">manse</a> were erected at the east end of the village in 1830 and a <a href="Factor%20%28Scotland%29">Factor's</a> house in 1860.

<a href="D%C3%B9n%2C%20St%20Kilda">Dùn</a> means "fort", and there is but a single ruined wall of a structure said to have been built in the far-distant past by the <a href="Fir%20Bolg">Fir Bolg</a>. The only "habitation" is "Sean Taigh" (old house), a natural cavern sometimes used as a shelter by the St Kildans when they were tending the sheep or catching birds.

Soay has a primitive hut known as "Taigh Dugan" (Dugan's house). This is little more than an excavated hole under a huge stone with two rude walls on the sides. The story of its creation relates to two sheep-stealing brothers from <a href="Isle%20of%20Lewis">Lewis</a> who came to St Kilda only to cause further trouble. Dugan was exiled to Soay, where he died; the other, called Fearchar Mòr, was sent to Stac an Armin, where he found life so intolerable he cast himself into the sea.

Boreray boasts the "Cleitean MacPhàidein", a "cleit village" of three small bothies used on a regular basis during fowling expeditions. Here too are the ruins of "Taigh Stallar" (the steward's house), which was similar to the Amazon's house in Gleann Mòr although somewhat larger, and which had six bed spaces. The local tradition was that it was built by the "Man of the Rocks", who led a rebellion against the landlord's steward. It may be an example of an <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a> <a href="wheelhouse%20%28archaeology%29">wheelhouse</a> and the associated remains of an agricultural field system were discovered in 2011. As a result of a smallpox outbreak on Hirta in 1724, three men and eight boys were marooned on Boreray until the following May. No fewer than 78 storage "cleitean" exist on <a href="Stac%20an%20Armin">Stac an Armin</a> and a small <a href="bothy">bothy</a>. A small bothy exists on the precipitous <a href="Stac%20Lee">Stac Lee</a> too, also used by fowlers.

The islands are composed of <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> <a href="igneous">igneous</a> formations of <a href="granites">granites</a> and <a href="gabbro">gabbro</a>, heavily weathered by the elements. The archipelago represents the remnants of a long-extinct ring volcano rising from a seabed plateau approximately below sea level.

At in extent, <a href="Hirta">Hirta</a> is the largest island in the group and comprises more than 78% of the land area of the archipelago. Next in size are Soay (English: "sheep island") at and Boreray ('the fortified isle'), which measures . Soay is north-west of Hirta, Boreray 6 kilometres (4 mi) to the northeast. Smaller <a href="islet">islet</a>s and <a href="Stack%20%28geology%29">stacks</a> in the group include <a href="Stac%20an%20Armin">Stac an Armin</a> ('warrior's stack'), <a href="Stac%20Lee">Stac Lee</a> ('grey stack') and <a href="Stac%20Levenish">Stac Levenish</a> ('stream' or 'torrent'). The island of Dùn ('fort'), which protects Village Bay from the prevailing southwesterly winds, was at one time joined to Hirta by a natural arch. MacLean (1972) suggests that the arch was broken when struck by a <a href="galleon">galleon</a> fleeing the defeat of the <a href="Spanish%20Armada">Spanish Armada</a>, but other sources, such as Mitchell (1992) and Fleming (2005), suggest that the arch was simply swept away by one of the many fierce storms that batter the islands every winter.

The highest point in the archipelago, Conachair ('the beacon') at , is on Hirta, immediately north of the village. In the southeast is Oiseval ('east fell'), which reaches , and Mullach Mòr ('big hill summit') 361 metres (1,185 ft) is due west of Conachair. Ruival ('red fell') and Mullach Bi ('pillar summit') dominate the western cliffs. Boreray reaches and Soay . The extraordinary Stac an Armin reaches , and Stac Lee, , making them the highest <a href="sea%20stack">sea stack</a>s in Britain.
In modern times, St Kilda's only settlement was at Village Bay ( or ) on Hirta. Gleann Mòr on the north coast of Hirta and Boreray also contain the remains of earlier habitations. The sea approach to Hirta into Village Bay suggests a small settlement flanked by high rolling hills in a semicircle behind it. This is misleading. The whole north face of Conachair is a vertical cliff up to high, falling sheer into the sea and constituting the highest sea cliff in the UK.

The archipelago is the site of many of the most spectacular sea cliffs in the British Isles. Baxter and Crumley (1988) suggest that St Kilda: "...is a mad, imperfect God's hoard of all unnecessary lavish landscape luxuries he ever devised in his madness. These he has scattered at random in Atlantic isolation 100 miles from the corrupting influences of the mainland, 40 miles west of the westmost Western Isles. He has kept for himself only the best pieces and woven around them a plot as evidence of his madness."

Although from the nearest land, St Kilda is visible from as far as the summit ridges of the <a href="Skye">Skye</a> <a href="Cuillin">Cuillin</a>, some distant. The climate is oceanic with high rainfall, , and high humidity. Temperatures are generally cool, averaging in January and in July. The prevailing winds, especially strong in winter, are southerly and southwesterly. Wind speeds average approximately 85 percent of the time and more than more than 30 percent of the time. Gale-force winds occur less than 2 percent of the time in any one year, but gusts of and more occur regularly on the high tops, and speeds of have occasionally been recorded near sea level. The tidal range is , and ocean swells of frequently occur, which can make landings difficult or impossible at any time of year. The oceanic location protects the islands from snow, which lies for only about a dozen days per year.

The archipelago's remote location and oceanic climate are matched in the UK only by a few smaller outlying islands such as the <a href="Flannan%20Isles">Flannan Isles</a>, <a href="North%20Rona">North Rona</a>, <a href="Sula%20Sgeir">Sula Sgeir</a>, and the <a href="Barra%20Isles">Bishop's Isles</a> at the southern edge of the Outer Hebrides. Administratively, St Kilda was part of the <a href="List%20of%20civil%20parishes%20in%20Scotland">parish</a> of <a href="Harris%2C%20Outer%20Hebrides">Harris</a> in the traditional county of <a href="Inverness-shire">Inverness-shire</a>. Today it is incorporated in the <a href="Comhairle%20nan%20Eilean%20Siar">Comhairle nan Eilean Siar</a> (Western Isles) <a href="unitary%20authority">unitary authority</a>.

On the inaccessible island of Soay are sheep of a unique type, which lived as <a href="feral">feral</a> animals and belonged to the owner of the islands, not to the islanders. These <a href="Soay%20sheep">Soay sheep</a> are believed to be remnants of the earliest sheep kept in Europe in the <a href="Neolithic%20Era">Neolithic Era</a>, and are small, short-tailed, usually brown with white bellies, and have naturally <a href="moulting">moulting</a> fleeces. About 200 Soay sheep remain on Soay itself, and soon after the evacuation a second feral population of them was established on Hirta, which at that time had no sheep; these now number between 600 and 1,700. A few Soays have been exported to form breeding populations in other parts of the world, where they are valued for their hardiness, small size and unusual appearance. On Hirta and Soay, the sheep prefer the "<a href="Plantago">Plantago</a>" pastures, which grow well in locations exposed to <a href="sea%20spray">sea spray</a> and include red fescue ("<a href="Festuca%20rubra">Festuca rubra</a>"), sea plantain ("<a href="Plantago%20maritima">Plantago maritima</a>") and sea pink ("<a href="Armeria%20maritima">Armeria maritima</a>").

The St Kildans kept up to 2,000 of a different type of sheep on the islands of Hirta and Boreray. These were a Hebridean variety of the <a href="Scottish%20Dunface">Scottish Dunface</a>, a primitive sheep probably similar to those kept throughout Britain during the <a href="Iron%20Age">Iron Age</a>. At the time of the evacuation all the islanders' sheep were removed from Hirta, but those on Boreray were left to become feral, and these are now regarded as a breed in their own right, the <a href="Boreray%20%28sheep%29">Boreray</a>. The Boreray is one of the rarest British sheep, and is one of the few remaining descendants of the Dunface (although some <a href="Scottish%20Blackface">Scottish Blackface</a> blood was introduced in the nineteenth century).

St Kilda is a breeding ground for many important <a href="seabird">seabird</a> species. One of the world's largest colonies of <a href="northern%20gannet">northern gannet</a>s, totalling 30,000 pairs, amount to 24 percent of the global population. There are 49,000 breeding pairs of <a href="Leach%27s%20storm-petrel">Leach's petrels</a>, up to 90 percent of the European population; 136,000 pairs of <a href="Atlantic%20puffin">Atlantic puffin</a>s, about 30 percent of the UK total breeding population, and 67,000 <a href="northern%20fulmar">northern fulmar</a> pairs, about 13 percent of the UK total. Dùn is home to the largest colony of <a href="fulmars">fulmars</a> in <a href="UK">Britain</a>. Prior to 1828, St Kilda was their only UK breeding ground, but they have since spread and established colonies elsewhere, such as <a href="Fowlsheugh">Fowlsheugh</a>. The last <a href="great%20auk">great auk</a> ("Pinguinus impennis") seen in Britain was killed on Stac an Armin in July 1840. Unusual behaviour by St Kilda's <a href="great%20skua">bonxies</a> was recorded in 2007 during research into recent falls in the Leach's petrel population. Using night vision gear, ecologists observed the skuas hunting petrels at night, a remarkable strategy for a seabird.

Two wild animal taxa are unique to St Kilda: the <a href="St%20Kilda%20wren">St Kilda wren</a> ("Troglodytes troglodytes hirtensis"), which is a subspecies of the <a href="troglodytes%20troglodytes">Eurasian wren</a>, and a subspecies of <a href="wood%20mouse">wood mouse</a> known as the <a href="St%20Kilda%20field%20mouse">St Kilda field mouse</a> ("Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis"). A third taxon <a href="Endemism">endemic</a> to St Kilda, a subspecies of <a href="house%20mouse">house mouse</a> known as the <a href="St%20Kilda%20house%20mouse">St Kilda house mouse</a> ("Mus musculus muralis"), vanished completely after the departure of human inhabitants, as it was strictly associated with settlements and buildings. It had a number of traits in common with a sub-species ("Mus musculus mykinessiensis") found on <a href="Mykines%2C%20Faroe%20Islands">Mykines</a> island in the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>. The <a href="gray%20seal">grey seal</a> ("Halichoerus grypus") now breeds on Hirta but did not do so before the 1930 evacuation.

The <a href="St%20Kilda%20dandelion">St Kilda dandelion</a> ("Taraxacum pankhurstianum") is an endemic species of <a href="Taraxacum">dandelion</a>, identified in 2012.

The archipelago's isolation has resulted in a lack of <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>. The most successful <a href="Insect%20migration">colonists</a> with nearly two hundred species are the <a href="fly">flies</a> followed by <a href="beetle">beetle</a>s with approximately 140 species. There are no <a href="bee">bee</a>s on the islands so the flies are probably important <a href="pollinator">pollinator</a>s of plants. One beetle, the rare and endangered <a href="weevil">weevil</a>, "<a href="Ceutorhynchus%20insularis">Ceutorhynchus insularis</a>", is known from only <a href="D%C3%B9n%2C%20St%20Kilda">Dùn</a> and the <a href="Vestmannaeyjar">Westmann Islands</a>, an archipelago off the south-west coast of <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. Less than one hundred species of <a href="butterfly">butterfly</a> and <a href="moth">moth</a> occur, compared to 367 recorded on the <a href="Outer%20Hebrides">Western Isles</a>. <a href="Vanessa%20atalanta">Red admiral</a> ("Vanessa atalanta") and <a href="Vanessa%20cardui">painted lady</a> ("Vanessa cardui") are two of only seven species of butterflies, both well known and common <a href="Lepidoptera%20migration">migrants</a>. Common summer moths are the <a href="Cerapteryx%20graminis">antler</a> ("Cerapteryx graminis"), <a href="dark%20arches">dark arches</a> ("Apamea monoglypha") and the migrant <a href="silver%20Y">silver Y</a> ("Autographa gamma"). One unusual moth recorded is the <a href="Idaea%20rusticata">least carpet</a> ("Idaea rusticata"), an occasional migrant, and in the UK, usually recorded in the south-east of England. On 4 September 2014 a rare <a href="Vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrant</a> <a href="oleander%20hawk-moth">oleander hawk-moth</a> ("Daphnis nerii") was recorded. Oleander is not found in the UK every year, and the larva have never been recorded in the Britain.

Plant life is heavily influenced by the salt spray, strong winds and acidic <a href="peat">peat</a>y soils. No trees grow on the archipelago, although there are more than 130 different flowering plants, 162 species of <a href="fungi">fungi</a> and 160 <a href="bryophyte">bryophyte</a>s. Several rarities exist amongst the 194 <a href="lichen">lichen</a> species. <a href="Kelp">Kelp</a> thrives in the surrounding seas, which contain a diversity of unusual marine invertebrates.

The beach at Village Bay is unusual in that its short stretch of summer sand recedes in winter, exposing the large boulders on which it rests. A survey of the beach in 1953 found only a single resident species, the crustacean <a href="isopod">isopod</a> "<a href="Eurydice%20pulchra">Eurydice pulchra</a>".

On his death on 14 August 1956, the Marquess of Bute's will bequeathed the archipelago to the <a href="National%20Trust%20for%20Scotland">National Trust for Scotland</a> provided they accepted the offer within six months. After much soul-searching, the Executive Committee agreed to do so in January 1957. The slow renovation and conservation of the village began, much of it undertaken by summer volunteer work parties. In addition, scientific research began on the feral Soay sheep population and other aspects of the natural environment. In 1957 the area was designated a <a href="national%20nature%20reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">national nature reserve</a>.

In 1986 the islands became the first place in Scotland to be inscribed as a <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> <a href="World%20Heritage%20Site">World Heritage Site</a>, for its terrestrial natural features. In 2004, the WHS was extended to include a large amount of the surrounding marine features as well as the islands themselves. In 2005 St Kilda became one of only two dozen global locations to be awarded mixed World Heritage Status for both 'natural' and 'cultural' significance. The islands share this honour with internationally important sites such as <a href="Machu%20Picchu">Machu Picchu</a> in <a href="Peru">Peru</a>, <a href="Mount%20Athos">Mount Athos</a> in Greece and the Ukhahlamba/<a href="Drakensberg">Drakensberg Park</a> in South Africa.

The St Kilda World Heritage Site covers a total area of including the land and sea contained within a square with the coordinates 57°54'36"N / 08°42'W, 57°46'N / 08°42'W, 57°46'N / 08°25' 42"W, 57°54'36"N / 08°25'42'W. The land area is .

St Kilda is a <a href="Scheduled%20Monument">Scheduled Ancient Monument</a>, a <a href="National%20Scenic%20Area%20%28Scotland%29">National Scenic Area</a>, a <a href="Site%20of%20Special%20Scientific%20Interest">Site of Special Scientific Interest</a>, and a European Union <a href="Special%20Protection%20Area">Special Protection Area</a>. Visiting yachts may find shelter in Village Bay, but those wishing to land are told to contact the National Trust for Scotland in advance. Concern exists about the introduction of non-native animal and plant species into such a fragile environment.

St Kilda's marine environment of underwater caves, arches and chasms offers a challenging but superlative diving experience. Such is the power of the North Atlantic swell that the effects of the waves can be detected below sea level. In 2008 the National Trust for Scotland received the support of Scotland’s <a href="Minister%20for%20Environment">Minister for Environment</a>, <a href="Michael%20Russell%20%28politician%29">Michael Russell</a> for their plan to ensure no rats come ashore from the "Spinningdale", a UK-registered/Spanish-owned fishing vessel grounded on Hirta. There was concern that bird life on the island could be seriously affected. Fortunately, potential contaminants from the vessel including fuel, oils, bait and stores were successfully removed by Dutch salvage company <a href="Mammoet">Mammoet</a> before the bird breeding season in early April.

The steamship company running a service between <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a> and St Kilda commissioned a short (18-minute) silent movie, "<a href="St%20Kilda%2C%20Britain%27s%20Loneliest%20Isle">St Kilda, Britain's Loneliest Isle</a>". Released in 1928, it shows some scenes in the lives of the island’s inhabitants. In 1937, after reading of the St Kilda evacuation, <a href="Michael%20Powell">Michael Powell</a> made the film "<a href="The%20Edge%20of%20the%20World">The Edge of the World</a>" about the dangers of island depopulation. It was shot on <a href="Foula">Foula</a>, one of the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a>. The writer <a href="Dorothy%20Dunnett">Dorothy Dunnett</a> wrote a short story, "The Proving Climb", set on St Kilda; it was published in 1973 in the anthology "Scottish Short Stories".

In 1982, the noted Scottish filmmaker and theatre director <a href="Bill%20Bryden">Bill Bryden</a> made the <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>-funded film "Ill Fares The Land" about the last years of St Kilda. It is not currently on commercial release.

The fictional island of Laerg, which features in the 1962 novel "Atlantic Fury" by <a href="Hammond%20Innes">Hammond Innes</a>, is closely based on Hirta.

The Scottish <a href="folk%20rock">folk rock</a> band <a href="Runrig">Runrig</a> recorded a song called "Edge of the World" on the album "<a href="The%20Big%20Wheel%20%28album%29">The Big Wheel</a>", which dwells on the islanders' isolated existence. The <a href="folk%20music">folk music</a> singer/songwriter <a href="Brian%20McNeill">Brian McNeill</a> wrote about one of St. Kilda's prodigal sons, a restless fellow named Ewan Gillies, who left St. Kilda to seek his fortune by prospecting for gold first in Australia and later California. The song recounts fortunes won and lost, his return to the island, and concludes with his inability to stay. Entitled "Ewan and the Gold", it was published on the album "Back O' The North Wind" in 1991 and is the subject of McNeill's audio-visual presentation about the Scottish <a href="diaspora">diaspora</a>.

In a 2005 <a href="Opinion%20poll">poll</a> of "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" readers, St Kilda was named as the ninth greatest natural wonder in the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>. In 2007 an <a href="opera">opera</a> in <a href="Scots%20Gaelic">Scots Gaelic</a> called "St Kilda: A European Opera" about the story of the islands received funding from the <a href="Scottish%20Government">Scottish Government</a>. It was performed simultaneously at six venues in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany and Scotland over the summer solstice of 2007. As part of its legacy, the production left a year-long time lapse camera on Hirta. "Britain's Lost World", a three-part <a href="BBC">BBC</a> documentary series about St Kilda began broadcasting on 19 June 2008.

Stamps were issued by the <a href="Post%20Office%20Ltd.">Post Office</a> depicting St. Kilda in 1986 and 2004. St Kilda was also commemorated on a new series of <a href="banknotes%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling">banknotes</a> issued by the <a href="Clydesdale%20Bank">Clydesdale Bank</a> in 2009; an image based on a historical photograph of residents appeared on the reverse of an issue of £5 notes.

In 2006, the documentary film <a href="https%3A//web.archive.org/web/20131203094032/http%3A//www.docsonline.tv/doc/390">"On the Edge of the World"</a> by director Sylvestre Sbille was released. The film depicts the history of the life on the isle and follows <a href="UNESCO">UNESCO</a> volunteers, working on St Kilda.

In 2009 <a href="Pr%C3%B2iseact%20nan%20Ealan">Pròiseact nan Ealan</a>, the Gaelic Arts Agency, announced plans to commemorate the evacuation on 29 August, (the 79th anniversary) including an exhibition in <a href="Kelvingrove%20Art%20Gallery">Kelvingrove Art Gallery</a>. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar are planning a feasibility study for a new visitor centre to tell the story of St Kilda, although they have specifically ruled out using Hirta as a location.

"Hirta Songs", a song cycle about and inspired by the archipelago was released in 2013 on the label Stone Tape Recordings by musician <a href="Alasdair%20Roberts%20%28musician%29">Alasdair Roberts</a> and poet <a href="Robin%20Robertson">Robin Robertson</a>.

In 2016 an album "<a href="The%20Lost%20Songs%20of%20St%20Kilda">The Lost Songs of St Kilda</a>" was released. It included recordings of folk songs from the island played on the piano by Trevor Morrison, an elderly man who had been taught them as a child by a former St Kilda resident. The album also included orchestral arrangements of the songs by Sir <a href="James%20MacMillan">James MacMillan</a> and others.

In late 2016, during cataloguing by the National Register of Archives for Scotland (NRAS), a census of St Kilda from 1764 was discovered. It lists 90 people living on the remote archipelago on 15 June 1764 - 38 males and 52 females, including 19 families and nine individuals.

"Where the World Ends" by <a href="Geraldine%20McCaughrean">Geraldine McCaughrean</a> won the 2018 <a href="Carnegie%20Medal%20%28literary%20award%29">Carnegie Medal</a> for best children's novel.
