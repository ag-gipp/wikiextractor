Two-cent piece (United States)

The two-cent piece was produced by the <a href="United%20States%20Mint">Mint of the United States</a> for circulation from 1864 to 1872 and for collectors in 1873. Designed by <a href="James%20B.%20Longacre">James B. Longacre</a>, there were decreasing mintages each year, as other minor coins such as the <a href="Nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">nickel</a> proved more popular. It was abolished by the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201873">Mint Act of 1873</a>.

The economic turmoil of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> caused government-issued coins, even the non-silver <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a>, to vanish from circulation, hoarded by the public. One means of filling this gap was <a href="Civil%20War%20token">private token</a> issues, often made of bronze. The cent at that time was struck of a copper-nickel alloy, the same diameter as the later <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a>, but somewhat thicker. The piece was difficult for the <a href="Philadelphia%20Mint">Philadelphia Mint</a> to strike, and Mint officials, as well as the annual <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>, recommended the coin's replacement. Despite opposition from those wishing to keep the metal <a href="nickel">nickel</a> in the coinage, led by Pennsylvania Congressman <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, Congress passed the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201864">Coinage Act of 1864</a>, authorizing bronze cents and two-cent pieces.

Although initially popular in the absence of other federal coinage, the two-cent piece's place in circulation was usurped by other non-precious metal coins which Congress subsequently authorized, the <a href="three-cent%20nickel">three-cent piece</a> and the nickel. It was abolished in 1873; large quantities were redeemed by the government and melted. Nevertheless, two-cent pieces remain inexpensive by the standards of 19th-century American coinage.

A two-cent piece had been proposed in 1806 by Connecticut Senator <a href="Uriah%20Tracy">Uriah Tracy</a>, along with a <a href="twenty-cent%20piece">twenty-cent piece</a> or "double dime". Reflecting the then-prevalent view that coins should contain their value in metal, Tracy's bill provided that the two-cent piece be made of <a href="billon%20%28alloy%29">billon</a>, or debased silver. The bill was opposed by Mint Director <a href="Robert%20Patterson%20%28educator%29">Robert Patterson</a>, as it would be difficult to refine the silver from melted-down pieces. Although Tracy's legislation passed the Senate twice, in 1806 and 1807, it failed in the House of Representatives. Patterson sent a brass button with two of the billon <a href="planchet">planchet</a>s that would have been used for the coin to Tracy, showing how hard it would be to prevent counterfeiting. The Mint considered a two-cent piece in 1836, and experiments were conducted by Second Engraver <a href="Christian%20Gobrecht">Christian Gobrecht</a> and Melter and Refiner <a href="Franklin%20Peale">Franklin Peale</a>. The piece was to be again of billon, and provision for the coin was included in early drafts of the Mint Act of 1837, but the proposal was dropped when Peale was able to show that the coin could be easily counterfeited.
Until 1857, the cent coin was a <a href="large%20cent%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">large copper piece</a>, containing about its face value in metal. These coins were unpopular, and in 1857, after receiving congressional approval, the Mint began issuing the <a href="Flying%20Eagle%20cent">Flying Eagle cent</a>, of the diameter of the later <a href="Lincoln%20cent">Lincoln cent</a>, but somewhat thicker and made of copper-nickel alloy. These pieces readily circulated, and although the design did not strike well and was replaced by the <a href="Indian%20Head%20cent">Indian Head cent</a> in 1859, the coins were commonly used until all federal coinage vanished from circulation in much of the United States in 1861 and 1862, during the economic turmoil of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. This happened because many Northerners feared that if the war went poorly, paper money and government bonds might become worthless. The gap was filled by, among other things, <a href="Civil%20War%20token">private token</a> issues, sometimes in copper-nickel approximating the size of the cent, but often thinner pieces in bronze.

This fact did not escape government officials, and when, in 1863, they attempted to restore coins to circulation, the use of bronze coins, which would not contain their face values in metal, was considered. In his annual report submitted October 1, 1863, Mint Director <a href="James%20Pollock">James Pollock</a> noted that "whilst people expect a full value in their gold and silver coins, they merely want the inferior [base metal] money for convenience in making exact payments". He observed that the private cent tokens had sometimes contained as little as a fifth of a cent in metal, yet had still circulated. He proposed that the copper-nickel cent be replaced with a bronze piece of the same size. Pollock also wanted to eliminate nickel as a coinage metal; its hard alloys destroyed dies and machinery. On December 8, Pollock wrote to Treasury Secretary <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a>, proposing a bronze cent and two-cent piece, and enclosing <a href="pattern%20coin">pattern coin</a>s of the two-cent piece that he had had prepared. According to <a href="numismatics">numismatist</a> Neil Carothers, a two-cent piece was most likely proposed in order to get as much dollar value in small change into circulation in as short a time as possible, as the Mint could strike a two-cent piece as easily as a cent.

On March 2, 1864, Pollock wrote urgently to Chase, warning him that the Mint was running out of nickel and that demand for cents was at an all-time high. He also informed the Secretary that the <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">United States Assay Commission</a>, composed of citizens and officials who had met the previous month to test the nation's silver and gold coinage, had recommended the use of French bronze (95% copper with the remainder tin and zinc) as a coinage metal for the cent and a new two-cent piece. Three days later, Chase sent Pollock's December letter and draft legislation for bronze one- and two-cent pieces to Maine Senator <a href="William%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BP.%20Fessenden">William P. Fessenden</a>, chairman of the <a href="Senate%20Finance%20Committee">Senate Finance Committee</a>. Fessenden took no immediate action, and on March 16, Pollock wrote again to Chase, warning that the Mint was going to run out of nickel, much of which was imported. Chase forwarded his letter to Fessenden. Legislation was finally introduced by New Hampshire Senator <a href="Daniel%20Clark%20%28New%20Hampshire%29">Daniel Clark</a> on March 22; Pollock's letters were read and apparently influenced proceedings as the Senate passed the bill without debate.

The domestic supply of nickel was at that time produced by a mine at <a href="Gap%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gap, Pennsylvania</a>, owned by industrialist <a href="Joseph%20Wharton">Joseph Wharton</a>. On March 19, Pollock wrote to Chase that they had no more nickel, nor was any available from overseas; "we are thus shut up to the home supply; from the works of Mr. Wharton". Opposed to the removal of nickel from the cent, Wharton published a pamphlet in April 1864 proposing coinage of one-, two-, three-, five-, and ten-cent pieces of an alloy of one part nickel to three of copper, doubling the percentage of nickel used in the cent. Despite Wharton's efforts, on April 20, a select committee of the House of Representatives endorsed the bill. It was opposed by Pennsylvania's <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, who represented the mining area from which Wharton extracted his nickel. Wharton had spent $200,000 to develop his mine and ore refinement machinery, Stevens related, and it was unfair to deprive him of the major use of his metal. "Shall we destroy all this property because by coining with another metal more money may be saved to the government?" Besides, he argued, the copper-nickel alloy for the cent had been approved by Congress, and the new metal, which he termed "brass", would show rust. He was rebutted by Iowa Congressman <a href="John%20A.%20Kasson">John A. Kasson</a>, chairman of the <a href="List%20of%20defunct%20United%20States%20congressional%20committees">House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures</a>, who stated that the bronze alloy did not resemble brass, and he could not support the proposition that the government is bound to purchase from a supplier because he has spent money in anticipation of sales.

The legislation passed the House, and the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201864">Coinage Act of 1864</a> was signed by President <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> on April 22, 1864. The legislation made base metal coins <a href="legal%20tender">legal tender</a> for the first time: both cents and two-cent pieces were acceptable in quantities of up to ten. The government would not, however, redeem them in bulk. The act also outlawed the private one- and two-cent tokens, and later that year Congress abolished all such issues. The legislation did not allow for the redemption of the old copper-nickel cents; it had been drafted by Pollock, who was hoping that the <a href="seignorage">seignorage</a> income from issuing the new coins would help finance Mint operations, and he did not want it reduced by the recall of the old pieces. Wharton and his interests were appeased by the passage of a bill for a <a href="three-cent%20piece">three-cent piece</a> in 1865 and a <a href="nickel%20%28United%20States%20coin%29">five-cent piece</a> in 1866, both of his proposed alloy, out of which the "nickel", as the latter coin has come to be known, is still struck.

In late 1861, the Reverend Mark R. Watkinson of <a href="Ridleyville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Ridleyville, Pennsylvania</a>, had written to Chase, proposing that some reference to God be placed on the coinage in that time of war, and on November 20 of that year, Chase wrote to Mint Director Pollock, "You will cause a device to be prepared without unnecessary delay with a motto expressing in the fewest tersest terms possible this national recognition." Several mottoes were considered by Pollock, including "God Our Trust" and "God and Our Country". Some of the patterns he sent Chase in December 1863 used "God Our Trust", and he wrote of the design, "the devices are beautiful and appropriate, and the motto on each such, as all who fear God and love their country, will approve." He also sent pattern coins depicting <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>; Chase responded to the letter, "I approve your mottoes, only suggesting that on that with the Washington obverse the motto should begin with the word OUR, so as to read OUR GOD AND OUR COUNTRY. And on that with the shield, it should be changed so as to read: IN GOD WE TRUST." Pollock had been inspired by "<a href="The%20Star%20Spangled%20Banner">The Star Spangled Banner</a>", a later stanza of which includes the line, "And this be our motto, 'In God Is Our Trust' ". Chase may have been influenced in his decision by the motto of his alma mater, <a href="Brown%20University">Brown University</a>, "In Deo Speramus" (In God We Hope).

As the mottoes to be placed on coinage were prescribed by the 1837 act, a legislative change was needed. The act which created the two-cent piece authorized the Mint Director, with the Secretary of the Treasury's approval, to prescribe the designs and mottoes to be used. Longacre's two-cent piece was the first coin inscribed with "<a href="In%20God%20We%20Trust">In God We Trust</a>". The motto was popularized by the new coin; on March 3, 1865 Congress passed legislation ordering its use on all coins large enough to permit it. Since 1938, "In God We Trust" has been used on all American coins.

The obverse design is a Longacre version of the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20United%20States">Great Seal of the United States</a>. His design focuses on the shield, or <a href="escutcheon%20%28heraldry%29">escutcheon</a>, as a defensive weapon, signifying strength and self-protection through unity. The upper part of the shield, or "chief", symbolizes Congress, while the 13 vertical stripes, or "paleways", represent the states; consequently the entire escutcheon symbolizes the strength of the federal government through the unity of the states. The crossed arrows represent nonaggression, but imply readiness against attack. The laurel branches, taken from Greek tradition, symbolize victory. In <a href="hatching%20system">heraldic engraving</a>, vertical lines represent red, clear areas white and horizontal lines blue, thus the escutcheon is colored red, white and blue and is meant to evoke the American flag. The reverse contains the denomination "2 CENTS" within a somewhat ornate wheat wreath. The rest of the coin is filled with the name of the country.

Art historian <a href="Cornelius%20Vermeule">Cornelius Vermeule</a> deemed the two-cent piece "the most Gothic and the most expressive of the Civil War" of all American coins. "The shield, arrows, and wreath of the obverse need only flanking cannon to be the consummate expression of Civil War heraldry." Vermeule suggested that the coin appears calligraphic, rather than sculptural, and ascribed this to Longacre's early career as a plate engraver.

A few thousand of the first circulation strikes, as well as a handful of <a href="proof%20coin">proof coin</a>s, came from a prototype die with smaller letters in the motto than all other 1864 pieces. Although specimens of the two-cent piece, being of base metal, were not set aside for testing by the annual <a href="United%20States%20Assay%20Commission">Assay Commission</a>, Congress did order that internal checks be done at the Mint as to their composition and weight.

The two-cent piece was at first a success, circulating freely once enough of them were issued to be recognized by the public. It initially circulated because of the wartime coin shortage, which was alleviated by the new cent and two-cent piece. Although Pollock reported hoarding of cents in his June 1864 report, he did not thereafter mention such activities. Silver coins still did not circulate in much of the nation, and the new coins (joined by the three- and five-cent pieces of copper-nickel, first struck in 1865 and 1866 respectively) answered the need for small change. In October 1864, he reported that the demand for both coins had been unprecedented and that every effort was being made to increase production; in his report the next June, he called the two-cent piece "a most convenient and popular coin". The Act of March 3, 1865, that provided for the <a href="three-cent%20nickel">three-cent nickel</a> piece, reduced the legal tender limit of the bronze coins to four cents, while making the newly authorized coin acceptable up to sixty cents.
After the large mintage of just under twenty million in the first year, according to numismatist <a href="Q.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BDavid%20Bowers">Q. David Bowers</a>, "enthusiasm and public acceptance waned". After the war, bank demand for the denomination dropped, while demand for the new five-cent nickel increased; mintages of the two-cent piece were smaller every year. Lange notes, "it was evident by the end of the 1860s that its coinage was no longer necessary". According to Carothers, "the coinage of a 2 cent piece was unnecessary. While it was popular at first because of the great public demand for metallic small change, it was a superfluous denomination, and its circulation waned rapidly after the 5 cent nickel coin was introduced."

Beginning in 1867, the new Mint Director, <a href="Henry%20Linderman">Henry Linderman</a>, (Pollock had resigned) began to advocate for Congress to authorize redemption of surplus copper and bronze coinage. Although the nickel could be redeemed in lots (permission granted in its authorizing act), there was no provision for the government to buy back the smaller coins, and with more being issued every year, there were too many small-value coins. Treasury officials insisted the government could not accept the pieces beyond their legal tender limits, even if what was being done was exchanging them for other currency. Under Linderman, the Mint, without any legal authority, purchased $360,000 in bronze coins using three-cent pieces and nickels. Still, millions of two-cent pieces accumulated in the hands of newspaper and transit companies, postmasters, and others who took small payments from the public, and there were complaints to Congress. With the advent of the <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Grant</a> administration, Pollock returned to office and opposed the redemption proposals. Although he included Pollock's opinions as part of his annual report, Treasury Secretary <a href="George%20S.%20Boutwell">George S. Boutwell</a> asked Congress to pass a redemption act, and it did so on March 3, 1871, allowing for the redemption of minor coinage in lots of not less than $20. It also allowed the Treasury Secretary to discontinue the coinage of any piece redeemed in large numbers. Pursuant to the new law, the Mint in 1871 and 1872 redeemed over 37,000,000 small coins, including two-cent pieces.
In the postwar years, Congress and the Treasury considered a revision of the coinage laws, as the act of 1837 was deemed outdated. Retention of the two-cent piece was never seriously considered in the debates over what became the <a href="Mint%20Act%20of%201873">Mint Act of 1873</a>; the only question concerning the minor coinage was whether to make the cent from bronze or copper-nickel, and how large to make the three-cent nickel. With those pieces remaining unchanged, the bill passed on February 12, 1873, putting an end to the two-cent piece series.

With the two-cent piece likely to be abolished, only 65,000 were struck for circulation in 1872; it is unclear why they were struck at all. On January 18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner <a href="Archibald%20Loudon%20Snowden">Archibald Loudon Snowden</a> complained that the "3" in the date, as struck by the Mint, too closely resembled an "8", especially on the smaller-sized denominations. In response, Pollock ordered the new chief engraver, <a href="William%20Barber%20%28engraver%29">William Barber</a> (Longacre had died in 1869), to re-engrave the date, opening the arms of the "3" wider on most denominations. The two-cent piece was struck only in <a href="proof%20coin">proof condition</a> in 1873, and due to its February abolition, there should not have been time or reason for Barber to re-engrave the coin. Nevertheless, it exists in "Closed 3" and "Open 3" varieties. Breen suggested that the "Open 3" variety was actually struck at a later date, probably clandestinely; it was not known to exist until discovered by a numismatist in the 1950s. Numismatist Paul Green ascribed the two varieties to the two types of <a href="proof%20set">proof set</a>s that the Mint sold at the time that would have contained the two-cent piece. The "nickel set" contained only the low-value coins without precious metal, while another contained also the silver coins; he suggested that one variety was struck for each.

Large quantities of two-cent pieces were withdrawn in the 1870s and after. Approximately 17,000,000 of the some 45,600,000 two-cent pieces issued had been repurchased by the Treasury as of 1909. Withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one-cent pieces. A bill for a two-cent piece bearing the portrait of recently deceased former president <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> passed the Senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a House committee but never enacted. Numismatist S. W. Freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two-cent piece, but for those who did, it was often associated with spending it at a candy store. He recalled that two cents would buy a quantity of sweets, as a dime did in Freeman's day, and, he feared, it would take a quarter to do in the future. Full legal tender status was granted the two-cent piece by the <a href="Coinage%20Act%20of%201965">Coinage Act of 1965</a>, long after the coin had passed from circulation, as it made all coins and currency of the United States good for all public and private debts without limit. Nevertheless, numismatist Jack White pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan, the piece "hardly got its two cents in".

<a href="R.S.%20Yeoman">R.S. Yeoman</a>'s 2018 edition of "<a href="A%20Guide%20Book%20of%20United%20States%20Coins">A Guide Book of United States Coins</a>" lists the 1864 large motto and the 1865 as the least expensive two-cent pieces, in <a href="coin%20grading">good (G-4) condition</a> at $15, though every issue by year through 1871 lists for $40 or less in that condition. The reason for the relatively flat prices, even in top grades, is a lack of collectors who seek the entire series (it is most popularly collected with a single specimen as part of a "type set" of the various issues of American coins). Despite the high mintage, it is the 1864 date that has one of the more highly valued varieties, the "small motto". Yeoman lists the 1864 small motto in Proof condition, at $20,000 and in Very Fine (VF-20) it is $600.

All two-cent pieces were minted at the Philadelphia Mint, and bore no mint mark. Proof mintages are estimated.

Yellow-tailed black cockatoo

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo ("Calyptorhynchus funereus") is a large <a href="cockatoo">cockatoo</a> native to the south-east of <a href="Australia">Australia</a> measuring in length. It has a short crest on the top of its head. Its <a href="plumage">plumage</a> is mostly brownish black and it has prominent yellow cheek patches and a yellow tail band. The body feathers are edged with yellow giving a scalloped appearance. The adult male has a black beak and pinkish-red eye-rings, and the female has a bone-coloured beak and grey eye-rings. In flight, yellow-tailed black cockatoos flap deeply and slowly, and with a peculiar heavy fluid motion. Their loud eerie wailing calls carry for long distances.

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is found in forested regions from south and central eastern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> to southeastern <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> including a very small population persisting in the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a>. Two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognised, although <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a>n and southern mainland populations of the southern subspecies "xanthanotus" may be distinct enough from each other to bring the total to three. Birds of subspecies "funereus" (Queensland to eastern <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>) have longer wings and tails and darker plumage overall, while those of "xanthanotus" (western <a href="Victoria%20%28Australia%29">Victoria</a>, South Australia and Tasmania) have more prominent scalloping.

Unlike other cockatoos, a large proportion of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of wood-boring grubs, and they also eat seeds. They nest in hollows situated high in trees with fairly large diameters, generally "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>". Although, they remain common throughout much of their range, <a href="Habitat%20fragmentation">fragmentation</a> of habitat and loss of large trees suitable for nesting has caused a population decline in Victoria and South Australia. In some places yellow-tailed black cockatoos appear to have adapted to humans and they can often be seen in parts of urban <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a> and <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>. It is not commonly seen in <a href="aviculture">aviculture</a>, especially outside Australia. Like most <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, it is protected by <a href="CITES">CITES</a>, an international agreement, that makes trade, export, and import of listed wild-caught species illegal.

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo was first described in 1794 by the English naturalist <a href="George%20Shaw">George Shaw</a> as "Psittacus funereus", its <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> "funereus" relating to its dark and sombre plumage, as if dressed for a funeral. The French zoologist <a href="Anselme%20Ga%C3%ABtan%20Desmarest">Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest</a> reclassified it in the new genus "<a href="Calyptorhynchus">Calyptorhynchus</a>" in 1826. The genus name is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> words καλυπτός ("calyptos") "hidden" and ῥύγχος ("rhynchos") "beak".

The ornithologist <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a> knew the bird as the funereal cockatoo. Other <a href="common%20name">common name</a>s used include yellow-tailed black cockatoo, yellow-eared black cockatoo, and "wylah". "Wy-la" was an <a href="Australian%20Aborigines">aboriginal</a> term from the <a href="Hunter%20Region">Hunter Region</a> of New South Wales, while the <a href="Tharawal%20language">Dharawal</a> name from the Illawarra region is "Ngaoaraa". Scientist and cockatoo authority Matt Cameron has proposed dropping the "black" and shortening the name to "yellow-tailed cockatoo", explaining that shorter names are more widely accepted.

Within the genus, the yellow-tailed and the two Western Australian white-tailed species, the <a href="short-billed%20black%20cockatoo">short-billed</a> and <a href="long-billed%20black%20cockatoo">long-billed black cockatoo</a>, form the subgenus "Zanda". The <a href="red-tailed%20black%20cockatoo">red-tailed</a> and <a href="glossy%20black%20cockatoo">glossy black cockatoo</a>s form the other subgenus, "Calyptorhynchus". The two groups are distinguished by differing juvenile <a href="Begging%20behavior%20in%20animals">food begging calls</a> and the degree of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>. Males and females of the latter group have markedly different plumage, whereas those of the former have similar plumage.

The three species of the subgenus "Zanda" have been variously considered as two, then as a single species for many years. In a 1979 paper, Australian ornithologist <a href="Denis%20A.%20Saunders">Denis Saunders</a> highlighted the similarity between the short-billed and the southern race "xanthanotus" of the yellow-tailed and treated them as a single species with the long-billed as a distinct species. He proposed that Western Australia had been colonised on two separate occasions, once by a common ancestor of all three forms (which became the long-billed black cockatoo), and later by what has become the short-billed black cockatoo. However, an analysis of protein <a href="allozyme">allozyme</a>s published in 1984 revealed the two Western Australian forms to be more closely related to each other than to the yellow-tailed, and the consensus since then has been to treat them as three separate species.

Within the species, two subspecies are recognised:


The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is in length and 750–900 grams in weight. It has a short mobile crest on the top of its head, and the plumage is mostly brownish-black with paler <a href="feather">feather</a>-margins in the neck, nape, and wings, and pale yellow bands in the tail feathers. The tails of birds of subspecies "funereus" measure around , with an average tail length longer than "xanthanotus". Male "funereus" birds weigh on average around and females weigh about . Birds of the "xanthanotus" race on the mainland average heavier than the Tasmanian birds; the males on the mainland weigh on average around 630 g and females , while those on Tasmania average 583 and respectively. Both mainland and Tasmanian birds of the "xanthanotus" race average about in tail length. The plumage is a more solid brown-black in the eastern subspecies, while the southern race has more pronounced yellow scalloping on the underparts.

The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo has a black bill, a dull yellow patch behind each eye, and pinkish or reddish eye-rings. The female has grey eye-rings, a horn-coloured bill, and brighter and more clearly defined yellow cheek-patches. Immature birds have duller plumage overall, a horn-coloured bill, and grey eye-rings; The upper beak of the immature male darkens to black by two years of age, commencing at the base of the bill and spreading over ten weeks. The lower beak blackens later by four years of age. The elongated bill has a pointed maxilla (upper <a href="beak">beak</a>), suited to digging out grubs from tree branches and trunks. Records of the timing of the eye ring changing from grey to pink in male birds are sparse, but have been recorded anywhere from one to four years of age. Australian farmer and amateur ornithologist John Courtney proposed that the similarity between juvenile and female eye rings prevented adult males becoming aggressive to younger birds. He also observed the eye rings to flush brighter in aggressive males. <a href="Moulting%23Birds">Moulting</a> appears to take place in stages over the course of a year, and is poorly understood.

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is distinguished from other dark-plumaged birds by its yellow tail and ear markings, and its contact call. Parts of its range overlap with the ranges of two cockatoo species that have red tail banding, the red-tailed cockatoo and the glossy black cockatoo. Crow species may appear similar when seen flying at a distance; however, crows have shorter tails, a quicker wing beat, and different calls.

An all-yellow bird lacking in black pigment was recorded in <a href="Wauchope%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Wauchope, New South Wales</a>, in December 1996, and it remained a part of the local group of cockatoos for four years. Birds with part-yellow plumage have been recorded from different areas in Victoria.

The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is found up to <a href="AMSL">AMSL</a> over southeastern Australia including the island of Tasmania and the islands of the <a href="Bass%20Strait">Bass Strait</a> (<a href="King%20Island%20%28Tasmania%29">King</a>, <a href="Flinders%20Island">Flinders</a>, <a href="Cape%20Barren%20Island">Cape Barren</a> islands), and also on <a href="Kangaroo%20Island">Kangaroo Island</a>. On Tasmania and the islands of the Bass Strait it is the only native black-coloured cockatoo. On the mainland, it is found from the vicinity of <a href="Gin%20Gin%2C%20Queensland">Gin Gin</a> and <a href="Gympie">Gympie</a> in south and central eastern <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>, south through New South Wales, where it occurs along the <a href="Great%20Dividing%20Range">Great Dividing Range</a> and to the coast, and into and across most of Victoria bar the northern and northwestern corner, to the <a href="Coorong">Coorong</a> and <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a> in southeastern South Australia. A tiny population numbering 30 to 40 birds inhabits the <a href="Eyre%20Peninsula">Eyre Peninsula</a>. There they are found in sugar gum ("<a href="Eucalyptus%20cladocalyx">Eucalyptus cladocalyx</a>") woodland in the lower peninsula and migrate to the <a href="Mallee%20Woodlands%20and%20Shrublands">mallee</a> areas in the northern peninsula after breeding. There is evidence that birds on the New South Wales south coast move from elevated areas to lower lying areas towards the coast in winter. They are generally common or locally very common in a wide range of habits, although they tend to be locally rare at the limits of their range. Their breeding range is restricted to areas with large old trees.

The birds may be found in a variety of habitats including grassy woodland, <a href="riparian%20forest">riparian forest</a>, <a href="Heath%20%28habitat%29">heathland</a>, <a href="subalpine">subalpine</a> areas, pine <a href="Plantation%23Industrial%20plantations">plantations</a>, and occasionally in urban areas, as long as there is a plentiful food supply. They have also spread to parts of suburban Sydney, particularly on or near golf courses, pine plantations and parks, such as <a href="Centennial%20Park%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Centennial Park</a> in the eastern suburbs. It is unclear whether this is adaptive or because of loss of habitat elsewhere. In urban Melbourne, they have been recorded at <a href="Yarra%20Bend%20Park%2C%20Melbourne">Yarra Bend Park</a>. The so-called "<a href="Black%20Saturday%20bushfires">Black Saturday bushfires</a>" in 2009 appear to have caused sufficient loss of their natural habitat for them to have been sighted in other parts of the urban areas of Melbourne as well.

Yellow-tailed black cockatoos are diurnal, raucous and noisy, and are often heard before being seen. They make long journeys by flying at a considerable height while calling to each other, and they are often seen flying high overhead in pairs, or trios comprising a pair and their young, or small groups. Outside of the breeding season in autumn or winter they may coalesce into flocks of a hundred birds or more, while family interactions between pairs or trios are maintained. They are generally wary birds, although they can be less shy in urban and suburban areas. They generally keep to trees, only coming to ground level to inspect fallen pine or banksia cones or to drink. Flight is fluid and has been described as "lazy", with deep, slow wingbeats.

Tall eucalypts that are emergent over other trees in wooded areas are selected for roosting sites. It is here that the cockatoos rest for the night, and also rest to shelter from the heat of the day. They often socialise before dusk, engaging in <a href="preening%20%28bird%29">preening</a>, feeding young, and flying acrobatically. Flocks will return to roost earlier in bad weather.

The usual call is an eerie high-pitched wailing contact call, "kee-ow ... kee-ow ... kee-ow", made while flying or roosting, and can be heard from afar. Birds may also make a harsh screeching <a href="Alarm%20signal">alarm call</a>. They also make a soft, chuckling call when searching for <a href="Cossidae">cossid</a> moth larvae. Adults are normally quiet when feeding, while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls. The <a href="superb%20lyrebird">superb lyrebird</a> can mimic the adult yellow-tailed black cockatoo's contact call with some success.

The breeding season varies according to latitude, taking place from April to July in Queensland, January to May in northern New South Wales, December to February in southern New South Wales, and October to February in Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania. The male yellow-tailed black cockatoo <a href="Courtship%20display">courts</a> by puffing up crest and spreading his tail feathers to display his yellow plumage. Softly growling, he approaches the female and bows three or four times to her. His eye ring may also flush a deeper pink. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees, generally eucalypts, which are either living or dead. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. A 1994 study of nesting sites in "<a href="Eucalyptus%20regnans">Eucalyptus regnans</a>" forest in the <a href="Strzelecki%20Ranges">Strzelecki Ranges</a> in eastern Victoria found the average age of trees used for hollows by the yellow-tailed black cockatoo to be 228 years. The authors noted that the proposed 80–150 year rotation time for managed forests would impact on the numbers of suitable trees.

Hollows can be deep and wide, with a base of woodchips. A chance felling of a eucalypt known to have been used as a nesting tree near <a href="Scottsdale%2C%20Tasmania">Scottsdale</a> in northeastern Tasmania allowed accurate measurements to be made, yielding a hollow measuring high by wide at the mouth, and at least deep, in a tree which measured in diameter below the hollow. Both the male and female prepare the hollow for breeding, which involves peeling or scraping off wood shavings from the inside the hollow to prepare bedding for the eggs. Gum leaves are occasionally added as well. The clutch consists of one or two white lustreless rounded oval eggs which may have the occasional lime nodule. The first egg averages around 47 or 48 mm long and 37 mm in diameter (2 × 1.4 in). The second egg is around 2 mm smaller all over and is laid two to seven days later. The female <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubates</a> the eggs alone and begins after the completion of laying. She enters the hollow feet first, and is visited by the male who brings food two to four times a day. Later both parents help to raise the chicks. The second chick is neglected and usually perishes in infancy. Information on the breeding of birds in the wild is lacking; however, the incubation period in captivity is 28–31 days. Newly hatched chicks are covered with yellow <a href="Down%20feather">down</a> and have pink beaks that fade to a greyish white by the time of fledging. Chicks fledge from the nest three months after hatching, and remain in the company of their parents until the next breeding season.
Like other cockatoos, this species is long-lived. A pair of yellow-tailed black cockatoos at <a href="Diergaarde%20Blijdorp">Rotterdam Zoo</a> stopped breeding when they were 41 and 37 years of age, but still showed signs of close bonding. Birds appear to reach <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> between four and six years of age; this is the age range of breeding recorded in captivity.

The diet of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is varied and available from a range of habitats within its distribution, which reduces their vulnerability to degradation or change in habitat. Much of the diet comprises seeds of native trees, particularly she-oaks ("<a href="Allocasuarina">Allocasuarina</a>" and "<a href="Casuarina">Casuarina</a>", including "<a href="Allocasuarina%20torulosa">A. torulosa</a>" and "<a href="Allocasuarina%20verticillata">A. verticillata</a>"), but also "<a href="Eucalyptus">Eucalyptus</a>" (including "<a href="Eucalyptus%20maculata">E. maculata</a>" flowers and "<a href="Eucalyptus%20nitida">E. nitida</a>" seeds), "<a href="Acacia">Acacia</a>" (including gum exudate and <a href="gall">gall</a>s), "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" (including the green seed pods and seeds of "<a href="Banksia%20serrata">B. serrata</a>", "<a href="Banksia%20integrifolia">B. integrifolia</a>", and "<a href="Banksia%20marginata">B. marginata</a>"), and "<a href="Hakea">Hakea</a>" species (including "<a href="Hakea%20gibbosa">H. gibbosa</a>", "<a href="Hakea%20rugosa">H. rugosa</a>", "<a href="Hakea%20nodosa">H. nodosa</a>", "<a href="Hakea%20sericea">H. sericea</a>", "<a href="Hakea%20cycloptera">H. cycloptera</a>", and "<a href="Hakea%20dactyloides">H. dactyloides</a>"). They are also partial to pine cones in plantations of the introduced "<a href="Pinus%20radiata">Pinus radiata</a>" and to other <a href="Introduced%20species">introduced</a> trees, including "<a href="Cupressus%20torulosa">Cupressus torulosa</a>", "<a href="Betula%20pendula">Betula pendula</a>" and the buds of elm "<a href="Ulmus">Ulmus</a>" species. In the Eyre Peninsula, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo has become dependent on the introduced Aleppo pine ("<a href="Pinus%20halepensis">Pinus halepensis</a>"), alongside native species.
The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is very fond of the larvae of tree-boring beetles, such as the longhorn beetle "<a href="Tryphocaria%20acanthocera">Tryphocaria acanthocera</a>", and cossid moth "<a href="Xyleutes%20boisduvali">Xyleutes boisduvali</a>". Birds seek them out all year but especially in June and July, when the moth caterpillars are largest, and they are accompanied by their just <a href="fledge">fledge</a>d young. They search out holes and make some exploratory bites looking for larvae. If successful, they peel and tear down a strip of bark to make a perch for themselves before continuing to gouge and excavate the larvae, which have deeply tunneled into the <a href="wood%23Heartwood%20and%20sapwood">heartwood</a>.

A yellow-tailed black cockatoo was observed stripping pieces of bark off the trunk of a dead "<a href="Leptospermum">Leptospermum</a>" tree in "<a href="Acacia%20melanoxylon">Acacia melanoxylon</a>" swamp near <a href="Togari%2C%20Tasmania">Togari</a> in northwestern Tasmania. It then scraped a layer of white material about 0.5 mm thick from the inner surface with its beak. This white layer turned out to be <a href="hyphomycetes">hyphomycete</a> fungi and <a href="slime%20mould">slime mould</a> that grew in the <a href="Cork%20cambium">cambium</a> of the bark.

Yellow-tailed black cockatoos have been reported flocking to "<a href="Banksia">Banksia</a>" cones ten days after <a href="bushfire">bushfire</a> as the follicles open. With pine trees, they prefer green cones, nipping them off at the stem and holding in one foot, then systematically lifting each segment and extracting the seed. A cockatoo spends about twenty minutes on each pine cone.

They drink at various places, from stock troughs to puddles, and do so in the early morning or late in the afternoon. Insect larvae and <a href="Fabaceae">Fabaceae</a> seeds are among food reported to have been fed to young.

In 2004, a captive yellow-tailed black cockatoo and two free-living <a href="tawny%20frogmouth">tawny frogmouth</a>s ("Podargus strigoides") suffering neurological symptoms were shown to be hosting the rat nematode "<a href="Angiostrongylus%20cantonensis">Angiostrongylus cantonensis</a>". They were the first non-mammalian hosts discovered for the organism. A species of feather mite, "<a href="Psittophagus%20calyptorhynchi">Psittophagus calyptorhynchi</a>", has also been isolated from the yellow-tailed black cockatoo, its only host to date.

Yellow-tailed black cockatoos can cause damage in pine and eucalyptus plantations by weakening stems through gouging out pieces of wood to extract moth larvae. In places with these gum plantations, the population of the larva of the cossid moth "Xyleutes boisduvali" grows, which then leads to increased predation (and hence tree damage) by cockatoos. Furthermore, plantations generally lack <a href="undergrowth">undergrowth</a> which might have prevented cockatoos from damaging younger trees. Yellow-tailed black cockatoos were shot as pests in some districts of New South Wales until the 1940s because of this. The yellow-tailed black cockatoo is promoted by the Shoalhaven City Council local government on the NSW south coast as the region's bird. Within the Jervis bay area the birds can be seen feasting on the many casuarina trees native to the area.

Although it is classified as "least concern" on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species, and not listed nationally as threatened, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is declining in numbers in Victoria and South Australia. This is due to <a href="habitat%20fragmentation">habitat fragmentation</a> and loss of large trees used for breeding hollows, although birds have become more plentiful in the vicinity of pine plantations. It has been listed as "vulnerable" in South Australia, due to its decline in the Adelaide and <a href="Mount%20Lofty%20Ranges">Mount Lofty Ranges</a>, and particularly the perilous status of the small isolated population on the Eyre Peninsula, which has declined sharply since European settlement, probably from loss of suitable habitat. A recovery program was commenced in 1998. Efforts to increase the population include fencing off remnants of native bushland, planting food plants such as "Hakea rugosa", monitoring breeding, and raising chicks in captivity. As a result, the population has increased from a low of 19–21 individuals in 1998.

This species was seldom seen in captivity before the late 1950s, after which time a large number of wild-caught birds entered the Australian market. Since then, it has become more common, but is still rarely seen outside Australia. Captive yellow-tailed black cockatoos require a large <a href="aviary">aviary</a> to avoid apathy and poor health. There is some evidence that protein may be more important to them than to other cockatoos, and low protein has been linked with the production of yolkless eggs in captivity. Females in particular enjoy <a href="mealworm">mealworm</a>s. They can be placid and tolerate sharing an enclosure with smaller parrots, but do not handle disturbance while breeding. As with other black cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos are rarely seen in European zoos, since Australia restricted exportation of wildlife in 1959, but birds seized by government agencies in Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have been loaned to zoos that are members of the <a href="European%20Association%20of%20Zoos%20and%20Aquaria">European Association of Zoos and Aquaria</a> (EAZA). In 2000, there were pairs of yellow-tailed black cockatoos in <a href="Puerto%20de%20la%20Cruz">Puerto de la Cruz</a> zoo in Spain and in Rotterdam. Like most species of <a href="parrot">parrot</a>s, the yellow-tailed black cockatoo is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (<a href="CITES">CITES</a>) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.

Dominik Hašek

Dominik Hašek (, ; born January 29, 1965) is a <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech</a> former <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="goaltender">goaltender</a>. In his 16-season <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) career, he played for the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a>, <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres">Buffalo Sabres</a>, <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> and the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a>. During his years in Buffalo, he became one of the league's finest goaltenders, earning him the nickname "The Dominator". His strong play has been credited with establishing European goaltenders in a league previously dominated by North Americans. He is a two-time <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> champion, both with the Red Wings.

Hašek was one of the league's most successful goaltenders of the 1990s and early 2000s. From <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NHL%20season">1993</a> to <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season">2001</a>, he won six <a href="Vezina%20Trophy">Vezina Trophies</a>, the most under the award's current system of voting for the best individual goalie. In <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NHL%20season">1998</a> he won his second consecutive <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a>, becoming the first goaltender to win the award multiple times. During the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%201998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Nagano%2C%20Nagano">Nagano</a>, Japan, he led the <a href="Czech%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Czech national ice hockey team</a> to its first and only Olympic gold medal. The feat made him a popular figure in his home country and prompted hockey legend <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> to call him "the best player in the game". While with the Red Wings in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2002</a>, Hašek became the first European-trained starting goaltender to win the Stanley Cup. In the process, he set a record for shutouts in a postseason year.

Hašek was considered an unorthodox goaltender, with a distinct style that labeled him a "flopper". He was best known for his concentration, foot speed, flexibility, and unconventional saves, such as covering the puck with his blocker rather than his <a href="Glove%20%28hockey%29">trapper</a>. Hašek holds the highest career <a href="save%20percentage">save percentage</a> of all time (0.9223) and is seventh in <a href="goals%20against%20average">goals against average</a> (first in the modern era) (2.202), and the third-highest single-season save percentage (0.9366 in <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">1998–99</a>). The record was broken by <a href="Tim%20Thomas%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Tim Thomas</a> in the 2010–11 season and again in the 2011–12 season by <a href="Brian%20Elliott">Brian Elliott</a>, who now holds the record at .940. Hašek is the only goalie to face the most shots per 60 minutes and have the highest save percentage in one season. He did it twice while with the Sabres (1996 and 1998).

At the time of his retirement, he was the oldest active goalie in the NHL at 43, and the second-oldest active player in the league after Red Wings teammate <a href="Chris%20Chelios">Chris Chelios</a>, who was 46. Hašek announced his retirement on June 9, 2008, but on April 21, 2009, he announced a comeback to professional hockey and signed a contract with <a href="HC%20Pardubice">HC Pardubice</a> of the <a href="Czech%20Extraliga">Czech Extraliga</a>. On June 7, 2010, he signed with <a href="HC%20Spartak%20Moscow">Spartak Moscow</a> of the <a href="KHL">KHL</a> and played the last season of his career with this team. Hašek announced his retirement on October 9, 2012. Hašek was inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> on November 17, 2014. He is also a member of the <a href="Czech%20Ice%20Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Czech Ice Hockey Hall of Fame</a> and the <a href="IIHF%20Hall%20of%20Fame">IIHF Hall of Fame</a>. His number was retired by the Sabres and HC Pardubice.

Hašek started playing hockey at the age of six in his native <a href="Czechoslovak%20Socialist%20Republic">Czechoslovakia</a>. As he explains:

In 1980, Hašek joined the top hockey league in the country, the <a href="Czechoslovak%20Extraliga">Czechoslovak Extraliga</a>, with his hometown team, <a href="HC%20Pardubice">HC Pardubice</a>. He became the youngest hockey player in history to play at the professional level at age 16. He helped to win two league titles in 1987 and 1989. The next year, he was drafted by the Czech army to play for <a href="Dukla%20Jihlava">Dukla Jihlava</a>. After making his mark and eventually playing for the Czechoslovakian National team, Hašek entered the NHL draft and was drafted by the Chicago Blackhawks in <a href="1983%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1983</a>. At the time, NHL teams were wary of drafting players from behind the <a href="Iron%20Curtain">Iron Curtain</a> who were often unwilling to play in the NHL or barred from doing so by their countries. Consequently, Hašek was picked in the 10th round (199th overall) and was the seventeenth goalie selected. Hašek did not even know he had been drafted until several months later.

Until 1990, Hašek played in his native Czechoslovakia for HC Pardubice and <a href="HC%20Jihlava">HC Jihlava</a>. He won the <a href="Golden%20Hockey%20Stick%20%28Czechoslovakia%29">Golden Hockey Stick</a>, given to the most valuable player in the Extraliga, in 1987, 1989 and 1990. He was named the Extraliga's Goaltender of the Year for four consecutive years from 1986 through 1990. His American career began with the <a href="Indianapolis%20Ice">Indianapolis Ice</a> of the <a href="International%20Hockey%20League%20%281945%E2%80%932001%29">International Hockey League</a> (IHL), where he played parts of two seasons. His NHL debut with the Blackhawks finally came in the <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NHL%20season">1990–91 season</a>, seven years after the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.

In Chicago, Hašek spent time as the backup to <a href="Ed%20Belfour">Ed Belfour</a>, and played only 25 games over two seasons with the Blackhawks, splitting time between the Blackhawks and the Indianapolis Ice of the IHL. On November 6, 1990, wearing the number 34 (31 was worn by backup goaltender Jacques Cloutier that year), Hašek made his first NHL start in a 1–1 tie against the <a href="Hartford%20Whalers">Hartford Whalers</a>.
His first victory came on March 8, 1991, by a score of 5–3 over the Buffalo Sabres, and on January 9, 1992, he recorded his first shutout in a 2–0 win against the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>. During this time with the Blackhawks, his goaltending coach was <a href="Vladislav%20Tretiak">Vladislav Tretiak</a>, who was selected in the 1983 draft but was barred from playing in the NHL by the Soviet government. Hašek appeared in game 4 of the <a href="1992%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">1992 Stanley Cup Finals</a> against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>, after Belfour allowed two goals on four shots in the opening 6:33, and had 21 saves. Although the Penguins won to clinch the Stanley Cup, Hašek's performance attracted the attention of the Sabres, who had considered trading for him earlier that season.

After the Stanley Cup finals appearance, Chicago decided to stay with Belfour and <a href="Jimmy%20Waite">Jimmy Waite</a>. Hašek was traded to the Buffalo Sabres for goalie <a href="Stephane%20Beauregard">Stephane Beauregard</a> and future considerations, which later materialized into a draft pick used to obtain <a href="%C3%89ric%20Daz%C3%A9">Éric Dazé</a>. In Buffalo, wearing number 39, he was initially the backup goaltender, playing behind <a href="Grant%20Fuhr">Grant Fuhr</a>. When Fuhr was injured partway through the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20NHL%20season">1993–94 season</a>, Hašek was elevated to starter and soon developed into a top-tier goaltender. In 1994, he won his first <a href="Vezina%20Trophy">Vezina Trophy</a>, was runner-up for the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> and shared the <a href="William%20M.%20Jennings%20Trophy">William M. Jennings Trophy</a> with Fuhr. Hašek played 58 games with a league-best 1.95 <a href="goals%20against%20average">goals against average</a> (GAA), seven shutouts, and a .930 <a href="save%20percentage">save percentage</a>. He followed this feat by again winning the Vezina Trophy and again placing as a Hart finalist in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20season">1995</a>.

Hašek's success in the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season">1996–97 season</a> was overshadowed by a conflict with then-head coach <a href="Ted%20Nolan">Ted Nolan</a>. The conflict created a tense, clique-like atmosphere in the Sabres' clubhouse.
In game three of the first round series against the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a>, Hašek removed himself in the second period and was replaced by <a href="Steve%20Shields%20%28hockey%20player%29">Steve Shields</a>. Hašek suffered a mild sprain of his right <a href="Medial%20collateral%20ligament">MCL</a>, and the team doctor pronounced him day-to-day. However, the media and some teammates speculated Hašek was using his injury to bail out on the team. One such individual was "<a href="Buffalo%20News">Buffalo News</a>" columnist <a href="Jim%20Kelley">Jim Kelley</a>, who wrote a column which detailed Hašek's injury and his conflict with Nolan, and questioned the goaltender's mental toughness. When Kelley approached Hašek for an interview after a loss in game five of the best-of-seven series, Hašek attacked the journalist and received a three-game suspension and a $10,000 (US) fine as a result of the incident. With Steve Shields in goal, the Sabres fought back against the Senators and took the series in seven games. However, Hašek did not play in the five-game loss in the following series against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Flyers">Philadelphia Flyers</a>.

Though General Manager <a href="John%20Muckler">John Muckler</a> was named "Executive of the Year", he was fired for his constant feuding with Nolan. Hašek, who sided with Muckler, stated in an interview during the 1997 NHL Awards Ceremony that the team would benefit from replacing Nolan.
Despite winning the <a href="Jack%20Adams%20Award">Jack Adams Award</a> as top coach and being popular with the Sabres fanbase, Nolan was only offered a one-year contract extension by replacement GM <a href="Darcy%20Regier">Darcy Regier</a>. He rejected this under the grounds that it was too short, and decided to part ways with the franchise. This upset many fans, who blamed Nolan's departure on Hašek's alleged attempt to rid him.
For the first six weeks of the next season he was booed so vigorously that arena workers would play tapes of a crowd cheering to help balance it out.
As the season progressed, the booing of Hašek ceased, as he posted a league-record seven shutouts in December and continued to play at an elite level. He won the Vezina Trophy again, as well as the <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson%20Award">Lester B. Pearson Award</a> and the Hart Trophy for league MVP. He became one of the few goaltenders in NHL history to win the Hart, alongside <a href="Jacques%20Plante">Jacques Plante</a>, <a href="Carey%20Price">Carey Price</a>, <a href="Chuck%20Rayner">Chuck Rayner</a>, <a href="Al%20Rollins">Al Rollins</a>, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Th%C3%A9odore">José Théodore</a> and <a href="Roy%20Worters">Roy Worters</a>.

Hašek played a career high 72 games in the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NHL%20season">1997–98 season</a>, and set a team record with 13 shutouts. Six of these shutouts came in December, which tied the all-time NHL record for most in one month. He again won the Lester B. Pearson Award, the Hart Trophy, and the Vezina Trophy, becoming the first goalie in NHL history to win the Hart twice. He donated the $10,000 prize money after winning the Pearson Award in 1998 to the "Variety Club of Buffalo". In the off-season he signed a three-year, $26 million deal, securing the highest goaltender salary contract at that time.

In <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">1999</a>, Hašek averaged a career best 1.87 GAA and .937 save percentage, capturing him his third consecutive Vezina, and fifth overall. He was also a finalist for the Hart and Pearson trophies. Though the Sabres did not have a stellar regular season and finished with the seventh seed in the <a href="Eastern%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Eastern Conference</a>, they defeated the Ottawa Senators, <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> and Toronto Maple Leafs in the playoffs en route to a best-of-seven Stanley Cup Final against the <a href="Presidents%27%20Trophy">Presidents' Trophy</a>-winning <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a>. The Sabres eventually lost the series four games to two, with the decisive sixth game being one of the longest Stanley Cup playoff games in NHL history. Hašek and Ed Belfour made 50 and 53 saves, respectively, in a sudden-death <a href="overtime%20%28ice%20hockey%29">triple-overtime</a> duel that only ended when <a href="Brett%20Hull">Brett Hull</a> scored a controversial Cup-winning goal with his foot in the <a href="Crease%20%28hockey%29">goal crease</a>.

The goal was not reviewed immediately, so officials did not notice Hull's foot in the crease until minutes later. After video reviews showed Hull's position, the goal was still upheld, leaving the Sabres infuriated. Hašek commented, "Maybe [the video goal judge] was in the bathroom. Maybe he was sleeping. Maybe he doesn't know the rule." The following season, NHL commissioner <a href="Gary%20Bettman">Gary Bettman</a> announced that video replays would no longer be used to judge if players are in the crease or not, and that it would be a judgment call by the officiating crew. After the season ended, Hašek contemplated retirement because of a combination of injuries and a desire to become more involved in his family life. The announcement stunned many of his teammates, particularly <a href="Michael%20Peca">Michael Peca</a> and <a href="Jason%20Woolley">Jason Woolley</a>.

In the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, Hašek was hampered by a nagging groin injury. He missed forty games and failed to win a major NHL award for the first time in several years. Though he healed in time for the playoffs, the Sabres were eliminated in the first round in five games by the Flyers. In <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season">2000–01</a>—his final season with Buffalo—Hašek set a modern era record by collecting his sixth Vezina Trophy. He also won his second William M. Jennings Trophy. The Sabres played Philadelphia in the first round of the playoffs again, where Hašek outplayed his 1998 Olympic back-up <a href="Roman%20%C4%8Cechm%C3%A1nek">Roman Čechmánek</a>. In the clinching sixth game, Hašek recorded a shutout against the Flyers. In the second round, the Sabres played a seven-game series against <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a>'s Penguins, which culminated with the Penguins winning the final game in overtime.

Before the start of <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">the next season</a>, Hašek was traded to the Detroit Red Wings in an attempt to lower the Sabres' payroll and to send Hašek to a more competitive team. He was dealt for <a href="Vyacheslav%20Kozlov">Vyacheslav Kozlov</a>, a first round selection in the <a href="2002%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2002 NHL Entry Draft</a> and future considerations, which eventually became the draft pick of <a href="Jim%20Slater%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Jim Slater</a>. During his <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20Detroit%20Red%20Wings%20season">first season with Detroit</a>, Hašek posted a career high 41 wins with just 15 losses, helping the Red Wings earn the President's Trophy with the league's best record. In the playoffs, he led the Wings past the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a>, the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>, the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> and eventually the <a href="Carolina%20Hurricanes">Carolina Hurricanes</a> in the finals to win the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>. During the conference finals against Colorado, he became the first goalie to be awarded an assist on an overtime game-winning goal in the post-season after passing the puck to Wings captain <a href="Steve%20Yzerman">Steve Yzerman</a>, who then assisted <a href="Fredrik%20Olausson">Fredrik Olausson</a> in scoring the final goal of the third game of that series. He also set a record for most shutouts in a post-season with six, broken the year after by <a href="Martin%20Brodeur">Martin Brodeur</a> with seven.

That summer, Hašek officially announced his retirement so that he could spend time with his family and other hobbies.
However, after Detroit's first round loss to the <a href="Mighty%20Ducks%20of%20Anaheim">Mighty Ducks of Anaheim</a> in the <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">following season</a>, he expressed his desire to play again. This created a difficult situation for the Red Wings, who had two years left on <a href="Curtis%20Joseph">Curtis Joseph</a>'s three-year $24 million contract, which had a no-trade clause. Detroit was also under pressure knowing that the rival Avalanche would be looking for a goalie to replace <a href="Patrick%20Roy">Patrick Roy</a> after his retirement. With <a href="Manny%20Legace">Manny Legace</a> also on the Wings' roster, Detroit now had three potential starting goalies.

In the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20Detroit%20Red%20Wings%20season">2003–04 season</a> Hašek injured his groin after playing just 14 games. On January 9, he and the team agreed he should rest his injury for two to four weeks. Hašek privately told general manager <a href="Ken%20Holland">Ken Holland</a> that he would not accept any pay while he was injured. On February 10, he announced that he was not going to continue to play that season, surprising the Red Wings management. He eventually revealed that he refused about $3 million of his $6 million salary. In April 2004, he underwent groin surgery in <a href="Prague">Prague</a>, and returned to his hometown of Pardubice to recuperate.

After his contract with the Red Wings expired, Hašek announced his intention to play for a Stanley Cup contender, and specifically named the Ottawa Senators as a possibility. On July 6, 2004, after trading <a href="Patrick%20Lalime">Patrick Lalime</a> to the St. Louis Blues, the Senators signed Hašek to a one-year deal.

During the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>, Hašek toured with the Primus Worldstars. Similar to the <a href="Ninety%20Nine%20All%20Stars%20Tour">tour</a> Wayne Gretzky and <a href="IMG%20%28business%29">IMG</a> formed during the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20lockout">1994–95 NHL lockout</a>, the Primus Worldstars Tour ran December 7–23, playing in seven different countries (Riga, Latvia; Moscow and St Petersburg, Russia; Bratislava, Slovakia; Bern, Switzerland; Karlstad, Jönköping and Linköping, Sweden; Oslo, Norway; Katowice, Poland) in ten scheduled games. The tour competed against all-star teams or club teams of each country.

Hašek played increasingly well for the Senators up until the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>. During the season, he reached <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20goaltenders%20with%20300%20wins">300 career wins</a>, and his GAA and save percentage were the second-best in the league. Upon departure to Turin, Hašek's equipment was accidentally left behind in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>. This caused Hašek to miss a number of practices with the <a href="Czech%20Republic%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Czech national team</a>. At the Winter Olympics, he injured his right <a href="adductor%20muscles%20of%20the%20hip">adductor muscle</a> while making a save in the first qualifying match against <a href="Germany%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics%23Ice%20hockey">Germany</a>, forcing him to leave the game after only 9 minutes and 25 seconds.
Hašek's injury caused him to miss the rest of the regular season and post-season, despite several rumours that he would return in time for <a href="2006%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">the playoffs</a>. He said that if he were to be re-signed, he would play for a base salary of $500,000 with bonuses.

After the Senators were eliminated in the second round, they opted not to re-sign Hašek.

On July 31, 2006, at the age of 41, Hašek joined the Red Wings for the second time. He signed a one-year $750,000 US
contract, with added bonuses if the team succeeded in the playoffs. He posted 38 wins and a 2.05 GAA while leading the Red Wings to
the number one seed in the <a href="Western%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Western Conference</a>. He also broke his own personal record by going 181 minutes and 17 seconds without allowing a goal.
Midway through the regular season, the team announced that to avoid injury and preserve Hašek for the playoffs, he would not play on consecutive nights. He played his first consecutive nights of the season on April 21 and 22 against the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> in games 5 and 6 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals. Hašek won both games, clinching the series for Detroit. In the next round against the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>, the Red Wings were on the road and down two games to one, but Hašek held the Sharks to three goals in the next three games. His 28-save shutout in game six was his 13th in postseason play and sent the Red Wings to the Western Conference finals against the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Anaheim Ducks</a>. However, Hašek and the Red Wings lost in six games to the Ducks, who eventually defeated the Ottawa Senators for the Stanley Cup.

Hašek contemplated retirement in the 2007 offseason, but on July 5, 2007, he signed a one-year contract with Detroit worth $2 million with up to $2 million in bonuses,
reportedly turning down $5 million for salary cap room for the rest of the Red Wings' roster.

During the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08 season</a>, Hašek was replaced by backup <a href="Chris%20Osgood">Chris Osgood</a>, who had originally been waived by the Red Wings to make way for Hašek before the 2001–02 season. When Hašek recovered and got back into his stride, Detroit chose to alternate goaltenders in tandem instead of designating either as the backup. Detroit head coach <a href="Mike%20Babcock">Mike Babcock</a> announced that Hašek was to start in the <a href="2008%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2008 playoffs</a>. Through the first two games against the <a href="Nashville%20Predators">Nashville Predators</a>, the Red Wings were victorious, but after a lackluster performance in the next two, Osgood was in goal for the remainder of the playoffs. Despite expressing disappointment at losing his starting position, Hašek maintained his professionalism in practice and continued to support his teammates, with <a href="Darren%20McCarty">Darren McCarty</a> citing a close relationship between Hašek and Osgood. Eventually the Red Wings beat the Penguins in six games for the Stanley Cup.

On June 9, 2008, Hašek announced his retirement from the NHL, only five days after winning his second Stanley Cup with the Red Wings, saying he lacked the motivation for another year in the NHL. With Osgood, the two were awarded the William M. Jennings Trophy for fewest goals against on a team in the season.

In April 2009, Hašek once again came out of retirement and signed a one-year contract with <a href="HC%20Moeller%20Pardubice">HC Moeller Pardubice</a>, the club where he started his long career. In the 2009–10 season he led his team to win the Czech league title. Hašek had three shutouts in the playoffs, one in the finals, while his Pardubice lost just one game in the playoffs before claiming 12 consecutive wins. For the 2010–11 hockey season, Hašek signed a one-year contract with <a href="HC%20Spartak%20Moscow">HC Spartak Moscow</a>.

On May 15, 2012, Czech website hokej.cz reported that Hašek had discussed playing for <a href="Pir%C3%A1ti%20Chomutov">Piráti Chomutov</a> after their promotion to the <a href="Czech%20Extraliga">Czech Extraliga</a>. On May 25, 2012, Czech sport website Deniksport reported that Hašek was considering a return to the NHL, possibly with the Red Wings or Tampa Bay Lightning. However, the start of the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NHL%20season">2012–13 NHL season</a> was delayed due to the <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NHL%20lockout">2012–13 NHL lockout</a> and Hašek announced his retirement on October 9, 2012.

The Sabres <a href="Buffalo%20Sabres%23Retired%20numbers">retired</a> Hašek's #39 jersey prior to a January 13, 2015 game against the Red Wings, making Hašek's number the seventh to be retired in Sabres history. In a ceremony held on January 27, 2017, during the All-Star Weekend in Los Angeles, Hašek was named one of the '<a href="100%20Greatest%20NHL%20Players">100 Greatest NHL Players</a>' in history.

Hašek's most memorable international performance came in the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%201998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998 Winter Olympics</a>, where he led the Czech national team to the gold medal. He allowed six goals in total, with only two of them coming in the medal round. Against <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> in the semifinals, Hašek stopped <a href="Theoren%20Fleury">Theoren Fleury</a>, <a href="Ray%20Bourque">Ray Bourque</a>, <a href="Joe%20Nieuwendyk">Joe Nieuwendyk</a>, <a href="Eric%20Lindros">Eric Lindros</a> and <a href="Brendan%20Shanahan">Brendan Shanahan</a> in a dramatic shootout win. He then shut out the <a href="Russia%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Russian team</a> 1–0 in the final game, stopping 20 shots. He was later announced as the best goaltender in the Olympics. After he won the gold, he was quoted as saying:

His play made him one of the most popular figures in the Czech Republic, so much so that residents chanted "Hašek to the castle!" in the streets, referring to the <a href="Prague%20Castle">Prague Castle</a>, the seat of the <a href="President%20of%20the%20Czech%20Republic">President of the Czech Republic</a>. In response to this, Hašek called the president <a href="V%C3%A1clav%20Havel">Václav Havel</a> and jokingly told him that his job was not in jeopardy.
He also helped to inspire an opera (titled "Nagano") about the Czech team's gold medal victory,
and in 2003, <a href="Petr%20Pravec">Petr Pravec</a> and <a href="Lenka%20%C5%A0arounov%C3%A1">Lenka Šarounová</a> named an <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a> (<a href="8217%20Dominikha%C5%A1ek">8217 Dominikhašek</a>) in his honour.

In the 2006 Winter Olympics in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy, Hašek played for just nine minutes and twenty-five seconds, until he injured his right adductor muscle.
Despite his absence, the Czechs managed to earn the bronze medal with backup goaltender <a href="Tom%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Vokoun">Tomáš Vokoun</a>, which Hašek received as well.

Hašek had an unorthodox <a href="Stand-up%20style">goaltending style</a>.
He was extraordinarily flexible and was jokingly described in a <a href="MasterCard">MasterCard</a> commercial as having "a <a href="Slinky">Slinky</a> for a spine".
In order to cover the bottom of the net, where most goals are scored, Hašek dropped down on almost every <a href="shot%20%28ice%20hockey%29">shot</a>. His "flopping" style was derived from him flailing in the crease, using every part of his body, including his head, to stop the puck. Hašek occasionally dropped his stick and covered the puck with his stick hand, whereas most goaltenders would use the glove hand instead.
In response to the speculation he received from his style, Hašek explained:

Hašek's unique style attracted fans to games.
Because of his flexibility, Hašek could make difficult saves that other goalies could not—an opposing coach once referred to them as "miracle saves". These types of saves include toe-stops and a maneuver known as the "Hašek roll". Hašek was also known for his strict regimen of <a href="Physical%20exercise">conditioning</a>. During the off-season between May and September 2006, he lost a considerable amount of weight to increase his flexibility. Hašek was one of the last goaltenders to wear a helmet-and-cage combo rather than a contemporary hybrid <a href="goalie%20mask">goalie mask</a>. The last was his former teammate Chris Osgood, who left the NHL three years after Hašek.

Hašek and his former wife Alena have a son named Michael (born 1990) and a daughter named Dominika (born 1994). He divides much of his free time playing <a href="squash%20%28sport%29">squash</a> and <a href="inline%20hockey">inline hockey</a>, where he plays defense. When he was younger, Hašek played competitive football as a midfielder, and was a junior <a href="tennis">tennis</a> champion in Eastern <a href="Bohemia">Bohemia</a>.
His brother <a href="Martin%20Ha%C5%A1ek">Martin</a> is also a competitive athlete and played for the Czech Republic football team <a href="AC%20Sparta%20Prague">AC Sparta Prague</a> before retiring and eventually deciding to coach. Cousin <a href="Ivan%20Ha%C5%A1ek">Ivan Hašek</a> also played professional football. Hobby-wise, Hašek claims that he has been a fan of professional wrestling since his Buffalo days, and says that he mostly follows his favorite wrestlers, <a href="Stone%20Cold%20Steve%20Austin">Stone Cold Steve Austin</a> and <a href="Don%20Muraco">Don "The Rock" Muraco</a>.

Because of his formal education, Hašek stands out among Czech sportsmen. He earned a <a href="Academic%20degree">university degree</a> after studying history and the <a href="Czech%20language">Czech language</a> in the Faculty of Education at the <a href="University%20of%20Hradec%20Kr%C3%A1lov%C3%A9">University of Hradec Králové</a>, which qualified him to be a teacher, and led him to teach high school classes. Hašek also had a brand of sportswear named "Dominator Clothing", which was launched shortly after the Nagano Olympics in 1998. It also had two locations in <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a> for a short time. However, sales were short, and the Dominator brand was forced out of business in 2008.
In May 2001, Hašek founded the "Dominik Hašek Youth Hockey League"/"Hašek's Heroes", and donated over $1 million to help underprivileged children in Buffalo play hockey.
He organized a charity hockey game in Prague in 1998, and donated the profits to hospitals in the Czech Republic.

Hašek was known to appreciate humor to keep team spirits up, and often jokes about his resemblance to <a href="Cosmo%20Kramer">Cosmo Kramer</a> of "<a href="Seinfeld">Seinfeld</a>". In the late 1990s, he was featured in a <a href="MasterCard">MasterCard</a> commercial that praised his flexibility. On November 26, 2006, <a href="Mark%20Parisi">Mark Parisi</a>'s <a href="comic%20panel">comic panel</a> "<a href="off%20the%20mark">off the mark</a>" featured a comic about Hašek's childhood.

In November 2012 Hašek announced divorce after 23 years of marriage.

Throughout his long career, Hašek was represented by agent <a href="Ritch%20Winter">Ritch Winter</a>.

During an inline hockey game on May 18, 2003, Hašek was accused of assaulting another player. He was playing as a defender for Bonfire Střída when he crosschecked <a href="Martin%20%C5%A0%C3%ADla">Martin Šíla</a>. The prosecutor in the case, Lenka Strnadová, ruled two months later that there was no evidence that Hašek intended bodily harm and recommended the case be treated as a misdemeanor, punishable only by fine ($95 USD maximum), rather than a felony where jail time would have been possible. Hašek's lawyer Pavel Jelínek announced in a statement that media reports about the incident were exaggerated, with Šíla not having sustained any documented injuries. In October 2003, the country's top prosecutor overruled Strnadová, saying her ruling was unlawful because the case had not been properly investigated. The Pardubice prosecution then investigated the case again, and reached the same decision as Strnadová.

Hašek earned his 300th National Hockey League win on October 15, 2005, in a 5–1 home victory with the Ottawa Senators over the Boston Bruins. He stopped 34 of 35 shots and was holding a shutout until Bruins forward <a href="Pat%20Leahy%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Pat Leahy</a> jammed a loose puck under him three minutes into the third period. He became the twenty-second goaltender to reach the milestone. He is the oldest goaltender in NHL history to post a 30-win season, and in 1997, he became the second goaltender to win the Lester B. Pearson Award for most outstanding player in the league (Mike Liut won the Lester B. Pearson Trophy as the league's MVP as determined by his peers in 1981). He is also the only goaltender to win the Hart Trophy twice for most valuable player, and was only one Vezina Trophy away from tying Jacques Plante's record of seven.

In nine seasons with the Buffalo Sabres, Hašek acquired over 25 franchise records, including most all-time games played, wins, shutouts and lowest goals against average. He also holds the Sabres' record for most shutouts in a single season with 13 in 1997–98, and lowest goals against average in a single season with a total of 1.87 in 1998–99. During the Detroit Red Wings' championship run in 2002, Hašek set franchise records for most games played, minutes played, wins and shutouts in a playoff year. He holds several notable NHL records:

One of the most impressive single-game performances by any player in NHL history came on April 27, 1994. Hašek made 70 saves in a four overtime shutout. The opposing goalie was Martin Brodeur, then a rookie, who made 49 saves before being beaten by <a href="Dave%20Hannan">Dave Hannan</a> and the Sabres beat New Jersey 1–0, which helped the Sabres to tie the series 3–3 in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Hašek's 70 saves set a record, which still stands, for the most saves in a game without allowing a goal.

Iranian Embassy siege

The Iranian Embassy siege took place from 30 April to 5 May 1980, after a group of six armed men stormed the <a href="Embassy%20of%20Iran%2C%20London">Iranian embassy</a> in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, London. The gunmen, members of Arabs of KSA group campaigning for Arab national sovereignty in the southern Iranian region of <a href="Khuzestan%20Province">Khuzestan Province</a>, took 26 people hostage, mostly embassy staff, but also several visitors, as well as a police officer who had been guarding the embassy. They demanded the release of Arab prisoners from prisons in Khuzestan and their own safe passage out of the United Kingdom.

<a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>'s <a href="First%20Thatcher%20ministry">government</a> quickly resolved that safe passage would not be granted, and a siege ensued. Over the following days, police negotiators secured the release of five hostages in exchange for minor concessions, such as the broadcasting of the hostage-takers' demands on British television.

By the sixth day of the siege the gunmen had become increasingly frustrated at the lack of progress in meeting their demands. That evening, they killed one of the hostages and threw his body out of the embassy. As a result, the government ordered the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS), a <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a> regiment of the British Army, to conduct an assault, known as Operation Nimrod, to rescue the remaining hostages. Shortly afterwards, SAS soldiers <a href="Abseiling">abseil</a>ed from the roof of the building and forced entry through the windows. During the 17-minute raid, they rescued all but one of the remaining hostages, and killed five of the six hostage-takers. The soldiers later faced accusations of unnecessarily killing two of the five, but an inquest into the deaths eventually cleared the SAS of any wrongdoing. The sole remaining gunman was prosecuted and served 27 years in British prisons.

The hostage-takers and their cause were largely forgotten after the <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a> broke out later that year and the <a href="Iran%20hostage%20crisis">hostage crisis in Tehran</a> continued until January 1981. Nonetheless, the operation brought the SAS to the public eye for the first time and bolstered the reputation of Thatcher. The SAS was quickly overwhelmed by the number of applications it received from people inspired by the operation and experienced greater demand for its expertise from foreign governments. The building, having suffered major damage from a fire that broke out during the assault, was not reopened as the Iranian embassy until 1993.

The hostage-takers were members of the <a href="Democratic%20Revolutionary%20Front%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Arabistan">Democratic Revolutionary Front for the Liberation of Arabistan</a> (DRFLA), Iranian Arabs protesting for the establishment of an autonomous Arab state in the southern region of the Iranian province of <a href="Kh%C5%ABzest%C4%81n%20Province">Khūzestān</a> which is home to an Arabic-speaking minority. The oil-rich area had become the source of much of Iran's wealth, having been developed by multi-national companies during the reign of the <a href="Shah">Shah</a>.

According to Oan Ali Mohammed, suppression of the Arab sovereignty movement was the spark that led to his desire to attack the Iranian Embassy in London. The plan was inspired by the <a href="Iran%20hostage%20crisis">Iran hostage crisis</a> in which supporters of the revolution held the staff of the American embassy in Tehran hostage.

Using Iraqi passports, Oan and three other members of the DRFLA arrived in London on 31 March 1980 and rented a flat in <a href="Earl%27s%20Court">Earl's Court</a>. They claimed they had met by chance on the flight. The men typically returned to the flat drunk, late at night, and sometimes accompanied by prostitutes. Within a week, the housekeeper asked them to leave. They soon found another flat, where they told their new landlord they were moving because they had been joined by other men and required larger accommodation. Over the following days, the group swelled, with up to a dozen men in the flat on one occasion.

Oan was 27 and from Khūzestān; he had studied at the <a href="University%20of%20Tehran">University of Tehran</a>, where he became politically active. He had been imprisoned by <a href="SAVAK">SAVAK</a>, the Shah's <a href="secret%20police">secret police</a>, and bore scars which he said were from torture in SAVAK custody. The other members of his group were Shakir Abdullah Radhil, known as "Faisal", Oan's second-in-command who also claimed to have been tortured by SAVAK; Shakir Sultan Said, or "Hassan"; Themir Moammed Hussein, or Abbas; Fowzi Badavi Nejad, or "Ali"; and Makki Hanoun Ali, the youngest of the group, who went by the name of "Makki".

On 30 April the men informed their landlord that they were going to <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a> for a week and then returning to Iraq, stated that they would no longer require the flat, and arranged for their belongings to be sent to Iraq. They left the building at 09:30 (<a href="British%20Summer%20Time">BST</a>) on 30 April. Their initial destination is unknown, but en route to the Iranian Embassy they collected firearms (including pistols and <a href="submachine%20gun">submachine gun</a>s), ammunition and hand grenades. The weapons, predominantly Soviet-made, are believed to have been smuggled into the United Kingdom in a <a href="diplomatic%20bag">diplomatic bag</a> belonging to Iraq. Shortly before 11:30, and almost two hours after vacating the nearby flat in <a href="Lexham%20Gardens">Lexham Gardens</a> in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, the six men arrived outside the embassy.

The <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS) is a regiment of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and part of the United Kingdom's <a href="special%20forces">special forces</a>. The regiment was formed by Colonel <a href="David%20Stirling">David Stirling</a> in Africa in 1941, at the height of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. Its original role was to penetrate enemy lines and strike at airfields and supply lines deep in enemy territory, first in North Africa and later around the Mediterranean and in occupied Europe. Stirling established the principle of using small teams, usually of just four men, to carry out raids, having realised that a four-man team could sometimes prove much more effective than a unit of hundreds of soldiers.

Western governments were prompted to form specialist anti-terrorist units following the "<a href="Munich%20massacre">Munich massacre</a>". During the 1972 Olympic Games, a firefight between a group of hostage-takers and West German police left a police officer and all the hostages dead. The British government, worried that the country was unprepared for a similar crisis in the United Kingdom, ordered the formation of the Counter Revolutionary Warfare (CRW) Wing of the SAS, which became the UK's primary anti-terrorist and anti-hijacking unit.

The SAS had taken part in counter-insurgency operations abroad since 1945, and had trained the bodyguards of influential people whose deaths would be contrary to British interests. Thus, it was believed to be better prepared for the role than any unit in the police or elsewhere in the armed forces. The CRW Wing's first operational experience was the storming of <a href="Lufthansa%20Flight%20181">Lufthansa Flight 181</a> in 1977, when a small detachment of soldiers were sent to assist <a href="GSG%209">GSG 9</a>, the elite West German police unit set up after the events of 1972.

At approximately 11:30 on Wednesday 30 April the six heavily armed members of DRFLA stormed the Iranian Embassy building on Princes Gate, <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>. The gunmen quickly overpowered <a href="Police%20Constable">Police Constable</a> Trevor Lock of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police">Metropolitan Police</a>'s <a href="Diplomatic%20Protection%20Group">Diplomatic Protection Group</a> (DPG). Lock was carrying a concealed <a href="Smith%20%26amp%3B%20Wesson">Smith & Wesson</a> .38-calibre revolver, but was unable to draw it before he was overpowered, although he did manage to press the "panic button" on his radio. Lock was later frisked, but the gunman conducting the search did not find the constable's weapon. He remained in possession of the revolver, and to keep it concealed refused to remove his coat, which he told the gunmen was to "preserve his image" as a police officer. The officer also refused offers of food throughout the siege for fear that the weapon would be seen if he had to use the toilet and a gunman decided to escort him.

Although the majority of the people in the embassy were captured, three managed to escape; two by climbing out of a ground-floor window and the third by climbing across a first-floor (second-floor in American dialect) parapet to the Ethiopian Embassy next door. A fourth person, Gholam-Ali Afrouz, the chargé d'affaires and thus most senior Iranian official present, briefly escaped by jumping out of a first-floor window, but was injured in the process and quickly captured. Afrouz and the 25 other hostages were all taken to a room on the second floor. The majority of the hostages were embassy staff, predominantly Iranian nationals, but several British employees were also captured. The other hostages were all visitors, with the exception of Lock, the British police officer guarding the embassy. Afrouz had been appointed to the position less than a year before, his predecessor having been dismissed after the revolution. Abbas Fallahi, who had been a butler before the revolution, was appointed the doorman by Afrouz. One of the British members of staff was Ron Morris, from <a href="Battersea">Battersea</a>, who had worked for the embassy in various positions since 1947.

During the course of the siege, police and journalists established the identities of several other hostages. <a href="Mustapha%20Karkouti">Mustapha Karkouti</a> was a journalist covering the crisis at the US Embassy in Tehran and was at the embassy for an interview with Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. Muhammad Hashir Faruqi was another journalist, at the embassy to interview Afrouz for an article on the Iranian Revolution. Simeon "Sim" Harris and Chris Cramer, both employees of the BBC, were at the embassy attempting to obtain visas to visit Iran, hoping to cover the aftermath of the 1979 revolution, after several unsuccessful attempts. They found themselves sitting next to Moutaba Mehrnavard, who was there to consult Ahmad Dadgar, the embassy's medical adviser, and Ali Asghar Tabatabai, who was collecting a map for use in a presentation he had been asked to give at the end of a course he had been attending.

Police arrived at the embassy almost immediately after the first reports of gunfire, and, within ten minutes, seven DPG officers were on the scene. The officers moved to surround the embassy, but retreated when a gunman appeared at a window and threatened to open fire. Deputy Assistant Commissioner <a href="John%20Dellow">John Dellow</a> arrived nearly 30 minutes later and took command of the operation. Dellow established a temporary headquarters in his car before moving it to the <a href="Royal%20School%20of%20Needlework">Royal School of Needlework</a> further down Princes Gate and then to 24 Princes Gate, a nursery school. From his various command posts, Dellow coordinated the police response, including the deployment of <a href="Specialist%20Firearms%20Command">D11</a>, the Metropolitan Police's marksmen, and officers with specialist surveillance equipment. Police negotiators made contact with Oan via a <a href="field%20telephone">field telephone</a> passed through one of the embassy windows, and were assisted by a negotiator and a psychiatrist. At 15:15 Oan issued the DRFLA's first demand, the release of 91 Arabs held in prisons in Khūzestān, and threatened to blow up the embassy and the hostages if this were not done by noon on 1 May.

Large numbers of journalists were on the scene quickly and were moved into a holding area to the west of the front of the embassy, while dozens of Iranian protesters also arrived near the embassy and remained there throughout the siege. Shortly after the beginning of the crisis, the British government's emergency committee <a href="Cabinet%20Office%20Briefing%20Room">COBRA</a>, was assembled. COBRA is made up of ministers, civil servants and expert advisers, including representatives from the police and the armed forces. The meeting was chaired by <a href="William%20Whitelaw%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Whitelaw">William Whitelaw</a>, the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, as <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>, the Prime Minister, was unavailable. The Iranian government accused the British and American governments of sponsoring the attack as revenge for the <a href="Iran%20hostage%20crisis">ongoing siege</a> of the US Embassy in Tehran. Given the lack of co-operation from Iran, Thatcher, kept apprised of the situation by Whitelaw, determined that British law would be applied to the embassy, despite the <a href="Vienna%20Convention%20on%20Diplomatic%20Relations">Vienna Convention</a>, under which the embassy is considered Iranian soil.

At 16:30, the gunmen released their first hostage, Frieda Mozaffarian. She had been unwell since the siege began, and Oan had asked for a doctor to be sent into the embassy to treat her, but the police refused. The other hostages deceived Oan into believing that Mozaffarian was pregnant, and Oan eventually released Mozaffarian after her condition deteriorated.

The COBRA meetings continued through the night and into Thursday. Meanwhile, two teams were dispatched from the headquarters of the <a href="Special%20Air%20Service">Special Air Service</a> (SAS) near <a href="Hereford">Hereford</a>, and arrived at a holding area in <a href="Regent%27s%20Park%20Barracks">Regent's Park Barracks</a>. The teams, from B Squadron, complemented by specialists from other squadrons, were equipped with CS gas, stun grenades, and explosives and armed with <a href="Browning%20Hi-Power">Browning Hi-Power</a> pistols and <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch%20MP5">Heckler & Koch MP5</a> submachine guns. <a href="Lieutenant-Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> <a href="Michael%20Rose%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Michael Rose</a>, commander of 22 SAS had travelled ahead of the detachment and introduced himself to Dellow, the commander of the police operation. At approximately 03:30 on 1 May, one of the SAS teams moved into the building next door to the embassy, normally occupied by the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20General%20Practitioners">Royal College of General Practitioners</a>, where they were briefed on Rose's "immediate action" plan, to be implemented should the SAS be required to storm the building before a more sophisticated plan could be formed.

Early in the morning of 1 May, the gunmen ordered one of the hostages to telephone the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>'s news desk. During the call, Oan took the receiver and spoke directly to the BBC journalist. He identified the group to which the gunmen belonged and stated that the non-Iranian hostages would not be harmed, but refused to allow the journalist to speak to any other hostages. At some point during the day, the police disabled the embassy's telephone lines, leaving the hostage-takers just the field telephone for outside communication. As the hostages woke up, Chris Cramer, a sound organiser for the BBC, appeared to become seriously ill. He and three other non-Arab hostages had decided one of them must get out, and to do this, he had convincingly exaggerated the symptoms of an existing illness. His colleague, Sim Harris, was taken to the field telephone to negotiate for a doctor. The police negotiator refused the request, instead telling Harris to persuade Oan to release Cramer. The ensuing negotiations between Harris, Oan, and the police took up most of the morning, and Cramer was eventually released at 11:15. He was rushed to hospital in an ambulance, accompanied by police officers sent to gather information from him.

As the deadline of noon approached, set the previous day for the release of the Arab prisoners, the police became convinced that the gunmen did not have the capability to carry out their threat of blowing up the embassy, and persuaded Oan to agree to a new deadline of 14:00. The police allowed the deadline to pass, to no immediate response from the gunmen. During the afternoon, Oan altered his demands, requesting that the British media broadcast a statement of the group's grievances and for ambassadors of three Arab countries to negotiate the group's safe passage out of the UK once the statement had been broadcast.

At approximately 20:00, Oan became agitated by noises coming from the Ethiopian Embassy next door. The noise came from technicians who were drilling holes in the wall to implant listening devices, but PC Trevor Lock, when asked to identify the sound, attributed it to mice. COBRA decided to create ambient noise to cover the sound created by the technicians and instructed <a href="British%20Gas%20plc">British Gas</a> to commence drilling in an adjacent road, supposedly to repair a gas main. The drilling was aborted after it agitated the gunmen, and instead <a href="British%20Airports%20Authority">British Airports Authority</a>, owner of <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a>, was told to instruct approaching aircraft to fly over the embassy at low altitude.

At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan appeared at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the <a href="telex">telex</a> system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak to somebody from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands; for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries, to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed that they should be broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The <a href="Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Office">Foreign and Commonwealth Office</a> informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.

Meanwhile, the police located the embassy caretaker and took him to their forward headquarters to brief the SAS and senior police officers. He informed them that the embassy's front door was reinforced by a steel security door, and that the windows on the ground floor and first floor were fitted with armoured glass, the result of recommendations made after the SAS had been asked to review security arrangements for the embassy several years earlier. Plans for entering the embassy by battering the front door and ground-floor windows were quickly scrapped and work began on other ideas.

Oan, angered by the BBC's incorrect reporting of his demands the previous evening, contacted the police negotiators shortly after 06:00 and accused the authorities of deceiving him. He demanded to speak with an Arab ambassador, but the negotiator on duty claimed that talks were still being arranged by the Foreign Office. Recognising the delaying tactic, Oan told the negotiator that the British hostages would be the last to be released because of the British authorities' deceit. He added that a hostage would be killed unless Tony Crabb was brought back to the embassy. Crabb did not arrive at the embassy until 15:30, nearly ten hours after Oan demanded his presence, to the frustration of both Oan and Sim Harris. Oan then relayed another statement to Crabb via Mustapha Karkouti, a journalist also being held hostage in the embassy. The police guaranteed that the statement would be broadcast on the BBC's next news bulletin, in exchange for the release of two hostages. The hostages decided amongst themselves that the two to be released would be Hiyech Kanji and Ali-Guil Ghanzafar; the former as she was pregnant and the latter for no other reason than his loud snoring, which kept the other hostages awake at night and irritated the terrorists.

Later in the evening, at approximately 23:00, an SAS team reconnoitred the roof of the embassy. They discovered a skylight, and succeeded in unlocking it for potential use as an access point, should they later be required to storm the building. They also attached ropes to the chimneys to allow soldiers to abseil down the building and gain access through the windows if necessary.

During the day, the Foreign Office held further talks with diplomats from Arabian countries in the hope of persuading them to go to the embassy and talk to the hostage-takers. The talks, hosted by <a href="Douglas%20Hurd">Douglas Hurd</a>, ended in stalemate. The diplomats insisted they must be able to offer safe passage out of the UK for the gunmen, believing this to be the only way to guarantee a peaceful outcome, but the British government was adamant that safe passage would not be considered under any circumstances. Karkhouti, through whom Oan had issued his revised demands the previous day, became increasingly ill throughout the day and by the evening was feverish, which led to suggestions that the police had spiked the food that had been sent into the embassy. John Dellow, the commander of the police operation, had apparently considered the idea and even consulted a doctor about its viability, but eventually dismissed it as "impracticable".

The SAS officers involved in the operation, including Brigadier <a href="Peter%20de%20la%20Billi%C3%A8re">Peter de la Billière</a>, <a href="Director%20Special%20Forces">Director Special Forces</a>, Lieutenant-Colonel Rose, Commander of 22 SAS, and Major Hector Gullan, commander of the team that would undertake any raid, spent the day refining their plans for an assault.

Oan woke Lock at dawn, convinced that an intruder was in the embassy. Lock was sent to investigate, but no intruder was found. Later in the morning, Oan called Lock to examine a bulge in the wall separating the Iranian embassy from the Ethiopian embassy next door. The bulge had, in fact, been caused by the removal of bricks to allow an assault team to break through the wall and to implant listening devices, resulting in a weakening of the wall. Although Lock assured him that he did not believe the police were about to storm the building, Oan remained convinced that they were "up to something" and moved the male hostages from the room in which they had spent the last four days to another down the hall. Tensions rose throughout the morning and, at 13:00, Oan told the police that he would kill a hostage unless he was able to speak to an Arab ambassador within 45 minutes. At 13:40, Lock informed the negotiator that the gunmen had taken Abbas Lavasani, the embassy's chief press officer, downstairs and were preparing to execute him. Lavasani, a devout believer in the <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a>, had repeatedly provoked his captors during the siege. According to Lock, Lavasani stated that "if they were going to kill a hostage, [Lavasani] wanted it to be him." At exactly 13:45, 45 minutes after Oan's demand to speak to an ambassador, three shots were heard from inside the embassy.

Home Secretary Willie Whitelaw, who had been chairing COBRA during the siege, was rushed back to Whitehall from a function he had been attending in <a href="Slough">Slough</a>, roughly away, arriving 19 minutes after the shots had been reported. He was briefed on the SAS plan by de la Billière, who told him to expect that up to 40 percent of the hostages would be killed in an assault. After deliberations, Whitelaw instructed the SAS to prepare to assault the building at short notice, an order that was received by Lieutenant-Colonel Rose at 15:50. By 17:00, the SAS were in a position to assault the embassy at ten minutes' notice. The police negotiators recruited the imam from a local mosque at 18:20, fearing that a "crisis point" had been reached, and asked him to talk to the gunmen. Three further shots were fired during the course of the imam's conversation with Oan. Oan announced that a hostage had been killed, and the rest would die in 30 minutes unless his demands were met. A few minutes later, Lavasani's body was dumped out of the front door. Upon a preliminary examination, conducted at the scene, a forensic pathologist estimated that Lavasani had been dead for at least an hour, meaning he could not have been killed by the three most recent shots, and leading the police to believe that two hostages had been killed. In fact, only Lavasani had been shot.

After Lavasani's body had been recovered, <a href="David%20McNee">Sir David McNee</a>, Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, contacted the Home Secretary to request approval to hand control of the operation over to the British Army, under the provisions of <a href="Military%20Aid%20to%20the%20Civil%20Authorities%23Military%20Aid%20to%20the%20Civil%20Power">Military Aid to the Civil Power</a>. Whitelaw relayed the request to Thatcher, and the prime minister agreed immediately. Thus John Dellow, the ranking police officer at the embassy, signed over control of the operation to Lieutenant-Colonel Rose at 19:07, authorising Rose to order an assault at his discretion. Meanwhile, the police negotiators began stalling Oan. They offered concessions in order to distract him and prevent him killing further hostages, buying time for the SAS to make its final preparations for the now-inevitable assault.

The two SAS teams on-scene, Red Team and Blue Team, were ordered to begin their simultaneous assaults, under the codename Operation Nimrod, at 19:23. One group of four men from Red Team abseiled from the roof down the rear of the building, while another four-man team lowered a <a href="stun%20grenade">stun grenade</a> through the skylight. The detonation of the stun grenade was supposed to coincide with the abseiling teams detonating explosives to gain entry to the building through the second-floor windows. Their descent had not gone according to plan and the <a href="staff%20sergeant">staff sergeant</a> leading the abseilers became entangled in his rope. While trying to assist him, one of the other soldiers had accidentally smashed a window with his foot. The noise of the breaking window alerted Oan, who was on the first floor communicating with the police negotiators, and he went to investigate. The soldiers were unable to use explosives for fear of injuring their stranded staff sergeant, but managed to smash their way into the embassy.

After the first three soldiers entered, a fire started and travelled up the curtains and out of the second-floor window, severely burning the staff sergeant. A second wave of abseilers cut him free, and he fell to the balcony below before entering the embassy behind the rest of his team. Slightly behind Red Team, Blue Team detonated explosives on a first-floor window; forcing Sim Harris, who had just run into the room, to take cover. Much of the operation at the front of the embassy took place in full view of the assembled journalists and was broadcast on live television, thus Harris's escape across the parapet of a first-floor balcony was famously captured on video.

As the soldiers emerged onto the first-floor landing, Lock tackled Oan to prevent him attacking the SAS men. Oan, still armed, was subsequently shot dead by one of the soldiers. Meanwhile, further teams entered the embassy through the back door and cleared the ground floor and cellar. The SAS then began evacuating hostages, manhandling them down the stairs towards the back door of the embassy. Two of the terrorists were hiding amongst the hostages; one of them produced a hand grenade when he was identified. An SAS soldier, who was unable to shoot for fear of hitting a hostage or another soldier, pushed the grenade-wielding terrorist to the bottom of the stairs, where two other soldiers shot him dead.

The raid lasted seventeen minutes and involved 30 to 35 soldiers. The terrorists killed one hostage and seriously wounded two others during the raid while the SAS killed all but one of the terrorists. The rescued hostages and the remaining terrorist, who was still concealed amongst them, were taken into the embassy's back garden and restrained on the ground while they were identified. The last terrorist was identified by Sim Harris and led away by the SAS.

After the end of the siege, PC Trevor Lock was widely considered a hero. He was awarded the <a href="George%20Medal">George Medal</a>, the United Kingdom's second-highest civil honour, for his conduct during the siege and for tackling Oan during the SAS raid, the only time during the siege that he drew his concealed side arm. In addition, he was honoured with the <a href="Freedom%20of%20the%20City%20of%20London">Freedom of the City of London</a> and in a motion in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">House of Commons</a>. Police historian Michael J. Waldren, referring to the television series "<a href="Dixon%20of%20Dock%20Green">Dixon of Dock Green</a>", suggested that Lock's restraint in the use of his revolver was "a defining example of the power of the Dixon image", and Maurice Punch noted the contrast between Lock's actions and the highly aggressive tactics of the SAS.

Sergeant Tommy Palmer was awarded the <a href="Queen%27s%20Gallantry%20Medal">Queen's Gallantry Medal</a> for his part in the assault, in which he shot dead a terrorist who was apparently about to throw a grenade amongst the hostages. After the operation concluded, the staff sergeant who was caught in his abseil rope was treated at <a href="St%20Stephen%27s%20Hospital">St Stephen's Hospital</a> in <a href="Fulham">Fulham</a>. He suffered serious burns to his legs, but went on to make a full recovery.

The Iranian government welcomed the end of the siege, and declared that the two hostages killed were martyrs for the Iranian Revolution. They also thanked the British government for "the persevering action of your police force during the unjust hostage-taking event at the Embassy".

After the assault concluded, the police conducted an investigation into the siege and the deaths of the two hostages and five terrorists, including the actions of the SAS. The soldiers' weapons were taken away for examination and, the following day, the soldiers themselves were interviewed at length by the police at the regiment's base in Hereford. There was controversy over the deaths of two terrorists in the telex room, where the male hostages were held. Hostages later said in interviews that they had persuaded their captors to surrender and television footage appeared to show them throwing weapons out of the window and holding a <a href="white%20flag">white flag</a>. The two SAS soldiers who killed the men both stated at the <a href="Inquests%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">inquest</a> into the terrorists' deaths that they believed the men had been reaching for weapons before they were shot. The inquest jury reached the verdict that the soldiers' actions were <a href="justifiable%20homicide">justifiable homicide</a> (later known as "lawful killing").

Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by <a href="ITN">ITN</a> technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to <a href="life%20imprisonment">life imprisonment</a> for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005.

As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but <a href="Article%203%20of%20the%20European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">Article 3</a> of the <a href="European%20Convention%20on%20Human%20Rights">European Convention on Human Rights</a>, incorporated into British law by the <a href="Human%20Rights%20Act%201998">Human Rights Act 1998</a>, has been held by the <a href="European%20Court%20of%20Human%20Rights">European Court of Human Rights</a> to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given <a href="political%20asylum">political asylum</a>. The <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> released a statement, saying "We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the <a href="Human%20Rights%20Act%201998">Human Rights Act 1998</a>. He now lives in Peckham, south London, having assumed another identity.

The SAS raid, codenamed "Operation Nimrod", was broadcast live at peak time on a <a href="bank%20holiday">bank holiday</a> Monday evening and was viewed by millions of people, mostly in the UK, making it a defining moment in <a href="British%20history">British history</a>. Both the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and <a href="ITV%20%28TV%20network%29">ITV</a> interrupted their scheduled programming to show the end of the siege, which proved to be a major career break for several journalists. <a href="Kate%20Adie">Kate Adie</a>, the BBC's duty reporter at the embassy when the SAS assault began, went on to <a href="War%20correspondent">report from war zones across the world</a> and eventually to become chief news correspondent for <a href="BBC%20News">BBC News</a>, while <a href="David%20A.%20Goldsmith">David Goldsmith</a> and his team, responsible for the hidden camera at the back of the embassy, were awarded a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> for their coverage. The success of the operation, combined with the high-profile it was given by the media, invoked a sense of national pride compared to <a href="Victory%20in%20Europe%20Day">Victory in Europe Day</a>, the end of the Second World War in Europe. The operation was declared "an almost unqualified success". Margaret Thatcher recalled that she was congratulated wherever she went over the following days, and received messages of support and congratulation from other world leaders. However, the incident strained already-tense <a href="relations%20between%20the%20UK%20and%20Iran">relations between the UK and Iran</a> following the Iranian Revolution. The Iranian government declared that the siege of the embassy was planned by the British and American governments, and that the hostages who had been killed were martyrs for the Revolution.

Operation Nimrod brought the SAS, a regiment that was largely unknown at the time owing to the <a href="Special%20forces">covert nature</a> of its operations, into the public eye. The regiment was not pleased with its new high profile, having enjoyed its previous obscurity. Nonetheless, the operation vindicated the SAS, which had been threatened with disbandment and whose use of resources had previously been considered a waste. The regiment was quickly overwhelmed by new applicants. Membership of 22 SAS is open only to individuals currently serving in the Armed Forces (allowing applications from any individual in any service), but the unit also has two regiments from the volunteer <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> (TA): 21 SAS and 23 SAS. Both the TA regiments received hundreds more applications than in previous years, prompting <a href="Peter%20de%20la%20Billi%C3%A8re">de la Billière</a> to remark that the applicants seemed "convinced that a <a href="balaclava%20helmet">balaclava helmet</a> and a <a href="Heckler%20%26amp%3B%20Koch">Heckler & Koch</a> sub-machine gun would be handed to them over the counter, so that they could go off and conduct embassy-style sieges of their own". All three units were forced to introduce additional fitness tests at the start of the application process. The SAS also experienced an increased demand for their expertise in training the forces of friendly countries and those whose collapse was considered not to be in Britain's interest.

The British government's response to the crisis, and the successful use of force to end it, strengthened the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> government of the day and boosted Thatcher's personal credibility. McNee believed that the conclusion of the siege exemplified the British government's policy of refusing to give in to terrorist demands, "nowhere was the effectiveness of this response to terrorism more effectively demonstrated".

The embassy building was severely damaged by fire. It was more than a decade before the British and <a href="Iranian%20government">Iranian government</a>s came to an agreement whereby the United Kingdom would repair the damage to the embassy in London and Iran would pay for repairs to the <a href="British%20embassy%20in%20Tehran">British embassy in Tehran</a>, which had been damaged during the 1979 <a href="Iranian%20Revolution">Iranian Revolution</a>. Iranian diplomats began working from 16 Princes Gate again in December 1993.

The DRFLA was undermined by its links with the <a href="Iraqi%20government">Iraqi government</a> after it emerged that Iraq had sponsored the training and equipping of the hostage-takers. The <a href="Iran%E2%80%93Iraq%20War">Iran–Iraq War</a> started five months after the end of the siege and continued for eight years. The campaign for autonomy of <a href="Kh%C5%ABzest%C4%81n">Khūzestān</a> was largely forgotten in the wake of the hostilities, as was the DRFLA.

Linezolid

Linezolid is an <a href="antibiotic">antibiotic</a> used for the treatment of <a href="infection">infection</a>s caused by <a href="Gram-positive%20bacteria">Gram-positive bacteria</a> that are <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">resistant</a> to other antibiotics. Linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including <a href="Streptococcus">streptococci</a>, <a href="vancomycin-resistant%20enterococcus">vancomycin-resistant enterococci</a> (VRE), and <a href="methicillin-resistant%20Staphylococcus%20aureus">methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus"</a> (MRSA). The main uses are infections of the <a href="skin">skin</a> and <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> although it may be used for a variety of other infections including <a href="drug%20resistant%20tuberculosis">drug resistant tuberculosis</a>. It is used either by <a href="intravenous">injection into a vein</a> or by mouth.
When given for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe antibiotic. It can be used in people of all ages and in people with <a href="liver%20disease">liver disease</a> or <a href="renal%20failure">poor kidney function</a>. Common side effects with short-term use include <a href="headache">headache</a>, <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>, rash, and <a href="nausea">nausea</a>. Serious side effects may include <a href="serotonin%20syndrome">serotonin syndrome</a>, <a href="bone%20marrow%20suppression">bone marrow suppression</a>, and <a href="lactic%20acidosis">high blood lactate levels</a>, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods it may cause <a href="chemotherapy-induced%20peripheral%20neuropathy">nerve damage</a>, including <a href="optic%20neuropathy">optic nerve damage</a>, which may be irreversible.
As a <a href="protein%20synthesis%20inhibitor">protein synthesis inhibitor</a>, linezolid works by suppressing <a href="Prokaryotic%20translation">bacterial protein production</a>. This either <a href="bacteriostatic">stops growth</a> or results in <a href="bactericidal">bacterial death</a>. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact <a href="mechanism%20of%20action">mechanism of action</a> of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the initiation of protein production, rather than one of the later steps. As of 2014, <a href="bacterial%20resistance">bacterial resistance</a> to linezolid has remained low. Linezolid is a member of the <a href="2-Oxazolidone">oxazolidinone</a> class of medications.
Linezolid was discovered in the mid 1990s, and was approved for commercial use in 2000. It is on the <a href="World%20Health%20Organization%27s%20List%20of%20Essential%20Medicines">World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines</a>, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. Linezolid is available as a <a href="generic%20medication">generic medication</a>. The wholesale cost in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a> is about US$2.90 per day, while that in the United States in 2016 was about US$13.79 per day. It appears to be more <a href="Cost-effectiveness%20analysis%23CEA%20in%20pharmacoeconomics">cost-effective</a> than alternatives such as <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a>, mostly because of the ability to switch from <a href="intravenous%20therapy">intravenous use</a> to <a href="Route%20of%20administration">administration by mouth</a> sooner.
The main use of linezolid is the treatment of severe infections caused by <a href="Aerobic%20organism">aerobic</a> <a href="Gram-positive%20bacteria">Gram-positive bacteria</a> that are <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">resistant</a> to other antibiotics; it should not be used against bacteria that are sensitive to drugs with a narrower spectrum of activity, such as <a href="penicillin">penicillin</a>s and <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>s. In both the popular press and the scientific literature, linezolid has been called a "reserve antibiotic"—one that should be used sparingly so that it will remain effective as a <a href="drug%20of%20last%20resort">drug of last resort</a> against potentially intractable infections.

In the United States, the indications for linezolid use approved by the U.S. <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) are the treatment of <a href="vancomycin-resistant%20Enterococcus">vancomycin-resistant "Enterococcus"</a> <a href="Enterococcus%20faecium">"faecium"</a> <a href="infections">infections</a>, with or without <a href="bacteremia">bacterial invasion of the bloodstream</a>; <a href="nosocomial%20pneumonia">nosocomial pneumonia</a> (hospital-acquired) and <a href="community-acquired%20pneumonia">community-acquired pneumonia</a> caused by "S. aureus" or "S. pneumoniae"; <a href="complicated%20skin%20and%20skin%20structure%20infection">complicated skin and skin structure infection</a>s (cSSSI) caused by susceptible bacteria, including <a href="diabetic%20foot">diabetic foot</a> infection, unless complicated by <a href="osteomyelitis">osteomyelitis</a> (infection of the bone and bone marrow); and "uncomplicated" skin and soft tissue infections caused by "S. pyogenes" or "S. aureus". The manufacturer advises against the use of linezolid for community-acquired pneumonia or "uncomplicated" skin and soft tissue infections caused by MRSA. In the United Kingdom, pneumonia and cSSSIs are the only indications noted in the product labeling.

Linezolid appears to be as safe and effective for use in children and newborns as it is in adults.

A large <a href="meta-analysis">meta-analysis</a> of randomized controlled trials found linezolid to be more effective than glycopeptide antibiotics (such as vancomycin and <a href="teicoplanin">teicoplanin</a>) and <a href="beta-lactam%20antibiotic">beta-lactam antibiotic</a>s in the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) caused by Gram-positive bacteria, and smaller studies appear to confirm its superiority over teicoplanin in the treatment of all serious Gram-positive infections.

In the treatment of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to be cheaper and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 <a href="open-label%20study">open-label study</a>, it was as effective as <a href="ampicillin/sulbactam">ampicillin/sulbactam</a> and <a href="Amoxicillin/clavulanic%20acid">Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid</a>, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no <a href="osteomyelitis">osteomyelitis</a>, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.

Some authors have recommended that combinations of cheaper or more cost-effective drugs (such as <a href="co-trimoxazole">co-trimoxazole</a> with <a href="rifampicin">rifampicin</a> or <a href="clindamycin">clindamycin</a>) be tried before linezolid in the treatment of SSTIs when susceptibility of the causative organism allows it.

No significant difference appears in treatment success rates between linezolid, glycopeptides, or appropriate beta-lactam antibiotics in the treatment of pneumonia. <a href="Medical%20guideline">Clinical guideline</a>s for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia developed by the <a href="American%20Thoracic%20Society">American Thoracic Society</a> and the <a href="Infectious%20Diseases%20Society%20of%20America">Infectious Diseases Society of America</a> recommend that linezolid be reserved for cases in which MRSA has been confirmed as the causative organism, or when MRSA infection is suspected based on the clinical presentation. The guidelines of the <a href="British%20Thoracic%20Society">British Thoracic Society</a> do not recommend it as first-line treatment, but rather as an alternative to vancomycin. Linezolid is also an acceptable second-line treatment for community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia when penicillin resistance is present.

U.S. guidelines recommend either linezolid or vancomycin as the first-line treatment for hospital-acquired (nosocomial) MRSA pneumonia. Some studies have suggested that linezolid is better than vancomycin against nosocomial pneumonia, particularly <a href="ventilator-associated%20pneumonia">ventilator-associated pneumonia</a> caused by MRSA, perhaps because the penetration of linezolid into bronchial fluids is much higher than that of vancomycin. Several issues in study design have been raised, however, calling into question results that suggest the superiority of linezolid. Regardless, linezolid's advantages include its high <a href="oral%20bioavailability">oral bioavailability</a>—which allows easy switching to oral therapy—and the fact that poor kidney function is not an obstacle to use. In contrast, achieving the correct dosage of vancomycin in patients with <a href="renal%20failure">renal insufficiency</a> is very difficult.

It is traditionally believed that so-called "deep" infections—such as osteomyelitis or <a href="infective%20endocarditis">infective endocarditis</a>—should be treated with bactericidal antibiotics, not bacteriostatic ones. Nevertheless, preclinical studies were conducted to assess the efficacy of linezolid for these infections, and the drug has been used successfully to treat them in clinical practice. Linezolid appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option for infective endocarditis caused by multi-resistant Gram-positive bacteria, despite a lack of high-quality evidence to support this use. Results in the treatment of enterococcal endocarditis have varied, with some cases treated successfully and others not responding to therapy. <a href="Evidence-based%20medicine%23Qualification%20of%20evidence">Low- to medium-quality evidence</a> is also mounting for its use in bone and joint infections, including chronic osteomyelitis, although adverse effects are a significant concern when long-term use is necessary.

In combination with other drugs, linezolid has been used to <a href="Tuberculosis%20treatment">treat tuberculosis</a>. The optimal dose for this purpose has not been established. In adults, daily and twice-daily dosing have been used to good effect. Many months of treatment are often required, and the rate of adverse effects is high regardless of dosage. There is not enough reliable evidence of efficacy and safety to support this indication as a routine use.

Linezolid has been studied as an alternative to vancomycin in the treatment of <a href="febrile%20neutropenia">febrile neutropenia</a> in cancer patients when Gram-positive infection is suspected. It is also one of few antibiotics that diffuse into the <a href="vitreous%20humor">vitreous humor</a>, and may therefore be effective in treating <a href="endophthalmitis">endophthalmitis</a> (inflammation of the inner linings and cavities of the eye) caused by susceptible bacteria. Again, there is little evidence for its use in this setting, as infectious endophthalmitis is treated widely and effectively with vancomycin <a href="intravitreal%20administration">injected directly into the eye</a>.

In animal studies of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> caused by "Streptococcus pneumoniae", linezolid was found to penetrate well into <a href="cerebrospinal%20fluid">cerebrospinal fluid</a>, but its effectiveness was inferior to that of other antibiotics. There does not appear to be enough high-quality evidence to support the routine use of linezolid to treat bacterial meningitis. Nonetheless, it has been used successfully in many cases of <a href="central%20nervous%20system">central nervous system</a> infection—including meningitis—caused by susceptible bacteria, and has also been suggested as a reasonable choice for this indication when treatment options are limited or when other antibiotics have failed. The guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommend linezolid as the first-line drug of choice for VRE meningitis, and as an alternative to vancomycin for MRSA meningitis. Linezolid appears superior to vancomycin in treating community-acquired MRSA infections of the central nervous system, although very few cases of such infections have been published ().

In March 2007, the FDA reported the results of a <a href="randomized%20controlled%20trial">randomized</a>, <a href="open-label%20trial">open-label</a>, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of <a href="central%20venous%20catheter%23Infection">catheter-related bloodstream infections</a>. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to <a href="oxacillin">oxacillin</a> or <a href="dicloxacillin">dicloxacillin</a> if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in both groups (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009.

Linezolid was associated with <a href="statistical%20significance">significant</a>ly greater mortality than the comparator antibiotics. When data from all participants were pooled, the study found that 21.5% of those given linezolid died, compared to 16% of those not receiving it. The difference was found to be due to the inferiority of linezolid in the treatment of Gram-negative infections alone or mixed Gram-negative/Gram-positive infections. In participants whose infection was due to Gram-positive bacteria alone, linezolid was as safe and effective as vancomycin. In light of these results, the FDA issued an alert reminding healthcare professionals that linezolid is not approved for the treatment of catheter-related infections or infections caused by Gram-negative organisms, and that more appropriate therapy should be instituted whenever a Gram-negative infection is confirmed or suspected.

In adults and children over the age of 12, linezolid is usually given every 12 hours, whether orally or intravenously. In younger children and infants, it is given every eight hours. No dosage adjustments are required in the elderly, in people with mild-to-moderate liver failure, or in those with impaired kidney function. In people requiring <a href="hemodialysis">hemodialysis</a>, care should be taken to give linezolid after a session, because dialysis removes 30–40% of a dose from the body; no dosage adjustments are needed in people undergoing <a href="hemofiltration">continuous hemofiltration</a>, although more frequent administration may be warranted in some cases. According to one study, linezolid may need to be given more frequently than normal in people with <a href="burn">burn</a>s affecting more than 20% of <a href="total%20body%20surface%20area">body area</a>, due to increased nonrenal clearance of the drug.

Linezolid is in U.S. <a href="pregnancy%20category">pregnancy category</a> C, meaning there have been no adequate studies of its safety when used by pregnant women, and although animal studies have shown mild toxicity to the fetus, the benefits of using the drug may outweigh its risks. It also passes into <a href="breast%20milk">breast milk</a>, although the clinical significance of this (if any) is unknown.

Linezolid is effective against all clinically important Gram-positive <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>—those whose <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a> contains a thick layer of <a href="peptidoglycan">peptidoglycan</a> and no <a href="bacterial%20outer%20membrane">outer membrane</a>—notably "<a href="Enterococcus%20faecium">Enterococcus faecium</a>" and "<a href="Enterococcus%20faecalis">Enterococcus faecalis</a>" (including <a href="vancomycin-resistant%20enterococcus">vancomycin-resistant enterococci</a>), "Staphylococcus aureus" (including methicillin-resistant "Staphylococcus aureus", MRSA), "<a href="Streptococcus%20agalactiae">Streptococcus agalactiae</a>", "<a href="Streptococcus%20pneumoniae">Streptococcus pneumoniae</a>", "<a href="Streptococcus%20pyogenes">Streptococcus pyogenes</a>", the <a href="Streptococcus%23Viridans%20and%20others">"viridans" group streptococci</a>, "<a href="Listeria%20monocytogenes">Listeria monocytogenes</a>", and "<a href="Corynebacterium">Corynebacterium</a>" species (the latter being among the most susceptible to linezolid, with <a href="minimum%20inhibitory%20concentration">minimum inhibitory concentration</a>s routinely below 0.5 mg/L). Linezolid is also highly active "<a href="in%20vitro">in vitro</a>" against several <a href="Mycobacterium">mycobacteria</a>. It appears to be very effective against "<a href="Nocardia">Nocardia</a>", but because of high cost and potentially serious adverse effects, authors have recommended that it be combined with other antibiotics or reserved for cases that have failed traditional treatment.

Linezolid is considered <a href="bacteriostatic%20agent">bacteriostatic</a> against most organisms—that is, it stops their growth and reproduction without actually killing them—but has some <a href="bactericide">bactericidal</a> (killing) activity against streptococci. Some authors have noted that, despite its bacteriostatic effect "in vitro", linezolid "behaves" as a bactericidal antibiotic "in vivo" because it inhibits the production of <a href="exotoxin">toxin</a>s by staphylococci and streptococci. It also has a <a href="antimicrobial%20pharmacodynamics">post-antibiotic effect</a> lasting one to four hours for most bacteria, meaning that bacterial growth is temporarily suppressed even after the drug is discontinued.

Linezolid has no clinically significant effect on most <a href="Gram-negative%20bacteria">Gram-negative bacteria</a>. "<a href="Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a>" and the <a href="Enterobacteriaceae">Enterobacteriaceae</a>, for instance, are not susceptible. "In vitro", it is active against "<a href="Pasteurella%20multocida">Pasteurella multocida</a>", "<a href="Fusobacterium">Fusobacterium</a>", "<a href="Moraxella%20catarrhalis">Moraxella catarrhalis</a>", "<a href="Legionella">Legionella</a>", "<a href="Bordetella">Bordetella</a>", and "<a href="Elizabethkingia%20meningoseptica">Elizabethkingia meningoseptica</a>", and moderately active (having a minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of strains of 8 mg/L) against "<a href="Haemophilus%20influenzae">Haemophilus influenzae</a>". It has also been used to great effect as a second-line treatment for "<a href="Capnocytophaga">Capnocytophaga</a>" infections.

Linezolid's spectrum of activity against Gram-positive bacteria is similar to that of the <a href="glycopeptide%20antibiotic">glycopeptide antibiotic</a> <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a>, which has long been the standard for treatment of MRSA infections, and the two drugs are often compared. Other comparable antibiotics include glycopeptide antibiotics such as <a href="teicoplanin">teicoplanin</a> (trade name Targocid), <a href="dalbavancin">dalbavancin</a> (Dalvance), and <a href="telavancin">telavancin</a> (Vibativ); <a href="quinupristin/dalfopristin">quinupristin/dalfopristin</a> (Synercid, a combination of two <a href="streptogramin">streptogramin</a>s, not active against "E. faecalis"); <a href="daptomycin">daptomycin</a> (Cubicin, a <a href="lipopeptide">lipopeptide</a>); and <a href="ceftobiprole">ceftobiprole</a> (Zevtera, a 5th-generation <a href="cephalosporin">cephalosporin</a>). Linezolid is the only one that can be taken by mouth for the treatment of systemic infections. In the future, <a href="oritavancin">oritavancin</a> and <a href="iclaprim">iclaprim</a> may be useful oral alternatives to linezolid—both are in the early stages of clinical development.

When used for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe drug. Common <a href="Adverse%20drug%20reaction">side effects</a> of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). Fungal infections such as <a href="Oral%20candidiasis">thrush</a> and <a href="candidal%20vulvovaginitis">vaginal candidiasis</a> may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called <a href="antibiotic%20candidiasis">antibiotic candidiasis</a>). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, <a href="pancreatitis">pancreatitis</a>, and <a href="elevated%20transaminases">elevated transaminases</a>, which may be a sign of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as <a href="erythromycin">erythromycin</a> and the <a href="quinolone%20antibiotic">quinolones</a>, linezolid has no effect on the <a href="QT%20interval">QT interval</a>, a measure of <a href="electrocardiography">cardiac electrical conduction</a>. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.

Like nearly all antibiotics, linezolid has been associated with <a href="Clostridium%20difficile%20colitis">"Clostridium difficile"-associated diarrhea</a> (CDAD) and <a href="pseudomembranous%20colitis">pseudomembranous colitis</a>, although the latter is uncommon, occurring in about one in two thousand patients in clinical trials. "C. difficile" appears to be susceptible to linezolid "in vitro", and linezolid was even considered as a possible treatment for CDAD.

<a href="Bone%20marrow%20suppression">Bone marrow suppression</a>, characterized particularly by <a href="thrombocytopenia">thrombocytopenia</a> (low platelet count), may occur during linezolid treatment; it appears to be the only adverse effect that occurs <a href="statistical%20significance">significantly</a> more frequently with linezolid than with glycopeptides or beta-lactams. It is uncommon in patients who receive the drug for 14 days or fewer, but occurs much more frequently in patients who receive longer courses or who have renal failure. A 2004 <a href="case%20report">case report</a> suggested that <a href="pyridoxine">pyridoxine</a> (a form of <a href="vitamin%20B6">vitamin B</a>) could reverse the anemia and thrombocytopenia caused by linezolid, but a later, larger study found no protective effect.

Long-term use of linezolid has also been associated with <a href="chemotherapy-induced%20peripheral%20neuropathy">chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy</a>, a progressive and enduring often irreversible tingling numbness, intense pain, and hypersensitivity to cold, beginning in the hands and feet and sometimes involving the arms and legs. Chemotherapy drugs associated with CIPN include <a href="thalidomide">thalidomide</a>, the <a href="epothilone">epothilone</a>s such as <a href="ixabepilone">ixabepilone</a>, the <a href="vinca%20alkaloid">"vinca" alkaloids</a> <a href="vincristine">vincristine</a> and <a href="vinblastine">vinblastine</a>, the <a href="taxane">taxane</a>s <a href="paclitaxel">paclitaxel</a> and <a href="docetaxel">docetaxel</a>, the <a href="proteasome%20inhibitor">proteasome inhibitor</a>s such as <a href="bortezomib">bortezomib</a>, and the platinum-based drugs <a href="cisplatin">cisplatin</a>, <a href="oxaliplatin">oxaliplatin</a> and <a href="carboplatin">carboplatin</a>. and <a href="optic%20neuropathy">optic neuropathy</a>, which is most common after several months of treatment and may also be irreversible. Although the mechanism of injury is still poorly understood, <a href="mitochondrial%20toxicity">mitochondrial toxicity</a> has been proposed as a cause; linezolid is toxic to <a href="mitochondria">mitochondria</a>, probably because of the similarity between mitochondrial and bacterial <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s. <a href="Lactic%20acidosis">Lactic acidosis</a>, a potentially life-threatening buildup of <a href="lactic%20acid">lactic acid</a> in the body, may also occur due to mitochondrial toxicity. Because of these long-term effects, the manufacturer recommends weekly <a href="complete%20blood%20count">complete blood count</a>s during linezolid therapy to monitor for possible bone marrow suppression, and recommends that treatment last no more than 28 days. A more extensive monitoring protocol for early detection of toxicity in seriously ill patients receiving linezolid has been developed and proposed by a team of researchers in Melbourne, Australia. The protocol includes twice-weekly blood tests and <a href="liver%20function%20tests">liver function tests</a>; measurement of serum <a href="lactic%20acid">lactate</a> levels, for early detection of lactic acidosis; a review of all medications taken by the patient, interrupting the use of those that may <a href="drug%20interaction">interact</a> with linezolid; and periodic eye and neurological exams in patients set to receive linezolid for longer than four weeks.

The adverse effects of long-term linezolid therapy were first identified during postmarketing surveillance. Bone marrow suppression was not identified during Phase III trials, in which treatment did not exceed 21 days. Although some participants of early trials did experience thrombocytopenia, it was found to be reversible and did not occur significantly more frequently than in controls (participants not taking linezolid). There have also been postmarketing reports of <a href="seizure">seizure</a>s, and, , a single case each of <a href="Bell%27s%20palsy">Bell's palsy</a> (paralysis of the <a href="facial%20nerve">facial nerve</a>) and <a href="nephrotoxicity">kidney toxicity</a>.

Linezolid is a weak, non-selective, reversible <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">monoamine oxidase inhibitor</a> (MAOI), and should not be used concomitantly with other MAOIs, large amounts of <a href="tyramine">tyramine</a>-rich foods (such as pork, aged cheeses, alcoholic beverages, or smoked and pickled foods), or <a href="serotonergic">serotonergic</a> drugs. There have been <a href="postmarketing%20surveillance">postmarketing reports</a> of <a href="serotonin%20syndrome">serotonin syndrome</a> when linezolid was given with or soon after the discontinuation of serotonergic drugs, particularly <a href="selective%20serotonin%20reuptake%20inhibitor">selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor</a>s such as <a href="paroxetine">paroxetine</a> and <a href="sertraline">sertraline</a>. It may also enhance the blood pressure-increasing effects of <a href="sympathomimetic%20drug">sympathomimetic drug</a>s such as <a href="pseudoephedrine">pseudoephedrine</a> or <a href="phenylpropanolamine">phenylpropanolamine</a>. It should also not be given in combination with <a href="pethidine">pethidine</a> (<a href="meperidine">meperidine</a>) under any circumstance due to the risk of <a href="serotonin%20syndrome">serotonin syndrome</a>.

Linezolid does not <a href="enzyme%20inhibitor">inhibit</a> or <a href="regulation%20of%20gene%20expression">induce</a> the <a href="cytochrome%20P450">cytochrome P450</a> (CYP) system, which is responsible for the metabolism of many commonly used drugs, and therefore does not have any CYP-related interactions.

Linezolid, like other oxazolidinones, is a bacterial <a href="protein%20synthesis%20inhibitor">protein synthesis inhibitor</a> and a weak, <a href="non-selective">non-selective</a>, <a href="reversible%20inhibitor">reversible</a> <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">monoamine oxidase inhibitor</a>. As a protein synthesis inhibitor, linezolid stops the growth and reproduction of bacteria by disrupting <a href="prokaryotic%20translation">translation</a> of <a href="messenger%20RNA">messenger RNA</a> (mRNA) into <a href="protein">protein</a>s in bacterial <a href="ribosome">ribosome</a>s. Linezolid inhibits translation at the first step of protein synthesis, "<a href="MRNA-ribosome">initiation</a>", unlike most other protein synthesis inhibitors, which inhibit "<a href="Prokaryotic%20translation%23Elongation">elongation</a>". It does so by preventing the formation of the initiation complex, composed of the <a href="30S">30S</a> and <a href="50S">50S</a> subunits of the ribosome, <a href="transfer%20RNA">tRNA</a>, and mRNA. Linezolid binds to the <a href="23S%20ribosomal%20RNA">23S</a> portion of the 50S subunit (the center of <a href="peptidyl%20transferase">peptidyl transferase</a> activity), close to the <a href="binding%20site">binding site</a>s of <a href="chloramphenicol">chloramphenicol</a>, <a href="lincomycin">lincomycin</a>, and other antibiotics. Due to this unique mechanism of action, <a href="cross-resistance">cross-resistance</a> between linezolid and other protein synthesis inhibitors is highly infrequent or nonexistent.

In 2008, the <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a> of linezolid bound to the 50S subunit of a ribosome from the <a href="archaea">archaea</a>n "Haloarcula marismortui" was elucidated by a team of scientists from <a href="Yale%20University">Yale University</a> and deposited in the <a href="Protein%20Data%20Bank">Protein Data Bank</a>. Another team in 2008 determined the structure of linezolid bound to a 50S subunit of "<a href="Deinococcus%20radiodurans">Deinococcus radiodurans</a>". The authors proposed a refined model for the mechanism of action of oxazolidinones, finding that linezolid occupies the <a href="MRNA-ribosome">A site</a> of the 50S ribosomal subunit, inducing a <a href="conformational%20change">conformational change</a> that prevents tRNA from entering the site and ultimately forcing tRNA to separate from the ribosome.

One of the advantages of linezolid is that it has an <a href="absolute%20bioavailability">absolute oral bioavailability</a> of 100% due to its rapid and complete <a href="absorption%20%28pharmacology%29">absorption</a> after <a href="oral%20administration">oral administration</a>; in other words, the entire dose reaches the bloodstream, as if it had been given <a href="intravenous%20therapy">intravenously</a>. This means that people receiving intravenous linezolid may be switched to oral linezolid as soon as their condition allows it, whereas comparable antibiotics (such as vancomycin and quinupristin/dalfopristin) can only be given intravenously.
Taking linezolid with food somewhat slows its absorption, but the <a href="area%20under%20the%20curve%20%28pharmacokinetics%29">area under the curve</a> is not affected.

Linezolid's <a href="plasma%20protein%20binding">plasma protein binding</a> is approximately 31% (range ) and its <a href="volume%20of%20distribution">volume of distribution</a> at <a href="steady%20state">steady state</a> averages  liters in healthy adult volunteers. <a href="Peak%20plasma%20concentration">Peak plasma concentration</a>s (C) are reached one to two hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from <a href="bone">bone</a> matrix and <a href="white%20adipose%20tissue">white adipose tissue</a>. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) of the <a href="lower%20respiratory%20tract">lower respiratory tract</a> is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported <a href="bronchus">bronchial</a> fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a> in treating pneumonia. However, a meta-analysis of clinical trials found that linezolid was not superior to <a href="vancomycin">vancomycin</a>, which achieves lower concentrations in the ELF. <a href="Cerebrospinal%20fluid">Cerebrospinal fluid</a> (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the <a href="blood%E2%80%93brain%20barrier">blood–brain barrier</a>, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.

Linezolid is <a href="drug%20metabolism">metabolized</a> in the <a href="liver">liver</a>, by <a href="redox">oxidation</a> of the <a href="morpholine">morpholine</a> ring, without involvement of the <a href="cytochrome%20P450">cytochrome P450</a> system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive <a href="metabolite">metabolite</a>s (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which accounts for more than 1% of an excreted dose. <a href="Clearance%20%28medicine%29">Clearance</a> of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which accounts for the shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance.

At <a href="pH%23Living%20systems">physiological pH</a> (7.4), linezolid exists in an uncharged state. It is moderately water-soluble (approximately 3 mg/mL), with a <a href="partition%20coefficient">log"P"</a> of 0.55.
The oxazolidinone <a href="pharmacophore">pharmacophore</a>—the chemical "template" essential for antimicrobial <a href="biological%20activity">activity</a>—consists of a <a href="2-Oxazolidone">1,3-oxazolidin-2-one</a> <a href="functional%20group">moiety</a> with an <a href="aryl">aryl</a> group at position 3 and an "S"-<a href="methyl%20group">methyl group</a>, with another <a href="substituent">substituent</a> attached to it, at position 5 (the "R"-<a href="enantiomer">enantiomer</a>s of all oxazolidinones are devoid of antibiotic properties). In addition to this essential core, linezolid also contains several structural characteristics that improve its effectiveness and safety. An <a href="acetamide">acetamide</a> substituent on the 5-methyl group is the best choice in terms of antibacterial efficacy, and is used in all of the more active oxazolidinones developed thus far; in fact, straying too far from an acetamide group at this position makes the drug lose its antimicrobial power, although weak to moderate activity is maintained when some <a href="bioisostere">isosteric</a> groups are used. A <a href="fluorine">fluorine</a> atom at the 3′ position practically doubles "in vitro" and "in vivo" activity, and the <a href="electron%20donor">electron-donating</a> <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> atom in the <a href="morpholine">morpholine</a> ring helps maintain high antibiotic potency and an acceptable safety profile.

The <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a> <a href="rivaroxaban">rivaroxaban</a> (Xarelto) bears a striking structural similarity to linezolid; both drugs share the oxazolidinone pharmacophore, differing in only three areas (an extra <a href="ketone">ketone</a> and chloro<a href="thiophene">thiophene</a>, and missing the fluorine atom). However this similarity appears to carry no clinical significance.

Linezolid is a completely <a href="organic%20synthesis">synthetic</a> drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most <a href="beta-lactam%20antibiotic">beta-lactam</a>s, which are <a href="semisynthesis">semisynthetic</a>). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid have been reported in the chemistry literature. Despite good <a href="yield%20%28chemistry%29">yields</a>, the original method (developed by Upjohn for <a href="pilot%20plant">pilot plant</a>-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, requires the use of expensive chemicals—such as <a href="palladium%20on%20carbon">palladium on carbon</a> and the highly sensitive reagents <a href="methanesulfonyl%20chloride">methanesulfonyl chloride</a> and <a href="n-Butyllithium">"n"-butyllithium</a>—and needs low-temperature conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis. A somewhat more concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998.

Later syntheses have included an "<a href="atom%20economy">atom-economical</a>" method starting from <a href="D-Mannitol">-mannitol</a>, developed by Indian pharmaceutical company <a href="Dr.%20Reddy%27s%20Laboratories">Dr. Reddy's</a> and reported in 1999, and a route starting from ("S")-glyceraldehyde acetonide (prepared from <a href="vitamin%20C">vitamin C</a>), developed by a team of researchers from <a href="Hunan%20Normal%20University">Hunan Normal University</a> in <a href="Changsha">Changsha</a>, <a href="Hunan">Hunan</a>, China. On 25 June 2008, during the 12th Annual Green Chemistry and Engineering Conference in New York, Pfizer reported the development of their "second-generation" synthesis of linezolid: a <a href="convergent%20synthesis">convergent</a>, <a href="green%20chemistry">green</a> synthesis starting from ("S")-<a href="epichlorohydrin">epichlorohydrin</a>, with higher yield and a 56% reduction in total waste.

Acquired resistance to linezolid was reported as early as 1999, in two patients with severe, multidrug-resistant "<a href="Enterococcus%20faecium">Enterococcus faecium</a>" infection who received the drug through a <a href="expanded%20access">compassionate use</a> program. Linezolid-resistant "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>" was first isolated in 2001.

In the United States, resistance to linezolid has been monitored and tracked since 2004 through a program named LEADER, which () was conducted in 60 medical institutions throughout the country. Resistance has remained stable and extremely low—less than one-half of one percent of <a href="wikt%3Aisolate">isolate</a>s overall, and less than one-tenth of one percent of "S. aureus" samples. A similar, worldwide program—the "Zyvox Annual Appraisal of Potency and Spectrum Study", or ZAAPS—has been conducted since 2002. , overall resistance to linezolid in 23 countries was less than 0.2%, and nonexistent among streptococci. Resistance was only found in Brazil, China, Ireland, and Italy, among <a href="Staphylococcus%23Coagulase-negative">coagulase-negative staphylococci</a> (0.28% of samples resistant), enterococci (0.11%), and "S. aureus" (0.03%). In the United Kingdom and Ireland, no resistance was found in staphylococci collected from <a href="bacteremia">bacteremia</a> cases between 2001 and 2006, although resistance in enterococci has been reported. Some authors have predicted that resistance in "E. faecium" will increase if linezolid use continues at current levels or increases. Nevertheless, linezolid continues to be an important antimicrobial agent with near-complete activity (0.05% resistance).

The "intrinsic" resistance of most Gram-negative bacteria to linezolid is due to the activity of <a href="efflux%20%28microbiology%29">efflux pumps</a>, which <a href="active%20transport">actively</a> "pump" linezolid out of the cell faster than it can accumulate.

Gram-positive bacteria usually develop resistance to linezolid as the result of a <a href="point%20mutation">point mutation</a> known as "G2576T", in which a <a href="guanine">guanine</a> base is replaced with <a href="thymine">thymine</a> in <a href="base%20pair">base pair</a> 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of "E. faecium". Other mechanisms have been identified in "<a href="Streptococcus%20pneumoniae">Streptococcus pneumoniae</a>" (including mutations in an RNA <a href="methyltransferase">methyltransferase</a> that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased <a href="gene%20expression">expression</a> of <a href="ATP-binding%20cassette%20transporter">ABC transporter</a> genes) and in "<a href="Staphylococcus%20epidermidis">Staphylococcus epidermidis</a>".

The <a href="2-Oxazolidone">oxazolidinone</a>s have been known as <a href="monoamine%20oxidase%20inhibitor">monoamine oxidase inhibitor</a>s since the late 1950s. Their antimicrobial properties were discovered by researchers at <a href="DuPont">E.I. duPont de Nemours</a> in the 1970s. In 1978, DuPont <a href="patent">patent</a>ed a series of oxazolidinone derivatives as being effective in the treatment of <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>l and <a href="fungus">fungal</a> <a href="plant%20pathology">plant disease</a>s, and in 1984, another patent described their usefulness in treating bacterial infections in <a href="mammal">mammal</a>s. In 1987, DuPont scientists presented a detailed description of the oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel <a href="mechanism%20of%20action">mechanism of action</a>. Early compounds were found to produce <a href="hepatotoxicity">liver toxicity</a>, however, and <a href="drug%20development">development</a> was discontinued.

<a href="Pharmacia">Pharmacia &</a> <a href="Upjohn">Upjohn</a> (now part of Pfizer) started its own oxazolidinone research program in the 1990s. Studies of the compounds' <a href="structure-activity%20relationship">structure–activity relationship</a>s led to the development of several subclasses of oxazolidinone derivatives, with varying safety profiles and antimicrobial activity. Two compounds were considered drug candidates: <a href="eperezolid">eperezolid</a> (codenamed "PNU-100592") and linezolid ("PNU-100766"). In the preclinical stages of development, they were similar in safety and antibacterial activity, so they were taken to <a href="Phase%20I%20trial">Phase I</a> <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s to identify any difference in <a href="pharmacokinetics">pharmacokinetics</a>. Linezolid was found to have a pharmacokinetic advantage—requiring only twice-daily dosage, while eperezolid needed to be given three times a day to achieve similar exposure—and therefore proceeded to further trials. The <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. Food and Drug Administration</a> (FDA) approved linezolid on 18 April 2000. Approval followed in Brazil (June 2000), the United Kingdom (January 2001), Japan and Canada (April 2001), Europe (throughout 2001), and other countries in Latin America and Asia.

, linezolid was the only oxazolidinone antibiotic available. Other members of this class have entered development, such as <a href="posizolid">posizolid</a> (AZD2563), <a href="ranbezolid">ranbezolid</a> (RBx 7644), and <a href="radezolid">radezolid</a> (RX-1741). In 2014, the FDA approved <a href="Tedizolid">tedizolid phosphate</a>, a second-generation oxazolidinone derivative, for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection.

Linezolid was quite expensive in 2009; a course of treatment may cost one or two thousand U.S. dollars for the drug alone, not to mention other costs (such as those associated with hospital stay). With the medication becoming generic the price has decreased such that in United States the wholesale cost of a course of treatment as of 2016 is about US$137.90. In India as of 2015 a month of linezolid, as would be used to treat tuberculosis cost about US$60.

However, because intravenous linezolid may be switched to an oral formulation (tablets or oral solution) without jeopardizing efficacy, people may be discharged from hospital relatively early and continue treatment at home, whereas home treatment with injectable antibiotics may be impractical. Reducing the <a href="length%20of%20stay">length of hospital stay</a> reduces the overall cost of treatment, even though linezolid may have a higher acquisition cost—that is, it may be more expensive—than comparable antibiotics.

Studies have been conducted in several countries with different <a href="health%20care%20system">health care system</a> models to assess the <a href="cost-effectiveness%20analysis%23CEA%20in%20pharmacoeconomics">cost-effectiveness</a> of linezolid compared to glycopeptides such as vancomycin or teicoplanin. In most countries, linezolid was more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia and complicated skin and skin structure infections, either due to higher cure and survival rates or lower overall treatment costs.

In 2009, Pfizer paid $2.3 billion and entered a <a href="corporate%20integrity%20agreement">corporate integrity agreement</a> to settle charges that it had misbranded and illegally promoted four drugs, and caused false claims to be submitted to government healthcare programs for uses that had not been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration. $1.3 billion was paid to settle criminal charges of illegally marketing the anti-inflammatory <a href="valdecoxib">valdecoxib</a>, while $1 billion was paid in civil fines regarding illegal marketing of three other drugs, including Zyvox.

Uncle Tupelo

Uncle Tupelo was an <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> music group from <a href="Belleville%2C%20Illinois">Belleville, Illinois</a>, active between 1987 and 1994. <a href="Jay%20Farrar">Jay Farrar</a>, <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a>, and <a href="Mike%20Heidorn">Mike Heidorn</a> formed the band after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primitives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with <a href="Sire%20Records">Sire Records</a> and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album "<a href="Anodyne%20%28album%29">Anodyne</a>", Farrar announced his decision to leave the band due to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Uncle Tupelo split on May 1, 1994, after completing a farewell tour. Following the breakup, Farrar formed <a href="Son%20Volt">Son Volt</a> with Heidorn, while the remaining members continued as <a href="Wilco">Wilco</a>.

Although Uncle Tupelo broke up before it achieved commercial success, the band is renowned for its impact on the alternative country music scene. The group's first album, "<a href="No%20Depression%20%28album%29">No Depression</a>", became a byword for the genre and was widely influential. Uncle Tupelo's sound was unlike popular country music of the time, drawing inspiration from styles as diverse as the <a href="hardcore%20punk">hardcore punk</a> of <a href="The%20Minutemen%20%28band%29">The Minutemen</a> and the country instrumentation and harmony of the <a href="Carter%20Family">Carter Family</a> and <a href="Hank%20Williams">Hank Williams</a>. Farrar and Tweedy's lyrics frequently referred to <a href="Middle%20America%20%28United%20States%29">Middle America</a> and the <a href="working%20class">working class</a> of Belleville.

<a href="Jay%20Farrar">Jay Farrar</a>, along with his brothers Wade and Dade, played in an early 1980s garage band named The Plebes. Hailing from <a href="Belleville%2C%20Illinois">Belleville, Illinois</a>, The Plebes sought to enter a battle-of-the-bands competition but needed another high school student as a member to perform. They invited <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a>, a high school friend of Jay Farrar, to join the band and play with them for the show. Despite a lack of skill with his instrument, Tweedy played an important role in the band by booking early gigs. While The Plebes had been playing music in a <a href="rockabilly">rockabilly</a> style, Tweedy wanted to play <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> like the music that he originally heard the group perform. This caused tensions between Tweedy and Dade Farrar, who left the band two months after Tweedy joined.

Before leaving the band in 1984, Dade Farrar introduced its members to <a href="Mike%20Heidorn">Mike Heidorn</a>, the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer. The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, a reference to a 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies. Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the <a href="St.%20Louis">St. Louis</a> area, The Primitives began to play <a href="blues">blues</a>-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in <a href="Millstadt%2C%20Illinois">Millstadt, Illinois</a>, where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee. They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to <a href="Southern%20Illinois%20University">Southern Illinois University</a> and an attempted enlistment in the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group. The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece. To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named <a href="The%20Primitives">The Primitives</a>, they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo. Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new name.

The Primitives renamed itself Uncle Tupelo after a character in a cartoon drawn by Chuck Wagner, a friend of the band's members. The name was created by combining two randomly chosen words from the dictionary; inspired by the name, Wagner drew a picture of an old, fat <a href="Elvis%20Presley">Elvis</a>. The trio recorded a four-song demo tape, which won them supporting roles at the concerts of artists such as <a href="Johnny%20Thunders">Johnny Thunders</a> and <a href="Warren%20Zevon">Warren Zevon</a>. Tweedy met Tony Margherita while <a href="wiktionary%3Amoonlighting">moonlighting</a> as a record clerk in St. Louis. After attending a pair of the band's concerts, Margherita offered to become its manager. Uncle Tupelo began to play regular shows at Cicero's Basement—a bar close to the campus of <a href="Washington%20University">Washington University</a>. Bands playing in a similar style, including <a href="Brian%20Henneman">Brian Henneman</a>'s Chicken Truck, often played at the venue, which by late 1988 was considered to have been the origin of a new music scene. The band temporarily expanded to a four-piece with the addition of the guitarist Alex Mutrux, but soon reverted to a trio.

Uncle Tupelo recorded its first tracks in the attic studio of future Chicago punk producer <a href="Matt%20Allison%20%28record%20producer%29">Matt Allison</a> in <a href="Champaign%2C%20Illinois">Champaign, Illinois</a>. The demo "Not Forever, Just for Now" includes the songs "I Got Drunk" and "Screen Door", as well as early versions of several songs that would appear on their first studio album. The "<a href="College%20Media%20Journal">CMJ New Music Report</a>" gave the tape a rave review, and called Uncle Tupelo the best unsigned band of the year. The accolade attracted the attention of independent labels, and the band decided to sign with Jay Fialkov and Debbie Southwood-Smith of <a href="Giant%20Records%20%28independent%20label%29">Giant Records</a> (who offered to book them at <a href="CBGB">CBGB</a> in New York City). Explaining the decision, the band said that "[our] original goals don't get distorted with an independent label."

Shortly after Uncle Tupelo's signing, Giant Records changed its name to <a href="Rockville%20Records">Rockville Records</a>. The band's first album for Rockville "<a href="No%20Depression%20%28album%29">No Depression</a>", was recorded over ten days in January 1990, at Fort Apache South recording studio in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. The album's thematic structure revolved around their lives as adolescents in Belleville; examples are songs about wanting to avoid factory work and songs about fearing a potential <a href="Gulf%20War">Persian Gulf War</a> <a href="military%20draft">military draft</a>. Impressed by their previous work on <a href="Dinosaur%20Jr.">Dinosaur Jr.</a>'s "<a href="Bug%20%28Dinosaur%20Jr%20album%29">Bug</a>", the band wanted <a href="Paul%20Kolderie">Paul Kolderie</a> and <a href="Sean%20Slade">Sean Slade</a> to produce the album. Slade let Farrar play on the same 1961 <a href="Gibson%20Les%20Paul%20Junior">Gibson Les Paul SG Junior</a> that <a href="J.%20Mascis">J. Mascis</a> originally played on "Bug". The album was released on June 21, 1990, and the band celebrated by playing at Cicero's for two nights.

In between tours, Farrar, Tweedy and Heidorn formed a country cover band named Coffee Creek, along with Brian Henneman (later a member of <a href="The%20Bottle%20Rockets">The Bottle Rockets</a>). Henneman impressed Uncle Tupelo, and he was invited to be a guitar technician and occasional multi-instrumentalist for the band. While Farrar and Heidorn would avoid drinking too much after shows, Tweedy would continue drinking throughout the night. Although Tweedy stopped after he began dating Sue Miller in 1991, a significant communication gap had already been opened between Tweedy and Farrar.

By March 1991, "No Depression" had sold an estimated 15,000 copies, and was featured in a "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" article about rising stars. However, Rockville Records refused to pay the band any royalties for the album, a theme that would continue for the remainder of the band's contract. Over seventeen days the band recorded a second album at <a href="Long%20View%20Farm">Long View Farm</a> in rural <a href="North%20Brookfield%2C%20Massachusetts">North Brookfield, Massachusetts</a>. "<a href="Still%20Feel%20Gone">Still Feel Gone</a>", with a more layered sound, was also produced by Kolderie and Slade, with contributions by Slade, Henneman, Rich Gilbert, Chris Bess of Enormous Richard, and <a href="Gary%20Louris">Gary Louris</a> of <a href="The%20Jayhawks">The Jayhawks</a>. The band was disappointed with the production of the album and decided to discontinue working with Kolderie and Slade. Soon afterward, Uncle Tupelo recorded "Shaking Hands (Soldier's Joy)" on <a href="Michelle%20Shocked">Michelle Shocked</a>'s album "<a href="Arkansas%20Traveler%20%28Michelle%20Shocked%20album%29">Arkansas Traveler</a>" and joined her on the accompanying tour with <a href="Taj%20Mahal%20%28musician%29">Taj Mahal</a> and <a href="The%20Band">The Band</a>. However, the tour only lasted for a few shows because of managerial problems between Shocked and The Band.

<a href="Alternative%20rock">Alternative rock</a> had broken into the mainstream by 1992, and an album released in that style was expected to earn the group a major-label record deal. However, Uncle Tupelo didn't want to follow in the footsteps of groups such as <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, and decided to play <a href="country%20music">country</a> and <a href="folk%20song">folk song</a>s "as a big 'fuck you' to the rock scene". <a href="Peter%20Buck">Peter Buck</a>, guitarist for <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>, saw the trio perform at the <a href="40%20Watt%20Club">40 Watt Club</a> in <a href="Athens%2C%20Georgia">Athens, Georgia</a> and sought them out after the show. Buck was impressed with a version of "Atomic Power" that the band played, and offered his services for their next album. Over a span of five days, Buck produced the group's next album, "<a href="March%2016%E2%80%9320%2C%201992">March 16–20, 1992</a>". Buck allowed them to stay in his house during the sessions, and charged no money for his services. Brian Henneman's role was increased for this album, and he taught himself how to play <a href="mandolin">mandolin</a> and <a href="bouzouki">bouzouki</a>. Despite turning away from the style of popular alternative rock, major labels began to show significant interest in Uncle Tupelo after "March 16–20, 1992" was released. The album sold more than their two previous recordings combined, although Rockville was displeased that it did not conform to the style of popular alternative rock.

In 1992, Joe McEwen of <a href="Sire%20Records">Sire Records</a> began to pursue the band. McEwen, who brought notable acts such as Dinosaur Jr and <a href="Shawn%20Colvin">Shawn Colvin</a> to Sire, had been interested in them since hearing the "Not Forever, Just for Now" demo tape. At the urging of <a href="Gary%20Louris">Gary Louris</a>, McEwen offered Uncle Tupelo a contract. Band manager Tony Margherita invoked the $50,000 escape clause he had put in their Rockville contract, freeing the band to sign a seven-year deal with Sire. The deal required two albums, and specified a budget of $150,000 for their first.

Around the time of the recording of "March 16–20, 1992", Mike Heidorn had secured a steady job at a Belleville newspaper company and was dating a woman who had two children from a previous marriage. Uncle Tupelo had planned a tour of Europe, but Heidorn wanted to stay in Belleville with his girlfriend, whom he married in August 1992.

The band held auditions prior to the promotional tour for "March 16–20, 1992", and two candidates stood out: Bill Belzer and <a href="Ken%20Coomer">Ken Coomer</a>. Although singers <a href="Jay%20Farrar">Jay Farrar</a> and <a href="Jeff%20Tweedy">Jeff Tweedy</a> agreed that Coomer was the better drummer, they were intimidated by his six-foot-four stature and long <a href="dreadlocks">dreadlocks</a>. The band selected Belzer as Heidorn's replacement, but he only stayed with the band for six months. Tweedy explained Belzer's departure:

We had Belzer in the band for six months. I want to believe it was purely musical, and I honestly believe that it wasn't working musically. I also believe that we weren't emotionally mature enough to be close friends with a <a href="gay">gay</a> person at that point in our lives ... And Bill was and is a very proud and righteous gay person, very open about his homosexuality.

After touring Europe opening for <a href="Sugar%20%28American%20band%29">Sugar</a>, the band replaced Belzer with Coomer. The band also experimented with new members: <a href="John%20Stirratt">John Stirratt</a> replaced Brian Henneman (who left to form The Bottle Rockets) while <a href="Max%20Johnston">Max Johnston</a>, the brother of Michelle Shocked, joined as a live mandolin and <a href="violin">violin</a> performer. Stirratt became a full-time bassist, allowing Tweedy to perform more songs with the guitar.

Now a five-piece, Uncle Tupelo recorded their major label debut at Cedar Creek studio in <a href="Austin%2C%20Texas">Austin, Texas</a> in early 1993. "<a href="Anodyne%20%28album%29">Anodyne</a>" consisted of live-in-the-studio recordings and included a duet with Farrar and <a href="Doug%20Sahm">Doug Sahm</a> of the <a href="Sir%20Douglas%20Quintet">Sir Douglas Quintet</a>. The album sold 150,000 copies, and was their only entry on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Top%20Heatseekers">Heatseekers</a> chart. The group toured until the end of the year, finishing with a sold out concert at Tramps in New York City. Because of their concert draw, major executives at Sire began to see the band as a potential hit.

In 1993, the band contributed a cover of <a href="Creedence%20Clearwater%20Revival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>'s track "Effigy" to the AIDS-Benefit album "<a href="No%20Alternative">No Alternative</a>" produced by the <a href="Red%20Hot%20Organization">Red Hot Organization</a>.

With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of "Anodyne", Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled:

Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, "Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again." He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore.

Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: "It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record."

Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs. The band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on "<a href="Late%20Night%20with%20Conan%20O%27Brien">Late Night with Conan O'Brien</a>". Sire had requested that the band perform "The Long Cut" on the show, which further irked Farrar since the song was written and sung by Tweedy. 

Uncle Tupelo's last concerts, two shows at <a href="The%20Blue%20Note%20%28Columbia%2C%20Missouri%29">The Blue Note</a> in <a href="Columbia%2C%20Missouri">Columbia, Missouri</a> and two shows at <a href="Mississippi%20Nights">Mississippi Nights</a> in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis, Missouri</a> took place from April 28 to May 1, 1994. A special "last leg" poster was created for the occasion which facetiously promoted the band as "St. Louis's 4th best country band", based on a readers' poll in the <a href="Riverfront%20Times">Riverfront Times</a>. On the last night, Tweedy and Farrar each performed nine songs during the concert, and Mike Heidorn performed as drummer during the encore.

Following Uncle Tupelo's final tour, Tweedy encouraged his bandmates to join him in a new group, while Farrar searched for members for a band of his own. Tweedy was able to retain the rest of the Uncle Tupelo lineup, and created <a href="Wilco">Wilco</a>. Wilco began rehearsing a few days after the final Uncle Tupelo concert, and by August 1994 they were in the recording studio for their first album, "<a href="A.M.%20%28Wilco%20album%29">A.M.</a>". Farrar asked Jim Boquist to join his new band, <a href="Son%20Volt">Son Volt</a>; Boquist was a multi-instrumentalist who had performed with <a href="Joe%20Henry">Joe Henry</a> as the opening act on Uncle Tupelo's last tour. Boquist also recruited his brother Dave, and Farrar convinced Mike Heidorn to leave Belleville to join the group. Farrar's new four-piece began recording their debut album "<a href="Trace%20%28album%29">Trace</a>" in November 1994.

Wilco signed to <a href="Reprise%20Records">Reprise Records</a> while Son Volt signed with <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros. Records</a>. Son Volt had an early <a href="college%20rock">college rock</a> hit with "Drown" from the album "Trace", but Wilco maintained a more commercially successful career in the years to follow. Regarding the possibility of a reunion, Mike Heidorn reported in a PopMatters interview that "nothing's ever for sure, but I would have to say, 'No such thing' ". Farrar said that he does not want the band to get back together, while Tweedy said that he believes that a reunion would not be productive musically.

Farrar and Tweedy sued Rockville Records and Dutch East India Trading CEO Barry Tenenbaum in 2000 over royalties that the label allegedly owed them, winning reparations from Tenenbaum and the joint rights to Uncle Tupelo's first three albums. After securing the rights, the band released a compilation entitled "". In 2003, Uncle Tupelo re-issued their first three albums, which before the lawsuit had cumulatively sold over 200,000 copies.

As The Primitives, Tweedy and Farrar were highly influenced by punk bands such as <a href="The%20Ramones">The Ramones</a> and <a href="The%20Sex%20Pistols">The Sex Pistols</a>. However, they began to listen to country music because punk rock was not well received in the Belleville and St. Louis music scenes. While they originally were introduced to country by their parents, it wasn't until this time that they began to listen to it for leisure. Farrar typically wrote songs about <a href="Middle%20America%20%28US%29">Middle America</a>, while Tweedy wrote about more mainstream topics such as relationships. Farrar took influence from authors such as <a href="Kurt%20Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a> and <a href="Jack%20Kerouac">Jack Kerouac</a>, whom he read while working at his mother's bookstore. As the lead singer of Uncle Tupelo, Farrar's lyrics would be front-and-center during performances, but the band's musical style was mostly driven by Tweedy and Heidorn (seen in the music's <a href="Minutemen%20%28band%29">Minutemen</a>-influenced start-stop arrangement). Jeff Tweedy said in an interview with the "<a href="St.%20Louis%20Post-Dispatch">St. Louis Post-Dispatch</a>":

We probably have more influences than we know what to do with. We have two main styles that have been influences. For instance, we like Black Flag as much as early Bob Dylan and Dinosaur Jr. as much as Hank Williams ... To us, hard-core punk is also folk music. We draw a close parallel between the two. We'll play both in the same set if we get a chance. We don't have any biases as far as music is concerned.

Tweedy in particular was inspired by the Minutemen, and wrote a song about <a href="D.%20Boon">D. Boon</a> following Boon's death in a van accident. The band has released songs originally performed by <a href="Creedence%20Clearwater%20Revival">Creedence Clearwater Revival</a>, <a href="The%20Carter%20Family">The Carter Family</a>, <a href="Lead%20Belly">Lead Belly</a>, <a href="Gram%20Parsons">Gram Parsons</a>, <a href="The%20Soft%20Boys">The Soft Boys</a>, <a href="The%20Louvin%20Brothers">The Louvin Brothers</a>, <a href="Texas%20Tornados">Texas Tornados</a>, and <a href="The%20Stooges">The Stooges</a>. Releasing "March 16–20, 1992" when alternative music was breaking through was a move inspired by <a href="Neil%20Young">Neil Young</a>'s decision to release the challenging albums "<a href="On%20the%20Beach%20%28Neil%20Young%20album%29">On the Beach</a>" and "<a href="Tonight%27s%20the%20Night%20%28Neil%20Young%20album%29">Tonight's the Night</a>" immediately after the commercially successful "<a href="Harvest%20%28Neil%20Young%20album%29">Harvest</a>". Critic Michael Corcoran likened the band's musical style to "<a href="Bob%20Mould">Bob Mould</a> fronting <a href="Soul%20Asylum">Soul Asylum</a> on a speeded-up version of a Gram Parsons song."

Uncle Tupelo is credited as one of the founders of the <a href="alternative%20country">alternative country</a> genre, a blend of <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> and traditional country music. While the genre eventually became associated with solo artists such as <a href="Gram%20Parsons">Gram Parsons</a> and <a href="Lyle%20Lovett">Lyle Lovett</a>, Uncle Tupelo is considered the first alternative country band. Some media outlets like the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> have even suggested that they were the genre's sole creator. However, Tweedy and Heidorn dispute this claim, and Farrar says that there is no difference between alternative country and other genres such as <a href="roots%20rock">roots rock</a>. Heidorn commented in a Country Standard Time interview:

It's strange to hear Uncle Tupelo mentioned because what we were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.

The band's first three albums influenced contemporary roots rock artists such as <a href="Richmond%20Fontaine">Richmond Fontaine</a> and <a href="Whiskeytown">Whiskeytown</a>. Uncle Tupelo's usage of distorted guitars to play a style of music that was known for its earnestness became a lasting trend in 1990s modern rock. Jason Ankeny wrote in <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a> that:

With the release of their 1990 debut LP, "No Depression", the Belleville, IL, trio Uncle Tupelo launched more than simply their own career—by fusing the simplicity and honesty of country music with the bracing fury of punk, they kick-started a revolution which reverberated throughout the American underground.

Their 1990 album "No Depression" lent its name to an influential <a href="No%20Depression%20%28periodical%29">alternative country periodical</a>. Due to the influence of the album and periodical, the term "No Depression" became a byword for alternative country—particularly for bands with punk rock influence. The alternative country movement played an important role in the success of future traditionalist country acts such as <a href="Robbie%20Fulks">Robbie Fulks</a> and <a href="Shelby%20Lynne">Shelby Lynne</a>.


Timeline

Uncle Tupelo also recorded a one-hour radio special that was released by Legacy Records in 2003. Legacy only distributed the CD, entitled "The Long Cut: A One Hour Radio Special", to non-commercial radio stations as a way to promote the re-issues of the band's studio albums. The special is hosted by Lauren Frey and features interviews by Farrar, Tweedy, and Heidorn.

Ice core

An ice core is a <a href="core%20sample">core sample</a> that is typically removed from an <a href="ice%20sheet">ice sheet</a> or a high mountain <a href="glacier">glacier</a>. Since the ice forms from the incremental buildup of annual layers of snow, lower layers are older than upper, and an ice core contains ice formed over a range of years. Cores are <a href="Ice%20drilling">drilled</a> with hand <a href="Auger%20%28drill%29">augers</a> (for shallow holes) or powered drills; they can reach depths of over two miles (3.2 km), and contain ice up to 800,000 years old.

The physical properties of the ice and of material trapped in it can be used to reconstruct the climate over the age range of the core. The proportions of different oxygen and hydrogen <a href="isotope">isotope</a>s provide information about <a href="Paleothermometer">ancient temperatures</a>, and the air trapped in tiny bubbles can be analysed to determine the level of atmospheric gases such as <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a>. Since <a href="Heat%20transfer">heat flow</a> in a large ice sheet is very slow, the borehole temperature is another indicator of temperature in the past. These data can be combined to find the <a href="climate%20model">climate model</a> that best fits all the available data.

Impurities in ice cores may depend on location. Coastal areas are more likely to include material of marine origin, such as sea salt <a href="ion">ion</a>s. <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> ice cores contain layers of <a href="Loess">wind-blown dust</a> that correlate with cold, dry periods in the past, when cold deserts were scoured by wind. <a href="Radioactivity">Radioactive</a> elements, either of natural origin or created by <a href="Nuclear%20weapons%20testing">nuclear testing</a>, can be used to date the layers of ice. Some volcanic events that were sufficiently powerful to send material around the globe have left a signature in many different cores that can be used to synchronise their time scales.

Ice cores have been studied since the early 20th century, and several cores were drilled as a result of the <a href="International%20Geophysical%20Year">International Geophysical Year</a> (1957–1958). Depths of over 400 m were reached, a record which was extended in the 1960s to 2164 m at <a href="Byrd%20Station">Byrd Station</a> in Antarctica. <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> ice drilling projects in Antarctica include decades of work at <a href="Vostok%20Station">Vostok Station</a>, with the deepest core reaching 3769 m. Numerous other deep cores in the Antarctic have been completed over the years, including the <a href="West%20Antarctic%20Ice%20Sheet">West Antarctic Ice Sheet</a> project, and cores managed by the <a href="British%20Antarctic%20Survey">British Antarctic Survey</a> and the <a href="ITASE">International Trans-Antarctic Scientific Expedition</a>. In Greenland, a sequence of collaborative projects began in the 1970s with the <a href="Greenland%20Ice%20Sheet%20Project">Greenland Ice Sheet Project</a>; there have been multiple follow-up projects, with the most recent, the <a href="East%20Greenland%20Ice-Core%20Project">East Greenland Ice-Core Project</a>, expected to complete a deep core in east Greenland in 2020.

An ice core is a vertical column through a glacier, sampling the layers that formed through an annual cycle of snowfall and melt. As snow accumulates, each layer presses on lower layers, making them denser until they turn into <a href="firn">firn</a>. Firn is not dense enough to prevent air from escaping; but at a density of about 830 kg/m it turns to ice, and the air within is sealed into bubbles that capture the composition of the atmosphere at the time the ice formed. The depth at which this occurs varies with location, but in Greenland and the Antarctic it ranges from 64 m to 115 m. Because the rate of snowfall varies from site to site, the age of the firn when it turns to ice varies a great deal. At <a href="Summit%20Camp">Summit Camp</a> in Greenland, the depth is 77 m and the ice is 230 years old; at <a href="Dome%20C">Dome C</a> in Antarctica the depth is 95 m and the age 2500 years. As further layers build up, the pressure increases, and at about 1500 m the <a href="crystal%20structure">crystal structure</a> of the ice changes from hexagonal to cubic, allowing air molecules to move into the cubic crystals and form a <a href="clathrate">clathrate</a>. The bubbles disappear and the ice becomes more transparent.

Two or three feet of snow may turn into less than a foot of ice. The weight above makes deeper layers of ice thin and flow outwards. Ice is lost at the edges of the glacier to <a href="icebergs">icebergs</a>, or to summer melting, and the overall shape of the glacier does not change much with time. The outward flow can distort the layers, so it is desirable to drill deep ice cores at places where there is very little flow. These can be located using maps of the flow lines.

Impurities in the ice provide information on the environment from when they were deposited. These include soot, ash, and other types of particle from <a href="Wildfire">forest fires</a> and <a href="volcano">volcano</a>es; isotopes such as <a href="beryllium-10">beryllium-10</a> created by <a href="cosmic%20ray">cosmic ray</a>s;
<a href="micrometeorite">micrometeorite</a>s; and <a href="pollen">pollen</a>. The lowest layer of a glacier, called basal ice, is frequently formed of subglacial meltwater that has refrozen. It can be up to about 20 m thick, and though it has scientific value (for example, it may contain subglacial microbial populations), it often does not retain stratigraphic information.

Cores are often drilled in areas such as Antarctica and central Greenland where the temperature is almost never warm enough to cause melting, but the summer sun can still alter the snow. In polar areas, the sun is visible day and night during the local summer and invisible all winter. It can make some snow <a href="Sublimation%20%28phase%20transition%29">sublimate</a>, leaving the top inch or so less dense. When the sun approaches its lowest point in the sky, the temperature drops and <a href="hoar%20frost">hoar frost</a> forms on the top layer. Buried under the snow of following years, the coarse-grained hoar frost compresses into lighter layers than the winter snow. As a result, alternating bands of lighter and darker ice can be seen in an ice core.

Ice cores are collected by cutting around a cylinder of ice in a way that enables it to be brought to the surface. Early cores were often collected with hand <a href="Auger%20%28drill%29">augers</a> and they are still used for short holes. A design for ice core augers was patented in 1932 and they have changed little since. An auger is essentially a cylinder with <a href="helix">helical</a> metal ribs (known as flights) wrapped around the outside, at the lower end of which are cutting blades. Hand augers can be rotated by a <a href="T-handle">T handle</a> or a <a href="Brace%20%28tool%29">brace handle</a>, and some can be attached to handheld <a href="electric%20drill">electric drill</a>s to power the rotation. With the aid of a <a href="tripod">tripod</a> for lowering and raising the auger, cores up to 50 m deep can be retrieved, but the practical limit is about 30 m for engine-powered augers, and less for hand augers. Below this depth, electromechanical or thermal drills are used.

The cutting apparatus of a drill is on the bottom end of a drill barrel, the tube that surrounds the core as the drill cuts downward. The <a href="Drill%20cuttings">cuttings</a> (chips of ice cut away by the drill) must be drawn up the hole and disposed of or they will reduce the cutting efficiency of the drill. They can be removed by compacting them into the walls of the hole or into the core, by air circulation (dry drilling), or by the use of a <a href="drilling%20fluid">drilling fluid</a> (wet drilling). Dry drilling is limited to about 400 m depth, since below that point a hole would close up as the ice deforms from the weight of the ice above.

Drilling fluids are chosen to balance the pressure so that the hole remains stable. The fluid must have a low kinematic <a href="viscosity">viscosity</a> to reduce <a href="Tripping%20%28pipe%29">tripping</a> time (the time taken to pull the drilling equipment out of the hole and return it to the bottom of the hole). Since retrieval of each segment of core requires tripping, a slower speed of travel through the drilling fluid could add significant time to a project—a year or more for a deep hole. The fluid must contaminate the ice as little as possible; it must have low <a href="toxicity">toxicity</a>, for safety and to minimize the effect on the environment; it must be available at a reasonable cost; and it must be relatively easy to transport. Historically, there have been three main types of ice drilling fluids: two-component fluids based on <a href="kerosene">kerosene</a>-like products mixed with <a href="fluorocarbon">fluorocarbon</a>s to increase density; alcohol compounds, including aqueous <a href="ethylene%20glycol">ethylene glycol</a> and <a href="ethanol">ethanol</a> solutions; and <a href="ester">ester</a>s, including <a href="N-Butyl%20acetate">n-butyl acetate</a>. Newer fluids have been proposed, including new ester-based fluids, low-molecular weight <a href="Dimethylsiloxane">dimethyl siloxane</a> oils, <a href="Fatty%20acid%20ester">fatty-acid esters</a>, and kerosene-based fluids mixed with foam-expansion agents.

Rotary drilling is the main method of drilling for minerals and it has also been used for ice drilling. It uses a <a href="Drill%20string">string of drill pipe</a> rotated from the top, and drilling fluid is pumped down through the pipe and back up around it. The cuttings are removed from the fluid at the top of the hole and the fluid is then pumped back down. This approach requires long trip times, since the entire drill string must be hoisted out of the hole, and each length of pipe must be separately disconnected, and then reconnected when the drill string is reinserted. Along with the logistical difficulties associated with bringing heavy equipment to ice sheets, this makes traditional rotary drills unattractive. In contrast, <a href="Wireline%20%28cabling%29">wireline</a> drills allow the removal of the core barrel from the drill assembly while it is still at the bottom of the borehole. The core barrel is hoisted to the surface, and the core removed; the barrel is lowered again and reconnected to the drill assembly. Another alternative is flexible drill-stem rigs, in which the <a href="drill%20string">drill string</a> is flexible enough to be coiled when at the surface. This eliminates the need to disconnect and reconnect the pipes during a trip.The need for a string of drillpipe that extends from the surface to the bottom of the borehole can be eliminated by suspending the entire downhole assembly on an armoured cable that conveys power to the downhole motor. These cable-suspended drills can be used for both shallow and deep holes; they require an anti-torque device, such as <a href="Leaf%20spring">leaf-springs</a> that press against the borehole, to prevent the drill assembly rotating around the drillhead as it cuts the core. The drilling fluid is usually circulated down around the outside of the drill and back up between the core and core barrel; the cuttings are stored in the downhole assembly, in a chamber above the core. When the core is retrieved, the cuttings chamber is emptied for the next run. Some drills have been designed to retrieve a second annular core outside the central core, and in these drills the space between the two cores can be used for circulation. Cable-suspended drills have proved to be the most reliable design for deep ice drilling.

Thermal drills, which cut ice by electrically heating the drill head, can also be used, but they have some disadvantages. Some have been designed for working in cold ice; they have high power consumption and the heat they produce can degrade the quality of the retrieved ice core. Early thermal drills, designed for use without drilling fluid, were limited in depth as a result; later versions were modified to work in fluid-filled holes but this slowed down trip times, and these drills retained the problems of the earlier models. In addition, thermal drills are typically bulky and can be impractical to use in areas where there are logistical difficulties. More recent modifications include the use of <a href="antifreeze">antifreeze</a>, which eliminates the need for heating the drill assembly and hence reduces the power needs of the drill. Hot-water drills use jets of hot water at the drill head to melt the water around the core. The drawbacks are that it is difficult to accurately control the dimensions of the borehole, the core cannot easily be kept sterile, and the heat may cause <a href="thermal%20shock">thermal shock</a> to the core.

When drilling in temperate ice, thermal drills have an advantage over electromechanical (EM) drills: ice melted by pressure can refreeze on EM drill bits, reducing cutting efficiency, and can clog other parts of the mechanism. EM drills are also more likely to fracture ice cores where the ice is under high stress.

When drilling deep holes, which require drilling fluid, the hole must be <a href="Casing%20%28borehole%29">cased</a> (fitted with a cylindrical lining), since otherwise the drilling fluid will be absorbed by the snow and firn. The casing has to reach down to the impermeable ice layers. To install casing a shallow auger can be used to create a pilot hole, which is then <a href="Reaming">reamed</a> (expanded) until it is wide enough to accept the casing; a large diameter auger can also be used, avoiding the need for reaming. An alternative to casing is to use water in the borehole to saturate the porous snow and firn; the water eventually turns to ice.

Ice cores from different depths are not all equally in demand by scientific investigators, which can lead to a shortage of ice cores at certain depths. To address this, work has been done on technology to drill replicate cores: additional cores, retrieved by drilling into the sidewall of the borehole, at depths of particular interest. Replicate cores were successfully retrieved at WAIS divide in the 2012–2013 drilling season, at four different depths.

The logistics of any coring project are complex because the locations are usually difficult to reach, and may be at high altitude. The largest projects require years of planning and years to execute, and are usually run as international consortiums. The <a href="East%20Greenland%20Ice-Core%20Project">EastGRIP</a> project, for example, which as of 2017 is drilling in eastern Greenland, is run by the <a href="Centre%20for%20Ice%20and%20Climate">Centre for Ice and Climate</a>, in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, and includes representatives from 12 countries on its steering committee. Over the course of a drilling season, scores of people work at the camp, and logistics support includes airlift capabilities provided by the <a href="Air%20National%20Guard">US Air National Guard</a>, using <a href="Lockheed%20C-130%20Hercules">Hercules transport planes</a> owned by the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a>. In 2015 the EastGRIP team moved the camp facilities from <a href="North%20Greenland%20Eemian%20Ice%20Drilling">NEEM</a>, a previous Greenland ice core drilling site, to the EastGRIP site. Drilling is expected to continue until at least 2020.

With some variation between projects, the following steps must occur between drilling and final storage of the ice core.

The drill removes an annulus of ice around the core but does not cut under it. A spring-loaded lever arm called a core dog can break off the core and hold it in place while it is brought to the surface. The core is then extracted from the drill barrel, usually by laying it out flat so that the core can slide out onto a prepared surface. The core must be cleaned of drilling fluid as it is slid out; for the <a href="WAIS%20Divide">WAIS Divide</a> coring project, a vacuuming system was set up to facilitate this. The surface that receives the core should be aligned as accurately as possible with the drill barrel to minimise mechanical stress on the core, which can easily break. The ambient temperature is kept well below freezing to avoid thermal shock.

A log is kept with information about the core, including its length and the depth it was retrieved from, and the core may be marked to show its orientation. It is usually cut into shorter sections, the standard length in the US being one metre. The cores are then stored on site, usually in a space below snow level to simplify temperature maintenance, though additional refrigeration can be used. If more drilling fluid must be removed, air may be blown over the cores. Any samples needed for preliminary analysis are taken. The core is then bagged, often in <a href="polythene">polythene</a>, and stored for shipment. Additional packing, including padding material, is added. When the cores are flown from the drilling site, the aircraft's flight deck is unheated to help maintain a low temperature; when they are transported by ship they must be kept in a refrigeration unit.

There are several locations around the world that store ice cores, such as the <a href="National%20Ice%20Core%20Laboratory">National Ice Core Laboratory</a> in the US. These locations make samples available for testing. A substantial fraction of each core is archived for future analyses.

Over a depth range known as the <a href="brittle%20ice">brittle ice</a> zone, bubbles of air are trapped in the ice under great pressure. When the core is brought to the surface, the bubbles can exert a stress that exceeds the tensile strength of the ice, resulting in cracks and <a href="spall">spall</a>. At greater depths, the air disappears into clathrates and the ice becomes stable again. At the WAIS Divide site, the brittle ice zone was from 520 m to 1340 m depth.

The brittle ice zone typically returns poorer quality samples than for the rest of the core. Some steps can be taken to alleviate the problem. Liners can be placed inside the drill barrel to enclose the core before it is brought to the surface, but this makes it difficult to clean off the drilling fluid. In mineral drilling, special machinery can bring core samples to the surface at bottom-hole pressure, but this is too expensive for the inaccessible locations of most drilling sites. Keeping the processing facilities at very low temperatures limits thermal shocks. Cores are most brittle at the surface, so another approach is to break them into 1 m lengths in the hole. Extruding the core from the drill barrel into a net helps keep it together if it shatters. Brittle cores are also often allowed to rest in storage at the drill site for some time, up to a full year between drilling seasons, to let the ice gradually relax.

Many different kinds of analysis are performed on ice cores, including visual layer counting, tests for <a href="Electrical%20resistivity%20and%20conductivity">electrical conductivity</a> and physical properties, and assays for inclusion of gases, particles, <a href="radionuclide">radionuclide</a>s, and various molecular <a href="Chemical%20species">species</a>. For the results of these tests to be useful in the reconstruction of <a href="Paleoenvironment">palaeoenvironments</a>, there has to be a way to determine the relationship between depth and age of the ice. The simplest approach is to count layers of ice that correspond to the original annual layers of snow, but this is not always possible. An alternative is to model the ice accumulation and flow to predict how long it takes a given snowfall to reach a particular depth. Another method is to correlate radionuclides or trace atmospheric gases with other timescales such as periodicities in the earth's <a href="orbital%20parameter">orbital parameter</a>s.

A difficulty in ice core dating is that gases can <a href="Diffusion">diffuse</a> through firn, so the ice at a given depth may be substantially older than the gases trapped in it. As a result, there are two chronologies for a given ice core: one for the ice, and one for the trapped gases. To determine the relationship between the two, models have been developed for the depth at which gases are trapped for a given location, but their predictions have not always proved reliable. At locations with very low snowfall, such as <a href="Vostok%20Station">Vostok</a>, the uncertainty in the difference between ages of ice and gas can be over 1,000 years.

The density and size of the bubbles trapped in ice provide an indication of crystal size at the time they formed. The size of a crystal is related to its growth rate, which in turn depends on the temperature, so the properties of the bubbles can be combined with information on accumulation rates and firn density to calculate the temperature when the firn formed.

<a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">Radiocarbon dating</a> can be used on the carbon in trapped . In the polar ice sheets there is about 15–20 µg of carbon in the form of in each kilogram of ice, and there may also be <a href="carbonate">carbonate</a> particles from wind-blown dust (<a href="loess">loess</a>). The can be isolated by subliming the ice in a vacuum, keeping the temperature low enough to avoid the loess giving up any carbon. The results have to be corrected for the presence of <a href="carbon-14"></a> produced directly in the ice by cosmic rays, and the amount of correction depends strongly on the location of the ice core. Corrections for produced by nuclear testing have much less impact on the results. Carbon in <a href="particulates">particulates</a> can also be dated by separating and testing the water-insoluble <a href="Organic%20chemistry">organic</a> components of dust. The very small quantities typically found require at least 300 g of ice to be used, limiting the ability of the technique to precisely assign an age to core depths.

Timescales for ice cores from the same hemisphere can usually be synchronised using layers that include material from volcanic events. It is more difficult to connect the timescales in different hemispheres. The <a href="Laschamp%20event">Laschamp event</a>, a <a href="geomagnetic%20reversal">geomagnetic reversal</a> about 40,000 years ago, can be identified in cores; away from that point, measurements of gases such as (<a href="methane">methane</a>) can be used to connect the chronology of a Greenland core (for example) with an Antarctic core. In cases where volcanic <a href="tephra">tephra</a> is interspersed with ice, it can be dated using <a href="Argon%E2%80%93argon%20dating">argon/argon dating</a> and hence provide fixed points for dating the ice. <a href="Uranium%20series%20dating">Uranium decay</a> has also been used to date ice cores. Another approach is to use <a href="Bayesian%20probability">Bayesian probability</a> techniques to find the optimal combination of multiple independent records. This approach was developed in 2010 and has since been turned into a software tool, DatIce.

The boundary between the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Pleistocene</a> and the <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a>, about 11,700 years ago, is now formally defined with reference to data on Greenland ice cores. Formal definitions of stratigraphic boundaries allow scientists in different locations to correlate their findings. These often involve fossil records, which are not present in ice cores, but cores have extremely precise <a href="Paleoclimatology">palaeoclimatic</a> information that can be correlated with other climate proxies.

The dating of ice sheets has proved to be a key element in providing dates for palaeoclimatic records. According to <a href="Richard%20Alley">Richard Alley</a>, "In many ways, ice cores are the ‘rosetta stones’ that allow development of a global network of accurately dated paleoclimatic records using the best ages determined anywhere on the planet".

Cores show visible layers, which correspond to annual snowfall at the core site. If a pair of pits is dug in fresh snow with a thin wall between them and one of the pits is roofed over, an observer in the roofed pit will see the layers revealed by sunlight shining through. A six-foot pit may show anything from less than a year of snow to several years of snow, depending on the location. Poles left in the snow from year to year show the amount of accumulated snow each year, and this can be used to verify that the visible layer in a snow pit corresponds to a single year's snowfall.

In central Greenland a typical year might produce two or three feet of winter snow, plus a few inches of summer snow. When this turns to ice, the two layers will make up no more than a foot of ice. The layers corresponding to the summer snow will contain bigger bubbles than the winter layers, so the alternating layers remain visible, which makes it possible to count down a core and determine the age of each layer. As the depth increases to the point where the ice structure changes to a clathrate, the bubbles are no longer visible, and the layers can no longer be seen. Dust layers may now become visible. Ice from Greenland cores contains dust carried by wind; the dust appears most strongly in late winter, and appears as cloudy grey layers. These layers are stronger and easier to see at times in the past when the earth's climate was cold, dry, and windy.

Any method of counting layers eventually runs into difficulties as the flow of the ice causes the layers to become thinner and harder to see with increasing depth. The problem is more acute at locations where accumulation is high; low accumulation sites, such as central Antarctica, must be dated by other methods. For example, at Vostok, layer counting is only possible down to an age of 55,000 years.

When there is summer melting, the melted snow refreezes lower in the snow and firn, and the resulting layer of ice has very few bubbles so is easy to recognise in a visual examination of a core. Identification of these layers, both visually and by measuring density of the core against depth, allows the calculation of a melt-feature percentage (MF): an MF of 100% would mean that every year's deposit of snow showed evidence of melting. MF calculations are averaged over multiple sites or long time periods in order to smooth the data. Plots of MF data over time reveal variations in the climate, and have shown that since the late 20th century melting rates have been increasing.

In addition to manual inspection and logging of features identified in a visual inspection, cores can be optically scanned so that a digital visual record is available. This requires the core to be cut lengthwise, so that a flat surface is created.

The isotopic composition of the oxygen in a core can be used to model the temperature history of the ice sheet. Oxygen has three stable isotopes, , and . The ratio between and indicates the temperature when the snow fell. Because is lighter than , water containing is slightly more likely to turn into vapour, and water containing is slightly more likely to condense from vapour into rain or snow crystals. At lower temperatures, the difference is more pronounced. The standard method of recording the / ratio is to subtract the ratio in a standard known as <a href="Standard%20Mean%20Ocean%20Water">standard mean ocean water</a> (SMOW):

formula_1

where the ‰ sign indicates <a href="parts%20per%20thousand">parts per thousand</a>. A sample with the same / ratio as SMOW has a of 0‰; a sample that is depleted in has a negative . Combining the measurements of an ice core sample with the borehole temperature at the depth it came from provides additional information, in some cases leading to significant corrections to the temperatures deduced from the data. Not all boreholes can be used in these analyses. If the site has experienced significant melting in the past, the borehole will no longer preserve an accurate temperature record.

Hydrogen ratios can also be used to calculate a temperature history. <a href="Deuterium">Deuterium</a> (, or D) is heavier than hydrogen () and makes water more likely to condense and less likely to evaporate. A ratio can be defined in the same way as . There is a linear relationship between and :

formula_2

where d is the deuterium excess. It was once thought that this meant it was unnecessary to measure both ratios in a given core, but in 1979 Merlivat and <a href="Jean%20Jouzel">Jouzel</a> showed that the deuterium excess reflects the temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed of the ocean where the moisture originated. Since then it has been customary to measure both.

Water isotope records, analyzed in cores from <a href="Camp%20Century">Camp Century</a> and <a href="Dye%203">Dye 3</a> in Greenland, were instrumental in the discovery of <a href="Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger%20event">Dansgaard-Oeschger events</a>—rapid warming at the onset of an <a href="interglacial">interglacial</a>, followed by slower cooling. Other isotopic ratios have been studied, for example, the ratio between and can provide information about past changes in the <a href="carbon%20cycle">carbon cycle</a>. Combining this information with records of carbon dioxide levels, also obtained from ice cores, provides information about the mechanisms behind changes in over time.

It was understood in the 1960s that analyzing the air trapped in ice cores would provide useful information on the <a href="paleoatmosphere">paleoatmosphere</a>, but it was not until the late 1970s that a reliable extraction method was developed. Early results included a demonstration that the concentration was 30% less at the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">last glacial maximum</a> than just before the start of the industrial age. Further research has demonstrated a reliable correlation between levels and the temperature calculated from ice isotope data.

Because (methane) is produced in lakes and <a href="wetland">wetland</a>s, the amount in the atmosphere is correlated with the strength of <a href="monsoon">monsoon</a>s, which are in turn correlated with the strength of <a href="tropics">low-latitude</a> summer <a href="Solar%20irradiance">insolation</a>. Since insolation depends on <a href="Milankovitch%20cycles">orbital cycles</a>, for which a timescale is available from other sources, can be used to determine the relationship between core depth and age. (nitrous oxide) levels are also correlated with glacial cycles, though at low temperatures the graph differs somewhat from the and graphs. Similarly, the ratio between (nitrogen) and (oxygen) can be used to date ice cores: as air is gradually trapped by the snow turning to firn and then ice, is lost more easily than , and the relative amount of correlates with the strength of local summer insolation. This means that the trapped air retains, in the ratio of to , a record of the summer insolation, and hence combining this data with orbital cycle data establishes an ice core dating scheme.

<a href="Diffusion">Diffusion</a> within the firn layer causes other changes that can be measured. Gravity causes heavier molecules to be enriched at the bottom of a gas column, with the amount of enrichment depending on the difference in mass between the molecules. Colder temperatures cause heavier molecules to be more enriched at the bottom of a column. These <a href="fractionation">fractionation</a> processes in trapped air, determined by the measurement of the / ratio and of <a href="neon">neon</a>, <a href="krypton">krypton</a> and <a href="xenon">xenon</a>, have been used to infer the thickness of the firn layer, and determine other palaeoclimatic information such as past mean ocean temperatures. Some gases such as <a href="helium">helium</a> can rapidly diffuse through ice, so it may be necessary to test for these "fugitive gases" within minutes of the core being retrieved to obtain accurate data. <a href="Chlorofluorocarbon">Chlorofluorocarbon</a>s (CFCs), which contribute to the <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a> and also cause <a href="Ozone%20depletion">ozone loss</a> in the <a href="stratosphere">stratosphere</a>, can be detected in ice cores after about 1950; almost all CFCs in the atmosphere were created by human activity.

Summer snow in Greenland contains some sea salt, blown from the surrounding waters; there is less of it in winter, when much of the sea surface is covered by pack ice. Similarly, <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> appears only in summer snow because its production in the atmosphere requires sunlight. These seasonal changes can be detected because they lead to changes in the electrical conductivity of the ice. Placing two <a href="electrode">electrode</a>s with a high voltage between them on the surface of the ice core gives a measurement of the conductivity at that point. Dragging them down the length of the core, and recording the conductivity at each point, gives a graph that shows an annual periodicity. Such graphs also identify chemical changes caused by non-seasonal events such as forest fires and major volcanic eruptions. When a known volcanic event, such as the <a href="Laki%231783%20eruption">eruption of Laki</a> in Iceland in 1783, can be identified in the ice core record, it provides a cross-check on the age determined by layer counting. Material from Laki can be identified in Greenland ice cores, but did not spread as far as Antarctica; the 1815 eruption of <a href="Mount%20Tambora">Tambora</a> in Indonesia injected material into the stratosphere, and can be identified in both Greenland and Antarctic ice cores. If the date of the eruption is not known, but it can be identified in multiple cores, then dating the ice can in turn give a date for the eruption, which can then be used as a reference layer. This was done, for example, in an analysis of the climate for the period from 535 to 550 AD, which was thought to be influenced by an otherwise unknown tropical eruption in about 533 AD; but which turned out to be caused by two eruptions, one in 535 or early 536 AD, and a second one in 539 or 540 AD. There are also more ancient reference points, such as the eruption of <a href="Lake%20Toba">Toba</a> about 72,000 years ago.

Many other elements and molecules have been detected in ice cores. In 1969, it was discovered that <a href="lead">lead</a> levels in Greenland ice had increased by a factor of over 200 since pre-industrial times, and increases in other elements produced by industrial processes, such as <a href="copper">copper</a>, <a href="cadmium">cadmium</a>, and <a href="zinc">zinc</a>, have also been recorded. The presence of nitric and sulfuric acid ( and ) in precipitation can be shown to correlate with increasing fuel <a href="combustion">combustion</a> over time. <a href="Mesylate">Methanesulfonate</a> (MSA) () is produced in the atmosphere by marine organisms, so ice core records of MSA provide information on the history of the oceanic environment. Both hydrogen peroxide () and formaldehyde () have been studied, along with organic molecules such as <a href="carbon%20black">carbon black</a> that are linked to vegetation emissions and forest fires. Some species, such as <a href="calcium">calcium</a> and <a href="ammonium">ammonium</a>, show strong seasonal variation. In some cases there are contributions from more than one source to a given species: for example, Ca comes from dust as well as from marine sources; the marine input is much greater than the dust input and so although the two sources peak at different times of the year, the overall signal shows a peak in the winter, when the marine input is at a maximum. Seasonal signals can be erased at sites where the accumulation is low, by surface winds; in these cases it is not possible to date individual layers of ice between two reference layers.

Some of the deposited chemical species may interact with the ice, so what is detected in an ice core is not necessarily what was originally deposited. Examples include HCHO and . Another complication is that in areas with low accumulation rates, deposition from fog can increase the concentration in the snow, sometimes to the point where the atmospheric concentration could be overestimated by a factor of two.
<a href="Galactic%20cosmic%20rays">Galactic cosmic rays</a> produce in the atmosphere at a rate that depends on the solar magnetic field. The strength of the field is related to the intensity of <a href="solar%20radiation">solar radiation</a>, so the level of in the atmosphere is a <a href="Proxy%20%28climate%29">proxy</a> for climate. <a href="Accelerator%20mass%20spectrometry">Accelerator mass spectrometry</a> can detect the low levels of in ice cores, about 10,000 atoms in a gram of ice, and these can be used to provide long-term records of solar activity. <a href="Tritium%20radioluminescence">Tritium</a> (), created by nuclear weapons testing in the 1950s and 1960s, has been identified in ice cores, and both <a href="Chlorine-36">Cl</a> and have been found in ice cores in Antarctica and Greenland. Chlorine-36, which has a half-life of 301,000 years, has been used to date cores, as have krypton (, with a half-life of 11 years), lead (, 22 years), and silicon (, 172 years).

Meteorites and micrometeorites that land on polar ice are sometimes concentrated by local environmental processes. For example, there are places in Antarctica where winds evaporate surface ice, concentrating the solids that are left behind, including meteorites. Meltwater ponds can also contain meteorites. At the <a href="South%20Pole%20Station">South Pole Station</a>, ice in a well is melted to provide a water supply, leaving micrometeorites behind. These have been collected by a robotic "vacuum cleaner" and examined, leading to improved estimates of their flux and mass distribution. The well is not an ice core, but the age of the ice that was melted is known, so the age of the recovered particles can be determined. The well becomes about 10 m deeper each year, so micrometeorites collected in a given year are about 100 years older than those from the previous year. <a href="Pollen">Pollen</a>, an important component of sediment cores, can also be found in ice cores. It provides information on changes in vegetation.

In addition to the impurities in a core and the isotopic composition of the water, the physical properties of the ice are examined. Features such as crystal size and <a href="Crystal%20axis">axis</a> orientation can reveal the history of ice flow patterns in the ice sheet. The crystal size can also be used to determine dates, though only in shallow cores.

In 1841 and 1842, <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a> drilled holes in the <a href="Unteraargletscher">Unteraargletscher</a> in the <a href="Alps">Alps</a>; these were drilled with iron rods and did not produce cores. The deepest hole achieved was 60 m. On <a href="Erich%20von%20Drygalski">Erich von Drygalski</a>'s Antarctic expedition in 1902 and 1903, 30 m holes were drilled in an iceberg south of the Kerguelen Islands and temperature readings were taken. The first scientist to create a snow sampling tool was <a href="James%20E.%20Church">James E. Church</a>, described by Pavel Talalay as "the father of modern snow surveying". In the winter of 1908–1909, Church constructed steel tubes with slots and cutting heads to retrieve cores of snow up to 3 m long. Similar devices are in use today, modified to allow sampling to a depth of about 9 m. They are simply pushed into the snow and rotated by hand.

The first systematic study of snow and firn layers was by Ernst Sorge, who was part of the <a href="Alfred%20Wegener">Alfred Wegener</a> Expedition to central Greenland in 1930–1931. Sorge dug a 15 m pit to examine the snow layers, and his results were later formalized into Sorge's Law of Densification by Henri Bader, who went on to do additional coring work in northwest Greenland in 1933. In the early 1950s, a <a href="SIPRE">SIPRE</a> expedition took pit samples over much of the Greenland ice sheet, obtaining early oxygen isotope ratio data. Three other expeditions in the 1950s began ice coring work: a joint <a href="Norwegian-British-Swedish%20Antarctic%20Expedition">Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition</a> (NBSAE), in <a href="Queen%20Maud%20Land">Queen Maud Land</a> in Antarctica; the <a href="Juneau%20Ice%20Field%20Research%20Project">Juneau Ice Field Research Project</a> (JIRP), in <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>; and <a href="Exp%C3%A9ditions%20Polaires%20Fran%C3%A7aises">Expéditions Polaires Françaises</a>, in central Greenland. Core quality was poor, but some scientific work was done on the retrieved ice.

The <a href="International%20Geophysical%20Year">International Geophysical Year</a> (1957–1958) saw increased <a href="glaciology">glaciology</a> research around the world, with one of the high priority research targets being deep cores in polar regions. SIPRE conducted pilot drilling trials in 1956 (to 305 m) and 1957 (to 411 m) at Site 2 in Greenland; the second core, with the benefit of the previous year's drilling experience, was retrieved in much better condition, with fewer gaps. In Antarctica, a 307 m core was drilled at <a href="Byrd%20Station">Byrd Station</a> in 1957–1958, and a 264 m core at <a href="Little%20America%20V">Little America V</a>, on the <a href="Ross%20Ice%20Shelf">Ross Ice Shelf</a>, the following year. The success of the IGY core drilling led to increased interest in improving ice coring capabilities, and was followed by a <a href="CRREL">CRREL</a> project at Camp Century, where in the early 1960s three holes were drilled, the deepest reaching the base of the ice sheet at 1387 m in July 1966. The drill used at Camp Century then went to Byrd Station, where a 2164 m hole was drilled to bedrock before the drill was frozen into the borehole by sub-ice meltwater and had to be abandoned.

French, Australian and Canadian projects from the 1960s and 1970s include a 905 m core at <a href="Dome%20C">Dome C</a> in Antarctica, drilled by <a href="Centre%20national%20de%20la%20recherche%20scientifique">CNRS</a>; cores at <a href="Law%20Dome">Law Dome</a> drilled by <a href="Australian%20National%20Antarctic%20Research%20Expeditions">ANARE</a>, starting in 1969 with a 382 m core; and <a href="Devon%20Ice%20Cap">Devon Ice Cap</a> cores recovered by a Canadian team in the 1970s.

<a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> ice drilling projects began in the 1950s, in <a href="Franz%20Josef%20Land">Franz Josef Land</a>, the <a href="Urals">Urals</a>, <a href="Novaya%20Zemlya">Novaya Zemlya</a>, and at <a href="Mirny%20Station">Mirny</a> and Vostok in the Antarctic; not all these early holes retrieved cores. Over the following decades work continued at multiple locations in Asia. Drilling in the Antarctic focused mostly on Mirny and Vostok, with a series of deep holes at Vostok begun in 1970. The first deep hole at Vostok reached 506.9 m in April 1970; by 1973 a depth of 952 m had been reached. A subsequent hole, Vostok 2, drilled from 1971 to 1976, reached 450 m, and Vostok 3 reached 2202 m in 1985 after six drilling seasons. Vostok 3 was the first core to retrieve ice from the previous glacial period, 150,000 years ago. Drilling was interrupted by a fire at the camp in 1982, but further drilling began in 1984, eventually reaching 2546 m in 1989. A fifth Vostok core was begun in 1990, reached 3661 m in 2007, and was later extended to 3769 m. The estimated age of the ice is 420,000 years at 3310 m depth; below that point it is difficult to interpret the data reliably because of mixing of the ice.

<a href="EPICA">EPICA</a>, a European ice coring collaboration, was formed in the 1990s, and two holes were drilled in East Antarctica: one at Dome C, which reached 2871 m in only two seasons of drilling, but which took another four years to reach bedrock at 3260 m; and one at <a href="Kohnen%20Station">Kohnen Station</a>, which reached bedrock at 2760 m in 2006. The Dome C core had very low accumulation rates, which mean that the climate record extended a long way; by the end of the project the usable data extended to 800,000 years ago.

Other deep Antarctic cores included a Japanese project at <a href="Dome%20F">Dome F</a>, which reached 2503 m in 1996, with an estimated age of 330,000 years for the bottom of the core; and a subsequent hole at the same site which reached 3035 m in 2006, estimated to reach ice 720,000 years old. US teams drilled at <a href="McMurdo%20Station">McMurdo Station</a> in the 1990s, and at <a href="Taylor%20Dome">Taylor Dome</a> (554 m in 1994) and <a href="Siple%20Dome">Siple Dome</a> (1004 m in 1999), with both cores reaching ice from the last glacial period. The <a href="West%20Antarctic%20Ice%20Sheet">West Antarctic Ice Sheet</a> (WAIS) project, completed in 2011, reached 3405 m; the site has high snow accumulation so the ice only extends back 62,000 years, but as a consequence, the core provides high resolution data for the period it covers. A 948 m core was drilled at <a href="Berkner%20Island">Berkner Island</a> by a project managed by the <a href="British%20Antarctic%20Survey">British Antarctic Survey</a> from 2002 to 2005, extending into the last glacial period; and an Italian-managed <a href="ITASE">ITASE</a> project completed a 1620 m core at <a href="Talos%20Dome">Talos Dome</a> in 2007.

In 2016, cores were retrieved from the <a href="Allan%20Hills">Allan Hills</a> in Antarctica in an area where old ice lay near the surface. The cores were dated by potassium-argon dating; traditional ice core dating is not possible as not all layers were present. The oldest core was found to include ice from 2.7 million years ago—by far the oldest ice yet dated from a core.

In 1970, scientific discussions began which resulted in the <a href="Greenland%20Ice%20Sheet%20Project">Greenland Ice Sheet Project</a> (GISP), a multinational investigation into the Greenland ice sheet that lasted until 1981. Years of field work were required to determine the ideal location for a deep core; the field work included several intermediate-depth cores, at Dye 3 (372 m in 1971), Milcent (398 m in 1973) and Crete (405 m in 1974), among others. A location in north-central Greenland was selected as ideal, but financial constraints forced the group to drill at Dye 3 instead, beginning in 1979. The hole reached bedrock at 2037 m, in 1981. Two holes, 30 km apart, were eventually drilled at the north-central location in the early 1990s by two groups: <a href="Greenland%20Ice%20Core%20Project">GRIP</a>, a European consortium, and GISP-2, a group of US universities. GRIP reached bedrock at 3029 m in 1992, and GISP-2 reached bedrock at 3053 m the following year. Both cores were limited to about 100,000 years of climatic information, and since this was thought to be connected to the topography of the rock underlying the ice sheet at the drill sites, a new site was selected 200 km north of GRIP, and a new project, <a href="North%20Greenland%20Ice%20Core%20Project">NorthGRIP</a>, was launched as an international consortium led by Denmark. Drilling began in 1996; the first hole had to be abandoned at 1400 m in 1997, and a new hole was begun in 1999, reaching 3085 m in 2003. The hole did not reach bedrock, but terminated at a subglacial river. The core provided climatic data back to 123,000 years ago, which covered part of the last interglacial period. The subsequent North Greenland Eemian (<a href="NEEM%20Camp">NEEM</a>) project retrieved a 2537 m core in 2010 from a site further north, extending the climatic record to 128,500 years ago; NEEM was followed by <a href="East%20Greenland%20Ice-Core%20Project">EastGRIP</a>, which began in 2015 in east Greenland and is expected to be complete in 2020.

Kareena Kapoor

Kareena Kapoor (; born 21 September 1980), also known by her married name Kareena Kapoor Khan, is an Indian actress who appears in <a href="Bollywood">Hindi films</a>. She is the daughter of actors <a href="Randhir%20Kapoor">Randhir Kapoor</a> and <a href="Babita">Babita</a>, and the younger sister of actress <a href="Karisma%20Kapoor">Karisma Kapoor</a>. Noted for playing a variety of characters in a range of <a href="film%20genre">film genre</a>s—from romantic comedies to crime dramas—Kapoor is the recipient of <a href="List%20of%20awards%20and%20nominations%20received%20by%20Kareena%20Kapoor">several awards</a>, including six <a href="Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Awards</a>, and is one of Bollywood's most popular and highest-paid actresses.

After making her acting debut in the 2000 war film "<a href="Refugee%20%282000%20film%29">Refugee</a>", Kapoor established herself in Hindi cinema with roles in the historical drama "<a href="A%C5%9Boka%20%282001%20film%29">Aśoka</a>", and the <a href="Blockbuster%20%28entertainment%29">blockbuster</a> melodrama "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" (both 2001). This initial success was followed by a series of commercial failures and repetitive roles, which garnered her negative reviews. The year 2004 marked a turning point for Kapoor when she played against <a href="typecasting%20%28acting%29">type</a> in the role of a <a href="sex%20worker">sex worker</a> in the drama "<a href="Chameli%20%28film%29">Chameli</a>". She subsequently earned wide critical recognition for her portrayal of a riot victim in the 2004 drama "<a href="Dev%20%28film%29">Dev</a>" and a character based on <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s heroine <a href="Desdemona">Desdemona</a> in the 2006 crime film "<a href="Omkara%20%282006%20film%29">Omkara</a>". Kapoor went on to receive Filmfare Awards for <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> and <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a> for her performances in the 2007 romantic comedy "<a href="Jab%20We%20Met">Jab We Met</a>" and the 2010 drama "<a href="We%20Are%20Family%20%28film%29">We Are Family</a>", respectively. Her <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films">highest-grossing</a> releases came with the dramas "<a href="3%20Idiots">3 Idiots</a>" (2009) and "<a href="Bajrangi%20Bhaijaan">Bajrangi Bhaijaan</a>" (2015), and she continued to draw praise for her performances in the 2009 thriller "<a href="Kurbaan%20%282009%20film%29">Kurbaan</a>", the 2012 drama "<a href="Heroine%20%282012%20film%29">Heroine</a>", the 2012 thriller "", and the 2016 crime film "<a href="Udta%20Punjab">Udta Punjab</a>".

Married to actor <a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a>, with whom she has a son, Kapoor's off-screen life is the subject of widespread coverage in India. She has a reputation for being outspoken and assertive, and is recognised for her contributions to the film industry through her fashion style and film roles. In addition to film acting, Kapoor participates in stage shows, hosts a radio show and has contributed as a co-writer to three books: an autobiographical memoir and two nutrition guides. She has started her own line of clothing and cosmetics for women, and has worked with <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> since 2014 to advocate the <a href="Female%20education">education of girls</a> and increase <a href="Education%20in%20India">quality based education in India</a>.

Born on 21 September 1980 in Bombay (now <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>), Kapoor (often informally referred to as 'Bebo') is the younger daughter of <a href="Randhir%20Kapoor">Randhir Kapoor</a> and <a href="Babita">Babita</a> ("née" Shivdasani); her elder sister <a href="Karisma%20Kapoor">Karisma</a> is also an actress. She is the paternal granddaughter of actor and filmmaker <a href="Raj%20Kapoor">Raj Kapoor</a>, maternal granddaughter of actor <a href="Hari%20Shivdasani">Hari Shivdasani</a>, and niece of actor <a href="Rishi%20Kapoor">Rishi Kapoor</a>. According to Kapoor, the name "Kareena" was derived from the book "<a href="Anna%20Karenina">Anna Karenina</a>", which her mother read while she was pregnant with her. She is of <a href="Punjabi%20Hindus">Punjabi</a> descent on her father's side, and on her mother's side she is of <a href="Sindhi%20people">Sindhi</a> and <a href="British%20people">British</a> descent. As a child, Kapoor regularly practised <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a> with her family, but was also exposed to <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a> from her mother.

Describing herself as a "very naughty [and] spoilt child", Kapoor's exposure to films from a young age kindled her interest in acting; she was particularly inspired by the work of actresses <a href="Nargis">Nargis</a> and <a href="Meena%20Kumari">Meena Kumari</a>. Despite her family background, her father disapproved of women entering films because he believed it conflicted with the traditional maternal duties and responsibility of women in the family. This led to a conflict between her parents, and they separated. She was then raised by her mother, who worked several jobs to support her daughters until Karisma debuted as an actress in 1991. After living separately for several years, her parents reconciled in October 2007. Kapoor remarked "My father is also an important factor in my life [...] [Al]though we did not see him often in our initial years, we are a family now."

Kapoor attended <a href="Jamnabai%20Narsee%20School">Jamnabai Narsee School</a> in Mumbai, followed by <a href="Welham%20Girls%27%20School">Welham Girls' School</a> in Dehradun. She attended the institution primarily to satisfy her mother, though later admitted to liking the experience. According to Kapoor, she wasn't inclined towards academics though received good grades in all her classes except mathematics. After graduating from Welham she studied commerce for two years at <a href="Mithibai%20College">Mithibai College</a> in <a href="Vile%20Parle">Vile Parle</a> (Mumbai). Kapoor then registered for a three-month summer course in microcomputers at <a href="Harvard%20Summer%20School">Harvard Summer School</a> in the United States. She later developed an interest in law, and enrolled at the <a href="Government%20Law%20College%2C%20Mumbai">Government Law College, Mumbai</a>; during this period, she developed a long-lasting passion for reading. However, after completing her first year, Kapoor decided to pursue her interest to become an actress. She began training at an acting institute in Mumbai mentored by Kishore Namit Kapoor, a member of the <a href="Film%20and%20Television%20Institute%20of%20India">Film and Television Institute of India</a> (FTII).

While training at the institute, Kapoor was cast as the female lead in <a href="Rakesh%20Roshan">Rakesh Roshan</a>'s "<a href="Kaho%20Naa...%20Pyaar%20Hai">Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai</a>" (2000) opposite his son, <a href="Hrithik%20Roshan">Hrithik Roshan</a>. Several days into the filming, however, she abandoned the project; Kapoor later explained that she had benefited by not doing the film since more prominence was given to the director's son. She debuted later that year alongside <a href="Abhishek%20Bachchan">Abhishek Bachchan</a> in <a href="J.%20P.%20Dutta">J. P. Dutta</a>'s war drama "<a href="Refugee%20%282000%20film%29">Refugee</a>". Set during the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20war%20of%201971">Indo-Pakistani war of 1971</a>, the film centers on a man who illegally transports civilians back and forth across the <a href="Indo-Pakistani%20border">border</a>. Kapoor portrayed Naaz, a Bangladeshi girl who falls in love with Bachchan's character while illegally migrating to Pakistan with her family. Her performance was acclaimed by critics; <a href="Taran%20Adarsh">Taran Adarsh</a> of <a href="Bollywood%20Hungama">Bollywood Hungama</a> described her as "a natural performer" and noted "the ease with which she emotes the most difficult of scenes", while "<a href="India%20Today">India Today</a>" reported that Kapoor belonged to a new breed of Hindi film actors that breaks away from character stereotypes. On the experience of acting in her first film, Kapoor described it as "tough ... [but] also a great learning experience". "Refugee" was a moderate box-office success in India and Kapoor's performance earned her the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Debut">Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut</a>.

For her second release, Kapoor was paired opposite <a href="Tusshar%20Kapoor">Tusshar Kapoor</a> in <a href="Satish%20Kaushik">Satish Kaushik</a>'s box-office hit "<a href="Mujhe%20Kucch%20Kehna%20Hai">Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai</a>" (2001). A review in "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>" noted that based on her first two films, she was "definitely the actress to watch out for". She next starred alongside <a href="Jackie%20Shroff">Jackie Shroff</a> and Hrithik Roshan in <a href="Subhash%20Ghai">Subhash Ghai</a>'s flop "<a href="Yaadein%20%282001%20film%29">Yaadein</a>", followed by <a href="Abbas-Mustan">Abbas-Mustan</a>'s moderately successful thriller "<a href="Ajnabee%20%282001%20film%29">Ajnabee</a>", co-starring <a href="Akshay%20Kumar">Akshay Kumar</a>, <a href="Bobby%20Deol">Bobby Deol</a> and <a href="Bipasha%20Basu">Bipasha Basu</a>. Later that year, she appeared in <a href="Santosh%20Sivan">Santosh Sivan</a>'s period epic "<a href="A%C5%9Boka%20%28film%29">Aśoka</a>", a partly fictionalized account of the life of the <a href="Ashoka">Indian emperor of the same name</a>. Featured opposite <a href="Shah%20Rukh%20Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a>, Kapoor found herself challenged playing the complex personality of her character <a href="Kaurwaki">Kaurwaki</a> (a <a href="Kalinga%20%28historical%20kingdom%29">Kalinga</a>n princess) with whom Ashoka falls in love. "Aśoka" was screened at the <a href="Venice%20Film%20Festival">Venice</a> and <a href="2001%20Toronto%20International%20Film%20Festival">2001 Toronto International Film Festival</a>s, and received generally positive reviews internationally but failed to do well in India, which was attributed by critics to the way Ashoka was portrayed. Jeff Vice of "<a href="The%20Deseret%20News">The Deseret News</a>" described Kapoor as "riveting" and commended her screen presence. <a href="Rediff.com">Rediff.com</a>, however, was more critical concluding that her presence in the film was primarily used for aesthetic purposes. At the <a href="47th%20Filmfare%20Awards">47th Filmfare Awards</a>, "Aśoka" was nominated for five awards including a <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Best Actress</a> nomination for Kapoor.

A key point in Kapoor's career came when she was cast by <a href="Karan%20Johar">Karan Johar</a> as Pooja ("Poo", a good-natured, superficial girl) in the 2001 melodrama "<a href="Kabhi%20Khushi%20Kabhie%20Gham...">Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...</a>" alongside an ensemble cast. Filming the big-budget production was a new experience for Kapoor, and she recalls it fondly: "[I]t was great fun doing [the film and] we had a blast. [W]orking with the unit and the six mega star set was a dream come true." "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..." was an immensely popular release, finishing as India's second highest-grossing film of the year and Kapoor's highest-grossing film to that point. It also became one of the biggest Bollywood success of all time in the overseas market, earning over worldwide. Taran Adarsh described Kapoor as "one of the main highlights of the film", and she received her second Filmfare nomination for the role—her first for <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Supporting%20Actress">Best Supporting Actress</a>—as well as nominations at the <a href="International%20Indian%20Film%20Academy%20Awards">International Indian Academy</a> (IIFA) and <a href="Screen%20Awards">Screen Awards</a>.

<a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a> reported that the success of "Mujhe Kucch Kehna Hai" and "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..." established Kapoor as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, and Rediff.com published that with "Aśoka" she had become the highest-paid Indian actress to that point earning per film. During 2002 and 2003, Kapoor continued to work in a number of projects but experienced a setback. All six films in which she starred—"<a href="Mujhse%20Dosti%20Karoge%21">Mujhse Dosti Karoge!</a>", "<a href="Jeena%20Sirf%20Merre%20Liye">Jeena Sirf Merre Liye</a>", "", "<a href="Khushi%20%282003%20Hindi%20film%29">Khushi</a>", "<a href="Main%20Prem%20Ki%20Diwani%20Hoon">Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon</a>", and the four-hour war epic "<a href="LOC%20Kargil">LOC Kargil</a>"—were critically and commercially unsuccessful. Critics described her performances in these films as "variations of the same character" she played in "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...", and expressed concern that she was becoming <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a>.

By 2004, Kapoor was keen on broadening her range as an actress and thus decided to portray more challenging roles. Under the direction of <a href="Sudhir%20Mishra">Sudhir Mishra</a>, Kapoor played the role of a <a href="Hooker%20with%20a%20heart%20of%20gold">golden-hearted prostitute</a> in "<a href="Chameli%20%28film%29">Chameli</a>", a film relating the story of a young prostitute who meets with a widowed investment banker (played by <a href="Rahul%20Bose">Rahul Bose</a>). When Kapoor was initially offered the film she refused it, explaining that she would be uncomfortable in the role. She relented when Mishra approached her for the second time, and in preparation for the role, visited several of Mumbai's <a href="red-light%20district">red-light district</a>s at night to study the mannerisms of sex workers and the way they dressed. "Chameli" was well received by critics and the film marked a significant turning point in her career, earning Kapoor a <a href="Filmfare%20Special%20Award">special jury recognition</a> at the <a href="49th%20Filmfare%20Awards">49th Filmfare Awards</a>. <a href="Indiatimes">Indiatimes</a> praised her "intuitive brilliance" and stated that she had exceeded all expectations. Rediff.com, however, found her portrayal unconvincing and excessively stereotypical, describing her as "sounding more like a teenager playacting than a brash, hardened streetwalker" and comparing her mannerisms to a <a href="caricature">caricature</a>.

Kapoor next co-starred in <a href="Mani%20Ratnam">Mani Ratnam</a>'s bilingual project "<a href="Yuva">Yuva</a>" alongside <a href="Ajay%20Devgn">Ajay Devgn</a>, Abhishek Bachchan, <a href="Vivek%20Oberoi">Vivek Oberoi</a>, <a href="Rani%20Mukerji">Rani Mukerji</a> and <a href="Esha%20Deol">Esha Deol</a>. The film, consisting of three chapters, tells the story of six individuals linked by a car accident. Kapoor is featured in the third chapter as Oberoi's love interest (Meera, a witty young woman). In a "<a href="The%20Times%20of%20India">Times of India</a>" review film critic <a href="Subhash%20K.%20Jha">Subhash K. Jha</a> described her role as "fey and insubstantial", but further stated that "she turns these character traits to her own advantage to create a girl who is at once enigmatic and all-there". She then appeared alongside <a href="Amitabh%20Bachchan">Amitabh Bachchan</a> and <a href="Fardeen%20Khan">Fardeen Khan</a> in <a href="Govind%20Nihalani">Govind Nihalani</a>'s critically acclaimed film "<a href="Dev%20%28film%29">Dev</a>", which revolved around the <a href="2002%20Gujarat%20violence">2002 Hindu-Muslim riots</a> in the Indian state of <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>. Kapoor's role was that of a Muslim victim named Aaliya, modelled after <a href="Zaheera%20Sheikh">Zaheera Sheikh</a> (a key witness in <a href="Vadodara">Vadodara</a>'s <a href="Best%20Bakery%20case">Best Bakery case</a>). It earned her a <a href="Filmfare%20Critics%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress</a> and nominations for Best Actress at various award ceremonies. Taran Adarsh described her as "first-rate" and in particular noted her scene with Bachchan's character.

Shortly afterwards, Kapoor was cast for the first time as a villain in the thriller "<a href="Fida">Fida</a>". Set against the backdrop of the <a href="Organised%20crime%20in%20India">Mumbai underworld</a>, the film follows the story of an online heist in which her character, Neha Mehra, becomes involved. Although the film was unsuccessful at the box office, Kapoor received positive reviews for her performance, and some critics noted a distinct progression from her earlier roles. Her subsequent releases that year included Abbas-Mustan's thriller "<a href="Aitraaz">Aitraaz</a>" and <a href="Priyadarshan">Priyadarshan</a>'s comedy "<a href="Hulchul%20%282004%20film%29">Hulchul</a>", both of which were successful at the Indian box office. Following the success of her last two releases, she was cast as the protagonist of the 2005 drama "<a href="Bewafaa%20%282005%20film%29">Bewafaa</a>". The feature received mostly negative reviews, and Kapoor's portrayal of Anjali Sahai (an unfaithful woman) was not well received. Nikhat Kazmi of Indiatimes believed that to become a serious actress Kapoor was embodying a maturer, more-jaded character beyond her years in "Bewafaa". That same year, she starred in the romantic dramas "<a href="Kyon%20Ki">Kyon Ki</a>" and "", both of which underperformed at the box office; however, Kapoor's performance in "Kyon Ki" was generally well received by critics (with the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> describing her as "a pure natural").

In 2006, Kapoor appeared in three films. She first starred in the thriller "<a href="36%20China%20Town">36 China Town</a>", followed by the comedy "<a href="Chup%20Chup%20Ke">Chup Chup Ke</a>"; both were moderately successful. She next portrayed the character of <a href="Desdemona">Desdemona</a> in "<a href="Omkara%20%282006%20film%29">Omkara</a>"—the Hindi adaptation of <a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Othello">Othello</a>". The film (directed by <a href="Vishal%20Bhardwaj">Vishal Bhardwaj</a>) is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set against the backdrop of the political system in <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a>. Describing Bhardwaj as a "world-class director [with] a unique style", Kapoor was cast in the project after the director had seen her performance in "Yuva", and was subsequently required to attend script-reading sessions along with the entire cast. The feature premiered at the <a href="2006%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2006 Cannes Film Festival</a> and was screened at the <a href="Cairo%20International%20Film%20Festival">Cairo International Film Festival</a>. "Omkara" was received positively by critics, and Kapoor's portrayal earned her a fourth <a href="52nd%20Filmfare%20Awards%23Critics%27%20awards">Filmfare Award</a> and first <a href="Screen%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">Screen Award</a>. In a 2010 retrospective of the "Top 80 Iconic Performances" of Hindi cinema, "<a href="Filmfare">Filmfare</a>" wrote that she was "brilliant" and praised her ability to "effortless[ly]" convey the various emotions her character went through. Kapoor considered her role in "Omkara" as a "new benchmark" in her career, and compared her portrayal of Dolly with her own evolving maturity as a woman.

Following "Omkara", Kapoor took a short break from acting, as she felt that "nothing [was] challenging enough for me to say yes". In an interview with "The Times of India" Kapoor commented, "In my initial years in the industry, I pushed myself to do a lot of work because I was greedy. I did some films—which I now regret—purely for the money. Today, I want to do selective films." Later that year, she appeared briefly in one of the year's biggest hits, the <a href="Farhan%20Akhtar">Farhan Akhtar</a> action-thriller "<a href="Don%20%282006%20Hindi%20film%29">Don</a>" (a remake of the <a href="Don%20%281978%20film%29">1978 film of the same name</a>).

Kapoor returned to film as the female protagonist Geet Dhillon, a vivacious <a href="Sikh">Sikh</a> girl with a zest for life, in the romantic comedy "<a href="Jab%20We%20Met">Jab We Met</a>" (2007). Director <a href="Imtiaz%20Ali%20%28director%29">Imtiaz Ali</a> was not a well-known figure before its production, with only one feature credit to his name, but Kapoor agreed to the film after being impressed with his "mind-blowing" script. Featured opposite <a href="Shahid%20Kapoor">Shahid Kapoor</a>, the film relates the story of two people with contrasting personalities who meet on a train and eventually fall in love. The film was received favourably by critics and became successful at the box office with gross earnings of . Kapoor won several awards for her performance, including her second Screen Award and the <a href="53rd%20Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare Award for Best Actress</a>. Jaspreet Pandohar of the BBC commented that the role required a mixture of naivety and spontaneity, and was impressed with Kapoor's effort. The critic <a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> labelled her the film's "biggest strength, as she brings alive her character with not just those smart lines, but with the kind of candor actors seldom invest in their work." While shooting for "Jab We Met", Kapoor and Shahid ended their four-year relationship. When asked by "<a href="Mumbai%20Mirror">Mumbai Mirror</a>", she stated "I hold him in utmost regard, and I hope one day we could be good friends. He is a great guy."

The following year, Kapoor co-starred in Vijay Krishna Acharya's action-thriller "<a href="Tashan%20%28film%29">Tashan</a>", where she met her future husband in actor <a href="Saif%20Ali%20Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a>. Although a poll (conducted by Bollywood Hungama) named it the most anticipated release of the year, the film underperformed at the box office grossing in India. After providing her voice for the character of Laila, the love interest of a street dog named Romeo, in the <a href="Yash%20Raj%20Films">Yash Raj Films</a> and <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Pictures">Walt Disney Pictures</a> animated film "<a href="Roadside%20Romeo">Roadside Romeo</a>", Kapoor played a mistrustful wife who believed her husband was unfaithful in <a href="Rohit%20Shetty">Rohit Shetty</a>'s comedy "<a href="Golmaal%20Returns">Golmaal Returns</a>". A sequel to the 2006 film "", the film had an ambivalent reception from critics, and Kapoor received mixed reviews. "<a href="The%20Indian%20Express">The Indian Express</a>" believed the screenplay was derivative, concluding: "There is nothing particularly new about a suspicious wife keeping tabs on her husband, and there is nothing particularly new in the way Kareena plays it." "Golmaal Returns" was a financial success with global revenues of .

In 2009, Kapoor was cast as Simrita Rai (a surgeon who moonlights as a model) in <a href="Sabbir%20Khan">Sabbir Khan</a>'s <a href="wikt%3Abattle%20of%20the%20sexes">battle-of-the-sexes</a> comedy "<a href="Kambakkht%20Ishq">Kambakkht Ishq</a>", opposite Akshay Kumar. Set in Los Angeles, it was the first Indian film to be shot at <a href="Universal%20Studios%20Hollywood">Universal Studios</a> and featured cameo appearances by Hollywood actors. The film was poorly received by critics but became an economic success, earning over worldwide; a review in "Times of India" described Kapoor's performance as "a complete let-down" and "unconvincing". The box-office flop "<a href="Main%20Aurr%20Mrs%20Khanna">Main Aurr Mrs Khanna</a>" came next, following which she played the leading lady in the dramatic thriller "<a href="Kurbaan%20%282009%20film%29">Kurbaan</a>", alongside Saif Ali Khan and Vivek Oberoi. The film (which marked the directorial debut of <a href="Rensil%20D%27Silva">Rensil D'Silva</a>) featured Kapoor as Avantika Ahuja, a woman who is confined to house arrest after discovering that her husband is a terrorist. Describing the film as "an emotionally draining experience", Kapoor explained that it was difficult to disconnect from her character. The film was critically praised, and Kapoor received her fourth Filmfare Best Actress nomination. Gaurav Malani of "<a href="The%20Economic%20Times">The Economic Times</a>" commented that after a long time the actress was given "a role of substance that brings her performing potential to the fore", while Subhash K. Jha described it as her "most consistently pitched performance to date" played "with splendid sensitivity" and "credib[ility]".

Kapoor's <a href="55th%20Filmfare%20Awards">second Filmfare nomination that year</a> came for <a href="Rajkumar%20Hirani">Rajkumar Hirani</a>'s <a href="57th%20National%20Film%20Awards">National Film Award</a>-winning "<a href="3%20Idiots">3 Idiots</a>", a film loosely based on the novel "<a href="Five%20Point%20Someone">Five Point Someone</a>" by <a href="Chetan%20Bhagat">Chetan Bhagat</a>. Co-starring alongside <a href="Aamir%20Khan">Aamir Khan</a>, <a href="R.%20Madhavan">R. Madhavan</a> and <a href="Sharman%20Joshi">Sharman Joshi</a>, Kapoor played Pia (a medical student and Khan's love interest). Several actresses were considered for the role, though Kapoor was eventually cast under the recommendation of Khan. The film received critical acclaim and emerged as the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films">highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time up until then</a>, grossing in India. It also did well internationally, earning over , the second biggest Bollywood success ever in the overseas market. "The <a href="Deccan%20Herald">Deccan Herald</a>" opined that Kapoor "brings a dollop of sunshine and feminine grace to an otherwise masculine tale. She is so spunky and spontaneous you wish there was room for more of her." "3 Idiots" received several Best Movie recognitions at major Indian award functions, and Kapoor was awarded the <a href="IIFA%20Award%20for%20Best%20Actress">IIFA Award for Best Actress</a>, among others.

Kapoor played the role of the career-oriented Shreya Arora (a character originally played by <a href="Julia%20Roberts">Julia Roberts</a>) and refrained from watching the film again so she could bring her own interpretation to it. Priyanka Roy of "<a href="The%20Telegraph%20%28Calcutta%29">The Telegraph</a>" criticized the film for being "superficial and unnecessarily melodramatic", but praised Kapoor for "breath[ing] life and a new-found maturity into what is largely a uni-dimensional character". "We Are Family" emerged a moderate success and Kapoor was awarded the Best Supporting Actress at the <a href="56th%20Filmfare%20Awards">56th Filmfare Awards</a>. At the end of the year, she reunited with director Rohit Shetty for "<a href="Golmaal%203">Golmaal 3</a>", a sequel to "Golmaal Returns".

She next appeared in <a href="Anubhav%20Sinha">Anubhav Sinha</a>'s science fiction film "<a href="Ra.One">Ra.One</a>" with Shah Rukh Khan and Arjun Rampal. Made on a budget of —India's most expensive film at the time—the film follows the story of a London-based videogame designer creating a villainous character who escapes into the real world. Despite negative media coverage of the film's box office performance, "Ra.One" became one of the biggest earners of the year with a worldwide total of over , and Kapoor's fourth major commercial success in three consecutive years.

Kapoor followed her success in "Bodyguard" and "Ra.One" with a role in <a href="Shakun%20Batra">Shakun Batra</a>'s directorial debut "<a href="Ek%20Main%20Aur%20Ekk%20Tu">Ek Main Aur Ekk Tu</a>" (2012) opposite <a href="Imran%20Khan%20%28Bollywood%20actor%29">Imran Khan</a>.

She played Riana Braganza, a carefree young woman, and was particularly drawn to the qualities of her character: "Riana knows what she is doing. Even though she does not have a house or a job, she is a positive person [...] very similar to the way I am." The film received positive reviews and was an economic success, grossing a total of in India and abroad. "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" found her "endearingly natural"; Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com asserted that "after doing ornamental roles in films like "Bodyguard" and "Ra.One", it is nice to see the spunky actress in her element again since "Jab We Met"." She next appeared in "<a href="Agent%20Vinod%20%282012%20film%29">Agent Vinod</a>", an <a href="Spy%20fiction">espionage thriller</a> directed by <a href="Sriram%20Raghavan">Sriram Raghavan</a>. Kapoor was enthusiastic about the project, but it met with a tepid response and she was described as miscast. When asked why she had taken the role, Kapoor described it as an opportunity to attempt something she had never done before.

For her next feature, Kapoor was cast as the protagonist of <a href="Madhur%20Bhandarkar">Madhur Bhandarkar</a>'s "<a href="Heroine%20%282012%20film%29">Heroine</a>", a drama revolving around the Bollywood film industry. Originally the first choice for the role, Kapoor was hesitant to take on the project when Bhandarkar approached her with the film's initial concept. With reservations about the criticism her character might evoke, she was replaced by <a href="Aishwarya%20Rai">Aishwarya Rai</a>. Days after production began, Rai left the film (due to her pregnancy) and Bhandarkar re-approached Kapoor with the film. When the director reinforced his faith in her, she agreed to do the film after having read the completed script. Kapoor (who described her character of Mahi Arora—a fading star—as "bipolar and schizophrenic") refrained from taking on any other projects, since she found "Heroine" "very aggressive and tiring". Reviewers found the film to be "drably monotonous", but noted that it was watchable primarily due to Kapoor's performance. Rajeev Masand described it as "a deliciously camp performance," played "with utmost sincerity". Bollywood Hungama opined that it was her best work to date and concluded that "[t]hough her character is inconsistent [...] Kareena furnishes the heroine's character with a rare vulnerability and an exceptional inner life." At the annual Stardust Awards, Kapoor garnered the <a href="Stardust%20Awards%23Editor%27s%20choice">Editor's Choice for Best Actress</a>, and received additional nominations at <a href="58th%20Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare</a>, IIFA, <a href="Producers%20Guild%20Film%20Awards">Producers Guild</a>, Screen and Stardust.

Kapoor stated that despite adding Khan to her name she would continue practising Hinduism after her marriage. At the end of the year, she co-starred alongside Aamir Khan and Rani Mukerji as the "tantalisingly seductive prostitute" Rosie, in <a href="Reema%20Kagti">Reema Kagti</a>'s <a href="Mystery%20film">crime mystery</a> "". Set against the backdrop of Mumbai's red-light districts, it follows the travails of its personnel and principal, Inspector Surjan Singh Shekhawat (Khan) who is assigned the duty of solving a mysterious car accident. Pratim D. Gupta of "The Telegraph" found Kapoor to be a standout among the ensemble, adding that "she brings an unseen mix of oomph and emotion that becomes the [film's] centrepiece". With global revenues of , the film emerged as a box office hit, and earned Kapoor Best Actress nominations at the Screen, Stardust and <a href="Zee%20Cine%20Awards">Zee Cine</a> award ceremonies.

In 2013, Kapoor collaborated with Ajay Devgn for the fourth time (alongside Amitabh Bachchan, Arjun Rampal, <a href="Manoj%20Bajpayee">Manoj Bajpayee</a> and <a href="Amrita%20Rao">Amrita Rao</a>) in <a href="Prakash%20Jha">Prakash Jha</a>'s "<a href="Satyagraha%20%28film%29">Satyagraha</a>", an ensemble socio-political drama loosely inspired by social activist <a href="Anna%20Hazare">Anna Hazare</a>'s <a href="2011%20Indian%20anti-corruption%20movement">fight against corruption in 2011</a>. The film received little praise from critics and underperformed at the box office earning domestically. A review in the "<a href="Daily%20News%20and%20Analysis">Daily News and Analysis</a>" noted that Kapoor's role as reporter Yasmin Ahmed was "limited to mouthing a few 'important' dialogues and being present in crucial scenes like any leading lady". Following an appearance in the poorly received romantic comedy "<a href="Gori%20Tere%20Pyaar%20Mein">Gori Tere Pyaar Mein</a>" (2013), Kapoor decreased her workload for the next two years to focus on her marriage and family. She took on smaller parts where she played the love-interest of Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan in the dramas "<a href="Singham%20Returns">Singham Returns</a>" (2014) and "<a href="Bajrangi%20Bhaijaan">Bajrangi Bhaijaan</a>" (2015) respectively. "Singham Returns" served as a sequel to the 2011 film "<a href="Singham">Singham</a>" and Kapoor's role was written specifically for her by Rohit Shetty—the third time the pair collaborated. Reviews for the film were generally mixed with Kapoor being criticized for taking a role of minimal importance, but the film was a financial success with a revenue of over . <a href="Kabir%20Khan%20%28director%29">Kabir Khan</a>'s "Bajrangi Bhaijaan" emerged as India's highest-earning film of the year grossing a total of , and earned the <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Popular%20Film%20Providing%20Wholesome%20Entertainment">National Film Award for Best Popular Film Providing Wholesome Entertainment</a> at the <a href="63rd%20National%20Film%20Awards">63rd National Film Awards</a>.

Balki</a>. She was cast as the ambitious and career-oriented Kia Bansal, and was particularly drawn to the project for its relevance and novel concept. Critics were divided in their opinion of the film, but it emerged a financial success grossing over worldwide. Meena Iyer of "The Times of India" mentioned Kapoor as "terrific" and Sukanya Verma considered the actress to be the film's prime asset noting her ease at "smoothly transition[ing] between fragile and volatile to reveal a woman comfortable in her own skin, unapologetic about living life on her terms and never missing an occasion to mince words."
Kapoor next played the role of Dr. Preet Sahni in <a href="Abhishek%20Chaubey">Abhishek Chaubey</a>'s critically acclaimed "<a href="Udta%20Punjab">Udta Punjab</a>" (2016), a crime drama that documents the <a href="substance%20abuse">substance abuse</a> endemic in the Indian state of <a href="Punjab%2C%20India">Punjab</a>. Co-starring alongside Shahid Kapoor, <a href="Alia%20Bhatt">Alia Bhatt</a> and <a href="Diljit%20Dosanjh">Diljit Dosanjh</a>, Kapoor was initially reluctant to do the film due to the length of her role, but agreed after having read the completed script and partially waived her fees to star in it. "Udta Punjab" generated controversy when the <a href="Central%20Board%20of%20Film%20Certification">Central Board of Film Certification</a> deemed that the film represented Punjab in a negative light and demanded extensive <a href="Censorship%20in%20India">censorship</a> before its theatrical release. The <a href="Bombay%20High%20Court">Bombay High Court</a> later cleared the film for exhibition with one scene cut. Rediff.com stated that despite being "the narrative’s most conventional character," the film "greatly relies on [her] for warmth and virtue" and Mehul S. Thakkar of "The <a href="Deccan%20Chronicle">Deccan Chronicle</a>" wrote that she was successful in "deliver[ing] a strong and hard hitting performance." For her performance, Kapoor received a nomination for Best Supporting Actress at the <a href="62nd%20Filmfare%20Awards">Filmfare</a> and Zee Cine award ceremonies.

On 20 December 2016, Kapoor gave birth to her son, Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi, at <a href="Breach%20Candy%20Hospital">Breach Candy Hospital</a> in Mumbai.

After a two-year absence from the screen, Kapoor starred in <a href="Shashanka%20Ghosh">Shashanka Ghosh</a>'s "<a href="Veere%20Di%20Wedding">Veere Di Wedding</a>" (2018), a <a href="female%20buddy%20film">female buddy film</a> co-starring <a href="Sonam%20Kapoor">Sonam Kapoor</a>, <a href="Swara%20Bhaskar">Swara Bhaskar</a> and Shikha Talsania. Initially approached for the project in 2016, the makers rewrote Kapoor's role to accommodate her pregnancy, but due to the lack of maternity insurance in India, filming was pushed back to after she gave birth. <a href="Anna%20M.%20M.%20Vetticad">Anna M. M. Vetticad</a> praised the film for portraying women with "agency, flaws, humanity and, above all, a sense of humour", and took note of Kapoor's "neatly restrained performance". With a worldwide gross of over , "Veere Di Wedding" emerged as one of the highest-grossing Hindi films featuring a female protagonist.

As of August 2018, Kapoor will reunite with Akshay Kumar and Diljit Dosanjh in "<a href="Good%20News%20%282019%20film%29">Good News</a>", a comedy-drama about a couple trying to get pregnant.

Alongside her acting work, Kapoor has established a career as a designer. During her five-year association with the retail chain <a href="Globus%20%28clothing%20retailer%29">Globus</a>, Kapoor became the first Indian actress to launch her own line of clothing for women; she described the collaboration as being "special" and "reflective of my personal sense of style". Her collection made its debut several months later in stores across India, and was well received. Following the end of her contract with Globus, she expressed a desire to work with a design house to release her clothing line internationally, but later explained that those plans were on hold.

Published by <a href="Random%20House">Random House Publications</a>, the book was well received by critics, and sold 10,000 copies within its first twenty days. A follow-up titled, "Women and The Weight Loss Tamasha", was released two years later. It addressed the weight loss concerns and eating habits of women in various parts of their life, and featured Kapoor in a voice-over for the audiobook. In February 2013, Kapoor released her autobiographical memoir: "The Style Diary of a Bollywood Diva". Co-written alongside Rochelle Pinto, it became the first book to be launched under the <a href="Shobhaa%20De">Shobhaa De</a> imprint of <a href="Penguin%20Books">Penguin Books</a>—a set of series that included celebrity memoirs, guides and biographies. In a review published by "Mint", Shefalee Vasudev criticised the writing style as "too-breezy" but further stated that it is "a well-produced book, reproducing chirpy little post-it notes and diet charts, punctuated with Bebo's stunning pictures from her private albums to fashion magazine covers." Later that year, she collaborated with Diwekar for the third time on "The Indian Food Wisdom and The Art of Eating Right", a documentary film about nutrition.

During her years in the film industry, Kapoor has been actively involved in promoting children's education and the safety of women. In June 2010, she took part in the international campaign <a href="1GOAL%20Education%20for%20All">1GOAL Education for All</a>, and was appointed ambassador for the Shakti Campaign—a project launched by NDTV to combat violence against women—in commemoration of the <a href="International%20Women%27s%20Day%232011%20International%20Women%27s%20Day">100th anniversary of International Women's Day</a>. Two years later, Kapoor launched <a href="Channel%20V%20India">Channel V</a>'s anti-rape mobile app 'VithU'; she stated that with an increasing amount of <a href="Rape%20in%20India">violence against women in India</a>, "[i]t [was] important for actors to stand up for issues because they can reach out to a lot of people."

In January 2014, Kapoor began working with <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> to advocate the <a href="Female%20education">education of girls</a> and increase <a href="Education%20in%20India">quality based education in India</a>. Speaking of her association, she expressed hope in creating places "where children feel safe and secure, and where interactive and creative tools are used to ensure that children are happy and learning." During the first year, Kapoor visited schools in the states of Rajasthan and <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a> where she interacted with students and participated in fundraising events hosted by the <a href="Kasturba%20Gandhi%20Balika%20Vidyalaya">Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya</a> organisation in the <a href="Jalna%20district">Jalna district</a>. Along with <a href="List%20of%20UNICEF%20Goodwill%20Ambassadors%23India">UNICEF India's Goodwill Ambassador</a> (<a href="Sharmila%20Tagore">Sharmila Tagore</a>), Kapoor hosted a charity dinner to help raise awareness for the development of underprivileged kids, and launched the 'Child-Friendly School and Systems' (CFSS) package. She later donated an equivalent amount of the funds raised during a joint initiative by UNICEF and <a href="Groupon">Groupon</a> for a higher-quality learning environment in Indian schools.

The following year, she awarded 31 students and 5 teachers for their contribution towards the field of education in <a href="Chhattisgarh">Chhattisgarh</a> at the concluding ceremony of Child Rights Protection week. Also that year, Kapoor provided a voice-over for the documentary film "Girl Rising: Woh Padhegi, Woh Udegi" [She will learn, she will fly] for the <a href="Girl%20Rising">organisation of the same name</a>, and produced a documentary on women's empowerment.

In May 2018, she was invited as a <a href="Keynote">keynote speaker</a> for a <a href="Mother%27s%20Day">Mother's Day</a> event in <a href="New%20Delhi">New Delhi</a> organised by UNICEF.

Additionally, Kapoor has made public appearances to support other charitable organisations. She performed at a fundraiser for the World Youth Peace Summit in November 2003, and participated in a concert to raise money for victims of the <a href="2004%20Indian%20Ocean%20earthquake%20and%20tsunami">2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami</a>. She visited Indian "<a href="jawans">jawans</a>" (troops) in <a href="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, for a special <a href="Holi">Holi weekend</a> episode of <a href="NDTV">NDTV</a>'s reality show "Jai Jawaan". In 2010, Kapoor adopted the village of <a href="Chanderi">Chanderi</a> in <a href="Madhya%20Pradesh">Madhya Pradesh</a> as part of NDTV's Greenathon Campaign, to provide the village with a regular supply of electricity. Four years later, she participated in a campaign to raise awareness on hunger and malnutrition in the world and made donations to the <a href="2014%20India%E2%80%93Pakistan%20floods%23Relief">Kashmir flood relief</a>. In September 2016, Kapoor attended the inaugural of Global Citizen India—a joint initiative by the <a href="Global%20Citizen%20Festival%232016">music festival of the same name</a> and The Global Education and Leadership Foundation. The following year, Kapoor became the brand ambassador for Swasth Immunised India, a campaign launced by the <a href="Network18%20Group">Network18 Group</a> and <a href="Serum%20Institute%20of%20India">Serum Institute of India</a> to promote immunization for children.

Kapoor has participated in several stage shows and world tours since 2002. Her first tour (Heartthrobs: Live in Concert (2002) with Hrithik Roshan, Karisma Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and <a href="Aftab%20Shivdasani">Aftab Shivdasani</a>) was successful in the United States and Canada. At the end of that year, she performed with several other Bollywood stars at <a href="Kings%20Park%20Stadium">Kings Park Stadium</a> in <a href="Durban">Durban</a>, South Africa in the show Now or Never.

Four years later, Kapoor returned to the stage with six other Bollywood celebrities in the successful Rockstars Concert world tour. The concert was originally scheduled to commence in April 2006, but was postponed due to <a href="Salman%20Khan%23Black%20Buck%20hunting%20case">the arrest of Salman Khan</a>. It later began the following month and was staged in 19 cities across the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada. In 2008, Kapoor performed in Shah Rukh Khan's Temptation Reloaded 2008, a series of concerts in a number of countries. The show (which also featured Arjun Rampal, <a href="Katrina%20Kaif">Katrina Kaif</a>, <a href="Ganesh%20Hegde">Ganesh Hegde</a>, <a href="Javed%20Ali">Javed Ali</a> and <a href="Anusha%20Dandekar">Anusha Dandekar</a>) debuted at the <a href="Ahoy%20Rotterdam">Ahoy Rotterdam</a> venue in <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>, the Netherlands. Several months later she again joined Khan, Rampal and Kaif to perform for an audience of 15,000 at <a href="Dubai">Dubai</a>'s <a href="Dubai%20Festival%20City">Festival City Arena</a>. In 2018, Kapoor collaborated with <a href="Ishq%20FM">Ishq FM</a> to host a radio show "What Women Want".

Known for her nonchalant relationship with the media, Kapoor has gained a reputation for discussing her private life with no reservations. As a child she regularly attended award ceremonies and events with her family, and would also accompany Karisma on-set during filming. In an interview with "Filmfare", she explained that growing up in a film family helped her develop a sense of professionalism and dedication towards her craft. Kapoor's private life has been the subject of media attention in India, with frequent press coverage of her weight and relationship with actor Saif Ali Khan. The couple—dubbed "Saifeena" by the entertainment media—has been one of the country's most-reported celebrity stories since 2007, and Kapoor gave birth to their son Taimur on 20 December 2016.

While a segment of the press has described Kapoor as friendly and extremely close to her family, others have criticized her for being arrogant and vain—an image she gained in the wake of her superficial character, Poo, in "Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham..." (2001). She subsequently featured in films portraying similar characters, and this further established her off- and on-screen personae. Before the release of "Chameli" (2004) (in which she played a sex worker), Kapoor stated that "there is a certain image that people identify you with [and] [i]t always follows you whichever role you play. I am trying to transgress this image and become more screen-friendly than image-friendly." "Chameli" helped Kapoor reinvent her on-screen persona, and she later explained that her honesty and openness was often perceived by the media as arrogance.

Kapoor is also known for her assertive and moody nature, and her outspoken views and independence have been singled out for making major contributions to her career; they "add to her superstar aura". In an early interview, she confessed to being an "introvert, yet [...] extremely candid and blunt", reasoning: "Total faith and complete belief in myself is my attitude towards life, films and virtually everything else. I am all about doing what I feel is right. It is not easy to pin me down as I can be a bundle of contradictions." Journalist Subhash K Jha explained that while this approach has sometimes been at the cost of professional opportunities, it "makes her such a favourite among the generation that believes in self regard being the highest form of creativity [...] She lives for the moment and crams all her intensity into it, not sparing a single thought for what is gone and what is waiting around the corner." Meanwhile, Anu Ahuja suggested that Kapoor's demeanour is an act; she is "cold and unapproachable so that no one will act funny with her".

Today, Kapoor is considered as one of the most popular Bollywood celebrities in India. Her look and performances have established her as a style icon for young women. In a 2009 poll conducted by the newspaper "Daily News and Analysis" Kapoor was voted one of India's most popular icons; with her partner Saif Ali Khan, she was listed amongst the top celebrity endorsers for brands and products worldwide. She became the only Indian actress to be featured on <a href="CNN">CNNGo's</a> list of "Who Mattered Most in India", and was later selected by "Verve" for its list of the country's most powerful women from 2008–2013 and in 2016. In June 2010, Kapoor was named "India's Most Beautiful Woman" by the Indian edition of "<a href="People%20%28magazine%29">People</a>" magazine; "<a href="Eastern%20Eye">Eastern Eye</a>" and "<a href="Maxim%20%28India%29">Indian Maxim</a>" named her as "Asia's Sexiest Woman" and "India's Hottest Woman" in 2011 and 2012 respectively. The following year, she was selected by "India Today" for its list of the country's most influential women. From 2012–18, Kapoor has featured on "<a href="Forbes%20India">Forbes India</a>"s "Celebrity 100," a list based on the income and popularity of India's celebrities, peaking at the seventh position in 2012 with an estimated annual earning of .

According to media reports, Kapoor relies on her instincts and spontaneity as an actor. She is known to commit heavily to each role, and refrains from rehearsing for a project. Commenting on this, director Rajkumar Hirani said "I usually have a habit of conducting rehearsals for my actors, but she insisted on not having them as it would affect her spontaneity. She really surprised me with a couple of emotional scenes which we canned in just one take." Karan Johar described Kapoor as a "natural", explaining that "she has no craft, grammar or process attached to her acting [...] It is a great sense of cinema that can keep her going." According to Rensil D'Silva (who directed her in "Kurbaan"), "Kareena [..] is instinctive and has emotional intelligence. She absorbs the situation and performs accordingly. Discussing the scene, in fact, harms her."

While discussing her career highlights in a 2010 article, Rediff.com noted: "[E]ven though a lot of her starring roles have been forgettable, [a] look at her filmography now, however, would show a more thoughtful selection of roles [...] playing to her strengths." Her portrayal of a series of superficial characters at the start of her career were criticized; film historian <a href="Gyan%20Prakash">Gyan Prakash</a> explained that these roles "tended to infantilise her, packaging her as daddy's little girl, all bubble and no fizz". Critics noted "Chameli" (2004) as her <a href="coming%20of%20age">coming of age</a>, claiming that "a new actor in her was discovered". Following her portrayal of a variety of character types in "Chameli", "Dev" (2004), "Omkara" (2006) and "Jab We Met" (2007), Kapoor was noted for her versatility. In 2010, "Filmfare Magazine" included two of her performances—from "Omkara" and "Jab We Met"—in its list of "80 Iconic Performances". "India Today" labelled her "the most versatile female lead in the industry", noting that she "play[s] her roles with trademark spunk".

Manjula Sen of "The Telegraph" wrote that although she has "the worst success ratio among her contemporaries", it does not affect her marketability. Sen further explained that Kapoor's strength lies in her being versatile; she is "effortlessly honest in her performances. It is a candour that spills over in her personal conduct." Writing for <a href="CNN-News18">CNN-News18</a>, Rituparna Chatterjee spoke of her transformation to date: "[A]fter 40 films and 10 years of fighting off competition from some of the most versatile actors of her generation, Kareena has matured into a bankable actor reinventing herself with surprising ease." In 2004, Kapoor placed third on Rediff's list of "Top Bollywood Female Stars". She was later ranked seventh and fifth in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and returned to third place in 2007. In January 2011, Kapoor placed fourth on Rediff's list of "Top 10 Actresses of 2000–2010".

Kapoor has received six Filmfare Awards out of ten nominations. For her role in "Refugee", Kapoor was awarded the Best Female Debut in 2000. She earned a special jury recognition for "Chameli" (2003), and two Critics Award for Best Actress for "Dev" (2004) and "Omkara" (2006). Kapoor later received the Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress for "Jab We Met" (2007) and "We Are Family" (2010) respectively.

<a href="General%20%28Australia%29">General</a> Sir Henry George Chauvel, (16 April 1865 – 4 March 1945), more usually known as Sir Harry Chauvel, was a senior officer of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> who fought at <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli</a> and during the <a href="Sinai%20and%20Palestine%20Campaign">Sinai and Palestine Campaign</a> in the <a href="Middle%20Eastern%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20I">Middle Eastern theatre</a> of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. He was the first Australian to attain the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20general%20%28Australia%29">lieutenant general</a> and later <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">general</a>, and the first to lead a <a href="corps">corps</a>. As commander of the <a href="Desert%20Mounted%20Corps">Desert Mounted Corps</a>, he was responsible for one of the most decisive victories and fastest pursuits in military history.

The son of a <a href="wikt%3Agrazier">grazier</a>, Chauvel was commissioned as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, a unit organised by his father, in 1886. After the family moved to <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a> he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the <a href="2nd/14th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment">Queensland Mounted Infantry</a> in 1890, and saw service during the <a href="1891%20Australian%20shearers%27%20strike">1891 Australian shearers' strike</a>. He became a regular officer in 1896, and went to the United Kingdom as part of the Queensland contingent for the 1897 <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</a> of <a href="Victoria%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen Victoria</a>. In 1899 he commanded one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that were Queensland's initial contribution to the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a>. After the war, he was closely involved with the training of the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">Australian Light Horse</a>.

Promoted to <a href="colonel">colonel</a> in 1913, Chauvel became the Australian representative on the <a href="Imperial%20General%20Staff">Imperial General Staff</a> but the First World War broke out while he was still "en route" to the United Kingdom. Chauvel arranged for the Australian Imperial Force to be diverted to Egypt, where he joined his new command, the <a href="1st%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade">1st Light Horse Brigade</a>, in December. In May 1915, it was sent dismounted to <a href="Gallipoli">Gallipoli</a>, where Chauvel assumed responsibility for some of the most dangerous parts of the line. He took charge of the <a href="1st%20Division%20%28Australia%29">1st Division</a> that November. In March 1916, Chauvel became commander of the <a href="Anzac%20Mounted%20Division">Anzac Mounted Division</a>, gaining victories in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Romani">Battle of Romani</a> in August and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Magdhaba">Battle of Magdhaba</a> in December, and nearly winning the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">First Battle of Gaza</a> in March 1917. The following month, he took over the Desert Column, later known as the Desert Mounted Corps, thereby becoming the first Australian to command a corps, and the first to reach the rank of lieutenant general. At <a href="Battle%20of%20Beersheba%20%281917%29">Beersheba</a> in October 1917, his light horse captured the town and its vital water supply in one of history's last great cavalry charges. By September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of three of his mounted divisions and launch a surprise attack on the enemy that won the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Megiddo</a>. He followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history.

In 1919, Chauvel was appointed Inspector General, the Army's most senior post. He was forced to maintain an increasingly hollow structure by politicians intent on cutting expenditure. He was concurrently <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> from 1923 until his retirement in 1930. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of general. During the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, he was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the <a href="Volunteer%20Defence%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Defence Corps</a>.

Henry George Chauvel was born in <a href="Tabulam%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tabulam, New South Wales</a>, on 16 April 1865, the second child of a <a href="wikt%3Agrazier">grazier</a>, Charles Henry Edward Chauvel, and his wife Fanny Ada Mary, née James. By 1884, Charles Henry Chauvel's <a href="Station%20%28Australian%20agriculture%29">station</a> at Tabulam consisted of , on which he raised 12,000 head of cattle and 320 horses. From an early age Henry George Chauvel was known as "Harry". He was educated at Mr Belcher's School near <a href="Goulburn%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Goulburn</a>, before going to <a href="Sydney%20Grammar%20School">Sydney Grammar School</a> from 1874 to 1880, and <a href="Toowoomba%20Grammar%20School">Toowoomba Grammar School</a> from 1881 to 1882. While at Sydney Grammar, Harry served in the school <a href="Australian%20Army%20Cadets">cadet unit</a>, rising to the rank of <a href="lance%20corporal">lance corporal</a>. In 1886, Charles Henry was given permission to raise two troops of cavalry. On 14 March 1886, he was commissioned as a <a href="Captain%20%28land%29">captain</a> in the Upper Clarence Light Horse, with his sons Arthur and Harry becoming <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a>s, while his two younger sons became troopers. The unit escorted <a href="Charles%20Wynn-Carington%2C%201st%20Marquess%20of%20Lincolnshire">Lord Carrington</a>, <a href="Governor%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">Governor of New South Wales</a>, when he formally opened the railway at <a href="Tenterfield%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Tenterfield</a> in 1886.

Following a <a href="Drought%20in%20Australia">series of severe droughts</a> in northern New South Wales, Charles Henry Chauvel sold his property at Tabulam in 1888 for £50,000. After paying his debts, he bought a much smaller property at <a href="Canning%20Downs">Canning Downs</a> on the <a href="Darling%20Downs">Darling Downs</a> in Queensland. In 1889, Harry Chauvel embarked on a solo tour of Europe, visiting Venice, Rome, Florence, Paris and London. While in the United Kingdom, he watched military manoeuvres near <a href="Aldershot">Aldershot</a> in the presence of <a href="Wilhelm%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany</a>. Harry resigned his commission in the New South Wales Military Forces when he moved to Queensland, but on 9 January 1890 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the <a href="2nd/14th%20Light%20Horse%20Regiment">Queensland Mounted Infantry</a>. After completing his examinations for the rank, he was confirmed as lieutenant in June 1890.

Chauvel's unit was called up in March 1891 during the <a href="1891%20Australian%20shearers%27%20strike">shearers' strike</a> that had begun earlier that year. Leading his troops and a small detachment of <a href="Queensland%20Police">Queensland Police</a>, Chauvel was given the task of escorting a party of <a href="strikebreaker">strikebreaker</a>s to a station north of <a href="Charleville%2C%20Queensland">Charleville</a>. Near Oakwood, Chauvel's troops were confronted by a crowd of around two hundred mounted <a href="sheep%20shearer">sheep shearer</a>s. When the inspector in charge of the police detachment arrested four of the shearers who were wanted by the police, the crowd became agitated, but Chauvel managed to disperse the crowd peacefully, and bring his charges safely to their destination. During the 1894 Australian shearers' strike, the Queensland government enrolled special constables rather than calling up the militia. Chauvel was appointed a temporary sub-inspector in <a href="Clermont%2C%20Queensland">Clermont</a>, and later the district around <a href="Longreach%2C%20Queensland">Longreach</a>.

On 9 September 1896, Chauvel transferred to the Queensland Permanent Military Forces with the rank of captain in the <a href="9th%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Queensland%20Regiment">Moreton Regiment</a>. He was sent to the United Kingdom with the Queensland contingent for the <a href="Diamond%20Jubilee">Diamond Jubilee</a> of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Sporting the <a href="emu">emu</a> feathers worn by Queensland units, he marched with the colonial troops through London behind <a href="Frederick%20Roberts%2C%201st%20Earl%20Roberts">Lord Roberts</a> on 21 June 1897. Chauvel qualified at the School of Musketry at <a href="Hythe%2C%20Kent">Hythe, Kent</a>, and served on exchange with the 3rd Battalion, <a href="King%27s%20Royal%20Rifle%20Corps">King's Royal Rifle Corps</a> and 2nd Battalion, <a href="Royal%20Berkshire%20Regiment">Royal Berkshire Regiment</a> at Aldershot. On returning to Australia, he became a staff officer at Headquarters, Queensland Defence Force.

In July 1899, the <a href="Premier%20of%20Queensland">Premier of Queensland</a>, <a href="James%20Robert%20Dickson">James Dickson</a>, offered a contingent of troops for service in South Africa in the event of war between the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, and the <a href="Boer">Boer</a> <a href="South%20African%20Republic">Transvaal Republic</a> and <a href="Orange%20Free%20State">Orange Free State</a>. For a time Chauvel served as an enrolment officer, signing up volunteers from the Darling Downs. The <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Boer War</a> broke out in October 1899, and Chauvel was given command of one of two companies of Queensland Mounted Infantry that departed Brisbane on 1 November 1899. They disembarked at <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a> on 14 December and joined the Imperial force under <a href="Paul%20Methuen%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Methuen">Lord Methuen</a> at the <a href="Orange%20River">Orange River</a>. The Queensland Mounted Infantry's first fighting was in an action at Sunnyside on 1 January 1900 alongside the infantry of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Regiment">Royal Canadian Regiment</a>. In February, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of <a href="Major-General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major General</a> <a href="John%20French%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Ypres">John French</a>'s Cavalry Division. After a strenuous march, the Cavalry Division relieved the <a href="Siege%20of%20Kimberley">Siege of Kimberley</a> on 15 February.

In the reorganisation that followed, the Queensland Mounted Infantry became part of Major General <a href="Edward%20Hutton%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Edward Hutton</a>'s 1st Mounted Infantry Brigade, along with the Canadian and New Zealand mounted units. Chauvel distinguished himself fighting alongside a group of New Zealanders and capturing a <a href="Maxim%20gun">Maxim gun</a>. The Queensland Mounted Infantry participated in the capture of <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Diamond%20Hill">Battle of Diamond Hill</a>. Chauvel was given a mixed force of British, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand mounted troops that became known as "Chauvel's Mounted Infantry", with <a href="Victor%20Sellheim">Victor Sellheim</a> as his chief of staff. Initially, Chauvel was given the mission of escorting 10,000 head of cattle to <a href="Belfast%2C%20Mpumalanga">Belfast, Mpumalanga</a> to supply the troops in the eastern Transvaal. However, his force was diverted by local commanders, who assigned it to burning homesteads sheltering Boer commandos and attacking Boer units. The Queensland Mounted Infantry embarked for Australia on 13 December 1900. They reached Brisbane on 17 January 1901 and the regiment was disbanded there on 23 January. For his part in the fighting, Chauvel was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a>, and appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> (CMG).
On 1 January 1901, the colonies of Australia federated to form the Commonwealth of Australia. When Chauvel returned to Australia on 17 January, he found that during his absence he had become an officer in the newly formed <a href="History%20of%20the%20Australian%20Army%23Boer%20War%201899%E2%80%931902">Australian Army</a>. A force of 14,000 troops was assembled for the opening of the first <a href="Parliament%20of%20Australia">Federal Parliament</a> on 9 May 1901 in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>; Chauvel was selected as brigade major of the mounted contingent, his first Federal posting. He became Staff Officer, Northern Military District, based at <a href="Townsville">Townsville</a>, Queensland, in July. In 1902, Chauvel was appointed to command of the <a href="Australian%20Commonwealth%20Horse">7th Commonwealth Light Horse</a>, a unit newly raised for service in South Africa, with the local rank of <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a>. Departing from Brisbane on 17 May 1902, the 7th Commonwealth Light Horse arrived at <a href="Durban">Durban</a> on 22 June, three weeks after the war ended. It therefore re-embarked for Brisbane, where it was disbanded. Chauvel remained in South Africa for a few weeks in order to tour the battlefields. On returning to Australia he became Staff Officer, Northern Military District once more. He was promoted to the <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevet rank</a> of lieutenant colonel in December 1902.

In 1903, Hutton, now <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">General Officer Commanding Australian Military Forces</a>, sent Chauvel to <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a> to organise the light horse regiments there. On returning to Queensland in 1904, he became acting Chief Staff Officer Queensland, based in Brisbane. He was promoted to the <a href="Military%20rank%23Types%20of%20rank">substantive rank</a> of lieutenant colonel in December 1909, but his ambition to become the Australian representative on the <a href="Imperial%20General%20Staff">Imperial General Staff</a> in London was blocked by Hutton's successor Major General <a href="John%20Charles%20Hoad">Charles Hoad</a>. Based on his experiences in South Africa, Chauvel propounded ideas on the nature of <a href="mounted%20infantry">mounted infantry</a>. He recommended that Australian troops improve their discipline in the field, called for stronger leadership from officers, and emphasised the need for better organisation for supply and for timely and efficient medical evacuation.

Chauvel knew Keith Jopp of <a href="Newmarket%2C%20Queensland">Newmarket, Queensland</a> even before the Boer War, and while stationed in Brisbane, Chauvel and Major <a href="Brudenell%20White">Brudenell White</a> played tennis at the Jopps' place with their daughters Dora and Sibyl. Chauvel became engaged to Sibyl in January 1906, and they were married on 16 June 1906 at <a href="All%20Saints%20Anglican%20Church%2C%20Brisbane">All Saints Anglican Church</a>, Brisbane. Their union ultimately produced two sons and two daughters. That year Chauvel also sold the property at Canning Downs South. In the shuffle of senior positions that followed Hoad's death in 1911, Chauvel was appointed to the Military Board in Melbourne as Adjutant General. As such, Chauvel was involved in the implementation of the <a href="Conscription%20in%20Australia">universal training scheme</a>. Chauvel was particularly involved with the training of the <a href="Australian%20Light%20Horse">light horse</a>. "When the next war comes," White predicted, "it will only need an <a href="Turner%20Ashby">Ashby</a> or a <a href="J.E.B.%20Stuart">J.E.B. Stuart</a> to make their name immortal."

Chauvel was promoted to <a href="colonel">colonel</a> in 1913. On 3 July 1914, he sailed for England with his wife and three children to replace Colonel <a href="James%20Gordon%20Legge">James Gordon Legge</a> as the Australian representative on the Imperial General Staff. While he was still travelling, the First World War broke out. On reporting for duty at the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> in mid-August 1914, Chauvel was given a cable directing him to assume command of the <a href="1st%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade">1st Light Horse Brigade</a> of the <a href="First%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Australian Imperial Force</a> (AIF) when it arrived in the United Kingdom. Chauvel became concerned with slow progress on construction of the AIF's proposed quarters on the <a href="Salisbury%20Plain">Salisbury Plain</a>. He made frequent visits to the site and had a <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Engineers">Royal Australian Engineers</a> officer, Major <a href="Cecil%20Henry%20Foott">Cecil Henry Foott</a>, appointed to the local staff to safeguard Australian interests. Convinced that the huts would not be ready on time, and that Australian troops would therefore have to spend a winter on Salisbury Plain under canvas, Chauvel persuaded the <a href="High%20Commission%20of%20Australia%20in%20London">High Commissioner for Australia in London</a>, former Prime Minister Sir <a href="George%20Reid%20%28Australian%20politician%29">George Reid</a>, to approach <a href="Herbert%20Kitchener%2C%201st%20Earl%20Kitchener">Lord Kitchener</a> with an alternate plan of diverting the AIF to Egypt, which was done. Accompanied by Major <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>, Chauvel sailed for Egypt on the <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> on 28 November 1914, arriving at <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a> on 10 December 1914.

Chauvel began training his brigade upon arrival in Egypt. He was noted for insisting on high standards of dress and bearing from his troops. The 1st Light Horse Brigade became part of Major General <a href="Alexander%20Godley">Alexander Godley</a>'s <a href="New%20Zealand%20and%20Australian%20Division">New Zealand and Australian Division</a>, along with the <a href="4th%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">4th Infantry Brigade</a>, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and <a href="New%20Zealand%20Mounted%20Rifles%20Brigade">New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade</a>. When the rest of the <a href="Australian%20and%20New%20Zealand%20Army%20Corps">Australian and New Zealand Army Corps</a> departed for <a href="Landing%20at%20Anzac%20Cove">Anzac Cove</a> on 25 April 1915, the mounted brigades remained in Egypt – the <a href="Gallipoli%20Peninsula">Gallipoli Peninsula</a> being unsuited to mounted operations. Following heavy casualties in the early days of the <a href="Gallipoli%20Campaign">Gallipoli Campaign</a>, however, the light horse were called upon to provide 1,000 reinforcements. The British commander in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir <a href="John%20Maxwell%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">John Maxwell</a>, elected instead to ship the mounted brigades to Anzac Cove intact.
Chauvel arrived on 12 May 1915 and took over the critical sector, which included Pope's Hill and Quinn's, Courtney's and Steele's Posts, from Colonel <a href="John%20Monash">John Monash</a>. Open to Turkish observation on two sides, these four advanced posts at the top of Monash Valley were the linchpin of the defence. Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts. He also formed special <a href="sniper">sniper</a> groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley. Chauvel's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel <a href="James%20Harold%20Cannan">J. H. Cannan</a> was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major <a href="Sydney%20Herring">S. C. E. Herring</a> was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.

On 9 July 1915, Chauvel was promoted to <a href="Brigadier%20General%23Australia">brigadier general</a>, back-dated to when he assumed command of the 1st Light Horse Brigade on 10 December 1914. He spent six weeks in Egypt, in June and July, in hospital with <a href="pleurisy">pleurisy</a>, but returned in time for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sari%20Bair">August offensive</a>, for which he was mentioned in despatches. Chauvel was acting commander of the New Zealand and Australian Division for short periods in September and October in Godley's absence. Then on 6 November 1915, he became commander of the 1st Division, and was promoted to <a href="Major%20General%20%28Australia%29">major general</a>. He commanded this division through the final phase of the Gallipoli Campaign, the evacuation, and the reorganisation in Egypt in February and March 1916. For his part in the evacuation, he was mentioned in despatches. His role in the campaign as a whole was recognised by his appointment as a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>.

Chauvel assumed command of the newly formed <a href="Anzac%20Mounted%20Division">Anzac Mounted Division</a> on 16 March 1916, the day after it relieved the 1st Division on the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a> defences. Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches for his part in the defence of the Canal. His division was committed to No. 3 Section of the Suez Canal Defences, the northern part of the Canal, under Major General H. A. Lawrence. Arrangements were far from ideal. The mounted troops were parcelled out so that only two brigades of the Anzac Mounted Division remained under Chauvel's command. The <a href="3rd%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">3rd Light Horse Brigade</a> had been placed under No. 2 Section by General Sir <a href="Archibald%20Murray">Archibald Murray</a> GHQ <a href="Egyptian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Egyptian Expeditionary Force</a> (EEF). Lawrence was too far away to control the battle, especially once the telephone lines were cut. Murray, in <a href="Ismailia">Ismailia</a>, was even further back.

For the <a href="Battle%20of%20Romani">Battle of Romani</a>, Chauvel chose his ground carefully, reconnoitring it from the ground and the air, and selecting both forward and fall back positions. His luck held; the German commander — <a href="Friedrich%20Kre%C3%9F%20von%20Kressenstein">Friedrich Kreß von Kressenstein</a> — selected the same position as the forming up area for his attack in August 1916. Under great pressure, Chauvel maintained his position until Brigadier-General <a href="Edward%20Chaytor">Edward Chaytor</a>'s <a href="New%20Zealand%20Mounted%20Rifles%20Brigade">New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade</a> arrived after being released by Lawrence. The counter-attack that Chauvel had been calling for all day did not materialise until dusk. At Katia and again at Bir el Abd, Chauvel attempted to sweep around the Turkish flank but wound up making frontal attacks on the Turkish rearguard and was beaten off by determined counter-attacks and artillery fire against the 3rd Light Horse Brigade. Despite killing 1,250 Turks and taking over 4,000 prisoners, Chauvel was criticised for his failure to rout and destroy the Turks. However, for the Australian and New Zealand horsemen, who suffered over 900 of the 1,130 British casualties, it was a clear-cut victory, their first decisive win and the turning point of the campaign. Later, Chauvel realised that Romani was the first decisive British victory of the war outside <a href="West%20Africa%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">West Africa Campaign</a>.

In his report to the War Office on the battle, Murray passed lightly over the part played by the <a href="Anzac%20Mounted%20Division">Anzac Mounted Division</a>. The majority of awards for the Battle of Romani went to British troops, including a generous number to officers of Murray's staff. Lawrence was made a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a>, but Chauvel, having already been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George for South Africa and Companion of the Order of the Bath for Gallipoli, was recommended for a lesser award, which he refused. In view of this, Murray decided that Chauvel should receive no award at all, and he was merely mentioned in despatches.

In October 1916 Major General Sir <a href="Charles%20Macpherson%20Dobell">Charles Macpherson Dobell</a>, a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> officer with broad experience in fighting colonial wars took over command of <a href="Eastern%20Force">Eastern Force</a>. Its advanced troops – including Chauvel's Anzac Mounted Division – became part of the newly formed <a href="Desert%20Column">Desert Column</a> under Major-General Sir <a href="Philip%20Chetwode">Philip Chetwode</a>, a British cavalry <a href="baronet">baronet</a>. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Magdhaba">Battle of Magdhaba</a> in December 1916, Chauvel therefore was answerable to the newly arrived Chetwode, instead of the distant commanders on the Canal. His <a href="military%20intelligence">intelligence</a> on enemy dispositions was considerably better thanks to the work of the aviators of <a href="No.%205%20Wing%20RAF">No. 5 Wing</a>, which consisted of <a href="No.%2014%20Squadron%20RAF">No. 14 Squadron</a>, <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> and <a href="No.%201%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 1 Squadron</a>, <a href="Australian%20Flying%20Corps">Australian Flying Corps</a>. However, he had only limited time to capture the position and its water supply, and when the issue was in doubt Chauvel ordered a withdrawal. The order was ignored by Brigadier-General <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Cox">Charles Frederick Cox</a> of the <a href="1st%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade%20%28Australia%29">1st Light Horse Brigade</a>, whose troops carried the position, and was cancelled by Chetwode. Despite his premature withdrawal order, it was Chauvel's plan of attack that won the battle. "Chauvel's leadership," wrote <a href="Henry%20Gullett">Henry Gullett</a>, "was distinguished by the rapidity with which he summed up the very obscure Turkish position in the early morning, and by his judgement and characteristic patience in keeping so much of his force in reserve until the fight developed sufficiently to ensure its most profitable employment."

Chauvel gained another important success in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rafa">Battle of Rafa</a> in January 1917. In many ways, the battle was similar to Magdhaba, but the Turkish position was stronger and the threat of its reinforcement was greater. Once again, the availability of water was a crucial feature of the battle. This time it was Chetwode who decided to call off the battle, with Chauvel's concurrence, but once again the troops carried the day. The victories at Magdhaba and Rafah changed Murray's mind about awarding Chauvel a knighthood and in January 1917 Chauvel was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George</a>. In July, he was mentioned in despatches for these operations.

However, Chauvel continued to be concerned about the lack of recognition for Australian and New Zealand troops and on 28 September 1917 wrote:
Chauvel appended 32 names of soldiers he recommended for awards that had been ignored. Two New Zealanders recommended for a <a href="Medal%20bar">Bar</a> to their <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a>s (DSO) were not even mentioned in despatches and an outstanding Australian regimental commander recommended for the CMG was also not even mentioned in despatches, while a brigade commander and a staff officer Chauvel recommended for DSOs received mentions.

In January 1917, a second mounted division – the <a href="Australian%20Mounted%20Division">Imperial Mounted Division</a> – was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades. A British regular army officer fresh from experience in the <a href="Senussi%20Campaign">Senussi Campaign</a>, Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was appointed to command, with an all-British staff. The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel's approval but was contrary to the policy of the <a href="Government%20of%20Australia">Australian Government</a>, which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28general%29">Robert Anderson</a> to <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a> to discuss the matter frankly with Chauvel and his superiors. As a result, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division.

In the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">First Battle of Gaza</a> in March 1917, Chauvel's mission was similar to Rafa and Magdhaba, but on a larger scale. He enveloped the Turkish position at <a href="Gaza%20City">Gaza</a> while the British <a href="53rd%20%28Welsh%29%20Infantry%20Division">53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division</a> and <a href="54th%20%28East%20Anglian%29%20Infantry%20Division">54th (East Anglian) Infantry Division</a> attempted to capture it. When this failed, Chetwode ordered Chauvel to attempt to capture Gaza from the rear. Chauvel successfully improvised a late afternoon assault on Gaza that captured the town despite the barriers of high cactus hedges and fierce enemy opposition, entering it after dark, only to have an out-of-touch Dobell order the mounted troops to withdraw, despite Chauvel's protests. This time his brigadiers at the front, Generals <a href="Granville%20Ryrie">Ryrie</a> and Chaytor, although they believed that Gaza could be held, felt compelled to obey, as they could not see the whole battle. All guns, including captured ones were hauled away, as were all unwounded prisoners, the wounded and even the dead. Chauvel ensured that wounded Turkish prisoners that were unfit to make the march to <a href="Deir%20al-Balah">Deir al-Balah</a> were each left with a full water bottle.

Dobell launched the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Second Battle of Gaza</a> in April 1917 with a full scale frontal assault supported by <a href="Naval%20gunfire%20support">naval gunfire</a>, tanks and <a href="Chemical%20warfare">poison gas</a>. It ended even more unsatisfactorily, and Dobell was relieved of command of Eastern Force on 19 April. His place was taken by Chetwode, while Chauvel took over the Desert Column, thereby becoming the first Australian to reach the rank of <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28Australia%29">lieutenant general</a>. Command of the Anzac Mounted Division passed to Chaytor. In June, during the <a href="Stalemate%20in%20Southern%20Palestine">Stalemate in Southern Palestine</a>, General Sir <a href="Edmund%20Allenby">Edmund Allenby</a> took over the EEF from Murray. Allenby moved his headquarters to Palestine and re-organised his command along more regular lines. Eastern Force was abolished and two corps headquarters were formed, <a href="XX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XX Corps</a> under Chetwode and <a href="XXI%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XXI Corps</a> under Lieutenant General <a href="Edward%20Bulfin">Edward Bulfin</a>. The three corps commanders were professional soldiers, none of whom had graduated from a military college or a staff college, they had all been commissioned from the militia or volunteers.

Two weeks before Allenby arrived, Chauvel attended an awards ceremony:

When Chauvel learned that the Desert Column was to be renamed the 2nd Cavalry Corps he requested <a href="Desert%20Mounted%20Corps">Desert Mounted Corps</a>. The corps consisted of the <a href="Anzac%20Mounted%20Division">Anzac Mounted Division</a>, the Australian Mounted Division, the newly formed <a href="Yeomanry%20Mounted%20Division">Yeomanry Mounted Division</a> and the <a href="Imperial%20Camel%20Corps%20Brigade">Imperial Camel Corps Brigade</a>.

Although some British thought that Allenby should replace Chauvel with a British officer, Allenby retained him in command. However he overrode Chauvel's own preference to appoint a <a href="Royal%20Horse%20Guards">Royal Horse Guards</a> officer, Brigadier General <a href="Richard%20Howard-Vyse">Richard Howard-Vyse</a>, known as "<a href="Wombat">Wombat</a>", as Chauvel's chief of staff. Chauvel thus, on 2 August 1917, became the first Australian to permanently command a corps. A "brass-bound brigadier" was quoted as saying, "Fancy giving the command of the biggest mounted force in the world's history to an Australian." On being told of the appointments, in a letter dated 12 August 1917 Chetwode wrote to congratulate Chauvel, "I cannot say how much I envy you the command of the largest body of mounted men ever under one hand – it is my own trade – but Fate has willed it otherwise." At Romani Chauvel had been a battleground commander who led from the front while Chetwode, relying on the phone had been deciding to retreat at the victory at Rafa. Chetwode's "arms length" style of command also impacted the First Battle of Gaza.

In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beersheba%20%281917%29">Battle of Beersheba</a> in October 1917, it was again Chauvel and his Desert Mounted Corps that had the critical role. Chetwode believed that the EEF did not have the resources to defeat the Turks in their fixed positions so he planned to drive the Turks from them by turning the enemy flank at <a href="Beersheba">Beersheba</a>, in a waterless area on the flank of the enemy line. The Desert Mounted Corps would have a long overnight approach over waterless desert and would have to capture the town with its wells intact or be forced to retreat. The Battle of Beersheba went right down to the line, but the mission was accomplished, albeit not without a <a href="mounted%20infantry">mounted infantry</a> <a href="bayonet">bayonet</a> charge by the 4th Light Horse Brigade – the last of history's great cavalry charges – to capture the town and its vital water supply. Few battles have been won in such spectacular fashion. For this decisive victory, and the subsequent capture of Jerusalem, Chauvel was mentioned in despatches twice more, and appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath</a> in the <a href="1918%20New%20Year%20Honours">1918 New Year Honours</a> List.

Chauvel, however, was still disappointed with the failure to destroy the Turkish army. The Turks had fought hard, forcing the commitment of the Desert Mounted Corps in heavy action before the moment for a sweeping pursuit came. When it did, the men and horses were too tired and could not summon the required energy. In February 1918, the EEF began a series of operations across the Jordan. Allenby soon found his British troops diverted to France, to be replaced by two Indian cavalry divisions, and the Australian Mounted Division faced a similar fate for a time. In the meantime, during the second Transjordan operations Chauvel faced great difficulties with the terrain, the weather and a tenacious enemy; the campaign was not a success. The Desert Mounted Corps found itself fighting outnumbered, with Turkish reinforcements closing in from all sides. Chauvel was forced to withdraw to the West Bank of the Jordan. Subsequently, the 5th Yeomanry Mounted Brigade was disbanded and Chauvel replaced it with the <a href="5th%20Light%20Horse%20Brigade">5th Light Horse Brigade</a>, formed from the Australian and New Zealand components of the now disbanded Imperial Camel Corps Brigade, and a composite French cavalry regiment of <a href="Spahis">Spahis</a> and <a href="Chasseurs%20d%27Afrique">Chasseurs d'Afrique</a>.

In September 1918, Chauvel was able to effect a secret redeployment of two of his mounted divisions. Allenby launched a surprise attack on the enemy and won the <a href="Battle%20of%20Megiddo%20%281918%29">Battle of Megiddo</a>. He then followed up this victory with one of the fastest pursuits in military history – 167 km in only three days. This time he succeeded in destroying the Turkish army. The Desert Mounted Corps moved across the <a href="Golan%20Heights">Golan Heights</a> and captured <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> on 1 October. Between 19 September and 2 October, the Australian Mounted Division lost 21 killed and 71 wounded, and captured 31,335 Turkish prisoners. To restore calm in the city, Chauvel ordered a show of force. Lieutenant Colonel <a href="T.%20E.%20Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</a> later lampooned this as a "triumphal entry" but it was actually a shrewd political stroke, freeing Chauvel's forces to advance another 300 km to Aleppo, which was captured on 25 October. Five days later, Turkey surrendered. For this victory, Chauvel was again mentioned in despatches.

Chauvel was obliged to remain in the Middle East due to the situation in <a href="Syria">Syria</a> and the <a href="Egyptian%20Revolution%20of%201919">Egyptian Rebellion</a>, although he was able to have Lady Chauvel join him there in January 1919. By April, the situation had calmed and Chauvel was able to hand over command of the AIF in the Middle East to Ryrie. Chauvel and Lady Chauvel then headed for London on the RMS "Malwa". They arrived in time for him to lead Australian troops on a victory march through the city on 3 May. Soon after, he was hospitalised at the 3rd London General Hospital at <a href="Wandsworth">Wandsworth</a> with <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>. The whole Chauvel family was able to sail for home on the transport HMAT "Demosthenes" on 26 July 1919. For his services as commander of the Desert Mounted Corps, Chauvel was created a <a href="Knight%20Grand%20Cross%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George</a> in June 1919, was awarded the French "<a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201914%E2%80%931918%20%28France%29">Croix de Guerre avec Palme</a>" by the <a href="President%20of%20France">President of France</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Nile">Order of the Nile</a> (2nd Class) by the <a href="Sultan%20of%20Egypt">Sultan of Egypt</a>, and was mentioned in despatches for the 11th time. At his special request, when he was conferred with vestments and accoutrements of the Order of St Michael and St George by <a href="George%20V">King George V</a>, the King dubbed him "Sir Harry" rather than "Sir Henry".

Chauvel's AIF appointment was terminated on 9 December 1919, and the next day he was appointed Inspector General, the Army's most senior post, which he held until 1930. The office of Inspector General had been created as an auditor who provided annual reports to the Council of Defence. In the event of war, it was intended that the Inspector General would become the Commander in Chief with the Military Board as his general staff. Chauvel's annual reports tended to emphasise the parlous state of the nation's defences. He warned, for example, that if war came, soldiers would "be subject to the unfair handicap and the certainty of increased loss of life which inferiority in armament and shortage of ammunition must inevitability entail". Looking back from the perspective of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, historian <a href="Gavin%20Long">Gavin Long</a> noted that Chauvel's annual reports were "a series of wise and penetrating examinations of Australian military problems of which, however, little notice was taken".
In February 1920, Chauvel was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, back-dated to 31 December 1919. In January 1920, he chaired a committee to examine the future structure of the army. The committee's recommendations proved to be next to impossible to implement in the face of defence cuts that were imposed in 1920 and 1922. On Lieutenant General Brudenell White's retirement as Chief of the General Staff in 1923, that post was divided into two, with Chauvel becoming 1st Chief of the General Staff as well as Inspector General, while Brigadier General Thomas Blamey became 2nd Chief of the General Staff. Chauvel also served as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, being the senior of the three service chiefs. In November 1929, he became the first Australian to be promoted to the rank of <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">general</a>. He attempted to maintain the Army's structure in the face of short-sighted politicians intent on cutting expenditure. As a result, the Army became increasingly hollow, retaining the form of a large force without the substance. When <a href="conscription">conscription</a> was abolished by Prime Minister <a href="James%20Scullin">James Scullin</a>'s government in 1929, it was left up to Chauvel to attempt to make the new volunteer system work. He finally retired in April 1930.
Chauvel's sons Ian and Edward resigned their commissions in the Australian Army in 1930 and 1932 respectively, and accepted commissions in cavalry regiments of the <a href="Indian%20Army%20%281895%E2%80%931947%29">British Indian Army</a>. His daughter <a href="Elyne%20Mitchell">Elyne</a> married <a href="Thomas%20Walter%20Mitchell">Thomas Walter Mitchell</a>, a grazier. Chauvel became a frequent visitor to their property "Towong Hill" near <a href="Corryong">Corryong</a>, Victoria. He was staying at Towong Hill during the <a href="Black%20Friday%20Bushfires%20of%201939">Black Friday Bushfires of 1939</a>. When the property was threatened by fire, he directed the firefighting effort, and at one point climbed a tree close to the house to hack away burning branches.

The dedication of the <a href="Shrine%20of%20Remembrance">Shrine of Remembrance</a> in 1934 saw a series of reunions. Ian and Edward arrived from India on leave, Alexander Godley came from Britain, and <a href="Richard%20Howard-Vyse">Richard Howard-Vyse</a> as chief of staff to <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester</a>. In 1937, Chauvel travelled to the United Kingdom as head of the Australian contingent for the <a href="coronation">coronation</a> of <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a>, where he was welcomed by Chetwode and Howard-Vyse. Chauvel had the contingent dressed as light horsemen, wearing emu plumes, <a href="bandolier">bandolier</a>s and <a href="spur">spur</a>s. When the <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a> troops assembled at <a href="Buckingham%20Palace">Buckingham Palace</a> to receive their <a href="King%20George%20VI%20Coronation%20Medal">King George VI Coronation Medal</a>s, Chauvel led the parade, with Howard-Vyse as his chief of staff. On the way back, the contingent visited France, where ceremonies were held at the <a href="Villers%E2%80%93Bretonneux%20Australian%20National%20Memorial">Villers–Bretonneux Australian National Memorial</a> and the <a href="Arc%20de%20Triomphe">Arc de Triomphe</a>. Chauvel frequently led <a href="Anzac%20Day">Anzac Day</a> parades through Melbourne but resigned from the leadership of the march in 1938 in protest against a decision by the <a href="Returned%20and%20Services%20League%20of%20Australia">Returned and Services League of Australia</a> to change the form of service at the Shrine from a Christian to a <a href="secular">secular</a> one.

During the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, Chauvel was recalled to duty as Inspector in Chief of the <a href="Volunteer%20Defence%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">Volunteer Defence Corps</a> (VDC), the Australian version of the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British Home Guard</a>. Following Brudenell White's death in the <a href="Canberra%20air%20disaster%2C%201940">Canberra air disaster</a>, Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> turned to Chauvel for advice on a successor as Chief of the General Staff. On Chauvel's recommendation, Menzies appointed Lieutenant General <a href="Vernon%20Sturdee">Vernon Sturdee</a> to the post. During the war, Chauvel's son Ian served as staff officer in the <a href="Italian%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Italian campaign</a>, while Edward was posted to <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a> to learn about <a href="jungle%20warfare">jungle warfare</a> from the Australian Army. Chauvel's daughter Eve joined the <a href="Women%27s%20Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20Service">Women's Royal Australian Naval Service</a> and spent a day in a lifeboat in the <a href="North%20Atlantic">North Atlantic</a> after her ship was <a href="torpedo">torpedo</a>ed by a <a href="U-Boat">U-Boat</a>. Tom Mitchell was captured by the Japanese in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Singapore">Battle of Singapore</a>. Chauvel remained with the VDC, based at <a href="Victoria%20Barracks%2C%20Melbourne">Victoria Barracks, Melbourne</a> but constantly travelling on inspections until his death on 4 March 1945.
Chauvel was given a state funeral service at <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Melbourne">St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne</a> officiated by the <a href="Anglican%20Diocese%20of%20Melbourne">Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne</a>, <a href="Joseph%20John%20Booth">Joseph John Booth</a>, after which he was <a href="cremated">cremated</a> at <a href="Springvale%20Crematorium">Springvale Crematorium</a> with full military honours. Eight generals acted as <a href="pallbearers">pallbearers</a>: Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Northcott">John Northcott</a>, Chief of the General Staff; Lieutenant General <a href="John%20Whitham">John Whitham</a>, Corps Commander, VDC; Major General <a href="James%20Cannan">James Cannan</a>, <a href="Quartermaster%20General">Quartermaster General</a>; Major General <a href="Charles%20Brand%20%28general%29">Charles Brand</a>; Major General <a href="Cyril%20Clowes">Cyril Clowes</a>, GOC, Victoria Line of Communications Area; Major General <a href="John%20Austin%20Chapman">John Austin Chapman</a>, Deputy Chief of General Staff; Major General <a href="Charles%20Lloyd%20%28Australian%20general%29">Charles Lloyd</a>, <a href="Adjutant%20General">Adjutant General</a>; and Major General <a href="Clive%20Steele">Clive Steele</a>, Engineer in Chief.

Portraits of Chauvel are held by the <a href="Australian%20War%20Memorial">Australian War Memorial</a> in Canberra, the <a href="Naval%20and%20Military%20Club">Naval and Military Club</a> in Melbourne, and the <a href="Imperial%20War%20Museum">Imperial War Museum</a> in London. A portrait by <a href="George%20Washington%20Lambert">George Washington Lambert</a> is in the possession of the family. Chauvel is commemorated in a bronze plaque in St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne. His sword is in Christ Church, <a href="South%20Yarra%2C%20Melbourne">South Yarra</a> and his uniform in the Australian War Memorial. There is also a memorial window in the chapel of the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>. Chauvel Street in North Ryde, Sydney is named in his honour.

Chauvel's daughter <a href="Elyne%20Mitchell">Elyne Mitchell</a> wrote a number of non-fiction works about her father and his corps. In his book "<a href="Seven%20Pillars%20of%20Wisdom">Seven Pillars of Wisdom</a>", <a href="T.%20E.%20Lawrence">T. E. Lawrence</a> provided a wildly inaccurate version of Chauvel. <a href="Charles%20Bean">Charles Bean</a> noted that "this wise, good and considerate commander was far from the stupid martinet that readers of Lawrence's "Seven Pillars of Wisdom" might infer." Lawrence confessed that "little of his book was strict truth though most of it was based on fact."

Chauvel's nephew <a href="Charles%20Chauvel%20%28filmmaker%29">Charles Chauvel</a> became a well-known film director, whose films included "<a href="Forty%20Thousand%20Horsemen">Forty Thousand Horsemen</a>" (1940), about the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beersheba%20%281917%29">Battle of Beersheba</a>.

Harry Chauvel was portrayed in film: by <a href="Bill%20Kerr">Bill Kerr</a> in "<a href="The%20Lighthorsemen%20%28film%29">The Lighthorsemen</a>" (1987), which covered the exploits of an Australian cavalry regiment during the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Gaza">Third Battle of Gaza</a>; by Ray Edwards in "" (1990), which took place around the 1919 <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris peace conference</a>; and by <a href="Colin%20Baker">Colin Baker</a> in the 1992 "<a href="The%20Young%20Indiana%20Jones%20Chronicles">Young Indiana Jones</a>" TV movie "Daredevils of the Desert", another retelling of the Third Battle of Gaza from the director of "The Lighthorsemen".

Paranoid Android

"Paranoid Android" is a song by the English <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a> band <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>, released as the lead single from their third studio album "<a href="OK%20Computer">OK Computer</a>" (1997) on 26 May 1997. The darkly humorous lyrics were written primarily by singer <a href="Thom%20Yorke">Thom Yorke</a> following an unpleasant experience in a <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> bar. The song is over six minutes long and contains four distinct <a href="section%20%28music%29">sections</a>. "Paranoid Android" takes its name from <a href="Marvin%20the%20Paranoid%20Android">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> of <a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a>' "<a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>" series.

Released as the lead single from "OK Computer", "Paranoid Android" charted at number three on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a>. It was well received by music critics. The track has appeared regularly on lists of the best songs of all time, including "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s <a href="500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a>. Its animated <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, directed by <a href="Magnus%20Carlsson%20%28illustrator%29">Magnus Carlsson</a>, was placed on <a href="heavy%20rotation">heavy rotation</a> on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>, although the network censored portions containing nudity in the US. At the <a href="1998%20Brit%20Awards">1998 Brit Awards</a>, the song was nominated for <a href="1998%20Brit%20Awards%23The%20awards">Best British Single</a>. Since its release, the track has been covered by numerous artists working in a variety of musical genres. The song was included in the 2008 "" collection.

Radiohead fused together parts from three different songs, each written by a different member of the band. The idea to combine the pieces into a single track was inspired in part by the <a href="through-composed">through-composed</a> structure of <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' "<a href="Happiness%20Is%20a%20Warm%20Gun">Happiness Is a Warm Gun</a>". 
<a href="Colin%20Greenwood">Colin Greenwood</a> admitted that the band, in attempting to make the disparate elements work together, "felt like irresponsible schoolboys who were doing this ... naughty thing, 'cause nobody does a six-and-a-half-minute song with all these changes. It's ridiculous". The song was at first intended to be humorous, and took its title from <a href="Marvin%20the%20Paranoid%20Android">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> in <a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a>' "<a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>" series of books. Yorke said the title "was chosen as a joke. It was like, 'Oh, I'm so depressed.' And I just thought, that's great. That's how people would "like" me to be. And that was the end of writing about anything personal in the song. The rest of the song is not personal at all." In an early interview, Colin Greenwood described it "just a joke, a laugh, getting wasted together over a couple of evenings and putting some different pieces together". The band used <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen's</a> "<a href="Bohemian%20Rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>" and the work of <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a> as reference points while writing; yet <a href="Ed%20O%27Brien">Ed O'Brien</a> denies they wrote "a 'Bohemian Rhapsody' for the nineties", and <a href="Jonny%20Greenwood">Jonny Greenwood</a> considers it too tense and simple to rival Queen's song.

"Paranoid Android" was recorded in actress <a href="Jane%20Seymour%20%28actress%29">Jane Seymour</a>'s 15th-century mansion near the village of <a href="St%20Catherine%2C%20Somerset">St Catherine</a>, near <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath, Somerset</a>. The first edit was over 14 minutes long and included a long <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> interlude performed by <a href="Jonny%20Greenwood">Jonny Greenwood</a>. Radiohead played this extended version during a tour with <a href="Alanis%20Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a> in September 1996. "When we started playing it live, it was completely hilarious," recalled O'Brien. "There was a rave down section and a <a href="Hammond%20organ">Hammond organ</a> outro, and we'd be pissing ourselves while we played. We'd bring out the <a href="glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a> and it would be really, really funny." Before the song's first live performance, Yorke told audiences that "[i]f you can have sex to this one, you're fucking weird." He also sarcastically referred to the version of the song played during the tour as "a <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> <a href="Cover%20version">cover</a>".

Inspired by the editing of The Beatles' "<a href="Magical%20Mystery%20Tour">Magical Mystery Tour</a>" (described by Colin Greenwood as "brutal"), Radiohead shortened the song to a final six and a half minutes, a process that led to Jonny Greenwood's organ section being replaced by a substantially shorter guitar fade out. However, it took the band a year and a half to learn how to play the final version in live performance.

"Paranoid Android" is a song described as <a href="alternative%20rock">alternative rock</a>, <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a> and <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a>. It has four distinct sections, each played in <a href="standard%20tuning">standard tuning</a>, and a <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a>, although several three-<a href="Bar%20%28music%29">bar</a> segments in the second section are played in timing.

The opening segment is played in the <a href="musical%20key">key</a> of <a href="G%20minor">G minor</a> with a <a href="tempo">tempo</a> of 84 beats per minute (BPM), and begins with a mid-tempo acoustic guitar backed by <a href="Idiophone">shaken</a> <a href="percussion">percussion</a> before layered with electric guitar and Yorke's vocals. The melody of the opening vocal lines spans an <a href="octave">octave</a> and a third. 

The second section is written in the key of <a href="A%20minor">A minor</a> and begins about two minutes into the song. Although the second section retains the tempo of the first, it differs rhythmically. Ending the second section is a <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">distorted</a> <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a> played by Jonny Greenwood, which lasts from 2:43 to 3:33. 

The third section was written by Jonny Greenwood, and reduces the tempo to 63 BPM. The harmonies form a looped chord progression resembling a <a href="Baroque%20music">Baroque</a> <a href="passacaglia">passacaglia</a>, with the tonality split between C minor and D minor. This section uses multi-tracked, <a href="Choir">choral</a> vocal arrangement and according to Dai Griffiths, a "chord sequence [that ordinarily] would sound seedy, rather like something by the band <a href="Portishead%20%28band%29">Portishead</a>".

The fourth and final section, which begins at 5:35, is a brief instrumental <a href="reprise">reprise</a> of the second movement that serves as a <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a>. After a second solo, a brief guitar <a href="riff">riff</a> is introduced, which Jonny Greenwood says "was something I had floating around for a while and the song needed a certain burn. It happened to be the right key and the right speed and it fit right in." The song ends, as does the second section, with a short <a href="Chromatic%20scale">chromatically</a> descending guitar <a href="Motif%20%28music%29">motif</a>.

"Paranoid Android" is categorised by three distinct moods written in what Yorke referred to as three different states of mind. The song's lyrics tie in with a number of themes common in "OK Computer", including <a href="insanity">insanity</a>, violence, <a href="slogan">slogan</a>s, and political objection to <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>. Yorke's lyrics were based on an unpleasant experience at a Los Angeles bar during which he was surrounded by strangers high on <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>. In particular, Yorke was frightened by a woman who became violent after someone spilled a drink on her. Yorke characterised the woman as "inhuman", and said "There was a look in this woman's eyes that I'd never seen before anywhere. ... Couldn't sleep that night because of it." The woman inspired the line "kicking squealing <a href="Gucci">Gucci</a> little piggy" in the song's second section. Yorke, referring to the line "With your opinions, which are of no consequence at all", said that "Again, that's just a joke. It's actually the other way around – it's actually "my" opinion that is of no consequence at all."

While Colin Greenwood said the song was "hardly the radio-friendly, breakthrough, buzz bin unit shifter [radio stations] have been expecting," Capitol supported the band's choice for the song as a lead single. Radiohead premiered "Paranoid Android" on the <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> programme "The Evening Session" in April 1997, nearly a month before its release as a single. "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" revealed that a Radio 1 producer had to "have a bit of a lie down" after first hearing the song. It was released as a single on 26 May 1997, chosen by the band to prepare listeners for the musical direction of its parent album. Despite an initial lack of radio play, "Paranoid Android" charted at number three on the UK Singles Chart, giving Radiohead their highest singles chart position. As the song's popularity grew, Radio 1 played it up to 12 times a day. Yorke described the song's appearance on Radio 1 as one of his proudest moments of the "OK Computer" era. The track also spent two weeks on <a href="Australia">Australia</a>'s <a href="ARIA%20Singles%20Chart">ARIA Singles Chart</a>, where it charted at number 29.

"Paranoid Android" received acclaim from music critics. "<a href="NME">NME</a>" chose it as its "Single of the Week", and journalist Simon Williams described how the song "[s]prawls out like a plump man on a small sofa, featuring all manner of crypto-<a href="flamenco">flamenco</a> shufflings, <a href="medieval">medieval</a> wailings, furiously wrenched guitars and ravishingly over-ambitious ideas. Possesses one of the most unorthodox 'axe' solos known to mankind." The style of the song was compared to that of <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a> by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s <a href="Mark%20Kemp">Mark Kemp</a>, while other critics, including <a href="David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29">David Browne</a> of "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", Jon Lusk of the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and Simon Williams of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" wrote about its similarity to Queen's "<a href="Bohemian%20Rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>". Williams described the song as being "not unlike 'Bohemian Rhapsody' being played backwards by a bunch of <a href="Vietnam%20war">Vietnam</a> vets high on <a href="Kings%20Cross%2C%20London">Kings Cross</a>-quality <a href="crack%20cocaine">crack</a>". Kemp praised the song's mix of acoustic and electronic instrumentation, which he believed were melded to produce "complex tempo changes, touches of dissonance, ancient <a href="choral%20music">choral music</a> and a <a href="King%20Crimson">King Crimson</a>-like melodic structure". Meanwhile Browne wrote of "celestial call-and-response vocal passages, dynamically varied sections, and Thom Yorke's high-voiced bleat". "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" called the song unforgettable and an "amazing epic single".

Several reviewers noted the record's ambition. "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" described the song's lyrics as a "multipart anti-<a href="yuppie">yuppie</a> anthem whose ambition is anything but ugly", and Andy Gill wrote in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" that "Paranoid Android" could be the most ambitious single since <a href="Jimmy%20Webb">Jimmy Webb</a>'s "<a href="MacArthur%20Park%20%28song%29">MacArthur Park</a>". Craig McLean of "<a href="The%20Sydney%20Morning%20Herald">The Sydney Morning Herald</a>" described "Paranoid Android" as "a titanic guitar <a href="opera">opera</a> in three movements and 6 [and a half] minutes". <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>' Evan Sawdey called the song "OK Computer"s "sweeping, multi-tiered centerpiece", Peter and Jonathan Buckley wrote in "The Rough Guide to Rock" that it was the album's "breathtaking high point". <a href="Allmusic">Allmusic</a>'s <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> called "Paranoid Android" "complex, multi-segmented ... tight, melodic, and muscular", and said it displayed Radiohead at their most adventurous. Browne admitted that, partially because of "Paranoid Android", "OK Computer" was significantly more expansive than "<a href="The%20Bends">The Bends</a>". "Rolling Stone" placed the song at number 256 on its <a href="500%20Greatest%20Songs%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Songs of All Time</a> list, and "<a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a>" included the song at number 4 on their "Top 200 Tracks of the 90s".

Remarking on the band's goals for the "Paranoid Android" <a href="music%20video">music video</a>, Yorke said that, "When it came time to make the video for that song, we had lots of people saying, 'Yeah, great, we can have another video like "<a href="Street%20Spirit%20%28Fade%20Out%29">Street Spirit</a>", all moody and black and dark.' Well, no. We had really good fun doing this song, so the video should make you laugh. I mean, it should be sick, too." <a href="Magnus%20Carlsson%20%28illustrator%29">Magnus Carlsson</a>, <a href="Swedish%20people">Swedish</a> creator of the animated series "<a href="Robin%20%28TV%20series%29">Robin</a>", was commissioned by the band to make the video. Radiohead were fans of the show, and connected with the Robin character; Jonny Greenwood described him as "affectionate" and "vulnerable", while Yorke admitted that he found Robin "quite the vulnerable character, but he's also violently cynical and quite tough and would always get up again." At first Carlsson sought to work on a video for "<a href="No%20Surprises">No Surprises</a>" and was uncertain as to how to approach "Paranoid Android". Eventually he devised a scenario to the band's liking after he locked himself in his office for over 12 hours to stare out of the window, while listening to the song on repeat while jotting down visual ideas. As Carlsson did not have access to the lyrics at the time, the concept for the video was based entirely on the song's sound. According to Yorke, the band "deliberately didn't send Magnus the lyrics" because they "didn't want [the video] to be too literal."

Like "Robin", the "Paranoid Android" video is drawn in a simplistic style that emphasises bold colours and clear, strong lines. It features Robin and his friend Benjamin venturing into the world, running into miserable <a href="European%20Union">EU</a> representatives, bullying pub patrons, a <a href="prostitution">prostitute</a>, two kissing <a href="leather%20subculture">leathermen</a>, a <a href="drug%20addiction">drug addict</a>, deranged businessmen, <a href="mermaid">mermaid</a>s and an <a href="angel">angel</a> who plays <a href="table%20tennis">table tennis</a> with Robin. The band appears in cameo at a bar, where they are shown drinking while watching a man with a head coming out of his belly dancing on their table. However, in this cameo only the versions of Yorke and Jonny Greenwood resemble themselves; O'Brien said "If you freeze-frame it on the video, the guy with the five strands of hair slicked back, that's Colin. It looks nothing like him." Colin Greenwood said "there was no way that we could appear in it to perform in it because that would be so <a href="Spinal%20Tap%20%28band%29">Spinal Tap</a>" and that having animations that did not resemble the band members allowed the video to be "twisted and colorful which is how the song is anyway". Yorke was ultimately pleased with the video, saying that it "is really about the violence around [Robin], which is exactly like the song. Not the same specific violence as in the lyrics, but everything going on around him is deeply troubling and violent, but he's just drinking himself into oblivion. He's there, but he's not there. That's why it works. And that's why it does my head in every time I see it."

While the single did not receive significant radio play in the US, <a href="MTV">MTV</a> placed its video on high rotation. The version most often shown was edited to remove the mermaids' bare breasts. Greenwood said, "we would've understood if they had a problem with some guy chopping his arms and legs off, but I mean, a woman's breasts! And mermaids as well! It's fucked up." <a href="MTV%20Europe">MTV Europe</a> played the video uncut for two weeks because the channel's official censor was ill and unable to work; after that time the channel ran the cut version of the video. A later US version of the video saw the mermaids wear bathing suits, while the uncut version was later compiled along with other Radiohead videos on the DVD and home video release "<a href="7%20Television%20Commercials">7 Television Commercials</a>" and .

Evan Sawdey of <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> described the video as "bizarre-yet-fitting", and "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" said it represented a stunning "psycho-cartoon". Adrian Glover of "<a href="Circus%20%28magazine%29">Circus</a>" called the animation incredible and the video "really cool". MTV vice president of music Lewis Largent told "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" "You can watch 'Paranoid Android' a hundred times and not figure it all out."

<a href="Stanley%20Donwood">Stanley Donwood</a> worked with Yorke to design the artwork for most of the "Paranoid Android" releases, although both the images and design were ultimately credited to "dumb computers". The cover illustration accompanying the single depicts a hand-drawn dome that contains the phrase "God loves his children, yeah!", the last line of the song, written above on the uppermost plane. Images from the "OK Computer" artwork reappear, including a pig and two human figures shaking hands. Writer <a href="Tim%20Footman">Tim Footman</a> suggested that these images are borrowed from Pink Floyd, respectively corresponding to the <a href="Pink%20Floyd%20pigs">Pink Floyd pigs</a> and "<a href="Wish%20You%20Were%20Here%20%28Pink%20Floyd%20album%29">Wish You Were Here</a>" cover. The cover of the CD2 single is <a href="Tints%20and%20shades">tinted</a> differently from the CD1 single. The UK vinyl release did not include the dome artwork found on the CD singles, but feature images taken from the "OK Computer" release across the top banner area, along with the phrase "against demons".

The two versions of the single have different messages on the reverse. Both the CD1 and <a href="Japan">Japan</a>ese releases state:
Written on the back of the CD2 single is:
Each release of "Paranoid Android" included one or more <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-sides</a>. "Polyethylene (Parts 1 & 2)", included on the CD1, 7-inch vinyl, and Japanese releases of the single, were a multi-section piece formatted much like "Paranoid Android" itself. The first part of the song consists of Yorke's vocals over acoustic guitar; the second part contains distorted guitar and <a href="Organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> and uses complex time signature changes. "Pearly*", featured on the CD1 and Japanese releases of the single, was described by Yorke as a "dirty song for people who use sex for dirty things". "A Reminder", which appears on the CD2 release, features fuzzed guitar, thumping drums, and <a href="electric%20piano">electric piano</a>. According to Yorke, this song was inspired by "this idea of someone writing a song, sending it to someone, and saying: 'If I ever lose it, you just pick up the phone and play this song back to remind me.'" "Melatonin", also on the CD2 release, is a synthesiser-based song with lyrics similar to that of a <a href="lullaby">lullaby</a>, but with an undercurrent of menace in lines like "Death to all who stand in your way". The "OK Computer" track "Let Down" is also included on the Japanese single.

YouTube cover artist Mike Massé recorded a live acoustic version of "Paranoid Android" with Jeff Hall on 9/8/08 at the Pie Pizzeria in Salt Lake City, Utah.

American metal band <a href="System%20of%20a%20Down">System of a Down</a> additionally performed a cover of Paranoid Android at a Los Angeles live performance in 2000.

<a href="Jazz">Jazz</a> <a href="pianist">pianist</a> <a href="Brad%20Mehldau">Brad Mehldau</a> recorded a nine-minute <a href="Cover%20version">cover</a> of "Paranoid Android" on his album "<a href="Largo%20%28album%29">Largo</a>" (2002), featuring percussionists <a href="Jim%20Keltner">Jim Keltner</a> and <a href="Matt%20Chamberlain">Matt Chamberlain</a>, as well as a horn section. Additionally, Mehldau performed a 19-minute version of the song on "<a href="Live%20in%20Tokyo%20%28Brad%20Mehldau%20album%29">Live in Tokyo</a>" (2004). Yet another solo version of 9 minutes appeared on the promotional album "Deregulating Jazz" (2000).

The <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Amherst">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> <a href="University%20of%20Massachusetts%20Minuteman%20Marching%20Band">Minuteman Marching Band</a> covered the song live in a version featuring <a href="xylophone">xylophone</a>s, <a href="chimes">chimes</a>, <a href="snare%20drum">snare drum</a>s, <a href="cymbal">cymbal</a>s, <a href="bass%20drum">bass drum</a> and <a href="timpani">timpani</a>.

Numerous Radiohead <a href="tribute%20album">tribute album</a>s include a version of "Paranoid Android", including "Rockabye Baby! Lullaby Renditions of Radiohead" and "Plastic Mutations: The Electronic Tribute to Radiohead".

The <a href="reggae">reggae</a> group <a href="Easy%20Star%20All-Stars">Easy Star All-Stars</a> covered "OK Computer" in its entirety for "<a href="Radiodread">Radiodread</a>" (2006). Producer Michael G noted that "Paranoid Android" was particularly difficult to arrange for reggae, saying "There are songs like 'Paranoid Android', which flips between 4/4 time and 7/8 time about 13 times, and I also had to think about other ways to reinterpret those parts with horns, melodica, organ ... it was a great challenge."

<a href="Sia%20Furler">Sia Furler</a> covered the song for the <a href="neo%20soul">neo soul</a> tribute "" (2006), and this version later appeared on "<a href="The%20O.C.">The O.C.</a>" episode "<a href="The%20Chrismukk-huh%3F">The Chrismukk-huh?</a>".

"Paranoid Android" has also been covered by <a href="classical%20music">classical music</a>ians. <a href="Christopher%20O%27Riley">Christopher O'Riley</a> arranged "Paranoid Android" for a single <a href="piano">piano</a> and performed the song on "<a href="Hold%20Me%20to%20This">Hold Me to This</a>" (2005).

Los Angeles <a href="string%20quartet">string quartet</a> The Section recorded the song for "Strung Out on OK Computer: The String Quartet Tribute to Radiohead" (2001); half of this quartet went on to form the Section Quartet, who performed "Paranoid Android" and the rest of "OK Computer" during two concerts in October 2006.

<a href="Weezer">Weezer</a> covered "Paranoid Android" in both a live studio version released as a <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> video and in concerts during their 2011 summer tour. "Pitchfork"s Tom Breihan called the Weezer cover "a "fucking weird" experience", and Jenny Eliscu of "Rolling Stone" criticised the song as "mainly boring" for not venturing far enough from Weezer's traditional sound.

A piano cover was featured in an episode of the <a href="HBO">HBO</a> television series "<a href="Westworld%20%28TV%20series%29">Westworld</a>" in 2016.

Crusaders (rugby union)

The Crusaders (formerly the Canterbury Crusaders and officially the BNZ Crusaders due to sponsorship by the <a href="Bank%20of%20New%20Zealand">Bank of New Zealand</a>) are a New Zealand professional <a href="rugby%20union">rugby union</a> team based in <a href="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>, who compete in the <a href="Super%20Rugby">Super Rugby</a> competition. They have won 9 titles (<a href="1998%20Super%2012%20season">1998</a>, <a href="1999%20Super%2012%20season">1999</a>, <a href="2000%20Super%2012%20season">2000</a>, <a href="2002%20Super%2012%20season">2002</a>, <a href="2005%20Super%2012%20season">2005</a>, <a href="2006%20Super%2014%20season">2006</a>, <a href="2008%20Super%2014%20season">2008</a>, <a href="2017%20Super%20Rugby%20season">2017</a> and <a href="2018%20Super%20Rugby%20season">2018</a>).

Formed in 1996 to represent the upper <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a> of New Zealand in the Super 12, the Crusaders represent the <a href="Buller%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Buller</a>, <a href="Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Canterbury</a>, <a href="Mid%20Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Mid-Canterbury</a>, <a href="South%20Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">South Canterbury</a>, <a href="Tasman%20Rugby%20Union">Tasman</a> and <a href="West%20Coast%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">West Coast</a> provincial Rugby Unions. Their main home ground is <a href="Lancaster%20Park">AMI Stadium</a>, formerly known as Jade Stadium and before that, Lancaster Park. They are the current Super Rugby champions. 

The Crusaders struggled in the first season of the Super 12, 1996, finishing last. Their performance improved in 1997 and the team finished sixth (out of twelve teams). The team went on to win all three titles from 1998 to 2000 despite each final being played away from home. They again won the competition in 2002 after going through the season unbeaten. In the following two seasons, they again reached the final, although they were beaten on both occasions. 2005 was the last season of the Super 12 before its expansion. After finishing top of the table in that season, the Crusaders went on to host the final in which they defeated the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">Waratahs</a>. As a result of winning their fifth Super 12 title, the Crusaders were given the trophy to keep. In 2006, the Crusaders hosted the <a href="Hurricanes%20%28Super%20rugby%20franchise%29">Hurricanes</a> in the inaugural <a href="2006%20Super%2014%20Final">Super 14 final</a> and won 19–12. In 2008 the Crusaders hosted the <a href="2008%20Super%2014%20Final">final</a> at AMI Stadium against the Waratahs, and won the match 20–12 to claim their seventh title. Their eighth championship came in the 2017 Super Rugby competition against the <a href="Lions%20%28Super%20Rugby%29">Lions</a>. The Crusaders hosted the Lions in 2018 for the final and won 37-18, securing their ninth title.

The Crusaders franchise was created as one of five New Zealand teams in the Super 12. Originally named the "Canterbury Crusaders", the Crusaders' franchise area encompassed the upper <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a> of New Zealand (see "<a href="Super%20Rugby%20franchise%20areas">Super Rugby franchise areas</a>"), and was formed from the Buller, Canterbury, <a href="Marlborough%20Rugby%20Union">Marlborough</a>, Mid-Canterbury, <a href="Nelson%20Bays%20Rugby%20Union">Nelson Bays</a>, South Canterbury, and West Coast rugby unions. The original Crusaders team of 1996 was captained by <a href="All%20Blacks">All Blacks</a> <a href="Rugby%20union%20positions%231.%20Loosehead%20prop%20.26%203.%20Tighthead%20prop">prop</a> <a href="Richard%20Loe">Richard Loe</a> and coached by Vance Stewart. The Crusaders struggled in the inaugural season and finished bottom of the table with only two wins. Their eight losses included a 49–18 loss to the <a href="Blues%20%28Super%20Rugby%29">Blues</a> and a 52–16 loss to the <a href="Queensland%20Reds">Queensland Reds</a>. And the First ever tour was a pre-visit to South Africa prior start of Super 12.

The following season saw a change in captain and coach, with <a href="Todd%20Blackadder">Todd Blackadder</a> succeeding Loe as captain and <a href="Wayne%20Smith%20%28rugby%20player%29">Wayne Smith</a> taking over as coach. With five wins, the team finished the round-robin stage in sixth place. The improvement was particularly illustrated by the Crusaders' 29–28 loss to the defending champions, the Blues, which contrasted with their 49–18 loss the previous season. (The Blues also went on to win the 1997 title). During this loss, <a href="Leon%20MacDonald">Leon MacDonald</a> was taken out with a shoulder charge by Robin Brooke. While the Crusaders attempted to get MacDonald back on the field, the Blues scored two tries, including one by Brooke, who was later suspended for two weeks for the shoulder charge. In their last game of 1997, the Crusaders beat the Queensland Reds 48–3 at <a href="Lancaster%20Park">Lancaster Park</a>, now known as AMI Stadium.

The Crusaders won their first title in 1998, despite starting the season with three losses in their first four games. They finished the <a href="Round-robin%20tournament">round-robin</a> by winning their last seven games, culminating in a last-round win over the Coastal Sharks (now the ) that gave them second place in the round-robin phase of the competition. Their second-placing allowed them to host their semi-final at Lancaster Park, where they won the match 36–32 against the Coastal Sharks.

In the final at <a href="Eden%20Park">Eden Park</a>, the Crusaders faced the Blues, who were heavy favourites. According to Crusaders' hooker <a href="Mark%20Hammett">Mark Hammett</a>, "If we'd been polled in that week, and had to give an honest answer, most of the boys, deep down, would probably have thought that the Blues would beat us." The Crusaders were ahead 3–0 at half time, but the Blues scored first after half time to take a 10–3 lead after 53 minutes. After Crusader <a href="Norm%20Maxwell">Norm Maxwell</a> scored a try, the game was tied 10 all. Then, after a <a href="penalty%20%28rugby%29">penalty</a> each, the two teams were tied 13 all with one minute of regulation time remaining. At that moment, Andrew Mehrtens chipped the ball for James Kerr to run onto and score, giving the Crusaders a 20–13 win after the try was <a href="Try%23Conversion">converted</a>. The ten points scored by Andrew Mehrtens in the final contributed to his total of 206 points for the season − a record for the Super 12. Upon the Crusaders' return to Christchurch, they were given a parade through the city that drew 100,000 people.

The 1999 season was equally successful for the Crusaders despite struggling to make the play-offs in fourth place after winning their last four round-robin matches. They defeated the favoured Queensland Reds (who had finished top in the round-robin) in their semi-final to advance to the final against the <a href="Highlanders%20%28rugby%29">Otago Highlanders</a> (since renamed the "Highlanders"). The all-<a href="South%20Island">South Island</a> final in <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a> was promoted as "the party at Tony Brown's house" after Highlanders <a href="Fly-half%20%28rugby%20union%29">first five-eighths</a> <a href="Tony%20Brown%20%28rugby%20player%29">Tony Brown</a>. Again playing away from home, the Crusaders won 24–19. The decisive try of the match was scored by Crusaders <a href="Wing%20%28rugby%20union%29">winger</a> <a href="Afato%20So%27oalo">Afato So'oalo</a> when he chipped the ball, then out-sprinted All Blacks winger <a href="Jeff%20Wilson%20%28sportsman%29">Jeff Wilson</a> to collect the ball and score.

Following the All Blacks' semi-final loss in the 1999 <a href="Rugby%20World%20Cup">Rugby World Cup</a>, <a href="Wayne%20Smith%20%28rugby%20player%29">Wayne Smith</a> succeeded <a href="John%20Hart%20%28rugby%20coach%29">John Hart</a> as All Blacks coach. Crusaders manager <a href="Robbie%20Deans">Robbie Deans</a> replaced Smith as Crusaders coach. In Deans' first year in charge, the Crusaders won their third title in a row − a feat that has not since been repeated. The Crusaders finished second in the round-robin, earning them the right to host a semi-final in which they faced the Highlanders at Jade Stadium. Two tries in the final 20 minutes by <a href="Marika%20Vunibaka">Marika Vunibaka</a> helped the Crusaders to a 37–15 win. The 2000 <a href="Super%2012">Super 12</a> Final was played against the <a href="Brumbies%20Rugby">Brumbies</a> in <a href="Canberra%2C%20Australia">Canberra, Australia</a>, where the weather for the final was icy, with sleet and snow. The game was low-scoring, with only one try each. Four penalties by Mehrtens gave the Crusaders a 12–6 half time lead. Following a Brumbies penalty four minutes from time, the Brumbies led 19–17. However, the Crusaders were awarded a penalty from the resulting kick-off, and after Mehrtens converted the penalty, the Crusaders went on to win the game 20–19.

After winning three consecutive Super 12 titles, the Crusaders finished tenth in 2001 – their worst finish since 1996. The season was the last for captain Todd Blackadder before he left to play for <a href="Edinburgh%20Rugby">Edinburgh</a> in Scotland.

The Crusaders bounced back dramatically in 2002 when they went through the Super 12 season unbeaten, achieving their fourth title. Although the Crusaders won all eleven of their round-robin matches, six of them were won by a margin of seven points or less. Their eleven round-robin games also included a record 96–19 win over the Waratahs in the final match of the round-robin stage, which was especially noteworthy given that both teams finished at the top of the table.

The Crusaders met the Highlanders in their 2002 semi-final, which they eventually won 34–23 after being ahead 18–6 at half time. The following week, they faced the Brumbies in the first final to be hosted at Jade Stadium. The Brumbies trailed 11–3 after the first half, having had only 30 per cent possession. Although the Brumbies closed the gap to 14–13 with eight minutes to go, the Crusaders held on and steadied to win 31–13 with a last-minute try to <a href="Caleb%20Ralph">Caleb Ralph</a>. The season was their first under the captaincy of <a href="Reuben%20Thorne">Reuben Thorne</a>, who went on to captain the All Blacks until the end of the <a href="2003%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2003 Rugby World Cup</a>.

The Crusaders' winning run finally came to an end when they were beaten 39–5 by the Blues in the third round of the 2003 Super 12 season. Although their 15-match unbeaten streak had ended, Richie McCaw said of the loss, "...in some ways it was almost a relief. We'd finally been beaten, the run was over, so people could stop talking about it and we could get on with playing it week by week." The Crusaders recovered to finish second on the table with eight wins. They hosted a semi-final against the Hurricanes, who were coached by Colin Cooper, a former assistant coach for the Crusaders. Despite this inside knowledge of the team by the Wellington coach, the Crusaders won the match 39–16. In the final, the Crusaders met the Blues, another team coached by a former Crusaders assistant coach, <a href="Peter%20Sloane">Peter Sloane</a>. Hooker <a href="Mark%20Hammett">Mark Hammett</a> scored two tries to give the Crusaders a 10–6 lead at half-time. The Blues hit back to lead 21–10 with ten minutes to go. The Crusaders managed another converted try, but it was not enough, and the Blues won 21–17.

The Crusaders' 2004 season began with two losses: first to the Waratahs, then to the Blues. They recovered to again finish second on the table with seven wins. They played the Stormers at Jade Stadium in their semi-final, and won 27–16. They met the Brumbies at <a href="Canberra%20Stadium">Canberra Stadium</a> in a replay of the 2000 final. The Brumbies dominated in the final, scoring 33 unanswered points in the first 19 minutes. The Crusaders managed to salvage some pride by narrowing the loss to a 47–38 finish.

The 2005 season started with a repeat of the previous year's final: a Brumbies victory over the Crusaders in Canberra. There was a win the following week at home over the <a href="Chiefs%20%28Super%20rugby%20franchise%29">Chiefs</a>, followed by a win over the Reds at <a href="Trafalgar%20Park%2C%20Nelson">Trafalgar Park</a>. Although there was a 35–20 loss to the Bulls after Crusaders captain Richie McCaw was knocked unconscious, they eventually finished the regular season top of the table. McCaw returned from his five weeks on the sideline to lead the Crusaders in their semi-final victory over the Hurricanes. They faced the Waratahs in the final at Jade Stadium. 
Leading 14–6 at halftime, the Crusaders then moved out to a 29-point lead. Despite three late tries by the Waratahs, the Crusaders won their fifth title with a 35–20 win.

As a reward for their seventh finals appearance and fifth title, the Crusaders were allowed to keep the Super 12 trophy. After the 2005 season, the franchise saw the departure of stalwarts <a href="Andrew%20Mehrtens">Andrew Mehrtens</a> and <a href="Justin%20Marshall">Justin Marshall</a>, both of whom had played for the team since its formation in 1996.

In 2006, the Super 12 expanded to form the Super 14 when the <a href="Western%20Force">Western Force</a> from <a href="Perth%2C%20Western%20Australia">Perth</a>, Australia, and the <a href="Cheetahs%20%28rugby%20union%29">Cheetahs</a> from the <a href="Free%20State%20Province">Free State</a> and <a href="Northern%20Cape%20Province">Northern Cape Province</a>s, South Africa joined the competition. An unbeaten run of sixteen matches was nearly halted when the Crusaders drew with the Western Force in Perth in round eleven. The following week, the unbeaten run was ended when the Crusaders lost to the Stormers in Cape Town. That loss was their only one of the year, as they finished top of the table with eleven wins. After beating the Bulls in their semi-final, the Crusaders faced the Hurricanes in the final at Jade Stadium that was played in a thick fog, causing poor visibility. Sections of the crowd could not see the field, and many spectators left during the match. The scorers were tied 9–9 going into the game's last 20 minutes. The Crusaders' <a href="Casey%20Laulala">Casey Laulala</a> then scored the game's only try before the match finished 19–12.

In the <a href="2007%20Super%2014">2007 Super 14</a> season, seven Crusaders players missed the first seven rounds of the competition to participate in an All Black "conditioning programme". The conditioning programme was part of the All Blacks' <a href="2007%20Rugby%20World%20Cup">2007 Rugby World Cup</a> preparations; 22 players were selected for the programme. The Crusaders' seven players in the programme was more than any other New Zealand Super 14 franchise. The Crusaders players were <a href="Chris%20Jack">Chris Jack</a>, Richie McCaw, Greg Somerville, Reuben Thorne, Dan Carter, Leon MacDonald, and <a href="Aaron%20Mauger">Aaron Mauger</a>. All but one of the seven returned to play for the Crusaders in their eighth round match against the Stormers (Greg Somerville did not return due to injury). The Crusaders climbed to second on the table before defeating the <a href="Western%20Force">Western Force</a> 53–0 at Jade Stadium in the tenth round. The victory over the Force was the one hundredth Super rugby win for the Crusaders – the first franchise to reach the milestone.

The Crusaders were top of the table going into the last round of the Super 14 before the play-offs. To guarantee a home semi-final they needed to defeat the Chiefs at Jade Stadium. The Chiefs won 30–24 – and ended the Crusaders 26 game winning streak at home. As the Bulls defeated the Reds 92–3 in the same round, they overtook the Crusaders to finish second in the round robin. The Crusaders then travelled to Pretoria to face the Bulls in their semi-final where they lost 27–12.

The 2008 season was another highly successful one for the Crusaders.
After finishing top of the table at the end of the last round, they comfortably defeated the Hurricanes 33–22 in the semi-final, and went on to beat the Waratahs in the final 20–12. It was a fitting way to send off long-serving coach Robbie Deans before he departed to coach <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a>. It was also the last game for Crusaders stalwarts Caleb Ralph and former captain Reuben Thorne. In July that year former captain <a href="Todd%20Blackadder">Todd Blackadder</a> was appointed Crusaders coach, and his former teammates <a href="Mark%20Hammett">Mark Hammett</a> and <a href="Daryl%20Gibson">Daryl Gibson</a> were appointed as assistants.

The 2009 season started with a sole win and a draw from the Crusaders' first five matches; this included a 6—0 loss to the Highlanders. The side found its feet later in the season, and won key away games which ultimately saw them finish in fourth place on the table – just ahead of the Waratahs. Both the Crusaders and Waratahs finished the season with 41 competition points, but the Crusaders advanced through to the semi-finals due to a greater 'points for and against' difference.

The Crusaders lost their semi-final to the <a href="Bulls%20%28rugby%20franchise%29">Bulls</a> 36–23 at <a href="Loftus%20Versfeld">Loftus Versfeld</a>, <a href="Pretoria">Pretoria</a> in front of a capacity 52,000 crowd. The Bulls went on to win the 2009 Super 14 title beating the Chiefs 61–17. Statistically, the Crusaders had the best defensive record of the 2009 competition – conceding just 198 points. However, points for, and total tries scored was the second lowest in the competition with just 231 points and 27 tries.

In 2010 the Crusaders had a very good start to the season before a poor finish with three losses in four games caused them to have to travel to <a href="Orlando%20Stadium">Orlando Stadium</a>, <a href="Soweto">Soweto</a> to face the <a href="Bulls%20%28rugby%20franchise%29">Bulls</a>. They lost the semi-final 39–24.

The 2011 season had a minor hiccup at the very beginning with a two-point loss to the <a href="Blues%20%28Super%20Rugby%20franchise%29">Blues</a>. Their second round match against the <a href="Hurricanes%20%28Super%20Rugby%29">Hurricanes</a> was cancelled, and match declared a draw after the <a href="2011%20Christchurch%20earthquake">Christchurch earthquake</a> on 22 February which caused 182 deaths. In their first match after the earthquake they played the <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20Waratahs">Waratahs</a>, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games. The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the <a href="ACT%20Brumbies">Brumbies</a> and brushed them aside in a 52–10 demolition. They next played the <a href="Highlanders%20%28rugby%29">Highlanders</a> who had previously only lost one match in the season, to the undefeated and table-topping <a href="Stormers">Stormers</a>. The Crusaders won comfortably 44–13 in Dunedin. The next team they played, the <a href="Sharks%20%28Super%20rugby%20franchise%29">Sharks</a>, had like the Highlanders previously only lost one match in the season before the Crusaders won 44–28 at <a href="Twickenham%20stadium">Twickenham</a> for a one off match due to earthquake damage at their own ground. They played the second match in Timaru Alpine Stadium against the Bulls in a sell out crowd winning 27–0. Round 9 they played the Chiefs in Mt Maunganui and gained four tries winning 34–16 with Richie McCaw returning after eight weeks off with injury. The Crusaders lost the final at the Suncorp Stadium to the <a href="Queensland%20Reds">Queensland Reds</a>. Will Genia scored a crucial try for the Reds to help them to an 18–13 win.

The 2012 season, the first in the new home ground of <a href="Christchurch%20Stadium">Christchurch Stadium</a>, saw the Crusaders again reach the playoffs. However, they were defeated by the (eventual champion) <a href="Waikato%20Chiefs">Chiefs</a> in the semi-final.

In 2017, Scott Robertson took over as head coach. The Crusaders lost to the <a href="British%20and%20Irish%20Lions">British and Irish Lions</a> 3-12 at Christchurch, during the <a href="2017%20British%20and%20Irish%20Lions%20tour%20to%20New%20Zealand">Lions tour to New Zealand</a>.

The team went on to win the Super Rugby competition against the to win their 8th title.

In 2018, the Crusaders again played the Lions in the final, but this time at home and winning their 9th title. They won 37-18.

The Crusaders' name was chosen to reflect the crusading nature of Canterbury rugby. A potential name was also the "Plainsmen"; however, this was not chosen, as "Crusaders" recalled the English heritage of the city of Christchurch. Christchurch was established by <a href="English%20people">English emigrants</a> in the 19th century and is often described as the most English city outside England. The club adopted Canterbury's traditional sporting colours of red and black, as worn by <a href="Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Canterbury</a>.

The Crusaders' franchise area consists of the regions controlled by the Buller, Canterbury, Mid-Canterbury, South Canterbury, Tasman and West Coast rugby unions. Before 2006, when the <a href="National%20Provincial%20Championship">NPC</a> was reorganised, Canterbury was the only union playing division one (now <a href="Mitre%2010%20Cup">Mitre 10 Cup</a>) within the Crusaders' catchment. As a result, the majority of Crusaders players were also listed with Canterbury. Today, the Crusaders' catchment contains two Mitre 10 Cup sides – Canterbury and Tasman.

The Crusaders' main home ground was the 36,000-capacity AMI Stadium in Christchurch. However, they stopped playing there during the 2011 Super Rugby season due to damage inflicted by the February Christchurch earthquake. The Crusaders usually took one game each year to another part of the franchise area, most often when the <a href="New%20Zealand%20cricket%20team">New Zealand cricket team</a> was playing at AMI Stadium. Previous venues included Trafalgar Park in <a href="Nelson%2C%20New%20Zealand">Nelson</a>, and Alpine Energy Stadium in <a href="Timaru">Timaru</a>.

With AMI Stadium still out of commission, the Crusaders adopted <a href="Rugby%20League%20Park">Rugby League Park</a> (which has been renamed Christchurch Stadium temporarily) in <a href="Addington%2C%20New%20Zealand">Addington</a> as their home ground for that and future seasons to recentralise their games in one location as opposed to the road show that was the 2011 season. The ground had a limited makeover, taking it to an 18,600 capacity stadium and bringing its facilities to the minimum standards required by the Super Rugby competition.

The Crusaders' management proposed playing a 2005 regular season match in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> when Jade Stadium was unavailable. Although five of the seven unions within the Crusaders region supported having the regular season game in Melbourne, the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Rugby%20Union">New Zealand Rugby Union</a> (NZRU) vetoed the proposal. In 2006, the Crusaders did play a pre-season match in Melbourne against the Western Force at <a href="Olympic%20Park%20Stadium">Olympic Park Stadium</a>. They did the same in the 2008 preseason as well, also against the Force.

Due to the 2011 earthquake, the Crusaders played four games at Trafalgar Park, and two in Timaru during their 2011 season. They also played a "home" game in Wellington in Round 18 against Hurricanes, and a special home match against the <a href="Sharks%20%28Super%20rugby%20franchise%29">Sharks</a> at <a href="Twickenham%20Stadium">Twickenham</a> in London. The London match was a fundraiser for earthquake relief, and was the first Super Rugby match ever contested outside of the three participating countries. In the first 30 hours of ticket sales, over 30,000 were purchased; a spokesman for <a href="Live%20Nation%20Entertainment">United Ticketmaster</a> indicated that the response was the strongest he had experienced for a rugby match outside of internationals.

The Crusaders have fielded a development team in competitions such as the <a href="Pacific%20Rugby%20Cup">Pacific Rugby Cup</a> and in matches against other representative teams for several seasons. Known as the Crusaders Development XV or Crusaders Knights, the squad is selected from the best emerging rugby talent in the Crusaders catchment area and is composed of Crusaders contracted players, wider training group members, under 20s, and selected club players.

Playoffs


In addition to winning more Super Rugby titles than any other team, the franchise also holds several <a href="List%20of%20Super%20Rugby%20records">competition records</a>, including most points in a game and most <a href="try">tries</a> in a game, both achieved in their 96–19 victory over the Waratahs in 2002. The Crusaders also hold the record for the fewest points scored in a game when they were defeated by the <a href="Highlanders%20%28rugby%29">Highlanders</a> 6–0 in 2009. They have also scored the most points (541) and most tries (71) in one season, both achieved in 2005.

Individual players also hold records: <a href="Andrew%20Mehrtens">Andrew Mehrtens</a> for most points in a Super 12 season (206 in 1998), and <a href="Rico%20Gear">Rico Gear</a> for most tries in a season (15 in 2005). Twelve players have played over 100 games for the franchise: <a href="Justin%20Marshall">Justin Marshall</a>, <a href="Reuben%20Thorne">Reuben Thorne</a>, <a href="Caleb%20Ralph">Caleb Ralph</a>, <a href="Greg%20Somerville">Greg Somerville</a>, <a href="Leon%20MacDonald">Leon MacDonald</a>, <a href="Richie%20McCaw">Richie McCaw</a>, <a href="Chris%20Jack">Chris Jack</a>, <a href="Dan%20Carter">Dan Carter</a>, <a href="Andrew%20Ellis">Andrew Ellis</a>, <a href="Kieran%20Read">Kieran Read</a>, <a href="Wyatt%20Crockett">Wyatt Crockett</a> and <a href="Sam%20Whitelock">Sam Whitelock</a>. They also have three <a href="International%20Rugby%20Board">International Rugby Board</a> Players of the Year: <a href="Dan%20Carter">Dan Carter</a> (2005), (2012), (2015), <a href="Richie%20McCaw">Richie McCaw</a> (2006), (2009) and (2010) and <a href="Kieran%20Read">Kieran Read</a> (2013)

The squad for the <a href="2019%20Super%20Rugby%20season">2019 Super Rugby season</a>:


Due to the unparalleled success of the Crusaders throughout the history of the <a href="Super%20Rugby">Super Rugby</a> since its inaugural year in 1996, many players that have represented the Crusaders since 1996 have gone on to play international test rugby for the <a href="All%20Blacks">All Blacks</a>

List of <a href="All%20Blacks">All Blacks</a> that have represented the Crusaders

Ten players have played over 100 games for the franchise: <a href="Justin%20Marshall">Justin Marshall</a>, <a href="Reuben%20Thorne">Reuben Thorne</a>, <a href="Caleb%20Ralph">Caleb Ralph</a>, <a href="Greg%20Somerville">Greg Somerville</a>, <a href="Leon%20MacDonald">Leon MacDonald</a>, <a href="Richie%20McCaw">Richie McCaw</a>, <a href="Chris%20Jack">Chris Jack</a>, <a href="Dan%20Carter">Dan Carter</a>, <a href="Wyatt%20Crockett">Wyatt Crockett</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Ellis">Andrew Ellis</a>. Half-back Justin Marshall was the first player to achieve the feat, playing for the Crusaders between 1996 and 2005. Both Thorne and Ralph achieved the 100-game mark at the same time. However, Ralph had played nine of his matches for other franchises: three for the Chiefs and six for the Blues. Ralph achieved the "100 Crusaders games" feat later that season; remarkably, they were played consecutively. Greg Somerville became the next player to contribute 100 games for the franchise, achieving this in the 2006 semi-final against the Bulls. The first match of the 2008 season was Leon MacDonald's 100th game, and on 11 March 2011 Chris Jack started against the Brumbies to play his 100th match for the Crusaders. The Crusaders also boast three winners of the <a href="IRB%20International%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">IRB International Player of the Year</a> Award: <a href="Dan%20Carter">Dan Carter</a> (2005, 2012 and 2015), <a href="Kieran%20Read">Kieran Read</a> (2013) and Richie McCaw (2006, 2009 and 2010).

On the eve of the last Super 12 final in 2005, a panel of experts picked the Crusaders team of the decade, which was published by the Christchurch Press. The experts chosen to select the team were: <a href="Tane%20Norton">Tane Norton</a> (former All Blacks captain), Vance Stewart (first Crusaders coach), Dick Tayler (president of supporters club), Bob Schumacher (former Christchurch Press rugby writer) and Tony Smith (Christchurch Press rugby writer).

The most notable omissions from the team were <a href="Dan%20Carter">Dan Carter</a>, Richard Loe, and Reuben Thorne. Daniel Carter was omitted due to the strength of Andrew Mehrtens and Aaron Mauger who occupied the <a href="Fly-half%20%28rugby%20union%29">first</a> and <a href="Centre%20%28rugby%20union%29">second five-eighth</a> positions respectively, and because he was regarded as "the star of the next decade". Despite being considered one of Canterbury's best ever props, Richard Loe missed out as he was only in the team for the unsuccessful 1996 season. The former All Black captain Reuben Thorne was omitted due the quality of players in the <a href="Lock%20%28rugby%20union%29">lock</a> and <a href="Flanker%20%28rugby%20union%29">blindside flanker</a> positions. The most unlikely inclusion was for <a href="Norm%20Berryman">Norm Berryman</a> at <a href="Wing%20%28rugby%20union%29">right wing</a>. Berryman was picked over Marika Vunibaka and Afato So'oalo due to his crucial tries late in the 1998 and 1999 seasons that helped the Crusaders qualify for the semi-finals. The team:

The Crusaders were coached in their first season by Vance Stewart, who was assisted by <a href="Brian%20McLean%20%28rugby%20union%29">Aussie Mclean</a>. Stewart was replaced by Wayne Smith in 1997; McLean too was replaced, by Peter Sloane. Smith continued as coach until he was appointed All Blacks coach after the 1999 season. Robbie Deans took over the reins for the 2000 season. Deans has had several assistants: in 2000 and 2001 his assistant was <a href="Steve%20Hansen">Steve Hansen</a>; in 2002, Colin Cooper; in 2003 and 2004, Don Hayes; and in 2005 and 2006, Vern Cotter. Deans' assistant for the 2007 season was former Crusader Mark Hammett. Deans was appointed coach of <a href="Australia%20national%20rugby%20union%20team">Australia</a> in December 2007, but was allowed to continue coaching the Crusaders in the 2008 season. Former captain, Todd Blackadder was appointed his successor in July 2008, with Hammett continuing as assistant coach. Hammett was appointed Hurricanes coach from the beginning of the 2011 season, and consequently former prop Dave Hewett was appointed assistant forwards coach. In June 2016, <a href="Scott%20Robertson%20%28rugby%20union%29">Scott Robertson</a>, former Crusaders player and current head coach of the <a href="Canterbury%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Canterbury</a> national provincial team and the <a href="New%20Zealand%20national%20under-20%20rugby%20union%20team">New Zealand Under 20</a> rugby team, was announced as the Crusaders head coach from 2017 through to 2019.

Gilwell Park

Gilwell Park is a camp site and <a href="Scout%20Activity%20Centre">activity centre</a> for <a href="Scouting">Scouting</a> and <a href="Girlguiding">Guiding</a> groups, as well as schools and other youth organisations. The site also houses a training and conference centre, including the hosting of social events such as weddings and birthday parties. The 44 hectare (109 acre) site is in <a href="Sewardstonebury">Sewardstonebury</a>, <a href="Epping%20Forest%20%28district%29">Epping Forest</a>, close to <a href="Chingford">Chingford</a>, London.

In the late <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a> the area was a farm, growing to a wealthy estate that fell into disrepair towards 1900. It was bought in 1919 by <a href="Scout%20Commissioner">Scout Commissioner</a> <a href="William%20de%20Bois%20Maclaren">William de Bois Maclaren</a> and given to <a href="The%20Scout%20Association">The Scout Association</a> of the United Kingdom to provide camping to London Scouts, and training for Scouters. As Scout Leaders from all countries of the world have come to Gilwell Park for their <a href="Wood%20Badge">Wood Badge</a> training, it is one of the landmarks of the world <a href="Scouting">Scouting</a> movement.

The site contains a number of camping fields, indoor accommodation, historical sites, monuments of Scouting, and outdoor adventure activities. The site can accommodate events up to 10,000 people, and regularly does so at Scouting events throughout the year.

Gilwell Park is also home to <a href="Scout%20Adventures%20%28The%20Scout%20Association%29">Scout Adventures</a> Gilwell Park, one of nine activity centres of The Scout Association, alongside Crawfordsburn, <a href="Downe%20Scout%20Activity%20Centre">Downe</a>, Ferny Crofts, Great Tower, Woodhouse Park, Yr Hafod and <a href="Youlbury%20Scout%20Activity%20Centre">Youlbury</a>.

The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe, and the area became known as Gillrolfes, "Gill" being <a href="Old%20English%20language">Old English</a> for <a href="glen">glen</a>. Following Rolfe's death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called "Great Gilwell" and "Little Gilwell". The two areas were named after the Old English "wella", or <a href="spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">spring</a>. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since.

Around this time, an adjoining property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, <a href="Henry%20VIII%20of%20England">King Henry VIII</a> owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son <a href="Edward%20VI%20of%20England">Edward</a>. Around 1736 the <a href="highwayman">highwayman</a> <a href="Dick%20Turpin">Dick Turpin</a> began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.

In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence.

Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed <a href="prenuptial%20agreement">prenuptial agreement</a> with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter <a href="George%20Chinnery">George Chinnery</a>.

The Chinnerys were wealthy and influential. William Chinnery's father, also named William, owned trading ships and named one Gilwell in 1800. William and Margaret Chinnery initially resided in London, and after three years of marriage and inheriting Gilwell in 1792, they moved to Gilwell in 1793. They soon shocked the populace by renaming Osborne Hall to "Gilwell Hall". William Chinnery expanded Gilwell's land holdings through significant purchases over 15 years and, with his wife, transformed it into a country estate with gardens, paths, and statues. Parts of the garden, paths, and dwelling modifications exist into the 21st century. William Chinnery was exposed as the embezzler of a small fortune from the British Treasury where he worked and was dismissed from all his posts on 12 March 1812. Margaret Chinnery was forced to sign over Gilwell Estate to the <a href="Exchequer">Exchequer</a> on 2 July 1812.

The Chinnery family was prominent enough that members of the English nobility visited often during the 1790s and early 19th century. <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> visited on occasion, and the Prince Regent, who later became <a href="George%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George IV</a>, was a regular visitor. George III's seventh son, <a href="Prince%20Adolphus%2C%20Duke%20of%20Cambridge">Prince Adolphus</a>, became a family friend, lived at Gilwell for a while, and tutored their eldest son George.

Gilpin Gorst bought the estate in 1815 at <a href="public%20auction">public auction</a>, and his son sold it to Thomas Usborne in 1824. When <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a> was replaced in 1826, Usborne bought pieces of the stone <a href="baluster">balustrades</a>, which date to 1209, and erected them behind the White House around the Buffalo Lawn. The estate changed ownership more times, but these families did not maintain the property and it fell into disrepair by 1900. Reverend Cranshaw, a local resident, bought the estate in 1911 and was the last owner prior to the Boy Scout Association, as it was then known.

The estate's condition declined more during the 1910s. <a href="William%20de%20Bois%20Maclaren">William de Bois Maclaren</a> was a publisher and Scout Commissioner from <a href="Rosneath">Rosneath</a>, Dumbartonshire, Scotland. During a business trip to London, Maclaren was saddened to see that Scouts in the <a href="East%20End">East End</a> had no suitable outdoor area to conduct their activities. He contacted <a href="Robert%20Baden-Powell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Baden-Powell">Lord Robert Baden-Powell</a>, who appointed <a href="P.B.%20Nevill">P.B. Nevill</a> to handle the matter. Nevill was Scout Commissioner of the East End.

On 20 November 1918 over dinner at Roland House, the Scout Hostel in <a href="Stepney">Stepney</a>, Maclaren agreed to donate £7,000 to the project. Part of the agreement included narrowing the areas to look for suitable land to <a href="Hainault%20Forest%20Country%20Park">Hainault Forest</a> and Epping Forest. <a href="Rover%20Scouts">Rover Scouts</a> searched both without success, but then John Gayfer, a young assistant Scoutmaster, suggested Gilwell Hall, a place he went <a href="bird-watching">bird-watching</a>. Nevill visited the estate and was impressed, though the buildings were in poor condition. The estate was for sale for £7,000, the price Maclaren had donated. The estate totaled at the time.

The estate was purchased in early 1919 by Maclaren for the Boy Scout Association. Nevill first took his Rover Scouts to begin repairing the estate on <a href="Maundy%20Thursday">Maundy Thursday</a>, 17 April 1919. On this visit, the Rovers slept in the gardener's shed in the orchard because the ground was so wet they could not pitch tents. They called this shed "The Pigsty" and though dilapidated, it still stands, as it is the site of the first Scout campsite at Gilwell Park. Maclaren was a frequent visitor to Gilwell Park and helped repair the buildings. His dedication was so great that he donated another £3,000. Maclaren's interest had been in providing a campground, but Baden-Powell envisioned a training centre for Scouters.

An official opening was planned for 19 July 1919 but it was delayed until Saturday, 26 July 1919 so that Scouts could participate in the Official Peace Festival commemorating the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Invitations were changed by hand to save money. Significant remodeling and construction was done in the 1920s. Because of limited finances, few improvements were made during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> of the 1930s.

Baden-Powell never lived at Gilwell Park but he often camped, lectured, taught courses, and attended meetings. He emphasized the importance of Scouters' training at Gilwell Park for Scouting by taking it as the territorial designation in his <a href="peerage">peerage</a> title of "1st Baron Baden-Powell of Gilwell" in 1929 when the <a href="baron">baron</a>y was conferred upon him by the king.

The axe and log logo was conceived by the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in the early 1920s to distinguish Gilwell Park from the Scout Headquarters. Gidney wanted to associate Gilwell Park with the outdoors and <a href="Scoutcraft">Scoutcraft</a> rather than the business or administrative Headquarters offices. Scouters present at the original Wood Badge courses regularly saw axe blades masked for safety by being buried in a log. Seeing this, Gidney chose the axe and log as the totem of Gilwell Park. This logo came to be strongly associated with <a href="Wood%20Badge">Wood Badge</a> <a href="%23Leader%20training">leader training</a> and is still used on certificates, flags, and other programme-related items.

The symbol of the axe in the log is associated with <a href="feudalism">feudalism</a> after the invasion and conquest of England by <a href="William%20I%20of%20England">William the Conqueror</a>. In that era, property, including forests, were owned by the landed barons and knights. Serfs, bound to the land in a form of modified slavery, were forbidden to cut wood from trees in the forest, and only permitted to gather downed wood. A <a href="serfdom%23Freemen">freeman</a> who carried an axe in a nobleman's forest demonstrated that he had earned the right by service. Symbolically, the grain of an axe handle must be "set square in the eye of the head." The steel head must have the proper <a href="tempering%20%28metallurgy%29">temper</a> and be kept sharp. To be useful in the hands of a skilled freeman, an axe also needed to be well-balanced, otherwise the handle might break, endangering its user. The axe represented skilled laborers who had proven themselves through service. Lastly, the axe in the wood reminds those who have completed Wood Badge that they have committed themselves to be an example of service and fealty.

The estate was requisitioned by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Defence%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">War Ministry</a> from 1940 to 1945 as a local command, training, and ordnance centre. Little remains at the estate from <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, except the hole created by a bomb dropped by the <a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>. It was enlarged and is now used for swimming and canoeing.

After the purchase of the original site in 1919, the purchase of Gilwellbury and adjoining land in 1945 is probably the next most important in Gilwell Park's Scouting history because it allowed The Scout Association to close the original road and fully utilize Branchet Field. It was originally used for small retreats and conferences but is now used as staff accommodation. The <a href="Ministry%20of%20Education%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Ministry of Education</a> assisted in the purchase.

The Gilwell Farmhouse is believed to date from the early 18th century, making it the oldest original building at Gilwell Park. It is composed of two buildings that were joined together. There is a brick well head on the farm that is known as the "Gil Well". A field adjoining the boundaries of Gilwell Park, known as Bill Oddie Field, affords dramatic views of the London skyline over <a href="Pole%20Hill">Pole Hill</a>, Chingford. The field was so-named after employees of The Scout Association spotted TV ornithologist <a href="Bill%20Oddie">Bill Oddie</a> recording a programme about circling birds of prey on the field in 2006.

After the war, the Boy Scout Association bought adjoining land to increase the estate and protect it from rapidly approaching new developments. These areas are called The Quick, New Field, and Hilly Field. An additional purchase and a donation from South Africa in the early 1950s brought the estate to its present size. This began an era of expanding camping facilities for Scouts which lasted until the early 1960s. Training and sleeping facilities were added through the early 1970s. The Boy Scout Association was renamed The Scout Association in 1967.

During the 1970s, two key and popular facilities were built: the Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre for <a href="Cub%20Scout">Cub Scout</a>s and the Colquhoun International Centre for training Scouters, originally called The International Hall of Friendship. In the 1980s extensive remodelling of the White House was done. In April 2001, The Scout Association moved its program staff from London to Gilwell Park, where its training staff were already located. Extensive renovations were done to the White House and other buildings. With a budget of £20,000,000 and individual contributions as high as £500,000, improvements to programs and facilities have been ongoing since then in preparation for the <a href="21st%20World%20Scout%20Jamboree">21st World Scout Jamboree</a> in 2007, which was the 100th anniversary of Scouting, hosted at nearby <a href="Hylands%20Park">Hylands Park</a>, <a href="Chelmsford">Chelmsford</a>, Essex with related activities also being held at Gilwell Park. Gilwell Park provides The Scout Association with over £1,000,000 a year through conference fees, accommodation fees, and sales of materials.

While different leader training courses are conducted at Gilwell Park, the most prominent is Wood Badge. Francis Gidney, the first Camp Chief, conducted the first Wood Badge course at Gilwell Park 8–19 September 1919. Gilwell Park became the home of leadership training in the <a href="Scouting">Scout movement</a>. Leaders from all over the world receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group (Gilwell Troop 1) on completion of the Wood Badge course. These leaders are henceforth called Wood Badgers or Gilwellians. Any location in which Wood Badgers meet is called Gilwell Field. The 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group meets every first weekend of September in Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion.

The Training Ground, near the White House, is the hallowed ground of Gilwell Park as this is the world home of Wood Badge, the premier Scout leader training course. A large oak tree, the <a href="Gilwell%20Oak">Gilwell Oak</a>, separates the Training Ground from the Orchard.

<a href="Francis%20Gidney">Captain Francis "Skipper" Gidney</a> became the first Camp Chief in May 1919 and served until 1923. He organized the first Wood Badge training, and contributed to setting up Gilwell Park as the Scouters' training centre. The Gidney Cabin was built and named in his honour in 1929 to serve as a training centre. The second Camp Chief was <a href="J.%20S.%20Wilson">John Skinner Wilson</a>, who served from 1923 until 1939. Wilson was Colonel with the British Indian Police when he became a <a href="Scout%20Leader">Scout Leader</a> in 1917. In 1921 he traveled to Gilwell Park to take leader training, which led to his retirement from the Indian Police in 1922 to become a full-time Scout Leader. He was honoured with the <a href="Bronze%20Wolf">Bronze Wolf</a> Award in 1937, the only distinction of the <a href="World%20Organization%20of%20the%20Scout%20Movement">World Organization of the Scout Movement</a>.

<a href="John%20Thurman">R.F. "John" Thurman</a> was a British Scout Leader who served as Camp Chief from 1943 until 1969 and was awarded the Bronze Wolf Award in 1959. He was a strong promoter of Scout training and wrote books on the subject that were translated into other languages. The Thurman Memorial stands near The Pigsty. Thurman was succeeded by John Huskin as "Director of leader training".

<a href="Don%20Potter">Don Potter</a> (1902–2004) was an English sculptor and <a href="wood%20carver">wood carver</a> who was a lifelong staff member at Gilwell Park, serving as a Gilwell Master Craftsman. Potter created wood carvings at Gilwell Park, including the Jim Green Gate, Gidney Cabin, the Leopard Gates, and totems he carved for the 1929 <a href="World%20Jamboree">World Jamboree</a>.

Since 2016, the activity centre at Gilwell Park is run and managed by Scout Adventures, following a re-branding of Scout Activity Centres nationwide. The centre offers a large range of outdoor and indoor adventure activities, as well as accommodation and camping, for Scout and Guide groups, schools and other youth organisations.

Activities provided by Scout Adventures at Gilwell Park include various <a href="Ropes%20course">high rope</a> activities, <a href="rock%20climbing">rock climbing</a>, 3G swing, <a href="archery">archery</a>, <a href="rifle%20shooting">rifle shooting</a>, <a href="kayaking">kayaking</a> and <a href="raft%20building">raft building</a>. Each activity session lasts 90 minutes, with most activities having a participant limit of 12. These activities are primarily run by a team of international volunteers.

Gilwell Park provides camping opportunities ranging from small groups, up to groups in excess of 2,500 people. This includes everything from unit-level camping to hosting international events.

Essex Chase is a large, open field located off of Camp Square. It is a popular field, due to its proximity to Rikki's toilet block, the main campfire circles, Camp Square and Scout Adventures reception.

Woodlands Field is a large field that will hold up to 200 campers at the north end of the park.

Branchet Field is the largest campsite and will hold 1,200 campers. The field is flat and open, with Maclarens toilet block in the centre. The Northern end of the field also has electrical hookups for camper vans and caravans.

Mallinson Field is a small, wooded, secluded area suited to small groups.

The Paddock is a smaller camping field, directly connected to the Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre. The field houses Mallinson's toilet block, and holds 30 campers.

Ferryman Field is a split-level field located to the North of the site, suitable for 'back to basics' camping due to its wooded nature and distance from facilities.

The Dorothy Hughes Pack Holiday Centre was built in 1970 by fitting interlocking logs together from a Norwegian, with no nails used to construct the original frame. Dorothy Hughes was a Cub Scout Leader from East London who wished to see a purpose-built facility for Cub Scout holidays.

The Centre can sleep 40 people, primarily in dormitory-style rooms with smaller rooms provided for use by group leaders. There are both toilet and shower facilities within the building. The building is centrally heated and includes AV equipment and Wi-Fi. The building is centrally heated with a large main hall and kitchen.

Branchet Lodge, named after field upon which it is sited, opened on 23 May 2003 to replace old <a href="Portable%20building">portable cabins</a>. Branchet Lodge is a single storey building that has central heating and sleeps up to 56 people in two separate wings with a common kitchen and main hall. Each wing has its own toilet and shower facilities. There are four single rooms for leaders, two accessible rooms that sleep two people each, and six rooms that sleep eight people each. It is constructed of stone, timber, copper, and a grass roof. The building is centrally heated, has laundry facilities, and includes AV equipment and Wi-Fi.

The <a href="Jack%20Petchey">Jack Petchey</a> Lodge opened in September 2008, located next to the Branchet Lodge. There are five single rooms for leaders, ten rooms that sleep four people each and two accessible rooms that sleep two people each. All rooms are en-suite, with communal toilets also provided in the main hall. The building is centrally heated, and includes AV equipment, freeview and Wi-Fi. There is a large communal kitchen as well as laundry facilities.

The Peter Harrison Lodge was built in 2009 and is the newest accommodation building at Gilwell Park. It is very similar to the Jack Petchey Lodge, and located opposite the Branchet Lodge. The building sleeps 50 people. There are four leader rooms, ten rooms sleeping four people each, and two accessible rooms sleeping two people each. All rooms are en-suite, with communal toilets also provided in the main hall. The building is centrally heated, and includes AV equipment, freeview and Wi-Fi. There is a large communal kitchen as well as laundry facilities.

Log cabins on the edge of Woodland Field sleep eight each in bunk beds. Cooking is provided in a separate shelter or an open fire can be utilized.

Each year Gilwell Park runs a number of regular special events. These have been established for more than 20 years with the addition of Gilwell 24 in 2004 and Scarefest in 2014 and are some of the largest annual Scout events in the UK.


Each year Scout Adventures recruits up to 120 volunteers from over 30 countries to assist in the running of its centres. Scout Adventures at Gilwell Park has between 20 – 50 volunteers, depending on the season. These volunteers stay for a maximum placement of one year, and are provided with accommodation in return for their work. These volunteers are trained to run activity sessions for guests, carry out maintenance and improvement works on the site, and provide customer service.

A new purpose-built accommodation building was opened in 2016 to house an increasing number of volunteers, following the degradation of previous accommodation in The Den and Gilwellbury. The International Volunteer Lodge cost £1.2m to build, the funding for which came largely from the <a href="Jack%20Petchey%20Foundation">Jack Petchey Foundation</a>, but also from several single private donors with a wider interest in Scouting. The building is predominantly timber framed with a large social space constructed using glulam beams and includes a two-storey sleeping area. This provides 26 double bedrooms and an accessible bedroom, all with en-suite facilities. The single storey social spaces include a drying and boot room, laundry room, open plan kitchen, dining and lounge area, quiet room and cinema style room.

Gilwell Park can host indoor and outdoor conferences, training and special events for businesses and individuals. During the summer months, Gilwell Park is a popular wedding venue. The Training and Event Centre also operate the hotel at Gilwell Park, located within the White House.

The Training and Event Centre primarily utilises the White House and Colquhoun International Centre (CIC), both of which have a variety of flexible spaces with AV equipment and other conference technologies. Weddings, parties and other functions are also held in The Swan Centre, a log-cabin style hall built in 1966 to replace an earlier building, and the Gidney Cabin built in 1929.

The White House and its predecessors represent over 500 years of Gilwell history. It became the headquarters of The Scout Association on 27 April 2001, although <a href="Baden-Powell%20House">Baden-Powell House</a> (the former headquarters) still facilitates some departments of The Scout Association.

The White House today serves as a hotel and has a number of conference rooms on the ground floor, following extensive renovations in the 1990s. The hotel comprises 41 guest bedrooms (35 en-suite) across the White House and its modern extension. The White House also houses a bar in the Group Room, and a canteen-style restaurant.

The Colquhoun International Centre (CIC) was built in 1971 as a Scout leader training centre, and was extensively renovated in 1995. The building has a main hall (The International Hall of Friendship) that can seat up to 250 people, 2 smaller training suites, and five seminar rooms. The main hall is regularly used for larger weddings, dinners and parties; with the seminar rooms and training suites used for conferences and meetings. The CIC also houses a second bar that is used during functions.

Gilwell Park has many attractions, primarily Scouting in nature, for visitors to see. This includes a souvenir shop, The Providore, the shape and stock of which have changed considerably over its decades of operation. The Gilwell Park museum closed in 2015 owing to its unsuitable conditions to house historical pieces. 
The White House is connected to The Barn (originally The Stables), a red-brick building built in 1926. The archway in the centre of the building was originally an open passageway. It now houses the reception area for the Training and Event Centre. The first floor of the building was used as training rooms for Cub Scout Leaders. The clock on the front of the building was a gift from a former Japanese Chief Scout, Count Sano, who was present at an early training course at Gilwell Park. The weather vane on the roof depicts <a href="Dick%20Turpin">Dick Turpin</a>, who was rumoured to live on the site.

Close to the estate entrance, The Lodge was built in 1934 as the Camp Chief's (later succeeded by the Director of Programme and Development) home. The building is now used to accommodate Scout Association staff and host internal meetings.

The Gilwell Farm is the oldest building on the site still standing, dating from the 1600s. The building started as two separate cottages. In the grounds of the building is the last remaining well on site, known as Gil Well. The Farm was refurbished from its derelict site, opening in 2015 as the new offices and reception of Scout Adventures Gilwell Park . Close by, The Leopard Gates mark the original entrance to Gilwell Park, and were carved by Gilwlel master craftsman Don Potter in 1928.

The Lid, which originally consisted of a roof but no walls, was a wet weather shelter built in 1967. In 2009, the building was renovated and now consists of a large activity hall, two classrooms, staff space and a large store room added The activity hall houses all the indoor activities on-site, including an archery range and climbing walls. In front of The Lid, is the Tait McKenzie Statue, gifted by the Boy Scouts of America in 1966.

The Barnacle was built in 1950 as a First Aid centre, which quickly became a volunteer-run <a href="cottage%20hospital">cottage hospital</a> for visitors and the local community. It houses a 6-bed ward, isolation room, dental surgery, X-ray room and operating theatre. In the late 1980s the building became volunteer accommodation, until it was decommissioned in 2016 with the opening of the International Volunteer Lodge. The building now stands empty, awaiting an uncertain future.

The Pigsty, a small gardeners shed located on The Orchard, has been preserved as the first campsite at Gilwell Park. The first group of Rover Scouts who arrived to prepare the site when it was purchased in 1919 slept here when the weather proved too bad to pitch their tents.

The site is home to five houses of worship for Scouts and other visitors, including a <a href="Buddhism">Buddhist</a> sala, <a href="Jewish">Jewish</a> synagogue, and an <a href="Islam">Islam</a>ic mosque. The Buddhist <a href="Sala%20%28architecture%29">Sala</a> was donated to Gilwell Park in 1967 by the Boy Scouts of <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>. The Buddha found inside was a gift from the Thai government and is over 1000 years old. Thai ambassadors to the United Kingdom often visit the sala, as it is their responsibility to care for it.

The White House, originally dating back to 1750, is timber framed and was extended in 1830 and again in the 1960s. The exterior is covered in hung slates, which caused extensive damage to the original frame which required extensive repairs in 1994. The 1797 chimneys are pointed in shape, to stop birds nesting and draw smoke up from the fire. The lawn in front of the building was the house's original turning circle, with the road once being a thoroughfare from Chingford to Waltham Abbey.

Camp Square has had a variety of buildings with many uses over the years, including a Warden's Office (recently demolished), museum (currently empty), archery range (former Scout Shop – no longer in use), volunteer accommodation (demolished in 2017), shop, soft drinks bar, staff space and toilet block. In the centre of the Square is the clock tower, known as Big Mac. It was named after Camp Warden Alfred Macintosh.

Behind Camp Square, The Bomb Hole was created when a World War 2 bomb was dropped on the site, creating a small crater. The Bomb Hole has been extended several times, and is now used for kayaking, raft building and pond dipping activity sessions.

There are two Campfire Circles which are used extensively during the peak camping season. The Large Campfire Circle has a Maori Gatewat which was presented by the <a href="Scouts%20New%20Zealand">Scouts New Zealand</a> in 1951.

The Lime Walk, constructed by previous estate owner <a href="Margaret%20Chinnery">Margaret Chinnery</a>, surrounds the Training Ground which was the original main lawn area of the White House. Few of the Lime trees survive to this day. On this path sits the Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of The Scouter magazine.

The Buffalo Lawn is so called because of the replica of the <a href="Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America">Boy Scouts of America</a> (BSA) <a href="Silver%20Buffalo%20Award">Silver Buffalo Award</a> that was presented by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the <a href="Unknown%20Scout">Unknown Scout</a> that helped <a href="William%20D.%20Boyce">William D. Boyce</a> bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the <a href="World%20Scout%20Jamboree">World Scout Jamboree</a>s from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn is part of the original balustrade of <a href="London%20Bridge">London Bridge</a> which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826.

Considered by many to be the most important Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman.

The caravan trailer, presented to <a href="Chief%20Scout%20%28The%20Scout%20Association%29">Chief Scout</a> <a href="Robert%20Baden-Powell%2C%201st%20Baron%20Baden-Powell">Sir Robert Baden-Powell</a>, along with a new Rolls-Royce car, during the <a href="3rd%20World%20Scout%20Jamboree">3rd World Scout Jamboree</a> in 1929 is on display during the summer months. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by <a href="Olave%20Baden-Powell">Olave Baden-Powell</a> in 1945.

Gilwell Park also has a number of other smaller memorials, statues, and places and objects of historical or Scouting importance.

Representative peer

In the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, representative peers were those <a href="Peerage">peers</a> elected by the members of the <a href="Peerage%20of%20Scotland">Peerage of Scotland</a> and the <a href="Peerage%20of%20Ireland">Peerage of Ireland</a> to sit in the British <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>. Until 1999, all members of the <a href="Peerage%20of%20England">Peerage of England</a> held the right to sit in the House of Lords; they did not elect a limited group of representatives. All peers who were created after 1707 as <a href="Peerage%20of%20Great%20Britain">Peers of Great Britain</a> and after 1801 as <a href="Peerage%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Peers of the United Kingdom</a> held the same right to sit in the House of Lords.

Representative peers were introduced in 1707, when the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">Kingdom of England</a> and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Kingdom of Scotland</a> were united into the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>. At the time there were 168 English and 154 Scottish peers. The English peers feared that the House of Lords would be swamped by the Scottish element, and consequently the election of a small number of representative peers to represent Scotland was negotiated. A similar arrangement was adopted when the Kingdom of Great Britain and the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Kingdom of Ireland</a> merged into the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland</a> in January 1801.

Scotland was allowed to elect sixteen representative peers, while Ireland could elect twenty-eight. Those chosen by Scotland sat for the life of one Parliament, and following each dissolution new Scottish peers were elected. In contrast, Irish representative peers sat for life. Elections for Irish peers ceased when the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> came into existence as a <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a> in December 1922. However, already-elected Irish peers continued to be entitled to sit until their death. Elections for Scottish peers ended in 1963, when all Scottish peers obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords.

Under the <a href="House%20of%20Lords%20Act%201999">House of Lords Act 1999</a>, a new form of representative peer was introduced to allow some hereditary peers to stay in the House of Lords.

Under articles XXII and XXIII of the <a href="Act%20of%20Union%201707">Act of Union 1707</a>, Scottish peers were entitled to elect sixteen representative peers to the House of Lords. Each served for one Parliament or a maximum of seven years, but could be re-elected during future Parliaments. Upon the summons of a new Parliament, the Sovereign would issue a proclamation summoning Scottish peers to the <a href="Holyrood%20Palace">Palace of Holyroodhouse</a>. The elections were held in the Great Gallery, a large room decorated by eighty-nine of <a href="Jacob%20de%20Wet">Jacob de Wet</a>'s portraits of Scottish monarchs, from <a href="Fergus%20M%C3%B3r">Fergus Mór</a> to <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a>. The <a href="Lord%20Clerk%20Register">Lord Clerk Register</a> would read out the Peerage Roll as indicates his presence when called. The Roll was then re–read, with each peer responding by publicly announcing his votes and the return being sent to the clerk of the crown at London. The same procedure was used whenever a vacancy arose.

The <a href="Plurality-at-large%20voting">block voting</a> system was used, with each peer casting as many votes as there were seats to be filled. The system, however, permitted the party with the greatest number of peers, normally the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservatives</a>, to procure a disproportionate number of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence to admit the representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive <a href="Hereditary%20peer%23Writs%20of%20summons">writs of summons</a>.
The position and rights of Scottish peers in relation to the House of Lords remained unclear during most of the eighteenth century. In 1711, <a href="James%20Douglas%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Hamilton">The 4th Duke of Hamilton</a>, a peer of Scotland, was made <a href="Duke%20of%20Brandon">Duke of Brandon</a> in the <a href="Peerage%20of%20Great%20Britain">Peerage of Great Britain</a>. When he sought to sit in the House of Lords, he was denied admittance, the Lords ruling that a peer of Scotland could not sit in the House of Lords unless he was a representative peer, even if he also held a British peerage dignity. They reasoned that the Act of Union 1707 had established the number of Scots peers in the House of Lords at no more and no less than sixteen. In 1782, however, the House of Lords reversed the decision, holding that the Crown could admit anyone it pleases to the House of Lords, whether a Scottish peer or not, subject only to qualifications such as being of full age.

Under the <a href="Peerage%20Act%201963">Peerage Act 1963</a>, all Scottish peers procured the right to sit in the House of Lords, and the system of electing representative peers was abolished. Scottish as well as British and English <a href="hereditary%20peer">hereditary peer</a>s lost their automatic right to sit in the Upper House with the passage of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords%20Act%201999">House of Lords Act 1999</a>. During the debate on the House of Lords Bill, a question arose as to whether the proposal would violate the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Union">Treaty of Union</a>. In suggesting that the Bill did indeed violate the Articles of Union, it was submitted that, prior to Union, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Scotland">Estates of Parliament</a>, Scotland's old, pre-Union parliament, was entitled to impose conditions, and that one fundamental condition was a guarantee of representation of Scotland in both Houses of Parliament at <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>. It was implied, furthermore, that the Peerage Act 1963 did not violate the requirement of Scottish representation, set out in the Article XXII of the Treaty of Union, by allowing all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords: as long as a minimum of sixteen seats were reserved for Scotland, the principles of the Article would be upheld. It was further argued that the only way to rescind the requirement of Article XXII would be to dissolve the Union between England and Scotland, which the House of Lords Bill did not seek to do.

Counsel for the Government held a different view. It was noted that the Peerage Act 1963 explicitly repealed the portions of the Articles of Union relating to elections of representative peers, and that no parliamentary commentators had raised doubts as to the validity of those repeals. As Article XXII had been, or at least purportedly, repealed, there was nothing specific in the Treaty that the bill transgressed. It was further asserted by the Government that Article XXII could be repealed because it had not been <a href="Entrenched%20clause">entrenched</a>. Examples of entrenched provisions are numerous: England and Scotland were united "forever", the <a href="Court%20of%20Session">Court of Session</a> was to remain "in all time coming within Scotland as it is now constituted", and the establishment of the <a href="Church%20of%20Scotland">Church of Scotland</a> was "effectually and unalterably secured". Article XXII, however, did not include any words of entrenchment, making it "fundamental or unalterable in all time coming".

Further, the Government pointed out that, even if the election of Scottish peers were entrenched, <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> could amend the provision under the doctrine of <a href="Parliamentary%20sovereignty">Parliamentary sovereignty</a>. Though the position of the Church of Scotland was "unalterably" secured, the <a href="Universities%20%28Scotland%29%20Act%201853">Universities (Scotland) Act 1853</a> repealed the requirement that professors declare their faith before assuming a position. In <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> was entirely disestablished in 1869, though the Articles of Union with Ireland had clearly entrenched the establishment of that body. In December 1922, the Union with most of Ireland was dissolved upon the creation of the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a>, though <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and all of Ireland were supposedly united "forever." It was therefore suggested that Parliament could, if it pleased, repeal an Article of Union as well amend as any underlying principle.

The Privileges Committee unanimously found that the Articles of Union would not be breached by the House of Lords Bill if it were enacted. The bill did receive <a href="Royal%20Assent">Royal Assent</a>, and from 1999, hereditary peers have not had the automatic right to sit in Parliament.

Irish representation in the Westminster parliament was outlined by articles IV and VIII of the agreement embodied in the <a href="Acts%20of%20Union%201800">Acts of Union 1800</a>, which also required the Irish Parliament to pass an act before the union providing details for implementation. 

Irish peers were allowed to elect twenty-eight representative peers as <a href="Lords%20Temporal">Lords Temporal</a>, each of whom could serve for life. The Chamber of the <a href="Irish%20House%20of%20Lords">Irish House of Lords</a>, located in <a href="Irish%20Houses%20of%20Parliament">Parliament House</a> on College Green in central <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, housed the first election, attended by the peers or their proxies. <a href="First%20Pitt%20ministry">The government</a> mistakenly circulated a list of the successful candidates before the vote. The <a href="Clerk%20of%20the%20Crown%20and%20Hanaper">Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper</a> in Ireland was responsible for electoral arrangements; each peer voted by an open and public ballot. After the Union, new elections were held by <a href="postal%20vote">postal vote</a> within 52 days of a vacancy. Vacancies arose through death or, in the case of <a href="Frederic%20Trench%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Ashtown">Baron Ashtown</a> in 1915, <a href="bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>. No vacancy was created where a representative peer acquired a UK peerage, as when <a href="Lord%20Curzon">Lord Curzon</a> was made <a href="Baron%20Scarsdale">Baron Scarsdale</a> in 1911.

The <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> of Great Britain—the presiding officer of the House of Lords—certified the vacancy, while the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor%20of%20Ireland">Lord Chancellor of Ireland</a> directed the Clerk of the Crown and Hanaper to issue ballots to Irish peers, receive the completed ballots, determine the victor, and announce the result, which was then published in both "<a href="The%20Dublin%20Gazette">The Dublin Gazette</a>" and "<a href="The%20London%20Gazette">The London Gazette</a>". Catholic peers could not vote or stand until the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Relief%20Act%201829">Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829</a>. The process of being recognised by the Westminster <a href="Committee%20of%20Privileges">Committee of Privileges</a> as an elector was more cumbersome and expensive than being recognised as a (British or Irish) peer, until the orders drawn up in 1800 were amended in 1857. Successive governments tried to ensure that <a href="absentee%20landlord">absentee landlord</a>s were not elected. An exception was <a href="Lord%20Curzon">Lord Curzon</a>, who won election as a representative peer in 1908 despite never having claimed the right to be an elector; he had been refused a UK peerage by <a href="Liberal%20government%2C%201905%E2%80%931915">the Liberal government</a>.

The Acts of Union united the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> and <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a>, whose bishops and archbishops previously sat as <a href="Lords%20Spiritual">Lords Spiritual</a> in their respective Houses of Lords. In the united Parliament there were four Irish prelates at any one time, one <a href="archbishop">archbishop</a> and three <a href="diocesan%20bishop">diocesan bishop</a>s, who sat for a <a href="Legislative%20session">session</a> before ceding their seats to colleagues on a fixed rotation of <a href="Dioceses%20of%20Ireland">dioceses</a>. The rotation skipped any bishop already serving as an elected representative peer, as when <a href="Charles%20Agar%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Normanton">Charles Agar</a> sat as <a href="Viscount%20Somerton">Viscount Somerton</a> rather than <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Dublin%20%28Church%20of%20Ireland%29">Archbishop of Dublin</a>. The rotation was changed by the <a href="Church%20Temporalities%20Act%201833">Church Temporalities Act 1833</a>, which merged many dioceses and degraded the archbishoprics of <a href="Archdiocese%20of%20Tuam%20%28Church%20of%20Ireland%29">Tuam</a> and <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Cashel">Cashel</a> to bishoprics. No Irish bishops sat as Lords Spiritual after the 1871 <a href="disestablishment">disestablishment</a> of the Church of Ireland under the <a href="Irish%20Church%20Act%201869">Irish Church Act 1869</a>, although <a href="Robin%20Eames">Robin Eames</a>, then <a href="Archbishop%20of%20Armagh%20%28Church%20of%20Ireland%29">Archbishop of Armagh</a> was made a <a href="life%20peer">life peer</a> in 1995.
Following the establishment of the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State">Irish Free State</a> in December 1922, Irish peers ceased to elect representatives, although those already elected were allowed to serve for life; the last of the temporal peers, <a href="Francis%20Needham%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Kilmorey">The 4th Earl of Kilmorey</a> (a peer from an <a href="Ulster">Ulster</a> family), died in 1961. Disputes then arose as to whether representative peers could still be elected. The Act establishing the Irish Free State was silent on the matter, although the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State%20%28Consequential%20Provisions%29%20Act%201922">Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922</a> had abolished the office of <a href="Lord%20Chancellor%20of%20Ireland">Lord Chancellor of Ireland</a>, whose involvement was required in the election process; the office of Clerk of the Crown had also been abolished in Ireland. Various Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords for a restoration of their right to elect representatives. In 1962, the Joint Committee on House of Lords Reform rejected such plans. In the next year, when the <a href="Peerage%20Act%201963">Peerage Act 1963</a> (which, among other things, gave all peers in the <a href="Peerage%20of%20Scotland">Peerage of Scotland</a> the right to sit in the House of Lords) was being considered, an amendment to similarly allow Irish peers to attend was defeated, ninety to eight. Instead, the new Act gave all Irish peers the right to stand for election to the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>, and to vote at parliamentary elections.

In 1965, the <a href="8th%20Earl%20of%20Antrim">8th Earl of Antrim</a> (another peer from Ulster) and other Irish peers petitioned the House of Lords, arguing that the right to elect representative peers had never been formally abolished. The House of Lords ruled against the Irish peers. <a href="James%20Reid%2C%20Baron%20Reid">Lord Reid</a>, a <a href="Lord%20of%20Appeal%20in%20Ordinary">Lord of Appeal in Ordinary</a>, based his ruling on the Act of Union, which stated that representative peers sat "on the part of Ireland." He reasoned that, since the island had been divided into the Irish Free State and <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a>, there was no such political entity called "Ireland" which the representative peers could be said to represent. Lord Reid wrote, "A statutory provision is impliedly repealed if a later enactment brings to an end a state of things the continuance of which is essential for its operation." In contrast, <a href="Richard%20Wilberforce%2C%20Baron%20Wilberforce">Lord Wilberforce</a>, another Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, disagreed that a major enactment such as the Act of Union could be repealed by implication. He argued instead on the basis that the <a href="Irish%20Free%20State%20%28Consequential%20Provisions%29%20Act%201922">Irish Free State (Consequential Provisions) Act 1922</a>—which was silent on the election of representative peers—abolished the posts of Lord Chancellor of Ireland and Clerk of the Crown in Ireland. The Lord Chancellor of Ireland was responsible for calling elections of representative peers, and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland was responsible for sending peers their ballots. Since these offices had been abolished; Lord Wilberforce argued against any mechanism by which Irish peers could be elected. Here too, the petitioners lost.

The petitioners failed to raise the status of <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> as part of the United Kingdom. "<a href="Burke%27s%20Peerage">Burke's Peerage & Baronetage</a>" suggests that if this fact had been foremost, Lord Wilberforce's arguments relating to the removal of the electoral mechanism for the election could be rebutted, as the Lord Chancellor of Ireland and the Clerk of the Crown in Ireland did have replacements in Northern Ireland. The reason for excluding the arguments relating to Northern Ireland from the petition "was that leading counsel for the petitioning Irish peers was convinced that the members of the Committee for Privileges were with him on what he considered was his best argument and did not want to alienate them by introducing another point." To prevent further appeals on the matter, <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Parliament</a> repealed, as a part of the <a href="Statute%20Law%20%28Repeals%29%20Act%201971">Statute Law (Repeals) Act 1971</a>, the sections of the Acts of Union relating to the election of Irish representative peers.

After the Union of England and Scotland in 1707, Scottish peers, including those who did not sit as representative peers, were excluded from the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>. Irish peers were not subject to the same restrictions. Irish members not nominated as representative peers were allowed to serve in Parliament as representatives of a constituencies in Great Britain, although not in Ireland, provided they gave up their <a href="rights%20and%20privileges%20of%20peers">privileges as a peer</a>. <a href="Lord%20Curzon">Lord Curzon</a>, for example, specifically requested an Irish peerage when made <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy of India</a>, so that he would not be debarred from sitting in the House of Commons on his return.

The Peerage Act 1963 allowed all Scottish peers to sit in the House of Lords; it also permitted all Irish peers to sit in the House of Commons for any constituency in the United Kingdom, as well as to vote in parliamentary elections, without being deprived of the remaining privileges of peerage.

During the passage of the House of Lords Bill in 1999, controversy surrounding House of Lords reform remained, and the Bill was conceived as a first stage of Lords reform. The "Weatherill" amendment—so called since it was proposed by former House of Commons Speaker <a href="Bernard%20Weatherill">Bernard Weatherill</a>—provided for a number of hereditary peers to remain as members of the House of Lords, during the first stage of Lords reform. It could then be reviewed during the next stage of the reform, when the system of appointed life peerages came under examination. In exchange for the House not delaying the passage of the Bill into law, the Government agreed to this amendment, and it then became part of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords%20Act%201999">House of Lords Act 1999</a>, and 92 hereditary peers were allowed to remain.

The ninety-two peers are made up of three separate groups. Fifteen 'office-holders' comprise Deputy Speakers and Deputy Chairmen, and are elected by the House, while seventy-five party and Crossbench members are elected by their own party or group. In addition, there are two royal appointments: the <a href="Lord%20Great%20Chamberlain">Lord Great Chamberlain</a>, currently the <a href="David%20Cholmondeley%2C%207th%20Marquess%20of%20Cholmondeley">Marquess of Cholmondeley</a>, is appointed as the Queen's representative in Parliament, while the post of <a href="Earl%20Marshal">Earl Marshal</a> remains purely hereditary; the office has been held since 1672 by the <a href="Duke%20of%20Norfolk">Dukes of Norfolk</a> and is responsible for ceremonies such as the <a href="State%20Opening%20of%20Parliament">State Opening of Parliament</a>.

Joe Sakic

Joseph Steven "Joe" Sakic (; born July 7, 1969) is a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> executive and former player. He played his entire 21-year <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) career with the <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a>/<a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> franchise. Named <a href="captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captain</a> of the team in <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NHL%20season">1992</a> (after serving as a co-captain in <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NHL%20season">1990–91</a>), Sakic is regarded as one of the most capable team leaders in league history and was able to consistently motivate his team to play at a winning level. Sakic led the Avalanche to <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> titles in 1996 and 2001, being named the <a href="Conn%20Smythe%20Trophy">most valuable player</a> of the <a href="1996%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">1996 playoffs</a>, and honored as the <a href="most%20valuable%20player">MVP</a> of the NHL in 2001 by the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">hockey writers</a> and his <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson%20Award">fellow players</a>. He is one of six players to participate in both of the team's Stanley Cup victories. Sakic was also named to play in 13 <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star Game</a>s and selected to the NHL First All-Star Team at <a href="Centre%20%28ice%20hockey%29">centre</a> three times.

Over the course of his career, Sakic was one of the most productive forwards in the game, having twice scored 50 goals and earning at least 100 points in six different seasons. His <a href="wrist%20shot%20%28ice%20hockey%29">wrist shot</a>, considered one of the best in the NHL, was the source of much of his production as goalies around the league feared his rapid snap-shot release. At the conclusion of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09 NHL season</a>, he was the eighth all-time points leader in the NHL, as well as 14th in all-time goals and 11th in all-time assists. During the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a>, Sakic helped lead <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> to its first ice hockey gold medal in 50 years, and was voted as the tournament's most valuable player. He represented the team in six other international competitions, including the <a href="Canada%20at%20the%201998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998</a> and <a href="Canada%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006</a> Winter Olympics.

Sakic retired from the NHL on July 9, 2009, and had his jersey number retired prior to the Avalanche's <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NHL%20season">2009–10 season</a> opener on October 1, 2009, at <a href="Pepsi%20Center">Pepsi Center</a>. On November 12, 2012, Sakic was inducted in the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>, along with <a href="Adam%20Oates">Adam Oates</a>, <a href="Pavel%20Bure">Pavel Bure</a> and <a href="Mats%20Sundin">Mats Sundin</a>. On April 11, 2013, Sakic and 11 others were inducted into the Canada Sports Hall of Fame. He served as executive advisor and alternate governor for the Avalanche, effective at the end of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2010–11 season</a>, and promoted to Executive Vice President of hockey operations on May 10, 2013. In 2017, Sakic was named one of the '<a href="100%20Greatest%20NHL%20Players">100 Greatest NHL Players</a>' in history.

Sakic was born in <a href="Burnaby">Burnaby</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, to Marijan and Slavica Sakic (originally Šakić, ), immigrants from <a href="Socialist%20Republic%20of%20Croatia">Croatia</a> in what was then <a href="Socialist%20Federal%20Republic%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>. Growing up in Burnaby, he did not learn to speak English well until <a href="kindergarten">kindergarten</a>, having been raised with <a href="Croatian%20language">Croatian</a> as his <a href="mother%20tongue">mother tongue</a>. At the age of four, Sakic attended his first NHL game, a match between the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> and <a href="Atlanta%20Flames">Atlanta Flames</a>; after watching the game, Sakic decided that he wanted to become a hockey player. As a smaller player, he was forced to use skill rather than size to excel, and modeled himself after his idol, <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>. After showing exceptional promise as a young hockey player in Burnaby, Sakic was referenced as a new Wayne Gretzky in the making. He scored 83 goals and 156 points in only 80 games for Burnaby, while attending school at <a href="Burnaby%20North%20Secondary">Burnaby North Secondary</a> Soon after, he was added to the <a href="Lethbridge%20Broncos">Lethbridge Broncos</a> of the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League">Western Hockey League</a> (WHL) for the last part of the <a href="1985%E2%80%9386%20WHL%20season">1985–86 season</a>.

During the <a href="1986%E2%80%9387%20WHL%20season">1986–87 season</a>, the Broncos relocated to <a href="Swift%20Current%2C%20Saskatchewan">Swift Current, Saskatchewan</a>, becoming the <a href="Swift%20Current%20Broncos">Swift Current Broncos</a>. Sakic, playing in his first full season, was named Rookie of the Year of the WHL. He notched 60 goals and 73 assists for 133 points. But while Sakic enjoyed success on the ice, he and his team faced a tragedy on the night of December 30, 1986. The Broncos were driving to a game against the <a href="Regina%20Pats">Regina Pats</a>, and due to bad weather conditions, the bus <a href="Swift%20Current%20Broncos%20bus%20crash">crashed after the driver lost control</a> on a patch of black ice outside of Swift Current. While Sakic was unharmed, four of his teammates (Trent Kresse, Scott Kruger, Chris Mantyka and Brent Ruff) were killed. This incident had a lasting impact on the young Sakic, who declined to talk about the crash throughout his career. The next year, in <a href="1987%E2%80%9388%20WHL%20season">1987–88</a>, Sakic was named the <a href="Four%20Broncos%20Memorial%20Trophy">WHL Most Valuable Player</a> and <a href="CHL%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Canadian Major Junior Player of the Year</a>. He scored 160 points (78 goals, 82 assists), tying him with <a href="Theoren%20Fleury">Theoren Fleury</a> of the <a href="Moose%20Jaw%20Warriors">Moose Jaw Warriors</a> for the WHL scoring title.

Sakic was drafted 15th overall by the <a href="Quebec%20Nordiques">Quebec Nordiques</a> in the <a href="1987%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1987 NHL Entry Draft</a>. Rather than make the immediate jump, he told the Nordiques management he would prefer to spend the 1987–88 season in Swift Current to prepare for the NHL. He made his NHL debut on October 6, 1988, against the <a href="Hartford%20Whalers">Hartford Whalers</a> and registered an assist. His first NHL goal came two days later against goaltender <a href="Sean%20Burke">Sean Burke</a> of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a>. During the season, he wore #88 because his preferred number, #19 was already taken by a teammate, <a href="Alain%20C%C3%B4t%C3%A9%20%281957%29">Alain Côté</a>. While considered a front-runner for the <a href="Calder%20Memorial%20Trophy">Calder Memorial Trophy</a> as rookie of the year due to his rapid scoring pace, an ankle injury that forced him to miss 10 games in December and the resulting scoring slump helped quash any hopes of winning the award. He would finish his rookie season with 62 points in 70 games, and finishing eighth in voting for the Calder; defenceman <a href="Brian%20Leetch">Brian Leetch</a>, who won the rookie scoring race with 28 goals and 48 assists, won with forty-two first-place votes, while Sakic only received two third-place votes.

In <a href="1989%E2%80%9390%20NHL%20season">1989–90</a>, his second NHL season, Sakic was able to switch his number back to his familiar #19 (<a href="Alain%20C%C3%B4t%C3%A9%20%28ice%20hockey%20b.%201957%29">Alain Côté</a> had retired over the summer), and scored 102 points, which was ninth overall in the league. At the start of the next season, <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NHL%20season">1990–91</a>, he was named <a href="captain%20%28hockey%29">co-captain</a> along with <a href="Steven%20Finn%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Steven Finn</a> (Sakic was captain for home games, Finn for away games) and again passed the 100 point mark, improving to 109 points and sixth overall in the league, but would slip during <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20NHL%20season">1991–92</a> to 94 points, having missed 11 games. Early on in the season, Sakic showed some of his leadership qualities, even while <a href="Mike%20Hough">Mike Hough</a> was serving as captain, as he stood firm in the <a href="Eric%20Lindros">Eric Lindros</a> holdout issue. With Lindros holding out against the Nordiques, who were one of the worst teams in league, Sakic commented, "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game." Lindros was <a href="Eric%20Lindros%20trade">traded a year later</a>, ending the situation and bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. During their first four seasons with Joe Sakic, the Nordiques finished last place in the <a href="Adams%20Division">Adams Division</a> and last in the entire league for three straight years, from <a href="1988%E2%80%9389%20NHL%20season">1989</a> to <a href="1990%E2%80%9391%20NHL%20season">1991</a>.

Starting with the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20NHL%20season">1992–93 season</a>, Sakic became the sole captain of the franchise. Under his leadership, the Nordiques made the playoffs for the first time in six years and set a franchise record for wins and points in the process (since broken by the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season">2000–01</a> Colorado Avalanche team). Sakic reached the 100-point plateau, the third time he did so in five years, by scoring 48 goals and 105 points in the regular season, and added another six points in the playoffs. In the shortened <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20season">1994–95</a>, after the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20lockout">1994–95 NHL lockout</a>, Sakic was eight points behind <a href="Jarom%C3%ADr%20J%C3%A1gr">Jaromír Jágr</a> for the scoring title with a fourth-place finish, and helped the Nordiques win the division title, their first since the 1985–86 season.

In May 1995, the Nordiques announced that the team had been sold and were relocating from Quebec. Before the start of the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20NHL%20season">1995–96 season</a>, the franchise moved to <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, and was renamed the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a>. Sakic led the team to its first <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> championship, scoring 120 points in 82 regular season games and 34 points in 22 playoff games. He was awarded the <a href="Conn%20Smythe%20Trophy">Conn Smythe Trophy</a> as the most valuable player of the 1996 NHL playoffs. During the run for the Cup, Sakic again proved himself to be an effective team leader. Although his Nordiques had missed the playoffs in five of his first seven years in the NHL, he scored 18 goals, including six game-winners, and 34 points. He was one goal off from the record for goals in a playoff year, and his game-winning goals established a new record.

In the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season">1996–97</a> season, Sakic only played in 65 games due to a lacerated calf, yet still managed to score 74 points as the Avalanche earned their first <a href="Presidents%27%20Trophy">Presidents' Trophy</a> and third straight division title. He had another great playoff season with eight goals and 17 assists, and took the Avalanche all the way to the conference finals, where they eventually lost to the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> in six games. As a free agent during the summer of 1997, Sakic signed a three-year, $21 million <a href="offer%20sheet">offer sheet</a> with the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> as a restricted free agent. Under the <a href="collective%20bargaining%20agreement">collective bargaining agreement</a> at the time, the Avalanche had one week to match the Rangers' offer or let go of Sakic. Colorado would match the offer, which instigated a salary raise for many NHL players.

Injuries would again limit Sakic's playing time in the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NHL%20season">1997–98</a> season. While playing in his first Olympics with Team Canada, Sakic hurt his knee and was forced to miss 18 games with the Avalanche. In the 64 games he did play in, he still scored 63 points, enough to earn him his seventh All-Star appearance. He finally rebounded from his injury problems in the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">1998–99</a> season, finishing fifth in the league in scoring with 41 goals and 96 points in only 73 games. He led the Avalanche all the way to within one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost to the eventual champion <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a>. After the season ended, Sakic was ranked number 94 on "<a href="The%20Hockey%20News">The Hockey News</a>"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.

During the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">1999–2000</a> season, Sakic reached several career milestones. Injuries limited him to only 60 games, but he still managed to lead the team in scoring with 81 points. On December 27, 1999, against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>, Sakic earned an assist to become the 56th player in NHL history to reach 1,000 career points. Later in the season, on March 23, 2000, he scored a hat trick against the <a href="Arizona%20Coyotes">Phoenix Coyotes</a>, and became the 59th player to score 400 career goals. It also gave him 1,049 points with the Quebec/Colorado franchise, passing <a href="Peter%20%C5%A0%C5%A5astn%C3%BD">Peter Šťastný</a> as the all-time leader on the team.

Sakic eclipsed the 100 point mark again in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season">2000–01</a>, finishing with 118 along with a career best 54 goals, both being second-best in the league. He won the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a>, the <a href="Lady%20Byng%20Memorial%20Trophy">Lady Byng Memorial Trophy</a> and the <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson%20Award">Lester B. Pearson Award</a> (the latter presented to him by former Nordiques mentor Peter Šťastný), while also being a finalist for the <a href="Frank%20J.%20Selke%20Trophy">Frank J. Selke Trophy</a>. He led the Avalanche to their second Stanley Cup championship, defeating the defending title holders <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> in seven games. Memorably, after receiving the Cup from the <a href="NHL%20commissioner">NHL commissioner</a>, Sakic broke with tradition by not hoisting it first as most captains do, instead passing the Cup straight to <a href="Ray%20Bourque">Ray Bourque</a>, a player who had waited a record-breaking 22 seasons to win the Stanley Cup.

Sakic led the Avalanche in scoring again in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02 season</a>, finishing sixth in the league with 79 points. On March 9, 2002, he played in his 1,000th career game. The Avalanche once again reached the Western Conference Finals, but lost to the eventual Cup-winning <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a>. The following year, Sakic appeared in only 58 games and finished with just 58 points. He rebounded the following year, finishing third in the league with 87 points. It also marked the first time since the <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20NHL%20season">1993–94</a> season that his team did not win the division title, which was won by the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a>.

Following the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>, the Avalanche were forced to lose many of their key players in order to stay below the salary cap. Even with the loss of teammates <a href="Peter%20Forsberg">Peter Forsberg</a> and <a href="Adam%20Foote">Adam Foote</a>, Sakic still helped the Avalanche get into the playoffs, where they eventually lost to the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Anaheim Ducks</a> in the conference semi-finals. In June 2006, Sakic signed a one-year, $5.75 million deal to keep him with the Avalanche for the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2006–07 season</a>. Upon the retirement of <a href="Steve%20Yzerman">Steve Yzerman</a> a month later, on July 3, 2006, Sakic became the League leader for most NHL career points scored among active players.

Sakic had another strong season in the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2006–07</a>. He scored his 600th career goal on February 15, 2007, against the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a>, becoming the 17th player in history to reach the milestone and third that year. On the final day of the regular season, he scored his 100th point, reaching the milestone for the sixth time in his career. At the same time, Sakic became the second-oldest NHL player to score 100 points in a season at age 37, alongside hockey legend <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a>. Despite his efforts as well as a late-season charge, Sakic and the Avalanche missed the playoffs for the first time in 11 years, finishing one point behind the eighth placed Calgary Flames. On May 1, the NHL announced that Sakic was named as one of the three finalists of the Lady Byng Trophy, but it was eventually awarded to <a href="Pavel%20Datsyuk">Pavel Datsyuk</a> of the Detroit Red Wings.

In April 2007, Sakic signed on for a 19th NHL season with the Colorado Avalanche, signing a one-year deal for <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08</a>. Sakic commented on the deal, saying "at this stage in my career, I prefer to do one-year deals as I evaluate my play year-to-year." Upon signing Sakic to the deal, Avalanche General Manager <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Gigu%C3%A8re">François Giguère</a> said, "Joe is the heart of this organization and his leadership and value to this team and especially our young players is unquestioned." On October 7, 2007, he scored a goal and had an assist against the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>, moving past <a href="Phil%20Esposito">Phil Esposito</a> into eighth place on the NHL career points list with 1,591. Nineteen days later, Sakic scored a goal and assisted <a href="Ryan%20Smyth">Ryan Smyth</a> for an overtime game-winning goal against the Calgary Flames, reaching his 1,600th point in the NHL. On December 27, 2007, it was announced that Sakic underwent <a href="hernia">hernia</a> <a href="surgery">surgery</a> to accelerate the recovery of an injury that had forced him to miss the previous 12 games after a 232 consecutive games played streak. The operation caused him to miss a career-high 38 games. He was activated off of the injured reserve on February 24 and played that night, scoring an assist. On March 22, 2008, Sakic recorded his 1,000th career assist against the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, becoming the 11th player in NHL history to reach this milestone.

In June 2008, Sakic had a talk with Colorado General Manager François Giguère and said that he is uncertain with his future with the Avalanche. However, it was announced on August 27, 2008, that Sakic decided to sign a one-year contract with the team. Injuries limited Sakic's playing time in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09</a>. A herniated disk in his back forced him to stop playing in early November, after playing in 15 games, in which Sakic scored 12 points. While at home letting his back heal, Sakic broke three fingers in a snow-blower accident. He announced his retirement on July 9, 2009 The Avalanche <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20retired%20numbers">retired</a> his jersey, #19, prior to their <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NHL%20season">2009–10 season</a> opener on October 1, 2009, with a "C" on the banner to represent his lengthy service as team captain (having been the only captain of the Avalanche until he retired). Sakic was also named the inaugural member of the Avalanche Alumni Association.

Sakic was voted into the <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star Game</a> 13 times and played in 12 of them, serving as a captain for two of them, the last in <a href="55th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">2007</a>. He had at least one point in 11 of them. The only one that he missed entirely was the <a href="47th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">1997 All-Star Game</a>, due to an injury. Sakic won the Most Valuable Player award in the <a href="54th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">2004 All-Star Game</a> after scoring a <a href="hat%20trick">hat trick</a>, despite the Western Conference losing the game. He is the all-time assist leader in All-Star Games with 16 assists and is third place in all-time all-star scoring with 22 points, behind <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a> (23 points) and <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> (25 points). His best record in an All-Star Game was in 2007, when he scored four assists for the winning team; however the MVP award was given to <a href="Daniel%20Bri%C3%A8re">Daniel Brière</a>, who had a goal and four assists.

Sakic had an extensive international hockey career, representing Canada at seven international competitions. After being drafted by the Nordiques in 1987, he went on and helped Canada win the <a href="IIHF%20%20World%20U20%20Championship">1988 World Junior Championship</a>. His next tournament was the <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">1991 World Championships</a>, where Canada won the silver medal and Sakic contributed eleven points in ten games. He tried out for the <a href="1991%20Canada%20Cup">1991 Canada Cup</a> Canadian team, but was the first player to be cut, being cited for his weak leg strength. Sakic was bitter about the experience, feeling he was not given a good enough chance to prove himself, and called the whole experience "a complete waste of time."

Sakic's first successful professional tournament was the <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">1994 World Championships</a>, where Canada won its first gold medal in the tournament since 1961. Sakic's seven points in eight games were a crucial part of the team's success. During the <a href="1996%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">1996 World Cup of Hockey</a>, he played only a minor role in Canada's second-place finish as he scored one goal and two assists in six games. However, the tournament allowed him to showcase that he was indeed a dominant player who had simply been overlooked.

Sakic's first Olympic appearance came in <a href="1998%20Winter%20Olympics">1998</a> at <a href="Nagano%20%28city%29">Nagano</a>, Japan, the first tournament in which NHL players participated. Bothered by a knee injury, he only scored three points in four games, as the Canadian squad failed to meet expectations and finished in fourth. His second Olympic appearance came in <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002</a> in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>; led by his strong play, the Canadian team reached the gold medal match against Team USA, in which Sakic scored four points and helped Canada win its first gold medal in 50 years. He was later named MVP of the tournament with a cumulative tally of four goals and six assists and became one of the first Canadian members of the <a href="Triple%20Gold%20Club">Triple Gold Club</a>. Sakic also played a part in Canada's triumph in the <a href="2004%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">2004 World Cup of Hockey</a>, where he scored six points in six games.

On December 21, 2005, Sakic was named captain of <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> for the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy. Once again, Team Canada was heavily favored and given high expectations, but they failed to medal, finishing seventh overall. Sakic finished the tournament with three points.

After he retired, Sakic decided to take time off from hockey and spent time with his family. In 2011, two years after his retirement, Sakic returned to the Avalanche to work in their front office. He was named an executive advisor and alternate governor for the team, effective at the end of the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2010–11 season</a>. In his role as an advisor, Sakic would advise the team in hockey-related matters, and as an alternate governor, would represent the team at Board of Governors meetings.

On June 26, 2012, Sakic was selected to the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> in his first year of eligibility. He was inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> on November 12, 2012, along with <a href="Mats%20Sundin">Mats Sundin</a>, <a href="Pavel%20Bure">Pavel Bure</a> and <a href="Adam%20Oates">Adam Oates</a>. Sakic was the only member of his class who won the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> during his career.

On May 10, 2013, the Avalanche promoted Sakic to Executive Vice President of Hockey Operations. In this expanded role, Sakic has the final say on all matters regarding hockey personnel. During <a href="Patrick%20Roy">Patrick Roy's</a> time as head coach, they shared most of the duties normally held by a general manager. General Manager <a href="Greg%20Sherman">Greg Sherman</a> remained in his post, but served mainly in an advisory role to Roy and Sakic. This de facto arrangement was formalized the following season, when Sakic was formally named general manager and Sherman was demoted to assistant general manager.

Apart from his two years away from hockey, Sakic has spent almost three decades with the Nordiques/Avalanche organization as either a player or executive.

Sakic and his wife Debbie have three children: son Mitchell, born in 1996, and fraternal twins; son Chase and daughter Kamryn, born in October 2000. They met at a local high school while he was playing in Swift Current, and they frequently return to the town during the off-season. Sakic is an avid <a href="golf">golf</a>er, and competed in the celebrity Pro Am golf tournament in <a href="Lake%20Tahoe">Lake Tahoe</a> in the summer of 2006. Each summer, he also hosts his own charity golf tournament which benefits the Food Bank of the Rockies. His charity work, which is estimated to have provided more than seven million meals to poor children and families, has earned an NHL Foundation Player Award in 2007.

Sakic was a fan favourite in his hometown of Burnaby, where a street has been named Joe Sakic Way in his honour. Throughout <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, he is affectionately known as "Burnaby Joe"; in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, he is known simply as "Super Joe." His younger brother <a href="Brian%20Sakic">Brian</a> joined the <a href="Swift%20Current%20Broncos">Swift Current Broncos</a> during Joe's final season with the team, and later played for the <a href="Flint%20Generals">Flint Generals</a> of the <a href="United%20Hockey%20League">United Hockey League</a>. Sakic also has an uncredited role in the movie <a href="Happy%20Gilmore">Happy Gilmore</a> as a "player at hockey tryouts".

Sakic recorded his 1,000th career point on December 27, 1999, against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>. He became the 11th player to reach 1,500 points, doing so on October 25, 2006, with an assist against the <a href="Washington%20Capitals">Washington Capitals</a>, and the sixth to do so with one franchise. <a href="Gordie%20Howe">Gordie Howe</a>, <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a>, <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a>, <a href="Ray%20Bourque">Ray Bourque</a> and <a href="Steve%20Yzerman">Steve Yzerman</a> are the others who have achieved this feat. On March 22, 2008, Sakic notched his 1,000th career assist against the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> on a second period goal scored by <a href="Tyler%20Arnason">Tyler Arnason</a>.

Sakic played his 1,000th career game on March 9, 2002, against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>. His 500th career goal came against the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> on December 11, 2002. In a February 15, 2007, game against the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a>, Sakic scored his 600th career goal. He also earned his 900th assist, the 16th player to do so, against the Flames in a game on March 12, 2006.

During the final game of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2006–07 season</a>, Sakic scored his 100th point of the year. This made him, at age 37, the second oldest player in NHL history, after Gordie Howe, to record 100 points in a regular season. He became the longest active tenured captain in the league, with fifteen seasons leading the Nordiques/Avalanche franchise, after the retirement of Steve Yzerman at the conclusion of the 2005–06 regular season. On March 22, 2008, against the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, Sakic recorded the 1,000th assist of his career, the 11th player to do so. The gloves he wore in the game were later sent to the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>.

Alongside <a href="Bobby%20Clarke">Bobby Clarke</a>, Wayne Gretzky and <a href="Mark%20Messier">Mark Messier</a>, Sakic is one of four players to captain his team to a Stanley Cup championship and win the Hart Memorial Trophy in the same year. Sakic is also a member of the <a href="Triple%20Gold%20Club">Triple Gold Club</a>, a term used in ice hockey to describe players who have won an Olympic Gold medal, a World Championship Gold medal and the Stanley Cup.

In his 20-year career with the Nordiques and Avalanche, Sakic has obtained nearly all of the franchise scoring records, including most all-time goals (625), assists (1,016) and points (1,641). He also holds the franchise record for most games played (1,363), and is on several notable NHL records which are most All-Star game assists (16) and most playoff overtime goals (8).

Sakic is also the only player ever to score 100 points in a season for a team that finishes dead last in the NHL regular season standings, accomplishing this feat in 1989-90 with Quebec Nordiques.

Throughout his career, Sakic was one of the top scorers in the league, but in his early years, he was criticized for not leading his team to playoff success. While in Quebec, the Nordiques were one of the worst teams in the league, finishing last in their division five out of the seven years Sakic was with the team, including three straight years of being last overall in the league. After leading the Avalanche to the Stanley Cup in 1996 with his 34 playoff points, Sakic began to be seen as capable of leading a team to success, and he was seen as one of the league's premier players.

Though Sakic was a quiet individual, he was able to motivate his team to play at higher levels, which earned him the respect of his peers and executives. The first signs of Sakic's leadership began to show while still a member of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL. After the bus crash that killed four of his teammates, Sakic was seen as the leader of the team, acknowledging that the experience changed his outlook on life. Early in his career with the Nordiques (when <a href="Mike%20Hough">Mike Hough</a> was still captain), with the team hoping to rebuild around their top draft pick <a href="Eric%20Lindros">Eric Lindros</a>, and holding onto Lindros' rights for the season when he refused to sign, Sakic suggested that the team could progress without Lindros, saying, "We only want players here who have the passion to play the game. I'm tired of hearing that name. He's not here and there are a lot of others in this locker room who really care about the game." Lindros was traded a year later, bringing in a number of quality players, which vastly improved the Nordiques. Sakic's leadership qualities led him to be courted by other teams, such as in the summer of 1997, when the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> offered him a large contract in order to replace departed captain <a href="Mark%20Messier">Mark Messier</a>, though the Avalanche ultimately matched the offer and retained Sakic.

One of the most defining actions of Sakic's career was at the conclusion of the 2001 playoffs. Defying the NHL tradition of the captain being the first to skate around with the Stanley Cup, Sakic passed it off to teammate <a href="Ray%20Bourque">Ray Bourque</a>.

CFM International CFM56

The CFM International CFM56 (U.S. military designation F108) series is a French-American family of <a href="bypass%20ratio">high-bypass</a> <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> <a href="aircraft%20engine">aircraft engine</a>s made by <a href="CFM%20International">CFM International</a> (CFMI), with a thrust range of . CFMI is a 50–50 joint-owned company of <a href="Safran%20Aircraft%20Engines">Safran Aircraft Engines</a> (formerly known as Snecma) of France, and <a href="GE%20Aviation">GE Aviation</a> (GE) of the United States. Both companies are responsible for producing components and each has its own final assembly line. GE produces the high-pressure <a href="axial%20compressor">compressor</a>, <a href="combustor">combustor</a>, and high-pressure <a href="Components%20of%20jet%20engines%23Turbines">turbine</a>, Snecma manufactures the fan, <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">gearbox</a>, exhaust and the low-pressure turbine, and some components are made by <a href="Avio">Avio</a> of Italy. The engines are assembled by GE in <a href="Evendale%2C%20Ohio">Evendale, Ohio</a>, and by Snecma in <a href="Melun%20Villaroche%20Aerodrome">Villaroche</a>, France. The completed engines are marketed by CFMI. Despite initial export restrictions, it is one of the most common <a href="turbofan">turbofan</a> <a href="aircraft%20engine">aircraft engine</a>s in the world, in four major variants.

The CFM56 first ran in 1974. In April 1979, the <a href="joint%20venture">joint venture</a> had not received a single order in five years and was two weeks away from being dissolved. The program was saved when <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a>, and <a href="Flying%20Tiger%20Line">Flying Tigers</a> chose the CFM56 to re-engine their <a href="DC-8">DC-8</a>s and shortly thereafter it was chosen to re-engine the <a href="KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135 Stratotanker</a> fleet of the <a href="U.S.%20Air%20Force">U.S. Air Force</a> – still its biggest customer. The first engines entered service in 1982. Several fan blade <a href="turbine%20engine%20failure">failure</a> incidents were experienced during the CFM56's early service, including one failure that was a cause of the <a href="Kegworth%20air%20disaster">Kegworth air disaster</a>, and some engine variants experienced problems caused by flight through rain and hail. Both these issues were resolved with engine modifications.

Research into the next generation of commercial jet engines, <a href="Bypass%20ratio">high-bypass ratio</a> turbofans in the "10-ton" (20,000 lbf; 89 kN) thrust class, began in the late 1960s. Snecma, who had mostly built military engines until then, was the first company to seek entrance into the market by searching for a partner with commercial experience to design and build an engine in this class. They considered <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney">Pratt & Whitney</a>, <a href="Rolls-Royce%20plc">Rolls-Royce</a>, and <a href="GE%20Aviation">GE Aviation</a> as potential partners, and after two company executives, <a href="Gerhard%20Neumann">Gerhard Neumann</a> from GE and René Ravaud from Snecma, introduced themselves at the 1971 <a href="Paris%20Air%20Show">Paris Air Show</a> a decision was made. The two companies saw mutual benefit in the collaboration and met several more times, fleshing out the basics of the joint project.

At the time, Pratt & Whitney dominated the commercial market. GE needed an engine in this market class, and Snecma had previous experience of working with them, collaborating on the production of the <a href="General%20Electric%20CF6%23CF6-50">CF6-50</a> turbofan for the <a href="Airbus%20A300">Airbus A300</a>. Pratt & Whitney was considering upgrading their <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT8D">JT8D</a> to compete in the same class as the CFM56 as a sole venture, while Rolls-Royce dealt with financial issues that precluded them from starting new projects; this situation caused GE to gain the title of best partner for the program.

A major reason for GE's interest in the collaboration, rather than building a 10-ton engine on their own, was that the Snecma project was the only source of development funds for an engine in this class at this particular time. GE was initially considering only contributing technology from its CF6 engine rather than its much more advanced <a href="General%20Electric%20F101">F101</a> engine, developed for the <a href="B-1%20Lancer">B-1 Lancer</a> supersonic bomber. The company was faced with a dilemma when the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF) announced its <a href="Advanced%20Medium%20STOL%20Transport">Advanced Medium STOL Transport</a> (AMST) project in 1972 which included funding for the development of a 10-ton engine – either to build a "limited" technology 10-ton engine with Snecma, or a similar engine with "advanced" technology on their own. Concerned that the company would be left with only the "limited" engine in its portfolio if it did not win the Air Force contract (for which it was competing with Pratt & Whitney and a <a href="General%20Motors">General Motors</a> division with its "advanced" engine), GE decided to apply for an export license for the F101 core technology.

GE applied for the export license in 1972 as their primary contribution to the 10-ton engine project. The <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State's</a> Office of Munitions Control recommended the rejection of the application on national security grounds; specifically because the core technology was an aspect of a strategic national defense system (B-1 bomber), it was built with <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Defense">Department of Defense</a> funding, and that exporting the technology to France would limit the number of American workers on the project. The official decision was made in a National Security Decision Memorandum signed by the National Security Advisor <a href="Henry%20Kissinger">Henry Kissinger</a> on 19 September 1972.

While national security concerns were cited as the grounds for rejection, politics played an important role as well. The project, and the export issue associated with it, was considered so important that French President <a href="Georges%20Pompidou">Georges Pompidou</a> appealed directly to U.S. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> in 1971 to approve the deal, and Henry Kissinger brought the issue up with President Pompidou in a 1972 meeting. GE reportedly argued at the highest levels that having half of the market was better than having none of it, which they believed would happen if Snecma pursued the engine on their own without GE's contribution. Nixon administration officials feared that this project could be the beginning of the end of American aerospace leadership.

There was also speculation that the rejection may have been, in part, retaliation for French involvement in convincing the Swiss not to purchase American-made <a href="LTV%20A-7%20Corsair%20II">LTV A-7 Corsair II</a> aircraft that had been competing against a French design, the <a href="Dassault%20Mirage%20III%23Derivatives">Dassault Milan</a>. In the end, the Swiss did not purchase either aircraft, opting for the <a href="Northrop%20F-5">Northrop F-5E Tiger II</a> instead.

Despite the export license being rejected, both the French and GE continued to push the Nixon Administration for permission to export the F101 technology. Efforts continued throughout the months following the rejection, culminating in the engine becoming an agenda topic during the 1973 meeting of Presidents Nixon and Pompidou in <a href="Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavík</a>. Discussions at this meeting resulted in an agreement that allowed the development of the CFM56 to proceed. Contemporary reports state that the agreement was based on assurances that the core of the engine, the part that GE was developing from the military F101, would be built in the U.S. and then transported to France in order to protect the sensitive technologies. The joint venture also agreed to pay the U.S. an $80 million royalty fee (calculated at $20,000 per engine predicted to be built) as repayment for the development money provided by the government for the F101 engine core. Documents declassified in 2007 revealed that a key aspect of the CFM56 export agreement was that the French government agreed not to seek tariffs against American aircraft being imported into Europe.

With the export issue settled, GE and Snecma finalized the agreement that formed <a href="CFM%20International">CFM International</a> (CFMI), a 50–50 joint company that would be responsible for producing and marketing the 10-ton engine, the CFM56. The venture was officially founded in 1974. The two primary roles for CFMI were to manage the program between GE and Snecma, and to market, sell and service the engine at a single point of contact for the customer. CFMI was made responsible for the day-to-day decision making for the project, while major decisions (developing a new variant, for example) required the go-ahead from GE and Snecma management.

The CFMI board of directors is currently split evenly between Snecma and GE (five members each). There are two vice presidents, one from each company, who support the President of CFMI. The president tends to be drawn from Snecma and sits at CFMI's headquarters near GE in Cincinnati, Ohio.

The work split between the two companies gave GE responsibility for the high-pressure <a href="Axial%20compressor">compressor</a> (HPC), the <a href="combustor">combustor</a>, and the high-pressure <a href="turbine">turbine</a> (HPT); Snecma was responsible for the fan, the low-pressure compressor (LPC), and the low-pressure turbine (LPT). Snecma was also responsible for the initial airframe integration engineering, mostly involving the <a href="nacelle">nacelle</a> design, and was initially responsible for the <a href="Transmission%20%28mechanics%29">gearbox</a>, but shifted that work to GE when it became apparent that it would be more efficient for GE to assemble that component along with their other parts.

Development work on the CFM56 began before CFMI was formally created. While work proceeded smoothly, the international arrangement led to unique working conditions. For example, both companies had assembly lines, some engines were assembled and tested in the U.S. and others in France. Engines assembled in France were subject to the initially strict export agreement, which meant that GE's core was built in the U.S., then shipped to the Snecma plant in France where it was placed in a locked room into which even the President of Snecma was not allowed. The Snecma components (the fore and aft sections of the engine) were brought into the room, GE employees mounted them to the core, and then the assembled engine was taken out to be finished.

The first completed CFM56 engine first ran at GE in June 1974 with the second running in October 1974. The second engine was then shipped to France and first ran there on 13 December 1974. These first engines were considered "production hardware" as opposed to test examples and were designated as the CFM56-2, the first variant of the CFM56.

The engine flew for the first time in February 1977 when it replaced one of the four <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT8D">Pratt & Whitney JT8D</a> engines on the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20YC-15">McDonnell Douglas YC-15</a>, an entrant in the Air Force's <a href="Advanced%20Medium%20STOL%20Transport">Advanced Medium STOL Transport</a> (AMST) competition. Soon after, the second CFM56 was mounted on a <a href="Sud%20Aviation%20Caravelle">Sud Aviation Caravelle</a> at the Snecma flight test center in France. This engine had a slightly different configuration with a long bypass duct and <a href="Bypass%20duct">mixed exhaust</a> flow, rather than a short bypass duct with <a href="Bypass%20duct">unmixed exhaust</a> flow. It was the first to include a "Thrust Management System" to maintain engine trim.

After testing the engine for several years, both in the air and on the ground, CFMI searched for customers outside of a possible AMST contract. The main targets were re-engine contracts for the <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a> and the <a href="Boeing%20707">Boeing 707</a> airliners, including the related military tanker, the <a href="KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135 Stratotanker</a>. There was little initial interest in the engine, but Boeing realized that the CFM56 might be a solution to upcoming noise regulations. After announcing that a 707 would be configured with the CFM56 engine for flight tests in 1977, Boeing officially offered the 707-320 with the CFM56 engine as an option in 1978. The new variant was listed as the 707-700. Due to limited interest from the airlines in a re-engined 707, Boeing ended the 707-700 program in 1980 without selling any aircraft. Despite the lack of sales, having the commercial 707 available with the CFM56 helped the engine's competitiveness for the KC-135 re-engine contract.

Winning the contract to re-engine the KC-135 tanker fleet for the USAF would be a huge boon to the CFM56 project (with more than 600 aircraft available to re-engine), and CFMI aggressively pursued that goal as soon as the Request For Proposals (RFP) was announced in 1977. Like other aspects of the program, international politics played their part in this contract. In efforts to boost the CFM56's chances versus its competitors, the <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT3D">Pratt & Whitney TF33</a> and an updated <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20JT8D">Pratt & Whitney JT8D</a>, the French government announced in 1978 that they would upgrade their 11 KC-135s with the CFM56, providing one of the first orders for the engine.

The USAF announced the CFM56 as the winner of the re-engine contract in January 1980. Officials indicated that they were excited at the prospect of replacing the <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20J57">Pratt & Whitney J57</a> engines currently flying on the KC-135A aircraft, calling them "...the noisiest, dirtiest, [and] most fuel inefficient powerplant still flying" at the time. The re-engined aircraft was designated the KC-135R. The CFM56 brought many benefits to the KC-135, decreasing <a href="takeoff">takeoff</a> distance by as much as 3,500 ft (1,100 m), decreasing overall fuel usage by 25%, greatly reducing noise (24 dB lower) and lowering total life cycle cost. With those benefits in mind, the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> selected the CFM56-2 to power their variant of the Boeing 707, the <a href="E-6%20Mercury">E-6 Mercury</a>, in 1982. In 1984 the <a href="Royal%20Saudi%20Air%20Force">Royal Saudi Air Force</a> selected the CFM56-2 to power their <a href="E-3%20Sentry">E-3 Sentry</a> aircraft (also related to the 707 <a href="airframe">airframe</a>). The CFM56-2-powered E-3 also became the standard configuration for aircraft purchased by the British and French.

By the end of the 1970s, airlines were considering upgrading their aging <a href="Douglas%20DC-8">Douglas DC-8</a> aircraft as an alternative to buying new quieter and more efficient aircraft. Following the French KC-135 order in 1978, the April 1979 decision by <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> to upgrade 30 of their DC-8-61 aircraft with the CFM56-2 was important for securing the development of the CFM56; GE and Snecma were two weeks away from freezing development had that order not materialized. This decision marked the first commercial purchase (rather than government/military) of the engine, and <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a> and <a href="Flying%20Tiger%20Line">Flying Tiger Line</a> soon followed suit, giving the CFM56 a firm footing in both the military and commercial market.

In the early 1980s Boeing selected the CFM56-3 to exclusively power the <a href="Boeing%20737%20Classic">Boeing 737-300</a> variant. The 737 wings were closer to the ground than previous applications for the CFM56, necessitating several modifications to the engine. The fan diameter was reduced, which reduced the bypass ratio, and the engine accessory gearbox was moved from the bottom of the engine (the 6 o'clock position) to the 9 o'clock position, giving the engine nacelle its distinctive flat-bottomed shape. The overall thrust was also reduced, from , mostly due to the reduction in bypass ratio.

Since the small initial launch order for twenty 737-300s split between two airlines, over 5,000 Boeing 737 aircraft had been delivered with CFM56 turbofans by April 2010.

In 1998, CFMI launched the "Tech56" development and demonstration program to create an engine for the new single-aisle aircraft that were expected to be built by Airbus and Boeing. The program focused on developing a large number of new technologies for the theoretical future engine, not necessarily creating an all-new design. When it became clear that Boeing and Airbus were not going to build all-new aircraft to replace the 737 and A320, CFMI decided to apply some of those Tech56 technologies to the CFM56 in the form of the "Tech Insertion" program which focused on three areas: <a href="fuel%20efficiency">fuel efficiency</a>, maintenance costs and emissions. Launched in 2004, the package included redesigned high-pressure compressor blades, an improved combustor, and improved high- and low-pressure turbine components which resulted in better fuel efficiency and lower <a href="NOx">nitrogen oxides</a> (NO) emissions. The new components also reduced engine wear, lowering maintenance costs by about 5%. The engines entered service in 2007, and all new CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B engines are being built with the Tech Insertion components. CFMI also offers the components as an upgrade kit for existing engines.

In 2009, CFMI announced the latest upgrade to the CFM56 engine, the "CFM56-7B Evolution" or CFM56-7BE. This upgrade, announced with improvements to Boeing's 737 Next Generation, further enhances the high- and low-pressure turbines with better aerodynamics, as well as improving engine cooling, and aims to reduce overall part count. CFMI expected the changes to result in a 4% reduction in maintenance costs and a 1% improvement in fuel consumption (2% improvement including the airframe changes for the new 737); flight and ground tests completed in May 2010 revealed that the fuel burn improvement was better than expected at 1.6%. Following 450 hours of testing, the CFM56-7BE engine was certified by FAA and EASA on 30 July 2010 and delivered from mid-2011.

The CFM56-5B/3 PIP (Performance Improvement Package) engine includes these new technologies and hardware changes to lower fuel burn and lower maintenance cost. Airbus A320s were to use this engine version starting in late 2011.

The LEAP is a new engine design based on and designed to replace the CFM56 series, with 16% efficiency savings by using more composite materials and achieving higher bypass ratios of over 10:1. LEAP entered service in 2016.

As of June 2016, the CFM56 is the most used <a href="high%20bypass%20turbofan">high bypass turbofan</a>, it achieved more than 800 million engine flight hours, and at a rate of one million flight hours every eight days it will achieve one billion flight hours by 2020. It has more than 550 operators and more than 2,400 CFM56-powered <a href="jet%20aircraft">jet aircraft</a> are in the air at any moment. It is known for its <a href="dependability">dependability</a>: its average time on wing is 30,000 hours before a first <a href="Aircraft%20maintenance">shop visit</a>, with the current fleet record at 50,000 hours.

As of July 2016, 30,000 engines have been built: 9,860 CFM56-5 engines for the <a href="Airbus%20A320ceo">Airbus A320ceo</a> and <a href="A340">A340</a>-200/300 and more than 17,300 CFM56-3/-7B engines for the <a href="Boeing%20737%20Classic">Boeing 737 Classic</a> and <a href="737NG">737NG</a>. In July 2016, CFM had 3,000 engines in backlog. <a href="Lufthansa">Lufthansa</a>, launch customer for the CFM56-5C-powered A340, have an engine with more than 100,000 flight hours, having entered commercial service on November 16, 1993, <a href="Maintenance%2C%20repair%2C%20and%20operations">overhauled</a> four times since. In 2016 CFM delivered 1,665 CFM56 and booked 876 orders, it plans to produce CFM56 spare parts until 2045.

By October 2017, CFM had delivered more than 31,000 engines and 24,000 were in service with 560 operators, it attained 500 million flight cycles and 900 million flight hours, including over 170 million cycles and 300 million hours since 1998 for the B737NG's -7B and over 100 million cycles and 180 million hours for the A320ceo's -5B since 1996.
By June 2018, 32,645 were delivered.
Strong demand will extend production to 2020, up from 2019.

<a href="Exhaust%20gas">Exhaust gas</a> temperature margin erodes with usage, one or two performance restoration shop visits, costing $0.3-$0.6m for a -5 series, can be performed before taking the engine off wing, which can restore 60% to 80% of the original margin; after that, the <a href="Fatigue%20limit">life limit</a>ed parts must be replaced, after 20,000 cycles for the hot section ($0.5m), 25,000 for the <a href="axial%20compressor">axial compressor</a> and 30,000 for the fan and booster ($0.5m-$0.7m) for a recent CFM56 : the whole engine parts cost more than $3m, $3.5 to $4m with the shop work-hours, around $150 per cycle.

The CFM56 is a high-bypass turbofan engine (most of the air accelerated by the fan bypasses the core of the engine and is exhausted out of the fan case) with several variants having <a href="bypass%20ratio">bypass ratio</a>s ranging from 5:1 to 6:1, generating 18,500 to 34,000 lbf (80 kN to 150 kN) of thrust. The variants share a common design, but the details differ. The CFM56 is a two-shaft (or two-spool) engine, meaning that there are two rotating shafts, one high-pressure and one low-pressure. Each is powered by its own turbine section (the high-pressure and low-pressure turbines, respectively). The fan and booster (low-pressure compressor) evolved over the different iterations of the engine, as did the compressor, combustor and turbine sections.

Most variants of the CFM56 feature a <a href="Annular%20combustor">single-annular combustor</a>. An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is injected into the airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. This contrasts with a <a href="Combustor%23Can%20type">can combustor</a>, where each combustion chamber is separate, and a <a href="Cannular">canannular</a> combustor which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a>. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine by means of an <a href="electrohydraulic%20servo%20valve">electrohydraulic servo valve</a> that, in turn, drives a fuel metering valve, that provides information to the <a href="FADEC">full authority digital engine controller</a> (FADEC).

In 1989, CFMI began work on a new, double-annular combustor. Instead of having just one combustion zone, the double-annular combustor has a second combustion zone that is used at high thrust levels. This design lowers the emissions of both <a href="NOx">nitrogen oxides</a> (NO) and <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (CO). The first CFM56 engine with the double-annular combustor entered service in 1995, and the combustor is used on CFM56-5B and CFM56-7B variants with the suffix "/2" on their nameplates.

GE started developing and testing a new type of combustor called the <a href="Twin%20Annular%20Premixing%20Swirler">Twin Annular Premixing Swirler</a> combustor, or "TAPS", during the Tech 56 program. This design is similar to the double-annular combustor in that it has two combustion zones; this combustor "swirls" the flow, creating an ideal fuel–air mixture. This difference allows the combustor to generate much less NO than other combustors. Tests on a CFM56-7B engine demonstrated an improvement of 46% over single-annular combustors and 22% over double-annular combustors. The analytical tools developed for TAPS have also been used to improve other combustors, notably the single-annular combustors in some CFM56-5B and -7B engines.

The high-pressure compressor (HPC), that was at the center of the original export controversy, features nine stages in all variants of the CFM56. The compressor stages have been developed from <a href="General%20Electric">GE</a>'s "GE core" (namely a single-turbine, nine-compressor stage design) which was designed in a compact core rotor. The small span of the compressor radius meant that the entire engine could be lighter and smaller, as the <a href="accessory%20unit">accessory unit</a>s in the system (<a href="Bearing%20%28mechanical%29">bearings</a>, oiling systems) could be merged to the main fueling system running on aviation fuel. As design evolved "HPC" design improved through better airfoil design. As part of the <a href="Tech-56%20improvement%20program">Tech-56 improvement program</a> CFMI has tested the new CFM-56 model with six-stage high-pressure <a href="compressor%20stage">compressor stage</a>s (discs that make up the compressor system) that was designed to deliver same pressure ratios (pressure gain 30) similar to the old nine-stages compressor design. The new one was not fully replacing the old one, but it offered an upgrade in HPC, thanks to improved <a href="blade%20%28disambiguation%29">blade</a> dynamics, as a part of their "Tech Insertion" management plan from 2007.

CFMI tested both a mixed and unmixed exhaust design at the beginning of development; most variants of the engine have an unmixed exhaust nozzle. Only the high-power CFM56-5C, designed for the Airbus A340, has a mixed-flow exhaust nozzle.

GE and Snecma also tested the effectiveness of <a href="Turbofan%23Noise">chevrons</a> on reducing jet noise. After examining configurations in the <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a>, CFMI chose to flight-test chevrons built into the core exhaust nozzle. The chevrons reduced jet noise by 1.3 perceived loudness <a href="decibel">decibel</a>s during takeoff conditions, and are now offered as an option with the CFM56 for the <a href="Airbus%20A321">Airbus A321</a>.

The CFM56 features a single-stage fan, and most variants have a three-stage booster on the low-pressure shaft, with four stages in the -5B and -5C variants. The booster is also commonly called the "low-pressure compressor" (LPC) as it sits on the low-pressure shaft and compresses the flow initially before it reaches the high-pressure compressor. The original CFM56-2 variant featured 44 tip-<a href="Shroud%20%28turbine%29">shrouded</a> fan blades, although the number of fan blades was reduced in later variants as wide-chord blade technology developed, down to 22 blades in the latest variant, the CFM56-7.

The CFM56 fan features <a href="Dovetail%20joint">dovetailed</a> fan blades which allows them to be replaced without removing the entire engine, and GE/Snecma claim that the CFM56 was the first engine to have that capability. This attachment method is useful for circumstances where only a few fan blades need to be repaired or replaced, such as following <a href="bird%20strike">bird strike</a>s.

The fan diameter varies with the different models of the CFM56, and that change has a direct impact on the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving <a href="Thrust%20specific%20fuel%20consumption">specific fuel consumption</a> nearly 3%).

The CFM56 is designed to support several <a href="Thrust%20reversal">reverse thrust</a> systems which help slow and stop the aircraft after landing. The variants built for the Boeing 737, the CFM56-3 and the CFM56-7, use a cascade type of thrust reverser. This type of thrust reverse consists of sleeves that slide back to expose mesh-like cascades and blocker doors that block the bypass air flow. The blocked bypass air is forced through the cascades, reducing the thrust of the engine and slowing the aircraft down.

The CFM56 also supports pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type is used on the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both blocking the bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.

All variants of the CFM56 feature a single-stage high-pressure turbine (HPT). In some variants, the HPT <a href="Turbine%20blade">blades</a> are "grown" from a <a href="single%20crystal">single crystal</a> <a href="superalloy">superalloy</a>, giving them high strength and <a href="Creep%20%28deformation%29">creep</a> resistance. The low-pressure turbine (LPT) features four stages in most variants of the engine, but the CFM56-5C has a five-stage LPT. This change was implemented to drive the larger fan on this variant. Improvements to the turbine section were examined during the Tech56 program, and one development was an <a href="Aerodynamics">aerodynamically</a> optimized low-pressure turbine blade design, which would have used 20% fewer blades for the whole low-pressure turbine, saving weight. Some of those Tech56 improvements made their way into the Tech Insertion package, where the turbine section was updated. The turbine section was updated again in the "Evolution" upgrade.

The high-pressure turbine stages in the CFM56 are internally cooled by air from the high-pressure compressor. The air passes through internal channels in each blade and ejects at the leading and trailing edges.

The CFM56-2 series is the original variant of the CFM56. It is most widely used in military applications where it is known as the F108; specifically in the <a href="KC-135%20Stratotanker">KC-135</a>, the <a href="E-6%20Mercury">E-6 Mercury</a> and some <a href="Boeing%20E-3%20Sentry">E-3 Sentry</a> aircraft. The CFM56-2 comprises a single-stage fan with 44 blades, with a three-stage LP compressor driven by a four-stage LP turbine, and a nine-stage HP compressor driven by a single-stage HP turbine. The combustor is annular.

The first derivative of the CFM56 series, the CFM56-3 was designed for <a href="Boeing%20737%20Classic">Boeing 737 Classic</a> series (737-300/-400/-500), with static thrust ratings from . A "cropped fan" derivative of the -2, the -3 engine has a smaller fan diameter at 60 in (1.5 m) but retains the original basic engine layout. The new fan was primarily derived from GE's <a href="CF6%23CF6-80">CF6-80</a> turbofan rather than the CFM56-2, and the booster was redesigned to match the new fan.

A significant challenge for this series was achieving ground clearance for the wing-mounted engine. This was overcome by reducing the intake fan diameter and relocating the gearbox and other accessories from beneath the engine to the sides. The resulting flattened nacelle bottom and intake lip yielded the distinctive appearance of the Boeing 737 with CFM56 engines.

The CFM56-4 series was a proposed improved version of the CFM56-2 designed for the <a href="Airbus%20A320%20family">Airbus A320</a> family of aircraft. Competing with the <a href="Rolls-Royce/JAEC%20RJ500">RJ500</a> engine being developed by Rolls-Royce, the -4 series was designed to produce 25,000 lbf (110 kN) and was to feature a new 68 in (1.73 m) fan, a new low-pressure compressor and a full authority digital engine controller (FADEC). Soon after the upgrade project was launched in 1984, International Aero Engines offered their new <a href="IAE%20V2500">V2500</a> engine for the A320. CFMI realized that the CFM56-4 did not compare favorably with the new engine and scrapped the project to begin working on the CFM56-5 series.

The CFM56-5 series is designed for the <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> aircraft and has a very wide thrust rating of between . It has three distinct sub-variants; the CFM56-5A, CFM56-5B and CFM56-5C, and differs from its Boeing-fitted cousins by featuring a FADEC and incorporating further aerodynamic design improvements.

The CFM56-5A series is the initial CFM56-5 series, designed to power the short-to-medium range <a href="Airbus%20A320%20family">Airbus A320 family</a>. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500 lbf (98 kN and 118 kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% more fuel efficient than its predecessors.

An improvement of the CFM56-5A series, it was originally designed to power the A321. With a thrust range between 22,000 and 33,000 lbf (98 kN and 147 kN) it can power every model in the A320 family (A318/A319/A320/A321) and has superseded the CFM56-5A series. Among the changes from the CFM56-5A is the option of a double-annular combustor that reduces emissions (particularly NO), a new fan in a longer fan case, and a new low-pressure compressor with a fourth stage (up from three in earlier variants). It is the most numerous engine supplied to Airbus.

With a thrust rating of between 31,200 and 34,000 lbf (139 kN and 151 kN), the CFM56-5C series is the most powerful of the CFM56 family. It powers Airbus' long-range <a href="Airbus%20A340">A340-200 and -300</a> airliners, and entered service in 1993. The major changes are a larger fan, a fifth low-pressure turbine stage, and the same four-stage low-pressure compressor found in the -5B variant.

Unlike every other variant of the CFM56, the -5C features a mixed-exhaust nozzle, which offers slightly higher efficiency.

The CFM56-7 first ran on 21 April 1995. Rated with a takeoff thrust range of , it powers the -600/-700/-800/-900 <a href="Boeing%20737%20Next%20Generation">Boeing 737 Next Generation</a>; compared to the CFM56-3, it has greater durability, 8% fuel burn improvement and a 15% reduction in maintenance costs.

Improvements are due to its 61-inch titanium <a href="wide%20chord">wide chord</a> fan, 3D aerodynamics designed new core and low-pressure turbine with <a href="single%20crystal">single crystal</a> high-pressure turbine and <a href="Full%20Authority%20Digital%20Engine%20Control">Full Authority Digital Engine Control</a> (FADEC). Fan blades are reduced from 38 to 24 and it incorporates features from the CFM56-5 series such as a double-annular combustor as an option.

Less than two years after entry into service, the Next-Generation 737 received 180 minutes <a href="ETOPS">Extended range twin engine Operations</a> (ETOPS) certification from the US <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA). It also powers the Boeing 737 military versions : <a href="Boeing%20737%20AEW%26amp%3BC">Airborne Early Warning & Control</a>, <a href="C-40%20Clipper">C-40 Clipper</a> transport and <a href="P-8%20Poseidon">P-8 Poseidon</a> Maritime Aircraft.

The CFM56 has an in-flight shutdown rate of 1 incident per 333,333 hours. Record time on wing before the first shop visit was 30,000 hours in 1996, to 40,729 hours in 2003 and 50,000 hours in 2016.

There have been several engine failures in the early service of the CFM56 family which were serious enough to either ground the fleet or require aspects of the engine to be redesigned. The engines have also suffered, periodically, from thrust instability events tentatively traced to Honeywell's hydromechanical unit.

There are several recorded incidents of CFM56 engines <a href="Flameout">flaming out</a> in heavy rain and/or hail conditions, beginning early in the CFM56's career. In 1987, a double flameout occurred in hail conditions (the pilots managed to relight the engines), followed by the <a href="TACA%20Flight%20110">TACA Flight 110</a> incident in 1988. Both CFM56 engines on the TACA 737 flamed out while passing through hail and heavy rain, and the crew was forced to land without engines on a grassy <a href="levee">levee</a> near New Orleans, Louisiana. CFMI modified the engines by adding a sensor to force the <a href="combustor">combustor</a> to continuously ignite under these conditions.

In 2002, <a href="Garuda%20Indonesia%20Flight%20421">Garuda Indonesia Flight 421</a> had to <a href="Water%20landing%23In%20distress">ditch</a> in a river because of hail-induced engine flameouts, killing a flight attendant and injuring dozens of passengers. Prior to this accident, there were several other incidents of single or dual flameouts due to these weather conditions. After three incidents through 1998, CFMI made modifications to the engine to improve the way in which the engine handled hail ingestion. The major changes included a modification to the fan/booster splitter (making it more difficult for hail to be ingested by the core of the engine) and the use of an elliptical, rather than conical, spinner at the intake. These changes did not prevent the 2002 accident, and the investigation board found that the pilots did not follow the proper procedures for attempting to restart the engine, which contributed to the final result. Recommendations were made to better educate pilots on how to handle these conditions, as well as to revisit <a href="FAA">FAA</a> rain and hail testing procedures. No further engine modifications were recommended.

One issue that led to accidents with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the <a href="Kegworth%20air%20disaster">Kegworth air disaster</a> in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the final approach. Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a <a href="Dan-Air">Dan-Air</a> 737-400 and a <a href="BMI%20%28airline%29">British Midland</a> 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.

At the time it was not mandatory to flight test new variants of existing engines, and certification testing failed to reveal vibration modes that the fan experienced during the regularly performed power climbs at high altitude. Analysis revealed that the fan was being subjected to <a href="high-cycle%20fatigue">high-cycle fatigue</a> stresses worse than expected and also more severe than tested for certification; these higher stresses caused the blade to fracture. Less than a month after grounding, the fleet was allowed to resume operations once the fan blades and fan disc were replaced and the electronic engine controls were modified to reduce maximum engine thrust to 22,000 lbf (98 kN) from 23,500 lbf (105 kN). The redesigned fan blades were installed on all CFM56-3C1 and CFM56-3B2 engines, including over 1,800 engines that had already been delivered to customers.

In August 2016 <a href="Southwest%20Airlines%20Flight%203472">Southwest Airlines Flight 3472</a> suffered a fan blade failure, but landed later without further incident. While the aircraft sustained substantial damage, there were no injuries.

On April 17, 2018, <a href="Southwest%20Airlines%20Flight%201380">Southwest Airlines Flight 1380</a> suffered from what appears to be a fan blade failure, debris from which punctured a window. The Boeing 737-700 landed safely, but one passenger was killed and several were injured.

Airlines have reported 32 events involving sudden instability of thrust, at various points during flight, including high thrust settings during climb to altitude. The problem has been long-standing. In 1998, two 737 pilots reported that their engine throttles suddenly increased to full thrust during flight. A very recent investigation has led to the tentative conclusion that the problem originates in the Hydromechanical unit, and may involve an unacceptable level of fuel contamination (with water, or particulate matter, including biodegradable material that create solids in the fuel), or overuse of biocides to reduce bacterial growth. Boeing told "<a href="Aviation%20Week%20and%20Space%20Technology">Aviation Week and Space Technology</a>" that CFM International had revised its <a href="FADEC">FADEC</a> software. The new software "...'reduces the duration and degree of thrust-instability events' by cycling the fuel monitoring valve (FMV) and the EHSV (electrohydraulic servo valve) to clean the EHSV spool." This software fix is not intended to be a definitive solution to the problem; CFM claimed that no further reports have reached it after this change was made.

Pontiac's War

Pontiac's War (also known as Pontiac's Conspiracy or Pontiac's Rebellion) was launched in 1763 by a loose confederation of elements of <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">Native American</a> tribes, primarily from the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region">Great Lakes region</a>, the <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a>, and <a href="Ohio%20Country">Ohio Country</a> who were dissatisfied with <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> postwar policies in the Great Lakes region after the British victory in the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> (1754–1763). Warriors from numerous tribes joined the uprising in an effort to drive British soldiers and settlers out of the region. The war is named after the <a href="Odawa">Odawa</a> leader <a href="Pontiac%20%28Ottawa%20leader%29">Pontiac</a>, the most prominent of many native leaders in the conflict.

The war began in May 1763 when Native Americans, offended by the policies of British General <a href="Jeffery%20Amherst%2C%201st%20Baron%20Amherst">Jeffrey Amherst</a>, attacked a number of British forts and settlements. Eight forts were destroyed, and hundreds of colonists were killed or captured, with many more fleeing the region. Hostilities came to an end after <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> expeditions in 1764 led to peace negotiations over the next two years. Native Americans were unable to drive away the British, but the uprising prompted the British government to modify the policies that had provoked the conflict.

Warfare on the North American frontier was brutal, and the killing of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was a reflection of a growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the <a href="Royal%20Proclamation%20of%201763">Royal Proclamation of 1763</a> in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an impetus for the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may have been one of the early contributing factors to the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>.

The conflict is named after its most famous participant, the <a href="Odawa">Ottawa</a> leader <a href="Pontiac%20%28person%29">Pontiac</a>; variations include "Pontiac's War", "Pontiac's Rebellion", and "Pontiac's Uprising". An early name for the war was the "Kiyasuta and Pontiac War", "Kiyasuta" being an alternate spelling for <a href="Guyasuta">Guyasuta</a>, an influential <a href="Seneca%20nation">Seneca</a>/<a href="Mingo">Mingo</a> leader. The war became widely known as "Pontiac's Conspiracy" after the publication in 1851 of <a href="Francis%20Parkman">Francis Parkman</a>'s "The Conspiracy of Pontiac". Parkman's influential book, the definitive account of the war for nearly a century, is still in print.

In the 20th century, some historians argued that Parkman exaggerated the extent of Pontiac's influence in the conflict and that it was misleading to name the war after Pontiac. For example, in 1988 <a href="Francis%20Jennings">Francis Jennings</a> wrote: "In Francis Parkman's murky mind the backwoods plots emanated from one savage genius, the Ottawa chief Pontiac, and thus they became 'The Conspiracy of Pontiac,' but Pontiac was only a local Ottawa war chief in a 'resistance' involving many tribes." Alternate titles for the war have been proposed, but historians generally continue to refer to the war by the familiar names, with "Pontiac's War" probably the most commonly used. "Pontiac's Conspiracy" is now infrequently used by scholars.

In the decades before Pontiac's Rebellion, France and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> participated in a series of wars in Europe that also involved the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20Wars">French and Indian Wars</a> in North America. The largest of these wars was the worldwide <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, in which France lost <a href="New%20France">New France</a> in North America to Great Britain. Peace with the <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> and <a href="Lenape">Lenape</a> who had been combatants came in 1758 with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Easton">Treaty of Easton</a>, where the British promised not to settle further beyond the ridge of the <a href="Allegheny%20Mountains">Alleghenies</a> – a demarcation later to be confirmed by the Royal Proclamation of 1763, though it was little respected. Most fighting in the North American <a href="theater%20%28warfare%29">theater</a> of the war, generally referred to as the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> in the United States, came to an end after British General <a href="Jeffery%20Amherst%2C%201st%20Baron%20Amherst">Jeffrey Amherst</a> captured Montreal, the last important French settlement, in 1760.

British troops proceeded to occupy the various forts in the <a href="Ohio%20Country">Ohio Country</a> and <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region%20%28North%20America%29">Great Lakes region</a> previously garrisoned by the French. Even before the war officially ended with the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29">Treaty of Paris (1763)</a>, the British Crown began to implement changes in order to administer its vastly expanded North American territory. While the French had long cultivated alliances among certain of the Native Americans, the British post-war approach was essentially to treat the Native Americans as a conquered people. Before long, Native Americans who had been allies of the defeated French found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the British occupation and the new policies imposed by the victors.

Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion lived in a vaguely defined region of New France known as the "pays d'en haut" ("the upper country"), which was claimed by France until the Paris peace treaty of 1763. Native Americans of the "pays d'en haut" were from many different <a href="tribe">tribe</a>s. At this time and place, a "tribe" was a linguistic or familial group rather than a political unit. No chief spoke for an entire tribe, and no tribe acted in unison. For example, <a href="Ottawa%20%28tribe%29">Ottawas</a> did not go to war as a tribe: some Ottawa leaders chose to do so, while other Ottawa leaders denounced the war and stayed clear of the conflict.

The tribes of the "pays d'en haut" consisted of three basic groups. The first group was composed of tribes of the Great Lakes region: <a href="Ojibwe">Ojibwe</a>, <a href="Odawa">Odawa</a>, and <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a>, who spoke <a href="Algonquian%20languages">Algonquian languages</a>; and the <a href="Wyandot%20people">Huron</a>, who spoke an <a href="Iroquoian%20language">Iroquoian language</a>. They had long been allied with French "<a href="habitants">habitants</a>", with whom they lived, traded, and intermarried. Great Lakes Native Americans were alarmed to learn that they were under British sovereignty after the French loss of North America. When a British garrison took possession of <a href="Fort%20Detroit">Fort Detroit</a> from the French in 1760, local Native Americans cautioned them that "this country was given by God to the Indians."

The second group was made up of the tribes from eastern <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a>, which included the <a href="Miami%20tribe">Miami</a>, <a href="Wea">Wea</a>, <a href="Kickapoo%20people">Kickapoo</a>, <a href="Mascouten">Mascouten</a>, and <a href="Piankashaw">Piankashaw</a>. Like the Great Lakes tribes, these people had a long history of close trading and other relations with the French. Throughout the war, the British were unable to <a href="power%20projection">project military power</a> into the Illinois Country, which was on the remote western edge of the conflict. The Illinois tribes were the last to come to terms with the British.

The third group was made up of tribes of the <a href="Ohio%20Country">Ohio Country</a>: <a href="Lenape">Delawares (Lenape)</a>, <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a>, <a href="Wyandot%20people">Wyandot</a>, and <a href="Mingo">Mingo</a>. These people had migrated to the Ohio valley earlier in the century from the mid-Atlantic and other eastern areas in order to escape British, French, and Iroquois domination in the New York and Pennsylvania area. Unlike the Great Lakes and Illinois Country tribes, Ohio Native Americans had no great attachment to the French regime. They had fought as French allies in the previous war in an effort to drive away the British. They made a separate peace with the British with the understanding that the British Army would withdraw from the Ohio Country. But after the departure of the French, the British strengthened their forts in the region rather than abandoning them, and so the Ohioans went to war in 1763 in another attempt to drive out the British.

Outside the "pays d'en haut", most warriors of the influential <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois Confederacy</a> did not participate in Pontiac's War because of their alliance with the British, known as the <a href="Covenant%20Chain">Covenant Chain</a>. However, the westernmost Iroquois nation, the <a href="Seneca%20tribe">Seneca tribe</a>, had become disaffected with the alliance. As early as 1761, the Seneca began to send out war messages to the Great Lakes and Ohio Country tribes, urging them to unite in an attempt to drive out the British. When the war finally came in 1763, many Seneca were quick to take action.

General Amherst, the British <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20North%20America">commander-in-chief in North America</a>, was in overall charge of administering policy towards Native Americans, which involved both military matters and regulation of the <a href="fur%20trade">fur trade</a>. Amherst believed that with France out of the picture, the Native Americans would have no other choice than to accept British rule. He also believed that they were incapable of offering any serious resistance to the British Army; therefore, of the 8,000 troops under his command in North America, only about 500 were stationed in the region where the war erupted. Amherst and officers such as Major <a href="Henry%20Gladwin">Henry Gladwin</a>, commander at <a href="Fort%20Detroit">Fort Detroit</a>, made little effort to conceal their contempt for the Native Americans. Native Americans involved in the uprising frequently complained that the British treated them no better than slaves or dogs.

Additional Native resentment resulted from Amherst's decision in February 1761 to cut back on the gifts given to the Native Americans. Gift giving had been an integral part of the relationship between the French and the tribes of the "pays d'en haut". Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to their people. By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among their people, and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies. Since gifts were considered necessary to diplomacy and peaceful co-existence, this change in policy led to a breakdown in any future talks.

Amherst also began to restrict the amount of ammunition and gunpowder that traders could sell to Native Americans. While the French had always made these supplies available, Amherst did not trust the Native Americans, particularly after the <a href="Anglo-Cherokee%20War">"Cherokee Rebellion"</a> of 1761, in which <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a> warriors took up arms against their former British allies. As the Cherokee war effort had collapsed because of a shortage of gunpowder, so Amherst hoped that future uprisings could be prevented by restricting gunpowder. This created resentment and hardship because gunpowder and ammunition were wanted by native men because it helped them to provide game for their families and skins for the fur trade. Many Native Americans began to believe that the British were disarming them as a prelude to making war upon them. <a href="Sir%20William%20Johnson%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir William Johnson</a>, the Superintendent of the <a href="Indian%20Department">Indian Department</a>, tried to warn Amherst of the dangers of cutting back on gifts and gunpowder, but to no avail.

Land was also an issue in the coming of the war. While the French colonists—most of whom were farmers who seasonally engaged in fur trade—had always been relatively few, there seemed to be no end of settlers in the British colonies, who wanted to clear the land of trees and occupy it. Shawnees and Delawares in the <a href="Ohio%20Country">Ohio Country</a> had been displaced by British colonists in the east, and this motivated their involvement in the war. On the other hand, Native Americans in the Great Lakes region and the <a href="Illinois%20Country">Illinois Country</a> had not been greatly affected by white settlement, although they were aware of the experiences of tribes in the east. Historian Gregory Dowd argues that most Native Americans involved in Pontiac's Rebellion were not immediately threatened with displacement by white settlers, and that historians have therefore overemphasized British colonial expansion as a cause of the war. Dowd believes that the presence, attitude, and policies of the British Army, which the Native Americans found threatening and insulting, were more important factors.

Also contributing to the outbreak of war was a religious awakening which swept through Native settlements in the early 1760s. The movement was fed by discontent with the British as well as food shortages and epidemic disease. The most influential individual in this phenomenon was <a href="Neolin">Neolin</a>, known as the "Delaware Prophet", who called upon Native Americans to shun the trade goods, alcohol, and weapons of the whites. <a href="Syncretism">Merging elements</a> from Christianity into traditional religious beliefs, Neolin told listeners that the <a href="Great%20Spirit">Master of Life</a> was displeased with the Native Americans for taking up the bad habits of the white men, and that the British posed a threat to their very existence. "If you suffer the English among you," said Neolin, "you are dead men. Sickness, smallpox, and their poison [alcohol] will destroy you entirely." It was a powerful message for a people whose world was being changed by forces that seemed beyond their control.

Although fighting in Pontiac's Rebellion began in 1763, rumors reached British officials as early as 1761 that discontented Native Americans were planning an attack. Senecas of the Ohio Country (<a href="Mingos">Mingos</a>) circulated messages ("war belts" made of <a href="wampum">wampum</a>) which called for the tribes to form a confederacy and drive away the British. The Mingos, led by <a href="Guyasuta">Guyasuta</a> and Tahaiadoris, were concerned about being surrounded by British forts. Similar war belts originated from Detroit and the Illinois Country. The Native Americans were not unified, however, and in June 1761, Native Americans at Detroit informed the British commander of the Seneca plot. After William Johnson held a large council with the tribes at Detroit in September 1761 a tenuous peace was maintained, but war belts continued to circulate. Violence finally erupted after the Native Americans learned in early 1763 of the imminent French cession of the "pays d'en haut" to the British.

The war began at Fort Detroit under the leadership of Pontiac, and quickly spread throughout the region. Eight British forts were taken; others, including Fort Detroit and Fort Pitt, were unsuccessfully besieged. Francis Parkman's "The Conspiracy of Pontiac" portrayed these attacks as a coordinated operation planned by Pontiac. Parkman's interpretation remains well known, but other historians have since argued that there is no clear evidence that the attacks were part of a master plan or overall "conspiracy". The prevailing view among scholars today is that, rather than being planned in advance, the uprising spread as word of Pontiac's actions at Detroit traveled throughout the "pays d'en haut", inspiring already discontented Native Americans to join the revolt. The attacks on British forts were not simultaneous: most Ohio Native Americans did not enter the war until nearly a month after the beginning of Pontiac's siege at Detroit.

Parkman also believed that Pontiac's War had been secretly instigated by <a href="habitants">French colonists</a> who were stirring up the Native Americans in order to make trouble for the British. This belief was widely held by British officials at the time, but subsequent historians have found no evidence of official French involvement in the uprising. (The rumor of French instigation arose in part because French war belts from the Seven Years' War were still in circulation in some Native villages.) Rather than the French stirring up the Native Americans, some historians now argue that the Native Americans were trying to stir up the French. Pontiac and other native leaders frequently spoke of the imminent return of French power and the revival of the Franco-Native alliance; Pontiac even flew a French flag in his village. All of this was apparently intended to inspire the French to rejoin the struggle against the British. Although some French colonists and traders supported the uprising, the war was initiated and conducted by Native Americans who had Native—not French—objectives.

Historian Richard Middleton (2007) argues that Pontiac's vision, courage, persistence, and organizational abilities allowed him to activate a remarkable coalition of Indian nations prepared to fight successfully against the British. Though the idea to gain independence for all Native Americans west of the Allegheny Mountains did not originate with him but with two Seneca leaders, Tahaiadoris and Guyasuta, by February 1763 Pontiac appeared to embrace the idea. At an emergency council meeting, Pontiac clarified his military support of the broad Seneca plan and worked to galvanize other nations into the military operation that he helped lead, in direct contradiction to traditional Indian leadership and tribal structure. He achieved this coordination through the distribution of war belts: first to the northern Ojibwa and Ottawa near Michilimackinac; and then after the failure to seize Detroit by stratagem, to the Mingo (Seneca) on the upper Allegheny River, the Ohio Delaware near Fort Pitt, and the more westerly Miami, Kickapoo, Piankashaw and Wea peoples.

On April 27, 1763, Pontiac spoke at a council on the banks of the <a href="Ecorse%20River">Ecorse River</a>, in what is now <a href="Lincoln%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Lincoln Park, Michigan</a>, about 10 miles (15 km) southwest of Detroit. Using the teachings of Neolin to inspire his listeners, Pontiac convinced a number of Ottawas, <a href="Ojibwa">Ojibwa</a>s, <a href="Potawatomi">Potawatomi</a>s, and <a href="Wyandot%20people">Hurons</a> to join him in an attempt to seize <a href="Fort%20Detroit">Fort Detroit</a>. On May 1, Pontiac visited the fort with 50 Ottawas in order to assess the strength of the garrison. According to a French chronicler, in a second council Pontiac proclaimed:

It is important for us, my brothers, that we exterminate from our lands this nation which seeks only to destroy us. You see as well as I that we can no longer supply our needs, as we have done from our brothers, the French. ... Therefore, my brothers, we must all swear their destruction and wait no longer. Nothing prevents us; they are few in numbers, and we can accomplish it.

Hoping to take the stronghold by surprise, on May 7 Pontiac entered Fort Detroit with about 300 men carrying concealed weapons. The British had learned of Pontiac's plan, however, and were armed and ready. His tactic foiled, Pontiac withdrew after a brief council and, two days later, laid siege to the fort. Pontiac and his allies killed all of the British soldiers and settlers they could find outside of the fort, including women and children. One of the soldiers was ritually <a href="cannibalism">cannibalized</a>, as was the custom in some Great Lakes Native cultures. The violence was directed at the British; French colonists were generally left alone. Eventually more than 900 soldiers from a half-dozen tribes joined the siege. Meanwhile, on May 28 a British supply column from <a href="Fort%20Niagara">Fort Niagara</a> led by Lieutenant <a href="Abraham%20Cuyler">Abraham Cuyler</a> was ambushed and defeated at <a href="Point%20Pelee%20National%20Park">Point Pelee</a>.

After receiving reinforcements, the British attempted to make a surprise attack on Pontiac's encampment. But Pontiac was ready and waiting, and defeated them at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bloody%20Run">Battle of Bloody Run</a> on July 31, 1763. Nevertheless, the situation at Fort Detroit remained a stalemate, and Pontiac's influence among his followers began to wane. Groups of Native Americans began to abandon the siege, some of them making peace with the British before departing. On October 31, 1763, finally convinced that the French in Illinois would not come to his aid at Detroit, Pontiac lifted the siege and removed to the <a href="Maumee%20River">Maumee River</a>, where he continued his efforts to rally resistance against the British.

Before other British outposts had learned about Pontiac's siege at Detroit, Native Americans captured five small forts in a series of attacks between May 16 and June 2. The first to be taken was <a href="Fort%20Sandusky">Fort Sandusky</a>, a small <a href="blockhouse">blockhouse</a> on the shore of <a href="Lake%20Erie">Lake Erie</a>. It had been built in 1761 by order of General Amherst, despite the objections of local <a href="Wyandot%20people">Wyandots</a>, who in 1762 warned the commander that they would soon burn it down. On May 16, 1763, a group of Wyandots gained entry under the pretense of holding a council, the same stratagem that had failed in Detroit nine days earlier. They seized the commander and killed the other 15 soldiers, as well as British traders at the fort. These were among the first of about 100 traders who were killed in the early stages of the war. The dead were ritually <a href="scalping">scalped</a> and the fort—as the Wyandots had warned a year earlier—was burned to the ground.

<a href="Fort%20St.%20Joseph%20%28Niles%29">Fort St. Joseph</a> (the site of present-day <a href="Niles%2C%20Michigan">Niles</a>, Michigan) was captured on May 25, 1763, by the same method as at Sandusky. Potawatomis seized the commander and killed most of the 15-man garrison outright. <a href="Forts%20of%20Fort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana">Fort Miami</a> (on the site of present <a href="Fort%20Wayne%2C%20Indiana">Fort Wayne</a>, Indiana) was the third fort to fall. On May 27, 1763, the commander was lured out of the fort by his Native mistress and shot dead by <a href="Miami%20%28tribe%29">Miami</a> Native Americans. The nine-man garrison surrendered after the fort was surrounded.

In the Illinois Country, , Kickapoos, and Mascoutens took <a href="Fort%20Ouiatenon">Fort Ouiatenon</a> (about west of present <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette</a>, Indiana) on June 1, 1763. They lured soldiers outside for a council, and took the 20-man garrison captive without bloodshed. The Native Americans around Fort Ouiatenon had good relations with the British garrison, but emissaries from Pontiac at Detroit had convinced them to strike. The warriors apologized to the commander for taking the fort, saying that "they were obliged to do it by the other Nations." In contrast with other forts, the Natives did not kill the British captives at Ouiatenon.

The fifth fort to fall, <a href="Fort%20Michilimackinac">Fort Michilimackinac</a> (present <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City</a>, Michigan), was the largest fort taken by surprise. On June 2, 1763, local Ojibwas staged a game of <a href="stickball%20%28Native%20American%29">stickball</a> (a forerunner of <a href="lacrosse">lacrosse</a>) with visiting <a href="Sauk%20people">Sauks</a>. The soldiers watched the game, as they had done on previous occasions. The ball was hit through the open gate of the fort; the teams rushed in and were given weapons which Native women had smuggled into the fort. The warriors killed about 15 of the 35-man garrison in the struggle; later they killed five more in ritual torture.

Three forts in the Ohio Country were taken in a second wave of attacks in mid-June. <a href="Iroquois">Iroquois</a> <a href="Seneca%20nation">Senecas</a> took <a href="Fort%20Venango">Fort Venango</a> (near the site of the present <a href="Franklin%2C%20Pennsylvania">Franklin</a>, Pennsylvania) around June 16, 1763. They killed the entire 12-man garrison outright, keeping the commander alive to write down the grievances of the Senecas. After that, they ritually burned him at the stake. Possibly the same Seneca warriors attacked <a href="Fort%20Le%20Boeuf">Fort Le Boeuf</a> (on the site of <a href="Waterford%2C%20Pennsylvania">Waterford</a>, Pennsylvania) on June 18, but most of the 12-man garrison escaped to Fort Pitt.

On June 19, 1763, about 250 Ottawa, Ojibwa, Wyandot, and Seneca warriors surrounded <a href="Fort%20Presque%20Isle">Fort Presque Isle</a> (on the site of <a href="Erie%2C%20Pennsylvania">Erie</a>, Pennsylvania), the eighth and final fort to fall. After holding out for two days, the garrison of about 30 to 60 men surrendered, on the condition that they could return to Fort Pitt. The warriors killed most of the soldiers after they came out of the fort.

Colonists in western Pennsylvania fled to the safety of Fort Pitt after the outbreak of the war. Nearly 550 people crowded inside, including more than 200 women and children. Simeon Ecuyer, the Swiss-born British officer in command, wrote that "We are so crowded in the fort that I fear disease ... ; the <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> is among us." Fort Pitt was attacked on June 22, 1763, primarily by <a href="Delawares">Delawares</a>. Too strong to be taken by force, the fort was kept under siege throughout July. Meanwhile, Delaware and <a href="Shawnee">Shawnee</a> war parties raided deep into Pennsylvania, taking captives and killing unknown numbers of settlers in scattered farms. Two smaller strongholds that linked Fort Pitt to the east, <a href="Fort%20Bedford">Fort Bedford</a> and <a href="Fort%20Ligonier">Fort Ligonier</a>, were sporadically fired upon throughout the conflict, but were never taken.

Before the war, Amherst had dismissed the possibility that the Native Americans would offer any effective resistance to British rule, but that summer he found the military situation becoming increasingly grim. He ordered subordinates to "immediately ... put to death" captured enemy Native American warriors. To Colonel <a href="Henry%20Bouquet">Henry Bouquet</a> at <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster</a>, Pennsylvania, who was preparing to lead an expedition to relieve Fort Pitt, Amherst wrote on about June 29, 1763: "Could it not be contrived to send the small pox among the disaffected tribes of Indians? We must on this occasion use every stratagem in our power to reduce them." Bouquet responded to Amherst (summer of 1763):

"P.S. I will try to inocculate the Indians by means of Blankets that may fall in their hands, taking care however not to get the disease myself. As it is pity to oppose good men against them, I wish we could make use of the Spaniard's Method, and hunt them with English Dogs. Supported by Rangers, and some Light Horse, who would I think effectively extirpate or remove that Vermine."

In a postscript, Amherst replied:

"P.S. You will Do well to try to Innoculate the Indians by means of Blankets, as well as to try Every other method that can serve to Extirpate this Execrable Race. I should be very glad your Scheme for Hunting them Down by Dogs could take Effect, but England is at too great a Distance to think of that at present."

Officers at the besieged Fort Pitt had already attempted to do what Amherst and Bouquet were discussing, apparently on their own initiative. During a parley at Fort Pitt on June 24, 1763, Ecuyer gave Delaware representatives, <a href="Turtleheart">Turtleheart</a> and Mamaltee, two blankets and a handkerchief that had been exposed to smallpox, hoping to spread the disease to the Native Americans in order to "extirpate" them from the territory. <a href="William%20Trent">William Trent</a>, the militia commander, left records that showed the purpose of giving the blankets was "to Convey the Smallpox to the Indians." <a href="Turtleheart">Turtleheart</a> and <a href="Bemino">Killbuck</a> would later represent the Delaware at the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Stanwix">Treaty of Fort Stanwix</a> in 1768.

On July 22, Trent writes, "Gray Eyes, Wingenum, Turtle's Heart and Mamaultee, came over the River told us their Chiefs were in Council, that they waited for Custaluga who they expected that Day". There are eyewitness reports that outbreaks of smallpox and other diseases had plagued the Ohio Native Americans in the years prior to the siege of Fort Pitt. Colonists also caught smallpox from Native Americans at a peace conference in 1759 which then led to an epidemic in Charleston and the surrounding areas in South Carolina.

Historians are at odds as to how much damage the attempt to spread smallpox at Fort Pitt caused. Historian Francis Jennings concluded that the attempt was "unquestionably successful and effective" and inflicted great damage to the Native Americans. Historian Michael McConnell writes that, "Ironically, British efforts to use pestilence as a weapon may not have been either necessary or particularly effective", noting that smallpox was already entering the territory by several means, and Native Americans were familiar with the disease and adept at isolating the infected. Historians widely agree that smallpox devastated the Native American population.

On August 1, 1763, most of the Native Americans broke off the siege at Fort Pitt in order to intercept 500 British troops marching to the fort under Colonel Bouquet. On August 5, these two forces met at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bushy%20Run">Battle of Bushy Run</a>. Although his force suffered heavy casualties, Bouquet fought off the attack and relieved Fort Pitt on August 20, bringing the siege to an end. His victory at Bushy Run was celebrated in the British colonies—church bells rang through the night in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>—and praised by <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George</a>.

This victory was soon followed by a costly defeat. <a href="Fort%20Niagara">Fort Niagara</a>, one of the most important western forts, was not assaulted, but on September 14, 1763, at least 300 Senecas, Ottawas, and Ojibwas attacked a supply train along the <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a> portage. Two companies sent from Fort Niagara to rescue the supply train were also defeated. More than 70 soldiers and teamsters were killed in these actions, which Anglo-Americans called the "<a href="Battle%20of%20Devil%27s%20Hole">Devil's Hole Massacre</a>", the deadliest engagement for British soldiers during the war.

The violence and terror of Pontiac's War convinced many western Pennsylvanians that their government was not doing enough to protect them. This discontent was manifested most seriously in an uprising led by a <a href="vigilante">vigilante</a> group that came to be known as the <a href="Paxton%20Boys">Paxton Boys</a>, so-called because they were primarily from the area around the Pennsylvania village of Paxton (or <a href="Paxtang%2C%20Pennsylvania">Paxtang</a>). The Paxtonians turned their anger towards Native Americans—many of them Christians—who lived peacefully in small enclaves in the midst of white Pennsylvania settlements. Prompted by rumors that a Native war party had been seen at the Native village of Conestoga, on December 14, 1763, a group of more than 50 Paxton Boys marched on the village and murdered the six <a href="Susquehannock">Susquehannock</a>s they found there. Pennsylvania officials placed the remaining 16 Susquehannocks in protective custody in <a href="Lancaster%2C%20Pennsylvania">Lancaster</a>, but on December 27 the Paxton Boys broke into the jail and slaughtered most of them. Governor <a href="John%20Penn%20%28governor%29">John Penn</a> issued bounties for the arrest of the murderers, but no one came forward to identify them.

The Paxton Boys then set their sights on other Native Americans living within eastern Pennsylvania, many of whom fled to Philadelphia for protection. Several hundred Paxtonians marched on Philadelphia in January 1764, where the presence of British troops and <a href="militia%20%28United%20States%29">Philadelphia militia</a> prevented them from committing more violence. <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>, who had helped organize the local militia, negotiated with the Paxton leaders and brought an end to the immediate crisis. Franklin published a scathing indictment of the Paxton Boys. "If an "Indian" injures me," he asked, "does it follow that I may revenge that Injury on all "Indians"?" One leader of the Paxton Boys was <a href="Lazarus%20Stewart">Lazarus Stewart</a> who would be killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Wyoming">Wyoming Massacre</a> of 1778.

Native American raids on frontier settlements escalated in the spring and summer of 1764. The hardest hit colony that year was Virginia, where more raids occurred on July 26, when four Delaware Indian soldiers killed and scalped a school teacher and ten children in what is now <a href="Franklin%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Franklin County</a>, Pennsylvania. Incidents such as these prompted the Pennsylvania Assembly, with the approval of Governor Penn, to reintroduce the scalp bounties offered during the French and Indian War, which paid money for every Native killed above the age of ten, including women.

General Amherst, held responsible for the uprising by the <a href="Board%20of%20Trade">Board of Trade</a>, was recalled to London in August 1763 and replaced by Major General <a href="Thomas%20Gage">Thomas Gage</a>. In 1764, Gage sent two expeditions into the west to crush the rebellion, rescue British prisoners, and arrest the Native Americans responsible for the war. According to historian <a href="Fred%20Anderson%20%28historian%29">Fred Anderson</a>, Gage's campaign, which had been designed by Amherst, prolonged the war for more than a year because it focused on punishing the Native Americans rather than ending the war. Gage's one significant departure from Amherst's plan was to allow William Johnson to conduct a peace treaty at Niagara, giving those Native Americans who were ready to "bury the hatchet" a chance to do so.

From July to August 1764, Johnson negotiated a <a href="Treaty%20of%20Fort%20Niagara">treaty at Fort Niagara</a> with about 2,000 Native Americans in attendance, primarily Iroquois. Although most Iroquois had stayed out of the war, Senecas from the <a href="Genesee%20River">Genesee River</a> valley had taken up arms against the British, and Johnson worked to bring them back into the <a href="Covenant%20Chain">Covenant Chain</a> alliance. As restitution for the Devil's Hole ambush, the Senecas were compelled to cede the strategically important Niagara portage to the British. Johnson even convinced the Iroquois to send a war party against the Ohio Native Americans. This Iroquois expedition captured a number of Delawares and destroyed abandoned Delaware and Shawnee towns in the <a href="Susquehanna%20River">Susquehanna Valley</a>, but otherwise the Iroquois did not contribute to the war effort as much as Johnson had desired.

Having secured the area around Fort Niagara, the British launched two military expeditions into the west. The first expedition, led by Colonel <a href="John%20Bradstreet">John Bradstreet</a>, was to travel by boat across Lake Erie and reinforce Detroit. Bradstreet was to subdue the Native Americans around Detroit before marching south into the Ohio Country. The second expedition, commanded by Colonel Bouquet, was to march west from Fort Pitt and form a second front in the Ohio Country.

Bradstreet set out from <a href="Fort%20Schlosser">Fort Schlosser</a> in early August 1764 with about 1,200 soldiers and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by <a href="Sir%20William%20Johnson">Sir William Johnson</a>. Bradstreet felt that he did not have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force, and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him to stop at <a href="Fort%20Presque%20Isle">Presque Isle</a> on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.

Bradstreet continued westward, as yet unaware that his unauthorized diplomacy was angering his superiors. He reached Fort Detroit on August 26, where he negotiated another treaty. In an attempt to discredit Pontiac, who was not present, Bradstreet chopped up a peace belt the Ottawa leader had sent to the meeting. According to historian <a href="Richard%20White%20%28historian%29">Richard White</a>, "such an act, roughly equivalent to a European ambassador's urinating on a proposed treaty, had shocked and offended the gathered Indians." Bradstreet also claimed that the Native Americans had accepted British sovereignty as a result of his negotiations, but Johnson believed that this had not been fully explained to the Native Americans and that further councils would be needed. Although Bradstreet had successfully reinforced and reoccupied British forts in the region, his diplomacy proved to be controversial and inconclusive.

Colonel Bouquet, delayed in Pennsylvania while mustering the militia, finally set out from Fort Pitt on October 3, 1764, with 1,150 men. He marched to the <a href="Muskingum%20River">Muskingum River</a> in the Ohio Country, within striking distance of a number of native villages. Now that treaties had been negotiated at Fort Niagara and Fort Detroit, the Ohio Native Americans were isolated and, with some exceptions, ready to make peace. In a council which began on October 17, Bouquet demanded that the Ohio Native Americans return all captives, including those not yet returned from the French and Indian War. Guyasuta and other leaders reluctantly handed over more than 200 captives, many of whom had been adopted into Native families. Because not all of the captives were present, the Native Americans were compelled to surrender hostages as a guarantee that the other captives would be returned. The Ohio Native Americans agreed to attend a more formal peace conference with William Johnson, which was finalized in July 1765.

Although the military conflict essentially ended with the 1764 expeditions, Native Americans still called for resistance in the Illinois Country, where British troops had yet to take possession of <a href="Fort%20de%20Chartres">Fort de Chartres</a> from the French. A Shawnee war chief named <a href="Charlot%20Kask%C3%A9">Charlot Kaské</a> emerged as the most strident anti-British leader in the region, temporarily surpassing Pontiac in influence. Kaské traveled as far south as <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> in an effort to enlist French aid against the British.

In 1765, the British decided that the occupation of the Illinois Country could only be accomplished by diplomatic means. As Gage commented to one of his officers, he was determined to have "none our enemy" among the Indian peoples, and that included Pontiac, to whom he now sent a wampum belt suggesting peace talks. Pontiac had by now become less militant after hearing of Bouquet's truce with the Ohio country Native Americans. Johnson's deputy, <a href="George%20Croghan">George Croghan</a>, accordingly travelled to the Illinois country in the summer of 1765, and although he was injured along the way in an attack by Kickapoos and Mascoutens, he managed to meet and negotiate with Pontiac. While Charlot Kaské wanted to burn Croghan at the stake, Pontiac urged moderation and agreed to travel to New York, where he made a formal treaty with William Johnson at <a href="Fort%20Ontario">Fort Ontario</a> on July 25, 1766. It was hardly a surrender: no lands were ceded, no prisoners returned, and no hostages were taken. Rather than accept British sovereignty, Kaské left British territory by crossing the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> with other French and Native refugees.

The total loss of life resulting from Pontiac's War is unknown. About 400 British soldiers were killed in action and perhaps 50 were captured and tortured to death. George Croghan estimated that 2,000 settlers had been killed or captured, a figure sometimes repeated as 2,000 settlers "killed". The violence compelled approximately 4,000 settlers from Pennsylvania and Virginia to flee their homes. Native American losses went mostly unrecorded.

Pontiac's War has traditionally been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans, but scholars now usually view it as a military stalemate: while the Native Americans had failed to drive away the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.

Relations between British colonists and Native Americans, which had been severely strained during the French and Indian War, reached a new low during Pontiac's Rebellion. According to historian David Dixon, "Pontiac's War was unprecedented for its awful violence, as both sides seemed intoxicated with <a href="genocide">genocidal</a> fanaticism." Historian Daniel Richter characterizes the Native attempt to drive out the British, and the effort of the Paxton Boys to eliminate Native Americans from their midst, as parallel examples of <a href="ethnic%20cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a>. People on both sides of the conflict had come to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans were inherently different and could not live with each other. According to Richter, the war saw the emergence of "the novel idea that all Native people were 'Indians,' that all Euro-Americans were 'Whites,' and that all on one side must unite to destroy the other."

The British government also came to the conclusion that colonists and Native Americans must be kept apart. On October 7, 1763, the Crown issued the <a href="Royal%20Proclamation%20of%201763">Royal Proclamation of 1763</a>, an effort to reorganize <a href="British%20North%20America">British North America</a> after the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281763%29">Treaty of Paris</a>. The Proclamation, already in the works when Pontiac's War erupted, was hurriedly issued after news of the uprising reached London. Officials drew a boundary line between the British colonies along the seaboard, and Native American lands west of the Allegheny Ridge (i.e., the <a href="Eastern%20Divide">Eastern Divide</a>), creating a vast <a href="Indian%20Reserve%20%281763%29">'Indian Reserve'</a> that stretched from the Alleghenies to the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and from <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>. It thus confirmed the antebellum demarcation that had been set by the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Easton">Treaty of Easton</a> in 1758. By forbidding colonists from trespassing on Native lands, the British government hoped to avoid more conflicts like Pontiac's Rebellion. "The Royal Proclamation," writes historian Colin Calloway, "reflected the notion that segregation not interaction should characterize Indian-white relations."

The effects of Pontiac's War were long-lasting. Because the Proclamation officially recognized that indigenous people had certain rights to the lands they occupied, it has been called the Native Americans' "Bill of Rights", and still informs the relationship between the Canadian government and <a href="First%20Nations">First Nations</a>. For British colonists and land speculators, however, the Proclamation seemed to deny them the fruits of victory—western lands—that had been won in the war with France. The resentment which this created undermined colonial attachment to the Empire, contributing to the coming of the <a href="American%20Revolution">American Revolution</a>. According to Colin Calloway, "Pontiac's Revolt was not the last American war for independence—American colonists launched a rather more successful effort a dozen years later, prompted in part by the measures the British government took to try to prevent another war like Pontiac's."

For Native Americans, Pontiac's War demonstrated the possibilities of pan-tribal cooperation in resisting Anglo-American colonial expansion. Although the conflict divided tribes and villages, the war also saw the first extensive multi-tribal resistance to <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">European colonization</a> in North America, and was the first war between Europeans and Native North Americans that did not end in complete defeat for the Native Americans. The Proclamation of 1763 ultimately did not prevent British colonists and land speculators from expanding westward, and so Native Americans found it necessary to form new resistance movements. Beginning with conferences hosted by Shawnees in 1767, in the following decades leaders such as <a href="Joseph%20Brant">Joseph Brant</a>, <a href="Alexander%20McGillivray">Alexander McGillivray</a>, <a href="Blue%20Jacket">Blue Jacket</a>, and <a href="Tecumseh">Tecumseh</a> would attempt to forge confederacies that would revive the resistance efforts of Pontiac's War.

Jack Sheppard

Jack Sheppard (4 March 1702 – 16 November 1724) was a notorious English <a href="Theft">thief</a> and <a href="prison">jail</a>-breaker of early 18th-century <a href="London">London</a>. Born into a poor family, he was <a href="apprentice">apprentice</a>d as a carpenter but took to theft and burglary in 1723, with little more than a year of his training to complete. He was arrested and imprisoned five times in 1724 but <a href="List%20of%20people%20who%20escaped%20multiple%20times%20from%20prison">escaped four times from prison</a>, making him a notorious public figure, and wildly popular with the poorer classes. Ultimately, he was caught, convicted, and <a href="hanging">hanged</a> at <a href="Tyburn%2C%20London">Tyburn</a>, ending his brief criminal career after less than two years. The inability of the notorious "Thief-Taker General" <a href="Jonathan%20Wild">Jonathan Wild</a> to control Sheppard, and injuries suffered by Wild at the hands of Sheppard's colleague, <a href="Joseph%20Blake%20%28criminal%29">Joseph "Blueskin" Blake</a>, led to Wild's downfall.

Sheppard was as renowned for his attempts to escape from prison as he was for his crimes. An <a href="autobiography">autobiographical</a> "Narrative", thought to have been <a href="ghostwriting">ghostwritten</a> by <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, was sold at his execution, quickly followed by popular plays. The character of <a href="Captain%20Macheath">Macheath</a> in <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a>'s "<a href="The%20Beggar%27s%20Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a>" (1728) was based on Sheppard, keeping him in the limelight for over 100 years. He returned to the public consciousness around 1840, when <a href="William%20Harrison%20Ainsworth">William Harrison Ainsworth</a> wrote a novel entitled "<a href="Jack%20Sheppard%20%28novel%29">Jack Sheppard</a>", with illustrations by <a href="George%20Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>. The popularity of his tale, and the fear that others would be drawn to emulate his behaviour, led the authorities to refuse to <a href="Licensing%20Act%201737">license</a> any plays in London with "Jack Sheppard" in the title for forty years.

Sheppard was born in White's Row, in <a href="London">London</a>'s <a href="Spitalfields">Spitalfields</a>. He was baptised on 5 March, the day after he was born, at <a href="St%20Dunstan%27s%2C%20Stepney">St Dunstan's, Stepney</a>, suggesting a fear of <a href="infant%20mortality">infant mortality</a> by his parents, perhaps because the newborn was weak or sickly. His parents named him after an older brother, John, who had died before his birth. In life, he was better known as Jack, or even "Gentleman Jack" or "Jack the Lad". He had a second brother, Thomas, and a younger sister, Mary. Their father, a <a href="carpenter">carpenter</a>, died while Sheppard was young, and his sister died two years later.

Unable to support her family without her husband's income, Jack's mother sent him to Mr Garrett's School, a <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a> near <a href="St%20Helen%27s%20Bishopsgate">St Helen's Bishopsgate</a>, when he was six years old. Sheppard was sent out as a parish apprentice to a cane-chair maker, taking a settlement of 20 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s, but his new master soon died. He was sent out to a second cane-chair maker, but Sheppard was treated badly. Finally, when Sheppard was 10, he went to work as a shop-boy for William Kneebone, a wool <a href="draper">draper</a> with a shop on the <a href="Strand%2C%20London">Strand</a>. Sheppard's mother had been working for Kneebone since her husband's death. Kneebone taught Sheppard to read and write and <a href="apprentice">apprentice</a>d him to a carpenter, Owen Wood, in <a href="Wych%20Street">Wych Street</a>, off <a href="Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a> in <a href="Covent%20Garden">Covent Garden</a>. Sheppard signed his seven-year <a href="indenture">indenture</a> on 2 April 1717.

By 1722, Sheppard was showing great promise as a carpenter. Aged 20, he was a small man, only 5'4" (1.63 m) and lightly built, but deceptively strong. He had a pale face with large, dark eyes, a wide mouth and a quick smile. Despite a slight <a href="stutter">stutter</a>, his wit made him popular in the taverns of Drury Lane. He served five unblemished years of his apprenticeship but then began to be led into crime.

Joseph Hayne, a button-moulder who owned a shop nearby, also ran a <a href="tavern">tavern</a> named the Black Lion off Drury Lane, which he encouraged the local apprentices to frequent. The Black Lion was visited by criminals such as <a href="Joseph%20Blake%20%28criminal%29">Joseph "Blueskin" Blake</a>, Sheppard's future partner in crime, and self-proclaimed "Thief-Taker General" <a href="Jonathan%20Wild">Jonathan Wild</a>, secretly the linchpin of a criminal empire across London and later Sheppard's implacable enemy.

According to Sheppard's autobiography, he had been an innocent until going to Hayne's tavern, but there began an attachment to strong drink and the affections of Elizabeth Lyon, a <a href="prostitute">prostitute</a> also known as Edgworth Bess (or Edgeworth Bess) from her place of birth at <a href="Edgware">Edgeworth</a> in <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>. In his "History", Defoe records that Bess was "a main lodestone in attracting of him up to this Eminence of Guilt." Such, Sheppard claimed, was the source of his later ruin. Peter Linebaugh offers a different view: that Sheppard's sudden transformation was a liberation from the dull drudgery of indentured labour and that he progressed from pious servitude to self-confident rebellion and <a href="Levellers">Levelling</a>.

Sheppard threw himself into a hedonistic whirl of drinking and whoring. Inevitably, his carpentry suffered, and he became disobedient to his master. With Lyon's encouragement, Sheppard took to crime in order to augment his legitimate wages. His first recorded theft was in Spring 1723, when he engaged in petty <a href="shoplifting">shoplifting</a>, stealing two silver spoons while on an errand for his master to Rummer Tavern in <a href="Charing%20Cross">Charing Cross</a>. Sheppard's misdeeds went undetected, and he moved on to larger crimes, often stealing goods from the houses where he was working. Finally, he quit the employ of his master on 2 August 1723, with less than two years of his apprenticeship left, although he continued to work as a <a href="journeyman">journeyman</a> carpenter. He was not suspected of the crimes, and progressed to <a href="burglary">burglary</a>, falling in with criminals in Jonathan Wild's gang.

He moved to <a href="Fulham">Fulham</a>, living as husband and wife with Lyon at <a href="Parsons%20Green">Parsons Green</a>, before moving to <a href="Piccadilly">Piccadilly</a>. When Lyon was arrested and imprisoned at <a href="St%20Giles%27s%20Roundhouse">St Giles's Roundhouse</a>, the <a href="beadle">beadle</a>, a Mr Brown, refused to let Sheppard visit, so he broke in and took her away.

Sheppard was first arrested after a burglary he committed with his brother, Tom, and his mistress, Lyon, in <a href="Clare%20Market">Clare Market</a> on 5 February 1724. Tom, also a carpenter, had already been convicted once for stealing tools from his master the previous autumn and <a href="Human%20branding">burned in the hand</a>. Tom was arrested again on 24 April 1724. Afraid that he would be hanged this time, Tom informed on Jack, and a <a href="Warrant%20%28law%29">warrant</a> was issued for Jack's arrest.

Jonathan Wild was aware of Sheppard's thefts, as Sheppard had <a href="fence%20%28criminal%29">fenced</a> some stolen goods through one of Wild's men, <a href="William%20Field%20%28criminal%29">William Field</a>. Wild asked another of his men, <a href="James%20Sykes%20%28criminal%29">James Sykes</a> (known as "Hell and Fury") to challenge Sheppard to a game of <a href="Skittles%20%28sport%29">skittles</a> at Redgate's public house near <a href="Seven%20Dials%2C%20London">Seven Dials</a>. Sykes betrayed Sheppard to a Mr Price, a <a href="constable">constable</a> from the parish of <a href="St%20Giles%2C%20London">St Giles</a>, to gather the usual £40 reward for giving information leading to the conviction of a <a href="Felony">felon</a>. The magistrate, Justice Parry, had Sheppard imprisoned overnight on the top floor of <a href="St%20Giles%27s%20Roundhouse">St Giles's Roundhouse</a> pending further questioning, but Sheppard escaped within three hours by breaking through the timber ceiling and lowering himself to the ground with a rope fashioned from bedclothes. Still wearing irons, Sheppard coolly joined the crowd that had been attracted by the sounds of him breaking out. He distracted their attention by pointing to the shadows on the roof and shouting that he could see the escapee, and then swiftly departed.

On 19 May 1724, Sheppard was arrested for a second time, caught in the act of <a href="pickpocket">picking a pocket</a> in Leicester Fields (near present-day <a href="Leicester%20Square">Leicester Square</a>). He was detained overnight in <a href="St%20Ann%27s%20Roundhouse">St Ann's Roundhouse</a> in <a href="Soho">Soho</a> and visited there the next day by Lyon; she was recognised as his wife and locked in a cell with him. They appeared before Justice Walters, who sent them to the <a href="New%20Prison">New Prison</a> in <a href="Clerkenwell">Clerkenwell</a>, but they escaped from their cell, known as the Newgate Ward, within a matter of days. By 25 May, <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> Monday, Sheppard and Lyon had filed through their manacles; they removed a bar from the window and used their knotted bed-clothes to descend to ground level. Finding themselves in the yard of the neighbouring <a href="Clerkenwell%20Bridewell">Bridewell</a>, they clambered over the 22-<a href="foot%20%28length%29">foot</a>-high (6.7 m) prison gate to freedom. This feat was widely publicised, not least because Sheppard was only a small man, and Lyon was a large, buxom woman.

Sheppard's thieving abilities were admired by Jonathan Wild. Wild demanded that Sheppard surrender his stolen goods for Wild to fence, and so take the greater profits, but Sheppard refused. He began to work with <a href="Joseph%20Blake%20%28criminal%29">Joseph "Blueskin" Blake</a>, and they burgled Sheppard's former master, William Kneebone, on Sunday 12 July 1724. Wild could not permit Sheppard to continue outside his control and began to seek Sheppard's arrest. Unfortunately for Sheppard, his fence, William Field, was one of Wild's men. After Sheppard had a brief foray with Blueskin as <a href="highwayman">highwaymen</a> on the Hampstead Road on Sunday 19 July and Monday 20 July, Field informed on Sheppard to Wild. Wild believed Lyon would know Sheppard's whereabouts, so he plied her with drinks at a brandy shop near <a href="Temple%20Bar%2C%20London">Temple Bar</a> until she betrayed him. Sheppard was arrested a third time at Blueskin's mother's brandy shop in <a href="Rosemary%20Lane%20%28London%20street%29">Rosemary Lane</a>, east of the <a href="Tower%20of%20London">Tower of London</a> (later renamed <a href="Royal%20Mint%20Street">Royal Mint Street</a>), on 23 July by Wild's henchman, <a href="Quilt%20Arnold">Quilt Arnold</a>.

Sheppard was imprisoned in <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a> pending his trial at the next <a href="Assize">Assize</a> of "<a href="oyer%20and%20terminer">oyer and terminer</a>". He was prosecuted on three charges of theft at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>, but was acquitted on the first two due to lack of evidence. Kneebone, Wild and Field gave evidence against him on the third charge, the burglary of Kneebone's house. He was convicted on 12 August, the case "being plainly prov'd", and sentenced to death. On Monday 31 August, the very day when the <a href="Execution%20warrant">death warrant</a> arrived from the court in <a href="Windsor%2C%20Berkshire">Windsor</a> setting Friday 4 September as the date for his execution, Sheppard escaped. Having loosened an iron bar in a window used when talking to visitors, he was visited by Lyon and Poll Maggott, who distracted the guards while he removed the bar. His slight build enabled him to climb through the resulting gap in the grille, and he was smuggled out of Newgate in women's clothing that his visitors had brought him. He took a coach to <a href="Blackfriars%20Stairs">Blackfriars Stairs</a>, a boat up the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> to the horse ferry in <a href="Westminster">Westminster</a>, near the warehouse where he hid his stolen goods, and made good his escape.

By this point, Sheppard was a <a href="working%20class">working class</a> hero, being a <a href="cockney">cockney</a>, non-violent, handsome and seemingly able to escape punishment for his crimes at will. He spent a few days out of London, visiting a friend's family in <a href="Chipping%20Warden">Chipping Warden</a> in <a href="Northamptonshire">Northamptonshire</a>, but was soon back in town. He evaded capture by Wild and his men but was arrested again on 9 September by a posse from Newgate as he hid out on <a href="Finchley%20Common">Finchley Common</a>, and returned to the condemned cell at Newgate. His fame had increased with each escape, and he was visited in prison by the great, the good and the curious. His plans to escape in September were thwarted twice when the guards found files and other tools in his cell, and he was transferred to a strong-room in Newgate known as the "Castle", clapped in <a href="leg%20irons">leg irons</a>, and chained to two metal staples in the floor to prevent further escape attempts. After demonstrating to his gaolers that these measures were insufficient, by showing them how he could use a small nail to unlock the horse padlock at will, he was bound more tightly and <a href="handcuffs">handcuffed</a>. In his "History", Defoe reports that Sheppard made light of his predicament, joking that "I am the Sheppard, and all the Gaolers in the Town are my Flock, and I cannot stir into the Country, but they are all at my Heels "Baughing" after me".

Meanwhile, "Blueskin" Blake was arrested by Wild and his men on Friday 9 October, and Tom, Jack's brother, was <a href="penal%20transportation">transported</a> for robbery on Saturday 10 October 1724. New court sessions began on Wednesday 14 October, and Blueskin was tried on Thursday 15 October, with Field and Wild again giving evidence. Their accounts were not consistent with the evidence that they gave at Sheppard's trial, but Blueskin was convicted anyway. Enraged, Blueskin attacked Wild in the courtroom, slashing his throat with a pocket-knife and causing an uproar. Wild was lucky to survive, and his grip over his criminal empire started to slip while he recuperated.

Taking advantage of the disturbance, which spread to Newgate Prison next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped for the fourth time. He unlocked his handcuffs and removed the chains. Still encumbered by his leg irons, he attempted to climb up the chimney, but his path was blocked by an iron bar set into the brickwork. He removed the bar and used it to break through the ceiling into the "Red Room" above the "Castle", a room which had last been used some seven years before to confine aristocratic <a href="Jacobitism">Jacobite</a> prisoners after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Preston%20%281715%29">Battle of Preston</a>. Still wearing his leg irons as night fell, he then broke through six barred doors into the prison chapel, then to the roof of Newgate, 60 feet (20 m) above the ground. He went back down to his cell to get a blanket, then back to the roof of the prison, and used the blanket to reach the roof of an adjacent house, owned by William Bird, a turner. He broke into Bird's house, and went down the stairs and out into the street at around midnight without disturbing the occupants. Escaping through the streets to the north and west, Sheppard hid in a cowshed in <a href="Tottenham">Tottenham</a> (near modern <a href="Tottenham%20Court%20Road">Tottenham Court Road</a>). Spotted by the barn's owner, Sheppard told him that he had escaped from <a href="Bridewell%20Prison">Bridewell Prison</a>, having been imprisoned there for failing to support a (nonexistent) bastard son. His leg irons remained in place for several days until he persuaded a passing shoemaker to accept the considerable sum of 20 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s to bring a blacksmith's tools and help him remove them, telling him the same tale. His manacles and leg irons were later recovered in the rooms of Kate Cook, one of Sheppard's mistresses. This escape astonished everyone. <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a>, working as a <a href="journalist">journalist</a>, wrote an account for John Applebee, "The History of the Remarkable Life of John Sheppard". In his "History", Defoe reports the belief in Newgate that the Devil came in person to assist Sheppard's escape.

Sheppard's final period of liberty lasted just two weeks. He disguised himself as a beggar and returned to the city. He broke into the Rawlins brothers' <a href="pawnbroker">pawnbroker</a>'s shop in Drury Lane on the night of 29 October 1724, taking a black silk suit, a silver sword, rings, watches, a wig, and other items. He dressed himself as a dandy gentleman and used the proceeds to spend a day and the following evening on the tiles with two mistresses. He was arrested a final time in the early morning on 1 November, blind drunk, "in a handsome Suit of Black, with a Diamond Ring and a <a href="carnelian">carnelian</a> ring on his Finger, and a fine <a href="Peruke">Light Tye Peruke</a>".

This time, Sheppard was placed in the Middle Stone Room, in the centre of Newgate next to the "Castle", where he could be observed at all times. He was also loaded with 300 <a href="pound%20%28mass%29">pounds</a> of iron weights. He was so celebrated that the gaolers charged high society visitors four shillings to see him, and the King's painter <a href="James%20Thornhill">James Thornhill</a> painted his portrait. Several prominent people sent a petition to King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>, begging for his sentence of death to be commuted to <a href="penal%20transportation">transportation</a>. "The Concourse of People of tolerable Fashion to see him was exceeding Great, he was always Chearful and Pleasant to a Degree, as turning almost everything as was said onto a Jest and Banter." To a Reverend Wagstaffe who visited him, he said, according to Defoe, "One file's worth all the Bibles in the World".

Sheppard came before Mr Justice Powis in the <a href="Court%20of%20King%27s%20Bench">Court of King's Bench</a> at <a href="Westminster%20Hall">Westminster Hall</a> on 10 November. He was offered the chance to have his sentence reduced by informing on his associates, but he scorned the offer, and the death sentence was confirmed. The next day, Blueskin was hanged, and Sheppard was moved to the condemned cell.

The following Monday, 16 November, Sheppard was taken to the <a href="gallows">gallows</a> at <a href="Tyburn">Tyburn</a> to be <a href="hanging">hanged</a>. He planned one more escape, but his <a href="pen-knife">pen-knife</a>, intended to cut the ropes binding him on the way to the gallows, was found by a prison warder shortly before he left Newgate for the last time.

A joyous procession passed through the streets of London, with Sheppard's cart drawn along <a href="Holborn">Holborn</a> and <a href="Oxford%20Street">Oxford Street</a> accompanied by a mounted <a href="City%20Marshal">City Marshal</a> and <a href="livery">liveried</a> <a href="Javelin%20Men">Javelin Men</a>. The occasion was as much as anything a celebration of Sheppard's life, attended by crowds of up to 200,000 (one third of London's population). The procession halted at the City of Oxford tavern on Oxford Street, where Sheppard drank a pint of <a href="Sherry">sack</a>. A carnival atmosphere pervaded Tyburn, where his "official" autobiography, published by Applebee and probably ghostwritten by Defoe, was on sale. Sheppard handed "a paper to someone as he mounted the scaffold", perhaps as a symbolic endorsement of the account in the "Narrative". His slight build had aided his previous prison escapes, but it condemned him to a slow death by <a href="strangulation">strangulation</a> from the <a href="hangman%27s%20noose">hangman's noose</a>. After hanging for the prescribed 15 minutes, his body was cut down. The crowd pressed forward to stop his body from being removed, fearing <a href="dissection">dissection</a>; their actions inadvertently prevented Sheppard's friends from implementing a plan to take his body to a doctor in an attempt to revive him. His badly mauled remains were recovered later and buried in the churchyard of <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a> that evening.

There was a spectacular public reaction to Sheppard's deeds. He was even cited (favourably) as an example in newspapers, pamphlets, broadsheets, and ballads were all devoted to his amazing exploits, and his story was adapted for the stage almost immediately. "Harlequin Sheppard", a <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> by one <a href="John%20Thurmond">John Thurmond</a> (subtitled "A night scene in grotesque characters"), opened at the <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Theatre Royal, Drury Lane</a> on Saturday 28 November, only two weeks after Sheppard's hanging. In a famous contemporary sermon, a London preacher drew on Sheppard's popular escapes as a way of holding his congregation's attention:

The account of his life remained well-known through the "<a href="Newgate%20Calendar">Newgate Calendar</a>", and a three-act farce was published but never produced, but, mixed with songs, it became "<a href="The%20Quaker%27s%20Opera">The Quaker's Opera</a>", later performed at <a href="Bartholomew%20Fair">Bartholomew Fair</a>. An imagined dialogue between Jack Sheppard and <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> was published in the "<a href="British%20Journal">British Journal</a>" on 4 December 1724, in which Sheppard favourably compares his virtues and exploits to those of Caesar.

Perhaps the most prominent play based on Sheppard's life is <a href="John%20Gay">John Gay</a>'s "<a href="The%20Beggar%27s%20Opera">The Beggar's Opera</a>" (1728). Sheppard was the inspiration for the figure of <a href="Captain%20Macheath">Macheath</a>; his nemesis, Peachum, is based on Jonathan Wild. The play was spectacularly popular, restoring the fortune that Gay had lost in the <a href="South%20Sea%20Bubble">South Sea Bubble</a>, and was produced regularly for over 100 years. An unperformed but published play "The Prison-Breaker" was turned into "The Quaker's Opera" (in imitation of "The Beggar's Opera") and performed at <a href="Bartholomew%20Fair">Bartholomew Fair</a> in 1725 and 1728. Two centuries later "The Beggar's Opera" was the basis for "<a href="The%20Threepenny%20Opera">The Threepenny Opera</a>" of <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Bertolt Brecht</a> and <a href="Kurt%20Weill">Kurt Weill</a> (1928).

Sheppard's tale may have been an inspiration for <a href="William%20Hogarth">William Hogarth</a>'s 1747 series of 12 <a href="engraving">engraving</a>s, "<a href="Industry%20and%20Idleness">Industry and Idleness</a>", which shows the parallel descent of an apprentice, Tom Idle, into crime and eventually to the gallows, beside the rise of his fellow apprentice, Francis Goodchild, who marries his master's daughter and takes over his business, becoming wealthy as a result, eventually emulating <a href="Dick%20Whittington">Dick Whittington</a> to become <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20London">Lord Mayor of London</a>.

Sheppard's tale was revived in the first half of the 19th century. A <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a>, "Jack Sheppard, The Housebreaker, or London in 1724", by <a href="W.%20T.%20Moncrieff">W. T. Moncrieff</a> was published in 1825. More successful was <a href="William%20Harrison%20Ainsworth">William Harrison Ainsworth</a>'s third novel, entitled "Jack Sheppard", which was originally published in "<a href="Bentley%27s%20Miscellany">Bentley's Miscellany</a>" from January 1839 with illustrations by <a href="George%20Cruikshank">George Cruikshank</a>, overlapping with the final episodes of <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a>' "<a href="Oliver%20Twist">Oliver Twist</a>". An archetypal <a href="Newgate%20novel">Newgate novel</a>, it generally remains close to the facts of Sheppard's life, but portrays him as a swashbuckling hero. Like Hogarth's prints, the novel pairs the descent of the "idle" apprentice into crime with the rise of a typical melodramatic character, Thames Darrell, a foundling of aristocratic birth who defeats his evil uncle to recover his fortune. Cruikshank's images perfectly complemented Ainsworth's tale—<a href="William%20Makepeace%20Thackeray">Thackeray</a> wrote that "...Mr Cruickshank really created the tale, and that Mr Ainsworth, as it were, only put words to it." The novel quickly became very popular: it was published in book form later that year, before the serialised version was completed, and even outsold early editions of "Oliver Twist". Ainsworth's novel was adapted into a successful play by <a href="John%20Buckstone">John Buckstone</a> in October 1839 at the <a href="Adelphi%20Theatre">Adelphi Theatre</a> starring (strangely enough) <a href="Mary%20Anne%20Keeley">Mary Anne Keeley</a>; indeed, it seems likely that Cruikshank's illustrations were deliberately created in a form that were informed by, and would be easy to repeat as, <a href="Tableau%20vivant">tableaux</a> on stage. It has been described as the "exemplary climax" of "the pictorial novel dramatized pictorially".

The story generated a form of cultural mania, embellished by pamphlets, prints, cartoons, plays and souvenirs, not repeated until <a href="George%20du%20Maurier">George du Maurier</a>'s "<a href="Trilby%20%28novel%29">Trilby</a>" in 1895. By early 1840, a <a href="Thieves%27%20cant">cant</a> song from Buckstone's play, "Nix My Dolly, Pals, Fake Away" was reported to be "deafening us in the streets". Public alarm at the possibility that young people would emulate Sheppard's behaviour led the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain">Lord Chamberlain</a> to ban, at least in London, the <a href="Licensing%20Act%201737">licensing</a> of any plays with "Jack Sheppard" in the title for forty years. The fear may not have been entirely unfounded: Courvousier, the valet of <a href="Lord%20William%20Russell%20%28aristocrat%29">Lord William Russell</a>, claimed in one of his several confessions that the book had inspired him to murder his master. <a href="Frank%20James">Frank</a> and <a href="Jesse%20James">Jesse James</a> wrote letters to the "Kansas City Star" signed "Jack Sheppard". Nevertheless, <a href="Victorian%20burlesque">burlesques</a> of the story were written after the ban was lifted, including a popular <a href="Gaiety%20Theatre%2C%20London">Gaiety Theatre, London</a> piece called "<a href="Little%20Jack%20Sheppard">Little Jack Sheppard</a>" (1886) by <a href="Henry%20Pottinger%20Stephens">Henry Pottinger Stephens</a> and William Yardley, which starred <a href="Nellie%20Farren">Nellie Farren</a> as Jack.

The Sheppard story has been revived three times on film in the 20th century: "The Hairbreadth Escape of Jack Sheppard" (1900), "Jack Sheppard" (1923), and "<a href="Where%27s%20Jack%3F">Where's Jack?</a>" (1969), a British costume drama directed by <a href="James%20Clavell">James Clavell</a> with <a href="Tommy%20Steele">Tommy Steele</a> in the title role. <a href="Jake%20Arnott">Jake Arnott</a> features him in his 2017 novel "The Fatal Tree". In "Confessions of the Fox", a 2018 novel by Jordy Rosenberg, the Sheppard story was recontextualized as a <a href="Gay%20literature">queer narrative</a>.

In 1971 British <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a> band <a href="Chicory%20Tip">Chicory Tip</a> paid tribute to Sheppard in "Don't Hang Jack", the <a href="B-side">B-side</a> to "<a href="I%20Love%20Onions">I Love Onions</a>". The song, apparently sung from the viewpoint of a witness in the <a href="courtroom">courtroom</a>, describes Jack's daring exploits as a thief, and futilely begs the judge to spare Sheppard because he was loved by the women of the town, and idolised by the lads who "made him their king."

The reasons for the lasting legacy of Jack Sheppard's exploits in the popular imagination have been addressed by Peter Linebaugh, who suggests that Sheppard's legend was rooted in the prospect of excarceration, of escape from what <a href="Michel%20Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> in "<a href="Madness%20and%20Civilization">Folie et déraison</a>" called the "grand renfermement" ("Great Confinement"), in which "unreasonable" members of the population were locked away and institutionalised. The laws levelled at Sheppard and similar working class criminals were a means of disciplining a potentially rebellious multitude into accepting increasingly harsh property laws. A nineteenth-century view on the Jack Sheppard phenomenon was offered by <a href="Charles%20Mackay%20%28author%29">Charles Mackay</a> in "<a href="Extraordinary%20Popular%20Delusions%20and%20the%20Madness%20of%20Crowds">Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds</a>":

St. Johns River

The St. Johns River () is the longest river in the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and its most significant one for commercial and recreational use. At long, it flows north and winds through or borders twelve counties. The drop in elevation from headwaters to mouth is less than ; like most Florida waterways, the St. Johns has a very low flow rate and is often described as "lazy". Numerous lakes are formed by the river or flow into it, but as a river its widest point is nearly across. The narrowest point is in the headwaters, an unnavigable marsh in <a href="Indian%20River%20County%2C%20FL">Indian River County</a>. The St. Johns drainage basin of includes some of Florida's major wetlands. It is separated into three major basins and two associated watersheds for <a href="Lake%20George%20%28Florida%29">Lake George</a> and the <a href="Ocklawaha%20River">Ocklawaha River</a>, all managed by the <a href="St.%20Johns%20River%20Water%20Management%20District">St. Johns River Water Management District</a>.

A variety of people have lived on or near the St. Johns, including <a href="Paleo-indian">Paleo-indian</a>s, <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20the%20Americas">Archaic people</a>, <a href="Timucua">Timucua</a>, <a href="Mocama">Mocama</a>, French and Spanish settlers, <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a>s, slaves and freemen, <a href="Florida%20cracker">Florida cracker</a>s, land developers, tourists and retirees. It has been the subject of <a href="William%20Bartram">William Bartram</a>'s journals, <a href="Marjorie%20Kinnan%20Rawlings">Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings</a>' books, and <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a>'s letters home. Although Florida was the location of the first permanent European settlement in what would become the United States, it was the last U.S. territory on the east coast to be developed; it remained an undeveloped frontier into the 20th century. When attention was turned to the state, however, much of the land was rapidly overdeveloped in a national zeal for progress. The St. Johns, like many Florida rivers, was altered to make way for agricultural and residential centers. It suffered severe pollution and human interference that has diminished the natural order of life in and around the river. In all, 3.5 million people live within the various watersheds that feed into the St. Johns River. The St. Johns, named one of 14 <a href="American%20Heritage%20River">American Heritage River</a>s in 1998, was number 6 on a list of America's Ten Most Endangered Rivers in 2008. Restoration efforts are under way for the basins around the St. Johns as Florida continues to deal with population increases in the river's vicinity.

Starting in Indian River County and meeting the Atlantic Ocean at <a href="Duval%20County%2C%20Florida">Duval County</a>, the St. Johns is Florida's primary commercial and recreational waterway. It flows north from its headwaters, originating in the direction of the Lake Wales Ridge, which is only slightly elevated at above sea level. Because of this low elevation drop, the river has a long <a href="Backwater%20%28river%29">backwater</a>. It ebbs and flows with tides that pass through the barrier islands and up the channel. Uniquely, it shares the same regional terrain as the parallel <a href="Kissimmee%20River">Kissimmee River</a>, although the Kissimmee flows south.

The St. Johns River is separated into three basins and two associated watersheds managed by the <a href="St.%20Johns%20River%20Water%20Management%20District">St. Johns River Water Management District</a>. Because the river flows in a northerly direction, the upper basin is located in the headwaters of the river at its southernmost point. Indian River County is where the river begins as a network of marshes, at a point west of <a href="Vero%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Vero Beach</a> aptly named the St. Johns Marsh in central Florida. The St. Johns River is a <a href="blackwater%20river">blackwater stream</a>, meaning that it is fed primarily by swamps and marshes lying beneath it; water seeps through the sandy soil and collects in a slight valley. The upper basin measures approximately ; the St. Johns transforms into a navigable waterway in <a href="Brevard%20County%2C%20Florida">Brevard County</a>. The river touches on the borders of <a href="Osceola%20County%2C%20Florida">Osceola</a> and <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20Florida">Orange Counties</a>, and flows through the southeast tip of <a href="Seminole%20County%2C%20Florida">Seminole County</a>, transitioning into its middle basin a dozen miles (19 km) or so north of <a href="Titusville%2C%20Florida">Titusville</a>.

The upper basin of the St. Johns was significantly lowered in the 1920s with the establishment of the Melbourne Tillman drainage project. This drained the St. Johns' headwaters eastward to the Indian River through canals dug across the Ten-Mile Ridge near Palm Bay. As of 2015, these past diversions are being partially reversed through the first phase of the Canal 1 Rediversion project.

The river is at its narrowest and most unpredictable in this basin. Channel flows are not apparent and are usually unmarked. The most efficient way to travel on this part of the river is by <a href="airboat">airboat</a>. Approximately 3,500 lakes lie within the overall St. Johns watershed; all are shallow, with maximum depths between . The river flows into many of the lakes, which further confuses navigation. Eight larger lakes and five smaller ones lie in the upper basin; one of the first is named <a href="Lake%20Hell%20%27n%20Blazes">Lake Hell 'n Blazes</a> (sometimes polished to read as Lake Helen or Hellen Blazes), referencing oaths yelled by boatmen and fishermen in the early 19th century, frustrated when trying to navigate through floating islands of <a href="macrophyte">macrophyte</a>s, or muck and weeds, as the islands changed location with the creeping flow. <a href="Lake%20Washington%20%28Florida%29">Lakes Washington</a>, <a href="Lake%20Winder">Winder</a>, and <a href="Lake%20Poinsett%20%28Florida%29">Poinsett</a>— named for <a href="Joel%20Roberts%20Poinsett">Joel Roberts Poinsett</a>, a diplomat who brought the <a href="poinsettia">poinsettia</a> to the United States— are located further along this stretch of the river. The northernmost points of the upper basin contain the <a href="Tosohatchee%20Wildlife%20Management%20Area">Tosohatchee Wildlife Management Area</a>, created in 1977 to assist with filtration of waters flowing into the larger St. Johns.

Wetlands in the upper and middle basin are fed by rainwater, trapped by the structure of the surrounding land. It is an oxygen- and nutrient-poor environment; what grows usually does so in <a href="peat">peat</a> which is created by centuries of decaying plant material. Water levels fluctuate with the subtropical wet and dry seasons. Rain in central and north Florida occurs seasonally during summer and winter, but farther south rain in winter is rare. All plants in these basins must tolerate water fluctuation, both flooding and drought. Sweetbay ("<a href="Magnolia%20virginiana">Magnolia virginiana</a>"), cypress ("<a href="Taxodium">Taxodium</a>"), and swamp tupelo ("<a href="Nyssa%20biflora">Nyssa biflora</a>") trees often find great success in this region on raised land called <a href="hammock%20%28ecology%29">hammocks</a>. Trees that live in water for long periods usually have buttressed trunks, tangled, braided roots, or protrusions like cypress knees to obtain oxygen when under water, but the majority of plant life is aquatic. Wetland staples include the American white waterlily ("<a href="Nymphaea%20odorata">Nymphaea odorata</a>"), <a href="pitcher%20plant">pitcher plant</a>s, and Virginia iris ("<a href="Iris%20virginica">Iris virginica</a>"). In the southernmost points of the river, "<a href="Cladium">Cladium</a>", or sawgrass, grows in vast swaths of wet prairie that at one time extended into the <a href="Everglades">Everglades</a>. These wetland flora are remarkably successful in filtering pollutants that otherwise find their way into the river.

For the river passes through a basin fed primarily by springs and stormwater runoff. This basin, spreading throughout Orange, <a href="Lake%20County%2C%20Florida">Lake</a>, <a href="Volusia%20County%2C%20Florida">Volusia</a>, and Seminole Counties, is home to the greater <a href="Orlando%2C%20Florida">Orlando</a> metropolitan area, where two million people live and major tourist attractions are located. The topography of the middle basin varies between clearly distinguishable banks along the river and broad, shallow lakes. Two of the largest lakes in the middle basin are created by the river: <a href="Lake%20Harney">Lake Harney</a> and Lake Monroe. The shallow Lake Harney is fed by the long narrow <a href="Puzzle%20Lake">Puzzle Lake</a>; immediately north is the <a href="Econlockhatchee%20River">Econlockhatchee River</a>, which joins to increase the volume of the St. Johns to where navigation becomes easier for larger boats. The river veers west, touching on <a href="Lake%20Jesup">Lake Jesup</a> before it empties into <a href="Lake%20Monroe%20%28Florida%29">Lake Monroe</a>, passing the city of <a href="Sanford%2C%20Florida">Sanford</a>. It is at this point that the St. Johns' navigable waterway dredged and maintained by the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> with channel markers maintained by the <a href="U.S.%20Coast%20Guard">U.S. Coast Guard</a> begins. Lake Monroe, a large lake at with an average depth of , drains a surrounding watershed of . Sanford has adapted to the lake by building some of its downtown area on the waterfront; citizens use boat transportation and Sanford's public dock to commute into town.

Optimally an deep channel about wide after leaving Lake Monroe, the St. Johns meets its most significant <a href="tributary">tributary</a> in the middle basin, the spring-fed <a href="Wekiva%20River">Wekiva River</a>, discharging approximately a day into the St. Johns. Near this confluence are the towns of <a href="DeBary%2C%20Florida">DeBary</a> and <a href="Deltona%2C%20Florida">Deltona</a>. Forests surrounding the Wekiva River are home to the largest black bear ("<a href="Ursus%20americanus%20floridanus">Ursus americanus floridanus</a>") population in Florida; several troops of Rhesus monkeys ("<a href="Macaca%20mulatta">Macaca mulatta</a>") have adapted to live near the river as well. The monkeys' introduction to Florida is unclear; they were reportedly brought either to serve in backdrop scenes of <a href="Tarzan">Tarzan</a> movies filmed around the <a href="Silver%20River%20%28Florida%29">Silver River</a> in the 1930s, or to lend an air of authenticity to "jungle cruises" provided by an enterprising boat operator around the same time.

Of most vital importance to marshes are invertebrate animals, the foundation of <a href="food%20webs">food webs</a>. Amphibious invertebrates such as apple snails ("<a href="Pomacea%20paludosa">Pomacea paludosa</a>"), <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a>, and <a href="Palaemonetes">grass shrimp</a> consume plant material, hastening its decomposition and acting as a food source for fish and birds. Insect larvae use water for breeding, feeding upon smaller <a href="copepod">copepod</a>s and <a href="amphipod">amphipod</a>s that live in microscopic <a href="algae">algae</a> and <a href="periphyton">periphyton</a> formations. <a href="Mosquito">Mosquito</a>s, born in water, are in turn the favorite food of 112 species of <a href="dragonflies">dragonflies</a> and 44 species of <a href="damselflies">damselflies</a> in Florida. These animals are water hardy and adaptable to dry conditions when water levels fluctuate from one season to the next or through drought and flood cycles.

Of vertebrates, numerous species of frog, salamander, snake, turtle, and alligator ("<a href="Alligator%20mississippiensis">Alligator mississippiensis</a>") proliferate in marsh waters. Most of these animals are active at night. Frog choruses are overwhelming; during alligator mating season the grunts of bulls join in. The marshes around the St. Johns River upper basin teem with birds. A recent study counted 60,000 birds in one month, nesting or feeding in the upper basin. Wading and water birds like the white ibis ("<a href="Eudocimus%20albus">Eudocimus albus</a>"), wood stork ("<a href="Mycteria%20americana">Mycteria americana</a>"), and purple gallinule ("<a href="Porphyrio%20martinicus">Porphyrio martinicus</a>") depend on the water for raising their young: they prey upon small fish and tadpoles in shallow water and puddles in the dry season. In successful seasons, their colonies can number in the thousands, creating a cacophony of calls and fertilizing trees with their droppings.

The river turns north again as it rolls through a basin spreading across <a href="Putnam%20County%2C%20Florida">Putnam</a>, Lake, and <a href="Marion%20County%2C%20Florida">Marion Counties</a>, and the western part of Volusia County. Slightly north of the Wekiva River is Blue Spring, the largest <a href="spring%20%28hydrosphere%29">spring</a> on the St. Johns, producing over a day. Florida springs stay at an even temperature of throughout the year. Because of this, Blue Spring is the winter home for West Indian manatees ("<a href="Trichechus%20manatus">Trichechus manatus</a> latirostris"), and they are protected within <a href="Blue%20Spring%20State%20Park">Blue Spring State Park</a>. Manatees are large, slow-moving herbivorous aquatic mammals whose primary threats are human development and collisions with swiftly moving watercraft. Many parts of the St. Johns and its tributaries are <a href="wake">no-wake zones</a> to protect manatees from being critically or fatally injured by boat propellers. Human interaction with manatees in Blue Spring State Park is forbidden.

Bordering to the north of Blue Spring State Park is <a href="Hontoon%20Island%20State%20Park">Hontoon Island State Park</a>, accessible only by boat. In 1955 an extremely rare <a href="Timucua">Timucua</a> <a href="totem">totem</a> representing an owl was found buried and preserved in the St. Johns muck off of <a href="Hontoon%20Island">Hontoon Island</a>. The figure may signify that its creators were part of the owl clan. Representing different clans of the Timucua, two more totems—in all, the only totems in North America to have been found outside of the Pacific Northwest—shaped like a pelican and otter were found in 1978 after being snagged by a barge at the bottom of the river. River otters ("<a href="Lutra%20canadensis">Lutra canadensis</a>") can be found through the length of the St. Johns and its tributaries, living in burrows or in the roots of trees bordering waterways. They eat crayfish, turtles, and small fish, and are active usually at night, playful but shy of human contact.

The St. Johns creeps into the southern tip of <a href="Lake%20George%20%28Florida%29">Lake George</a>, the second largest lake in Florida at , wide and long. The watershed surrounding Lake George expands through , lying within <a href="Ocala%20National%20Forest">Ocala National Forest</a> and <a href="Lake%20George%20State%20Forest">Lake George State Forest</a>, that protect an ecosystem dominated by pine and scrub more than and in size, respectively. Flatwoods forests dominate the Lake George watershed, with slash pines ("<a href="Pinus%20elliottii">Pinus elliottii</a>"), saw palmetto ("<a href="Serenoa%20repens">Serenoa repens</a>"), and over 100 species of groundcover or herbal plants that grow in poor, sandy soil. Flatwoods pine forests stay relatively dry, but can withstand short periods of flooding. Larger land animals such as wild turkeys ("<a href="Meleagris%20gallopavo">Meleagris gallopavo</a>"), sandhill cranes ("<a href="Grus%20canadensis">Grus canadensis</a>"), and the largest population of southern bald eagles ("<a href="Haliaeetus%20leucocephalus">Haliaeetus leucocephalus</a> leucocephalus") in the contiguous U.S, find it easier to live in the flatwoods. Typical mammals that live in these ecosystems, such as raccoons ("<a href="Procyon%20lotor">Procyon lotor</a>"), opossums ("<a href="Didelphis%20virginiana">Didelphis virginiana</a>"), bobcats ("<a href="Lynx%20rufus">Lynx rufus</a>"), and white tailed-deer ("<a href="Odocoileus%20virginianus">Odocoileus virginianus</a>"), are ones that prefer dry, flat areas with good ground cover and available nesting sites.

The <a href="Ocklawaha%20River">Ocklawaha River</a> flows north and joins the St. Johns as the largest tributary, and one of significant historical importance. The Ocklawaha (also printed as Oklawaha) drainage basin expands through Orange, Lake, Marion, and <a href="Alachua%20County%2C%20Florida">Alachua</a> Counties, comprising a total of . <a href="Ocala%2C%20Florida">Ocala</a>, <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville</a>, and the northern suburbs of the Orlando metropolitan area are included in this basin. There are two headwaters for the Ocklawaha: a chain of lakes, the largest of which is <a href="Lake%20Apopka">Lake Apopka</a> in Lake County, and the <a href="Green%20Swamp%20%28Florida%29">Green Swamp</a> near <a href="Haines%20City%2C%20Florida">Haines City</a> in <a href="Polk%20County%2C%20Florida">Polk County</a>, drained by the <a href="Palatlakaha%20River">Palatlakaha River</a>. The Silver River, fed by one of Florida's most productive springs expelling daily, is located about midway along the Ocklawaha.

<a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate Captain</a> <a href="John%20William%20Pearson">John William Pearson</a> named his militia after the <a href="Ocklawaha%20River">Ocklawaha River</a> called the Ocklawaha Rangers in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. Prior to the civil war, Pearson ran a successful health resort in <a href="Orange%20Springs%2C%20Florida">Orange Springs</a>. After the civil war Pearson's Orange Springs resort declined in popularity due to the increasing attention to nearby <a href="Silver%20Springs%2C%20Florida">Silver Springs</a>—the source of the Silver River—at the turn of the 20th century, popularizing the Ocklawaha. Georgia-born poet <a href="Sidney%20Lanier">Sidney Lanier</a> called it "the sweetest waterlane in the world" in a travel guide he published in 1876. The river gave <a href="Marjorie%20Kinnan%20Rawlings">Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings</a> access to the St. Johns from her homestead at <a href="Orange%20Lake%2C%20Florida">Orange Lake</a>. The region served as a major fishing attraction until a decline in water quality occurred in the 1940s, and since then further degradation of the river and its sources have occurred. In particular, <a href="Lake%20Apopka">Lake Apopka</a> earned the designation of Florida's most polluted lake following a chemical spill in 1980 that dumped <a href="Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene">DDE</a> in it. It has experienced chronic <a href="algal%20bloom">algal bloom</a>s caused by citrus farm fertilizer and wastewater runoff from nearby farms.
The proliferation of largemouth bass ("<a href="Micropterus%20salmoides">Micropterus salmoides</a>"), black crappie ("<a href="Pomoxis%20nigromaculatus">Pomoxis nigromaculatus</a>"), and bluegill ("<a href="Lepomis%20macrochirus">Lepomis macrochirus</a>") in central Florida is a major attraction for fishermen from all over the country. The St. Johns is home to 183 species of fish, 55 of which appear in the main stem of the river. One, the southern tessellated darter ("<a href="Etheostoma%20olmstedi">Etheostoma olmstedi</a>") is found only in the Ocklawaha. Some are marine species that either migrate upriver to spawn or have found spring-fed habitats that are high in salinity, such as a colony of Atlantic stingrays ("<a href="Dasyatis%20sabina">Dasyatis sabina</a>") that live in Lake Washington in the upper basin. Ocean worms, snails, and white-fingered mud crabs ("<a href="Rhithropanopeus%20harrisii">Rhithropanopeus harrisii</a>") have also been found far upriver where tidal influences are rare. In contrast, American eels ("<a href="Anguilla%20rostrata">Anguilla rostrata</a>") live in the St. Johns and Ocklawaha and spawn in the <a href="Sargasso%20Sea">Sargasso Sea</a> in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. After a year living in the ocean, many of them <a href="fish%20migration">find their way back</a> to the St. Johns to live, then, prompted by the phases of the moon, make the return journey to spawn and die.

From the intersection of the Ocklawaha River, to the Atlantic Ocean, the St. Johns lies within the lower basin, draining a total area of in Putnam, <a href="St.%20Johns%20County%2C%20Florida">St. Johns</a>, <a href="Clay%20County%2C%20Florida">Clay</a>, and Duval Counties. Twelve tributaries empty into the river in the lower basin. The St. Johns River widens considerably on the north end of Lake George; between Lake George and Palatka the river ranges between wide. Between Palatka and Jacksonville, that widens further to between . This portion of the river is the most navigable and shipping is its primary use. The <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">Army Corps of Engineers</a> maintains shipping channels at least deep and wide. North of Jacksonville, the channels are expanded to deep and between wide.

The towns and cities along the lower basin of the river are some of the oldest in Florida, and their histories have centered on the river. Both Palatka and Green Cove Springs have been popular tourist destinations in the past. Several smaller locations along the river sprang up around ferry landings, but when rail lines and then <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate highways</a> were constructed closer to the Atlantic Coast, many of the towns experienced significant economic decline, and ferry landings were forgotten.

The final of the river's course runs through Jacksonville with a population of more than a million. Much of the economic base of Jacksonville depends on the river: of goods are shipped in and out of Jacksonville annually. Exports include paper, phosphate, fertilizers, and citrus, while major imports include oil, coffee, limestone, cars, and lumber. The Port of Jacksonville produces $1.38 billion in the local economy and supports 10,000 jobs. The U.S. Navy has two bases in the Jacksonville area: <a href="Naval%20Station%20Mayport">Naval Station Mayport</a>, at the mouth of the river, serves as the second largest <a href="Fleet%20Forces%20Command">Atlantic Fleet</a> operation and home port in the country. <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20Jacksonville">Naval Air Station Jacksonville</a> is one of the service's largest air installations, home to two air wings and over 150 fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, and the host for one of only two full-fledged Naval Hospitals remaining in Florida.

Using an unofficial nickname of "The River City", Jacksonville has a culture centered on the St. Johns. An annual footrace named the <a href="Gate%20River%20Run">Gate River Run</a> accepts 18,000 participants who travel a course along and over the river twice. The largest <a href="Jacksonville%20Kingfish%20Tournament">kingfishing tournament in the U.S.</a> is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel ("<a href="Scomberomorus%20cavalla">Scomberomorus cavalla</a>"), cobia ("<a href="Rachycentron%20canadum">Rachycentron canadum</a>"), dolphin ("<a href="Coryphaena%20hippurus">Coryphaena hippurus</a>") and Wahoo ("<a href="Acanthocybium%20solandri">Acanthocybium solandri</a>"). The <a href="Jacksonville%20Municipal%20Stadium">home stadium</a> for the <a href="Jacksonville%20Jaguars">Jacksonville Jaguars</a> faces the river, as does most of the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.

Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an <a href="estuarine">estuarine</a> ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet ("<a href="Mullidae">Mullidae</a>"), flounder ("<a href="Paralichthys%20lethostigma">Paralichthys lethostigma</a>"), shad ("<a href="Alosa%20sapidissima">Alosa sapidissima</a>"), and blue crabs ("<a href="Callinectes%20sapidus">Callinectes sapidus</a>") migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.

Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a> and <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> take that role in the estuarine habitat. <a href="Mollusks">Mollusks</a> gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom of the river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters ("<a href="Crassostrea%20virginica">Crassostrea virginica</a>") is apparent in the many <a href="midden">midden</a>s left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees that line the river from its source to south of Jacksonville begin to transition into salt marshes east of the city. <a href="Mayport">Mayport</a> is home to approximately 20 shrimping vessels that use the mouth of the St. Johns to access the Atlantic Ocean.

Lying within a <a href="coastal%20plain">coastal plain</a>, the St. Johns River passes through an area that was at one time barrier islands, coastal dunes, and estuary marshes. The Florida Peninsula was created primarily by forces and minerals from the ocean. It lies so low that minor fluctuations in sea levels can have a dramatic effect on its geomorphology. Florida was once part of the supercontinent <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>. Lying underneath the visible rock formations is a <a href="Basement%20rock">basement</a> of <a href="igneous">igneous</a> <a href="granite">granite</a> and volcanic composition under a sedimentary layer formed during the <a href="Paleozoic%20era">Paleozoic era</a> 542 to 251 million years ago. During the <a href="Cretaceous%20period">Cretaceous period</a> (145 to 66 million years ago), the basement and its sedimentary overlay were further covered by <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> and formations left by the evaporation of water called <a href="evaporites">evaporites</a>. What covers the peninsula is the result of simultaneous processes of deposits of sands, shells, and coral, and erosion from water and weather. As ocean water has retreated and progressed, the peninsula has been covered with sea water at least seven times. Waves compressed sands, calcium carbonate, and shells into <a href="limestone">limestone</a>; at the ocean's edge, beach ridges were created by this depositional forming. North-south axis rivers, such as the St. Johns, were created by past beach ridges which were often divided by <a href="Swale%20%28geographical%20feature%29">swales</a>. As ocean water retreated, <a href="lagoon">lagoon</a>s formed in the swales, which were further eroded by acidic water. <a href="Barrier%20island">Barrier island</a>s, furthermore, formed along the Atlantic Coast, surrounding the lagoon with land and forming a freshwater river.

From its origins to approximately the area of Sanford, the St. Johns flows north. It takes a sharp turn west near Sanford for a few miles—which is referred to as the "St. Johns River offset", but shortly changes direction to flow north again. Geologists hypothesize that the west-flowing offset may have formed earlier than the north flowing portions, possibly during the late <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> or early <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a> era 66 to 12 million years ago. Some fracturing and faulting may also be responsible for the offset. Although seismic activity in Florida is mostly insignificant, several minor earthquakes have occurred near the St. Johns River, caused by the trough created by <a href="Pangaea">Pangaea</a>n <a href="rifting">rifting</a>.

All of Florida's abundant fresh water is the result of precipitation that returns to the atmosphere in a process called <a href="evapotranspiration">evapotranspiration</a> that involves evaporation and transpiration of moisture from plants. As rains fall, most of the water is directed to lakes, streams, and rivers. However, a significant amount of fresh water is held underground but close to the surface in <a href="aquifers">aquifers</a>. A <a href="surficial%20aquifer">surficial aquifer</a> consisting mostly of clay, shells, and sand is over a confining layer of denser materials. Wells are drilled in the surficial aquifer, which supplies better quality water in areas where the deepest aquifer has a high mineral content. Occasionally the confining layer is fractured to allow breaches of water to percolate down to recharge the layer below. The <a href="Floridan%20Aquifer">Floridan Aquifer</a>, underneath the confining layer, underlies the entire state and portions of Georgia, Alabama, and South Carolina. It is particularly accessible in the northern part of Florida, serving as the fresh water source of metropolitan areas from <a href="St.%20Petersburg%2C%20Florida">St. Petersburg</a> north to Jacksonville and <a href="Tallahassee%2C%20Florida">Tallahassee</a>.

Acidic rainwater erodes the limestone and can form underground caverns. When the overlay of these caverns is particularly thin—less than —<a href="sinkhole">sinkhole</a>s can form. Where the limestone or sand/clay overlay dissolves over the aquifer and the pressure of the water pushes out, springs form. The upper and middle basins of the St. Johns River are located in a portion of the peninsula where the aquifer system is thinly confined, meaning springs and sinkholes are abundant. Springs are measured in magnitude of how much water is discharged, which is dependent upon season and rainfall. The greatest discharge is from first magnitude springs that emit at least of water per second. There are four first magnitude springs that feed the St. Johns River: <a href="Silver%20Springs%2C%20Florida">Silver Springs</a> in Marion County, emitting between /second; <a href="Silver%20Glen%20Spring">Silver Glen Spring</a> straddling Marion and Lake Counties, emitting between /second; <a href="Alexander%20Springs%20Wilderness">Alexander Springs</a> in Lake County, emitting between /second; and Blue Spring in Volusia County, emitting between /second.

The St. Johns River lies within a <a href="humid%20subtropical">humid subtropical</a> zone. In summer months, the temperature ranges from , and between in the winter, although drops may occur in winter months to below freezing approximately a dozen times. Water temperatures in the river correlate to the air temperatures. The average range of water temperatures is between , rising in the summer months. Where the river widens between Palatka and Jacksonville, wind becomes a significant factor in navigation, and both <a href="Wind%20wave">whitecap waves</a> and calm surface waters are common.

Rain occurs more frequently in late summer and early fall. <a href="Tropical%20storm">Tropical storm</a>s and <a href="nor%27easter">nor'easter</a>s are common occurrences along the Atlantic coast of Florida; the St. Johns River lies between inland, so any storm striking the counties of Indian River north to Duval produces rain that is drained by the St. Johns River. <a href="Tropical%20Storm%20Fay%20%282008%29">Tropical Storm Fay</a> in 2008 deposited of rain in a 5-day period, most of it located near <a href="Melbourne%2C%20Florida">Melbourne</a>. The St. Johns near <a href="Geneva%2C%20Florida">Geneva</a> in Seminole County rose in four days, setting a record. The river near Sanford rose in 36 hours. Fay caused severe flooding in the middle basin due not only to the deluge but the flat slopes of the river. Typically, however, the St. Johns basin receives between of rain annually, half of it in summer months. The rate of evapotranspiration corresponds to rainfall, ranging between a year, most of it occurring in the summer.

The entire river lies within the nearly flat Pamlico terrace, giving it an overall gradient of per mile (km); it is one of the flattest major rivers on the continent. Its proximity to the ocean in the lower basin affects its rise and fall with tides and salinity. Tides regularly affect water levels as far south as Lake George; when combined with extreme winds, the river's tidal effects can extend to Lake Monroe away and have on occasion reached Lake Harney. Tides typically raise the river level about at Jacksonville, decreasing some to at <a href="Orange%20Park%2C%20Florida">Orange Park</a> where the river widens, and increasing back to at Palatka as it narrows. As a result of tidal effects, discharge measurements in the lower basin are often inaccurate. However, the estimated rate of discharge between the Ocklawaha River and the center of Jacksonville ranges from per second. The nontidal discharge at the mouth at Mayport averages per second, but with tides it exceeds per second, and following heavy rains combined with tides can top per second. Farther upriver, the discharge rate ranges from per second near Lake Poinsett to per second near DeLand. The confluence of numerous springs, the Econlockhatchee River, and the Wekiva River causes the average discharge to increase by per second between Lake Harney and DeLand, representing the greatest annual average increase of streamflow along the St. Johns.

As distance between the mouth of the St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the <a href="salinity">salinity</a> in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35 parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2 ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as brackish water. Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40 ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9 ppt and falls again to 0.81 ppt at the <a href="Shands%20Bridge">Shands Bridge</a> near <a href="Green%20Cove%20Springs%2C%20Florida">Green Cove Springs</a>.

<a href="Oxygen%20saturation">Dissolved oxygen</a> in fresh water is measured to indicate the health of plant and animal life. It enters water through the atmosphere and from aquatic plant photosynthesis, and is affected by water pressure and temperature. Rapid decomposition of organic materials will decrease the amount of dissolved oxygen in the river, as will nutrients added to the water artificially by wastewater treatment runoff or drainage from fertilized agricultural fields. The U.S. <a href="Environmental%20Protection%20Agency">Environmental Protection Agency</a> and the State of Florida recommend no less than 5 mg of oxygen per liter. Several locations on the St. Johns or its tributaries reported at or below these minimums in the 1990s, including the mouth of the Wekiva River, the St. Johns at the town of <a href="Christmas%2C%20Florida">Christmas</a>, and in the early 2000s at Blue Spring and Blackwater Creek. Sustained low levels of dissolved oxygen may create algal blooms, which may also cause a further decrease in dissolved oxygen.

Like all blackwater streams in Florida, the color of most of the St. Johns is black, <a href="tannin-stained%20waters">owing to the tannin</a>s in leaf litter and decaying aquatic plants. Spring fed streams, on the other hand, are remarkably clear and visibility is very high, even when the river bottom is dozens of feet below.

Humans arrived on the Florida Peninsula about 12,000 years ago when the ocean was about lower than today, and the peninsula was double its current size. These earliest people are called <a href="Paleo-Indian">Paleo-Indian</a>s. They were primarily hunter–gatherers who followed large game, such as <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a>s, horses, camels, and bison. Much of the land was far from water—most fresh water was contained in glaciers and polar ice caps. As a result, Florida was an arid landscape with few trees, dominated by grasslands and scrub vegetation.

Around 9,000 years ago, the climate warmed, melting much of the polar ice caps and many glaciers, creating a wetter environment and submerging half the peninsular shelf. As Paleo-Indians now did not have to travel as far to find water, their camps became more permanent, turning into villages. With evidence of a wide variety of tools constructed around this time, archeologists note the transition into <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20the%20Americas">Archaic people</a>. The Archaic people made tools from bone, animal teeth, and antlers. They wove fibers from plants such as cabbage palms and saw palmettos. A few burial sites have been excavated—including the <a href="Windover%20Archaeological%20Site">Windover Archaeological Site</a> in Brevard County near <a href="Titusville%2C%20Florida">Titusville</a>—that provide evidence of burial rituals. Archaic peoples interred their dead in shallow <a href="bogs">peat marshes</a>, which preserved much of the human tissue. Further climate change between 5,000 and 3,000 years ago led to the Middle Archaic period; evidence suggests that human habitation near the St. Johns River first occurred during this era. Populations of indigenous people increased significantly at this time, and numerous settlements near the St. Johns have been recorded from this era; the banks of the St. Johns and its arteries are dotted with <a href="midden">midden</a>s filled with thousands of shells, primarily those of "<a href="Viviparus%20georgianus">Viviparus georgianus</a>"—a freshwater snail—and oysters.

The advent of regional types of pottery and stone tools made of flint or limestone marked further advancements around 500 <a href="Common%20Era">BCE</a>. The Archaic people transitioned into settled groups around Florida. From the central part of the state north, along the Atlantic Coast lived people in the <a href="St.%20Johns%20culture">St. Johns culture</a>, named for the most significant nearby natural formation. Around 750 <a href="Common%20Era">CE</a>, the St. Johns culture learned to cultivate corn, adding to their diet of fish, game, and gourds. Archeologists and anthropologists date this agricultural advancement to coincide with a spread of archeological sites, suggesting that a population increase followed. When European explorers arrived in north Florida, they met the <a href="Timucua">Timucua</a>, numbering about 14,000, the largest group of indigenous people in the region. The later <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a> people called the river "Welaka" or "Ylacco". These forms may derive from the <a href="Creek%20language">Creek</a> "wi-láko", "big water", a compound usually applied to large rivers that run through lakes; the St. Johns forms and borders numerous lakes. Alternately, the Seminole name may derive from "walaka" (from "wi-alaka", "water" and "coming"), perhaps a reference to the river's slow discharge and the tidal effects on it. The name is sometimes rendered as "Chain of Lakes" in English.

The first known European reference to Florida is in a 1502 map by <a href="Cantino%20planisphere">Cantino</a>, which maps Florida and aptly describes the unique vegetation rafts in the St. Johns Rivers by originally naming the river the Rio de las Almadias (River of Rafts). Later, in 1513 <a href="Juan%20Ponce%20de%20Le%C3%B3n">Juan Ponce de León</a> arrived near <a href="Cape%20Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a>, and not until 1562 did Europeans settle the north Atlantic coast of the peninsula. Early Spanish explorers named the river "Rio de Corientes" (River of Currents). The St. Johns River became the first place colonized in the region and its first battleground: when French explorer <a href="Jean%20Ribault">Jean Ribault</a> erected a monument south of the river's mouth to make the French presence known, it alarmed the Spanish who had been exploring the southern and western coast of the peninsula for decades. Ribault was detained after he returned to Europe.

In 1564, <a href="Ren%C3%A9%20Goulaine%20de%20Laudonni%C3%A8re">René Goulaine de Laudonnière</a> arrived to build <a href="Fort%20Caroline">Fort Caroline</a> at the mouth of the St. Johns River; they called the river "Rivière de Mai" because they settled it on May 1. An artist named <a href="Jacques%20LeMoyne">Jacques LeMoyne</a> documented what he saw among the Timucuan people in 1564, portraying them as physically powerful and not lacking for provisions. Fort Caroline did not last long, though relations with the local <a href="Timucua">Timucua</a> and <a href="Mocama">Mocama</a>s were friendly. The colony was unable to support itself; some of the French deserted. Those who remained were killed in 1565 by the Spanish, led by Pedro Menéndez, when they marched north from St. Augustine and captured Fort Caroline. The river was renamed San Mateo by the Spanish in honor of the Apostle Matthew, whose feast was the following day. Capturing Fort Caroline allowed the Spanish to maintain control of the river.

The French and Spanish continued to spar over who would control the natural resources and native peoples of the territory. The Timucua, who had initially befriended the French, were not encouraged to make the Spanish allies because of colonial governor <a href="Pedro%20Men%C3%A9ndez%20de%20Avil%C3%A9s">Pedro Menéndez de Avilés</a>' abhorrence of <a href="Huguenot">French Protestantism</a> and his view that the Timucuan beliefs were "Satanic". By 1573, the Timucua were in outright rebellion, testing the governor's patience and forcing Spanish settlers to abandon farms and garrisons in more interior parts of Florida; the Spanish could not persuade the Timucua to keep from attacking them.

Over a hundred years later, missionaries had more success, setting up posts along the river. Spanish Franciscan missionaries gave the river its current name based on "<a href="San%20Juan%20del%20Puerto%2C%20Florida">San Juan del Puerto</a>" (St. John of the Harbor), the <a href="Mission%20%28station%29">mission</a> established at the river's mouth following the demise of the French fort. The name first appeared on a Spanish map created between 1680 and 1700.

The Timucua, as other groups of indigenous people in Florida, began to lose cohesion and numbers by the 18th century. A tribe located in modern-day Georgia and Alabama called the <a href="Creek%20%28people%29">Creeks</a> assisted with this; in 1702, they joined with the Yamasee and attacked some of the Timucua, forcing them to seek protection from the Spanish who forced them into slavery. The Creeks began assimilating other people and spread farther south until they were known by 1765 as <a href="Seminole">Seminole</a>s by the British, a term adapted from "cimarrones" that meant "runaways" or "wild ones". The Seminoles employed a variety of languages from the peoples the Creeks had assimilated: <a href="Hitchiti">Hitchiti</a>, <a href="Muskogee%20language">Muskogee</a>, as well as Timucua. Between 1716 and 1767, the Seminoles gradually moved into Florida and began to break ties with the Creeks to become a cohesive tribe of their own. The St. Johns provided a natural boundary to separate European colonies on the east bank and indigenous lands west of the river.
After Florida came under the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Kingdom of Great Britain</a>'s jurisdiction in 1763, <a href="Quaker">Quaker</a> father and son naturalists <a href="John%20Bartram">John</a> and <a href="William%20Bartram">William Bartram</a> explored the length of the river while visiting the southeastern United States from 1765 to 1766. They published journals describing their experiences and the plants and animals they observed. They were charged by <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> to find the source of the river they called the Picolata or San Juan, and measured its widths and depths, taking soil samples as they traveled southward. William returned to Florida from 1773 to 1777 and wrote another journal about his travels, while he collected plants and befriended the Seminoles who called him "Puc Puggy" (flower hunter). William's visit took him as far south as Blue Spring, where he remarked on the crystal clear views offered by the spring water: "The water is perfectly diaphanous, and here are continually a prodigious number and variety of fish; they appear as plain as though lying on a table before your eyes, although many feet deep in the water." Bartram's journals attracted the attention of such prominent Americans as <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> and <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>. The success of these journals inspired other naturalists such as <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Michaux">André Michaux</a> to further explore the St. Johns, as he did in 1788, sailing from Palatka south to Lake Monroe, and gave names to some of the plants described by the Bartrams' journals. Michaux was followed by <a href="William%20Baldwin%20%28botanist%29">William Baldwin</a> between 1811 and 1817. Subsequent explorers, including <a href="John%20James%20Audubon">John James Audubon</a>, have carried William's "Travels Through North & South Carolina, Georgia, East & West Florida" with them as a guide.

In 1795, Florida was transferred back to Spain which lured Americans with cheap land. A former loyalist to Britain who left <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, a planter and slave trader named <a href="Zephaniah%20Kingsley">Zephaniah Kingsley</a> seized the opportunity and built a plantation named Laurel Grove near what is now <a href="Doctors%20Lake%20%28Florida%29">Doctors Lake</a>, close to the west bank of the St. Johns River, south of where <a href="Orange%20Park%2C%20Florida">Orange Park</a> is today. Three years later, Kingsley took a trip to Cuba and purchased a 13-year-old <a href="Wolof%20people">Wolof</a> girl named <a href="Anna%20Kingsley">Anna Madgigine Jai</a>. She became his common-law wife, and managed Laurel Grove while Kingsley traveled and conducted business. The plantation grew citrus and sea island cotton ("<a href="Gossypium%20barbadense">Gossypium barbadense</a>"). In 1814, they moved to <a href="Kingsley%20Plantation">a larger plantation</a> on <a href="Fort%20George%20Island">Fort George Island</a>, where they lived for 25 years, and owned several other plantations and homesteads in what is today Jacksonville and another on <a href="Drayton%20Island">Drayton Island</a> at the north end of Lake George. Kingsley later married three other freed women in a polygamous relationship; <a href="Spanish%20Florida">Spanish-controlled Florida</a> allowed interracial marriages, and white landowners such as James Erwin, George Clarke, Francisco Sánchez, John Fraser, and Francis Richard, Jr.—early settlers along the river—all were married to or in extramarital relationships with African women.

The first years following Florida's annexation to the United States in 1821 were marked with violent conflicts between white settlers and Seminoles, whose bands often included runaway African slaves. The clashes between American and Seminole forces during the establishment of the <a href="Florida%20territory">Florida territory</a> are reflected in the towns and landmarks along the St. Johns named for those who were directly involved. Even before Florida was under U.S. jurisdiction, Major General <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a> was responsible for removing the Alachua Seminoles west of the <a href="Suwannee%20River">Suwannee River</a>, either killing them or forcing them farther south towards Lake County, in 1818. Jackson's efforts became the <a href="First%20Seminole%20War">First Seminole War</a>, and were rewarded by the naming of a cattle crossing across a wide portion of the St. Johns near the Georgia border—previously named Cowford—to Jacksonville. The result of Jackson's offensive was the transfer of Florida to the U.S. Following the Seminole Wars, a gradual increase in commerce and population occurred on the St. Johns, made possible by steamship travel. <a href="Steamboat">Steamboat</a>s heralded a heyday for the river, and before the advent of local railroads, they were the only way to reach interior portions of the state. They also afforded the citizens of Jacksonville a pastime to watch competing races. By the 1860s, weekly trips between Jacksonville, <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>, and <a href="Savannah%2C%20Georgia">Savannah</a> were made to transport tourists, lumber, cotton, and citrus. The soil along the St. Johns was considered especially successful for producing sweeter oranges.

<a href="Florida%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Florida's involvement</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20Civil%20War">U.S. Civil War</a> was limited compared to other <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate states</a> because it had a fraction of the populations of states that had been developed. Florida provided materials to the Confederacy by way of steamboats on the St. Johns, although the river and the Atlantic coasts were blockaded by the U.S. Navy. One action in Florida's role in the Civil War was the sinking of the "<a href="USS%20Columbine%20%281862%29">USS Columbine</a>", a Union <a href="paddle%20steamer">paddle steamer</a> used for patrolling the St. Johns to keep materials from reaching the Confederate Army. In 1864, near Palatka, Confederate forces under the command of Capt. <a href="John%20Jackson%20Dickison">John Jackson Dickison</a> captured, burned, and sank the "USS Columbine", making her perhaps the only ship commandeered by the Confederacy. The same year and farther downriver, Confederates again sank a Union boat, the "<a href="Maple%20Leaf%20%28shipwreck%29">Maple Leaf</a>", which struck a floating keg filled with explosives and settled into the muck near <a href="Julington%20Creek">Julington Creek</a>, south of Jacksonville. Part of the shipwreck was recovered in 1994, when it was discovered that many Civil War-era artifacts, including <a href="daguerreotype">daguerreotype</a>s and wooden matches, had been preserved in the river muck.

Although the Spanish had colonized Florida for two centuries, the state remained the last part of the east coast of the United States to be developed and explored. Following the Civil War, the State of Florida was too far in debt to build roads and rail lines to further its progress. Florida Governor <a href="William%20Bloxham">William Bloxham</a> in 1881 appealed directly to a Pennsylvania-based industrialist named <a href="Hamilton%20Disston">Hamilton Disston</a>, initially to build canals to improve steamboat passage through the <a href="Caloosahatchee%20River">Caloosahatchee River</a>, and later to drain lands in the central part of the state for agriculture. Disston was furthermore persuaded to purchase of land in central Florida for $1 million, which at the time was reported to be the largest purchase of land in human history. Disston was ultimately unsuccessful in his drainage attempts, but his investment sparked the tourist industry and made possible the efforts of railroad magnates <a href="Henry%20Morrison%20Flagler">Henry Morrison Flagler</a> and <a href="Henry%20Bradley%20Plant">Henry Bradley Plant</a> to construct rail lines down the east coast of Florida, including a rail link between Sanford and Tampa. Disston was responsible for creating the towns of <a href="Kissimmee%2C%20Florida">Kissimmee</a>, <a href="St.%20Cloud%2C%20Florida">St. Cloud</a>, and several others on the west coast of Florida.

A "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" story reporting on Disston's progress in 1883 stated that before Disston's purchase and the subsequent development, the only places worth seeing in Florida were Jacksonville and St. Augustine, with perhaps an overnight trip on the St. Johns River to <a href="Palatka%2C%20Florida">Palatka</a>; by 1883 tourist attractions had extended south. More attention was paid to the St. Johns with the increasing population. Florida was portrayed as an exotic wonderland able to cure failing health with its water and citrus, and the region began to be highlighted in travel writings. To relieve his bronchitis, <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> stayed briefly in St. Augustine, calling north Florida "a grotesque region" that was being swarmed by land speculators. Emerson poignantly disliked the public sale of slaves, adding to his overall distaste. Following the Civil War, however, famed author <a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Harriet Beecher Stowe</a> lived near Jacksonville and traveled up the St. Johns, writing about it with affection: "The entrance of the St. Johns from the ocean is one of the most singular and impressive passages of scenery that we ever passed through: in fine weather the sight is magnificent." Her memoir "<a href="Palmetto%20Leaves">Palmetto Leaves</a>", published in 1873 as a series of her letters home, was very influential in luring northern residents to the state.

One unforeseen aspect of more people coming to Florida proved to be an overwhelming problem. A woman living in a winter home near Palatka introduced water hyacinths ("<a href="Eichhornia%20crassipes">Eichhornia crassipes</a>") to the St. Johns in an attempt to beautify her backyard. Ten years later, the purple-flowered hyacinths had grown to reside in of the river and its arteries, becoming a serious <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. Hyacinths grow so densely that they prevent the navigation of watercraft, fishing, and sunlight from reaching the depths of the river, affecting both plant and animal life. The government of Florida found the plants to be so vexing that it spent almost $600,000 between 1890 and 1930 in an unsuccessful bid to rid the creeks and rivers of north Florida of them.

An Englishman named <a href="Nelson%20Fell">Nelson Fell</a>, persuaded by Disston's advertisements to make his fortunes in Florida, arrived in the 1880s. An engineer by trade, Fell purchased near <a href="Lake%20Tohopekaliga">Lake Tohopekaliga</a> to create a town named <a href="Narcoossee%2C%20Florida">Narcoossee</a>, which had a population of more than 200 English immigrants by 1888. A spate of poor luck and tense British-American relations followed, prompting Fell to spend some years investing in infrastructure in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, but he returned in 1909 with ideas of developing wetlands in central Florida. He was further encouraged by the political promises of Governor <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte%20Broward">Napoleon Bonaparte Broward</a> to <a href="Draining%20and%20development%20of%20the%20Everglades">drain the Everglades</a> during his 1904 campaign. In 1910 Fell purchased of land for $1.35 an acre and started the Fellsmere Farms Company to drain the St. Johns Marsh in 1911 and send water into the <a href="Indian%20River%20Lagoon">Indian River Lagoon</a>, promoting the engineered canals and other structures as wondrously efficient in providing land to build a massive metropolis. Some progress was made initially, including the establishment of the town of <a href="Fellsmere%2C%20Florida">Fellsmere</a> in which land was sold for $100 an acre, but sales lagged because of a scandal regarding land sale fraud and faulty draining reports from the Everglades. The company then found itself short of funds due to mismanagement. Torrential rains ruptured the newly constructed levees and dikes and forced the company by 1916 to go into receivership. Fell left Florida for Virginia in 1917.

<a href="Marjorie%20Kinnan%20Rawlings">Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings</a> used the St. Johns as a backdrop in her books "<a href="South%20Moon%20Under">South Moon Under</a>" and "<a href="The%20Yearling">The Yearling</a>", and several short stories. In 1933 she took a boat trip along the St. Johns with a friend. In the upper basin, she remarked on the difficulty of determining direction due to the river's ambiguous flow, and wrote in a chapter titled "Hyacinth Drift" in her memoir "<a href="Cross%20Creek%20%28book%29">Cross Creek</a>" that she had the best luck in watching the way the hyacinths floated. Rawlings wrote, "If I could have, to hold forever, one brief place and time of beauty, I think I might choose the night on that high lonely bank above the St. Johns River."

Florida in the 20th century experienced a massive migration into the state. Undeveloped land sold well and draining to reclaim wetlands has often gone unchecked, and often encouraged by government. The St. Johns headwaters decreased in size from to one between 1900 and 1972. Much of the land was reclaimed for urban use, but agricultural needs took their toll as fertilizers and runoff from cattle ranching washed into the St. Johns. Without wetlands to filter the pollutants, the chemicals stayed in the river and flushed into the Atlantic Ocean. Boaters destroyed the floating islands of muck and weeds in the upper basin with dynamite, causing the lakes to drain completely.

What could have been the most serious human impact on nature in central Florida was the <a href="Cross%20Florida%20Barge%20Canal">Cross Florida Barge Canal</a>, an attempt to connect the Gulf and Atlantic coasts of the state by channeling the Ocklawaha River, first authorized in 1933. The canal was intended to be long, wide, and deep. Canal construction was top among the engineering priorities in the state, and by 1964 the <a href="U.S.%20Army%20Corps%20of%20Engineers">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</a> began construction on the Cross Florida Barge Canal. Flood control was the primary impetus behind its construction, though the broader reasoning and feasibility of the project remained unclear. The Army Corps of Engineers was also constructing hundreds of miles of canals in the Everglades at the same time and by the 1960s was being accused of wasting tax money through its unnecessary construction projects. In 1969 the <a href="Environmental%20Defense%20Fund">Environmental Defense Fund</a> filed suit in federal court to stop construction on the canal, citing irreparable harm that would be done to Florida waterways and the Floridan Aquifer, central and north Florida's fresh water source.

A separate canal, the <a href="St.%20Johns-Indian%20River%20Barge%20Canal">St. Johns-Indian River Barge Canal</a>, was planned to link the river with the <a href="Intracoastal%20Waterway">Intracoastal Waterway</a>; the project never broke ground, and was canceled soon after the Cross Florida Barge Canal was suspended.

When steamboats were superseded by the <a href="Florida%20East%20Coast%20Railway">railroad</a>, the river lost much of its significance to the state. The influx of immigrants to Florida settled primarily south of Orlando, adversely affecting the natural order of wetlands there. Within the past 50 years, however, urban areas in the northern and central parts of the state have grown considerably. In the upper basin, population increased by 700 percent between 1950 and 2000, and is expected to rise another 1.5 million by 2020.

<a href="Nitrates">Nitrates</a> and <a href="phosphorus">phosphorus</a> used as lawn and crop fertilizers wash into the St. Johns. Broken septic systems and seepage from cattle grazing lands create pollution that also finds its way into the river. Storm water washes from street drains directly to the river and its tributaries: in the 1970s, the Econlockhatchee River received of treated wastewater every day. Wetlands were drained and paved, unable to filter pollutants from the water, made worse by the river's own slow discharge. Algal blooms, fish kills, and deformations and lesions on fish occur regularly in the river from Palatka to Jacksonville. Although most of the pollutants in the river are washed from the southern parts of the river, the Jacksonville area produces approximately 36 percent of them found in the lower basin.

The State of Florida implemented a program named Surface Water Improvement and Management (SWIM) in 1987 to assist with river cleanups, particularly with <a href="nonpoint%20source%20pollution">nonpoint source pollution</a>, or chemicals that enter the river by soaking into the ground, as opposed to direct piped dumping. SWIM assists local jurisdictions with purchasing land for wetlands restoration. The St. Johns River Water Management District (SJRWMD) is charged by the <a href="Florida%20Department%20of%20Environmental%20Protection">Florida Department of Environmental Protection</a> (DEP) with restoring the river. The first step in restoration, particularly in the upper basin, is the purchase of public lands bordering the river; ten different reserves and conservation areas have been implemented for such use around the St. Johns headwaters. Around <a href="Lake%20Griffin">Lake Griffin</a> in the Ocklawaha Chain of Lakes, the SJRWMD has purchased of land that was previously used for muck farming. More than have been purchased along Lake Apopka to restore its wetlands, and the SJRWMD has removed nearly of gizzard shad ("<a href="Dorosoma%20cepedianum">Dorosoma cepedianum</a>"), a fish species that stores phosphorus and adds to algae problems. The SJRWMD has also set minimum levels for the lakes and tributaries in the St. Johns watersheds to monitor permitted water withdrawals and declare water shortages when necessary.

To assist with river cleanup and the associated funds for improving water quality in the St. Johns, Mayor <a href="John%20Delaney%20%28mayor%29">John Delaney</a> of Jacksonville waged a campaign to get it named as an <a href="American%20Heritage%20River">American Heritage River</a>, beginning in 1997. The designation by the Environmental Protection Agency is intended to coordinate efforts among federal agencies to improve natural resource and environmental protection, economic revitalization, and historic and cultural preservation. The campaign was controversial as the Republican mayor defended asking for federal government assistance, writing "Other rivers have relied heavily on federal help for massive environmental clean-ups. It's the St. Johns' turn now." Twenty-two towns along the St. Johns and environmental, sporting, recreation, boating, and educational organizations also supported its designation, but several prominent Republican politicians expressed concerns over increased federal regulations and restrictions on private property ownership along the river; the <a href="Florida%20House%20of%20Representatives">Florida House of Representatives</a> passed a resolution asking President <a href="Bill%20Clinton">Bill Clinton</a> not to include the St. Johns. Despite this, Clinton designated the St. Johns as one of only 14 American Heritage Rivers out of 126 nominated in 1998 for its ecological, historic, economic and cultural significance.

The continuing increase of population in Florida has caused urban planners to forecast that the <a href="Floridan%20Aquifer">Floridan Aquifer</a> will no longer be able to sustain the people living in north Florida. By 2020, 7 million people are predicted to live in the St. Johns basins, double the number living there in 2008. Proposals to use a day from the St. Johns, and another from the Ocklawaha River, for fresh water are controversial, prompting a private organization named St. Johns Riverkeeper to nominate it to the list of the Ten Most Endangered Rivers by an environmental watchdog group named <a href="American%20Rivers">American Rivers</a>. In 2008, it was listed as #6, which was met with approval from Jacksonville's newspaper, "<a href="The%20Florida%20Times-Union">The Florida Times-Union</a>", and skepticism from the SJRWMD.

The St. Johns River is under consideration as an additional water source to meet growing public water needs. In 2008, the river's Water Management District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water withdrawals and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted in a series of four reports that assessed the impact of water withdrawal on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the Water Management District study. The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water withdrawals. However, the report noted that the District's final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in water management would increase water levels and flows that exceed the proposed surface water withdrawals, these predictions have high uncertainties.
The report also noted concerns about the District's conclusion that the water withdrawals will have few deleterious ecological effects. This conclusion was based on the model findings that increased flows from upper basin projects and from changes in land use (increases in impervious areas) largely compensated for the impacts of water withdrawals on water flows and levels. Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot be said about increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.

HMS Illustrious (87)

HMS "Illustrious" was the <a href="lead%20ship">lead ship</a> of <a href="Illustrious-class%20aircraft%20carrier">her class</a> of <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s built for the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> before World War II. Her first assignment after completion and <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a> was with the <a href="Mediterranean%20Fleet">Mediterranean Fleet</a>, in which her aircraft's most notable achievement was sinking one Italian <a href="battleship">battleship</a> and badly damaging two others during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Taranto">Battle of Taranto</a> in late 1940. Two months later the carrier was crippled by German <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s and was repaired in the United States. After sustaining damage on the voyage home in late 1941 by a collision with her <a href="sister%20ship">sister ship</a> , "Illustrious" was sent to the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> in early 1942 to support the invasion of <a href="Vichy%20French">Vichy French</a> Madagascar (<a href="Operation%20Ironclad">Operation Ironclad</a>). After returning home in early 1943, the ship was given a lengthy refit and briefly assigned to the <a href="Home%20Fleet">Home Fleet</a>. She was transferred to <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a> for the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">Battle of Salerno</a> in mid-1943 and then rejoined the <a href="Eastern%20Fleet">Eastern Fleet</a> in the Indian Ocean at the beginning of 1944. Her aircraft attacked several targets in the Japanese-occupied Dutch East Indies over the following year before "Illustrious" was transferred to the newly formed <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> (BPF). The carrier participated in the early stages of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a> until mechanical defects arising from accumulated battle damage became so severe that she was ordered home early for repairs in May 1945.

The war ended while she was in the dockyard and the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> decided to modify her for use as the Home Fleet's trials and <a href="training%20ship">training carrier</a>. In this role she conducted the deck-landing trials for most of the British postwar naval aircraft in the early 1950s. She was occasionally used to ferry troops and aircraft to and from foreign deployments as well as participating in exercises. In 1951, she helped to transport troops to quell rioting in <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> after the collapse of the <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20treaty%20of%201936">Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936</a>. She was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">paid off</a> in early 1955 and sold for <a href="ship%20breaking">scrap</a> in late 1956.

The Royal Navy's 1936 Naval Programme authorised the construction of two aircraft carriers. <a href="Admiral%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Admiral</a> Sir <a href="Reginald%20Henderson">Reginald Henderson</a>, <a href="Third%20Sea%20Lord">Third Sea Lord and Controller of the Navy</a>, was determined not to simply modify the previous unarmoured design. He believed that carriers could not be successfully defended by their own aircraft without some form of early-warning system. Lacking that, there was nothing to prevent land-based aircraft from attacking them, especially in confined waters like the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a>. This meant that the ship had to be capable of remaining in action after sustaining damage and that her fragile aircraft had to be protected entirely from damage. The only way to do this was to completely armour the <a href="hangar">hangar</a> in which the aircraft would shelter, but putting so much weight high in the ship allowed only a single-storey hangar due to stability concerns. This halved the aircraft capacity compared with the older unarmoured carriers, exchanging offensive potential for defensive survivability.

"Illustrious" was in <a href="length%20overall">length overall</a> and at the <a href="waterline">waterline</a>. Her <a href="beam%20%28nautical%29">beam</a> was at the waterline and she had a <a href="draught%20%28ship%29">draught</a> of at <a href="deep%20load">deep load</a>. She displaced at <a href="Displacement%20%28ship%29%23Standard%20displacement">standard load</a> as completed. Her complement was approximately 1,299 officers and enlisted men upon completion in 1940. By 1944, she was severely overcrowded with a total crew of 1,997. After postwar modifications to convert her into a <a href="evaluation">trials</a> carrier, her complement was reduced to 1,090 officers and enlisted men.

The ship had three <a href="Parsons%20Marine%20Steam%20Turbine%20Company">Parsons</a> geared <a href="steam%20turbine">steam turbine</a>s, each driving one shaft, using steam supplied by six <a href="Admiralty%203-drum%20boiler">Admiralty 3-drum boiler</a>s. The turbines were designed to produce a total of , enough to give a maximum speed of at deep load. On 24 May 1940 "Illustrious" ran her sea trials and her engines reached . Her exact speeds were not recorded as she had her <a href="Paravane%20%28water%20kite%29%23Military%20applications">paravanes</a> streamed, but it was estimated that she could have made about under full power. She carried a maximum of of <a href="fuel%20oil">fuel oil</a> which gave her a range of at or at or at .

The armoured <a href="flight%20deck">flight deck</a> had a usable length of , due to prominent "round-downs" at each end designed to reduce the effects of air turbulence caused by the carrier's structure on aircraft taking-off and landing, and a maximum width of . A single hydraulic <a href="aircraft%20catapult">aircraft catapult</a> was fitted on the forward part of the flight deck. The ship was equipped with two unarmoured <a href="Elevator%23Aircraft%20elevators">lifts</a> on the centreline, each of which measured . The hangar was long and had a maximum width of . It had a height of which allowed storage of <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> <a href="Vought%20F4U%20Corsair">Vought F4U Corsair</a> fighters once their wingtips were clipped. The hangar was designed to accommodate 36 aircraft, for which of <a href="avgas">aviation fuel</a> was provided.

The main armament of the "Illustrious" class consisted of sixteen <a href="quick-firing%20gun">quick-firing (QF)</a> <a href="QF%204.5-inch%20Mk%20I%20%E2%80%93%20V%20naval%20gun"></a> <a href="dual-purpose%20gun">dual-purpose gun</a>s in eight twin-<a href="gun%20turret">gun turret</a>s, four in <a href="sponson">sponson</a>s on each side of the hull. The roofs of the gun turrets protruded above the level of the flight deck to allow them to fire across the deck at high elevations. Her light antiaircraft defences included six octuple mounts for <a href="QF%202-pounder%20naval%20gun">QF 2-pounder ("pom-pom")</a> <a href="antiaircraft%20gun">antiaircraft gun</a>s, two each fore and aft of her island, and two in sponsons on the port side of the hull.

The completion of "Illustrious" was delayed two months to fit her with a <a href="Type%2079%20radar">Type 79</a>Z <a href="early-warning%20radar">early-warning radar</a>; she was the first aircraft carrier in the world to be fitted with radar before completion. This version of the radar had separate transmitting and receiving antennas which required a new <a href="mainmast">mainmast</a> to be added to the aft end of the island to mount the transmitter.

The "Illustrious"-class ships had a flight deck protected by of armour and the internal sides and ends of the hangars were thick. The hangar deck itself was thick and extended the full width of the ship to meet the top of the 4.5-inch waterline <a href="Belt%20armor">armour belt</a>. The <a href="torpedo%20belt">underwater defence system</a> was a layered system of liquid- and air-filled compartments backed by a splinter bulkhead.

While under repair in 1941, "Illustrious"s rear "round-down" was flattened to increase the usable length of the flight deck to . This increased her aircraft complement to 41 aircraft by use of a permanent deck park. Her light AA armament was also augmented by the addition of 10 <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm</a> <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a> in single mounts. In addition the two steel fire curtains in the hangar were replaced by asbestos ones. After her return to the UK later that year, her Type 79Z radar was replaced by a <a href="Type%20281%20radar">Type 281</a> system and a <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20285">Type 285</a> gunnery radar was mounted on one of the main <a href="Ship%20gun%20fire-control%20systems">fire-control directors</a>. The additional crewmen, maintenance personnel and facilities needed to support these aircraft, weapons and sensors increased her complement to 1,326.

During her 1943 refits, the flight deck was modified to extend its usable length to , and "outriggers" were probably added at this time. These were 'U'-shaped beams that extended from the side of the flight deck into which aircraft tailwheels were placed. The aircraft were pushed back until the main wheels were near the edge of the flight deck to allow more aircraft to be stored on the deck. Twin Oerlikon mounts replaced most of the single mounts. Other twin mounts were added so that by May she had a total of eighteen twin and two single mounts. The Type 281 radar was replaced by an upgraded Type 281M, and a single-antenna Type 79M was added. Type 282 gunnery radars were added for each of the <a href="Pom-Pom%20Director">"pom-pom" directors</a>, and the rest of the main directors were fitted with Type 285 radars. A <a href="List%20of%20World%20War%20II%20British%20naval%20radar%23Type%20272">Type 272</a> target-indicator radar was mounted above her <a href="bridge%20%28nautical%29">bridge</a>. These changes increased her aircraft capacity to 57 and caused her crew to grow to 1,831.

A year later, in preparation for her service against the Japanese in the Pacific, one starboard octuple "pom-pom" mount, directly abaft the island, was replaced by two <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">40 mm Bofors</a> AA guns. Two more twin Oerlikon mounts were added, and her boilers were retubed. At this time her complement was 1,997 officers and enlisted men. By 1945, accumulated wear-and-tear as well as undiagnosed shock damage to "Illustrious"s machinery caused severe vibrations in her centre propeller shaft at high speeds. In an effort to cure the problem, the propeller was removed, and the shaft was locked in place in February; these radical measures succeeded in reducing, but not eliminating, the vibrations and reduced the ship's speed to about .

"Illustrious" had been badly damaged underwater by a bomb in April 1945, and was ordered home for repairs the following month. She began permanent repairs in June that were scheduled to last four months. The RN planned to fit her out as a flagship, remove her aft 4.5-inch guns in exchange for increased accommodation, and replace some of her Oerlikons with single two-pounder AA guns, but the end of the war in August caused the RN to reassess its needs. In September, it decided that the "Illustrious" would become the trials and training carrier for the Home Fleet and her repairs were changed into a lengthy refit that lasted until June 1946. Her complement was sharply reduced by her change in role and she retained her aft 4.5-inch guns. Her light AA armament now consisted of six octuple "pom-pom" mountings, eighteen single Oerlikons, and seventeen single and two twin Bofors mounts. The flight deck was extended forward, which increased her overall length to . The high-angle director atop the island was replaced with an American SM-1 <a href="Ground-controlled%20interception">fighter-direction</a> radar, a Type 293M target-indication system was added, and the Type 281M was replaced with a prototype Type 960 early-warning radar. The sum total of the changes since her commissioning increased her full-load displacement by . In 1947 she carried five 8-barrel pom-poms, 17 Bofors and 16 Oerlikons. A five-bladed propeller was installed on her centre shaft although the increasing wear on her outer shafts later partially negated the reduction in vibration. While running trials in 1948, after another refit, she reached a maximum speed of from . Two years later, she made 29.2 knots from . At some point after 1948, the ship's light AA armament was reduced to two twin and nineteen single 40 mm guns and six Oerlikons.

"Illustrious", the fourth ship of her name, was ordered as part of the 1936 Naval Programme from <a href="Vickers-Armstrongs">Vickers-Armstrongs</a> on 13 April 1937. Construction was delayed by slow deliveries of her armour plates because the industry had been crippled by a lack of orders over the last 15 years as a result of the <a href="Washington%20Naval%20Treaty">Washington Naval Treaty</a>. As a consequence, her flight-deck armour had to be ordered from <a href="V%C3%ADtkovice%20Mining%20and%20Iron%20Corporation">Vítkovice Mining and Iron Corporation</a> in <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>. She was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> at their <a href="Barrow-in-Furness">Barrow-in-Furness</a> shipyard two weeks later as <a href="yard%20number">yard number</a> 732 and <a href="Ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> on 5 April 1939. She was christened by Lady Henderson, wife of the recently retired Third Sea Lord. "Illustrious" was then towed to <a href="Buccleuch%20Dock">Buccleuch Dock</a> for <a href="fitting%20out">fitting out</a> and <a href="Captain%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Captain</a> <a href="Denis%20Boyd">Denis Boyd</a> was appointed to command her on 29 January 1940. She was commissioned on 16 April 1940 and, excluding her armament, she cost £2,295,000 to build.

While "Illustrious" was being moved in preparation for her acceptance trials on 24 April, the <a href="tugboat">tugboat</a> "Poolgarth" <a href="capsized">capsized</a> with the loss of three crewmen. The carrier conducted preliminary flying trials in the <a href="Firth%20of%20Clyde">Firth of Clyde</a> with six <a href="Fairey%20Swordfish">Fairey Swordfish</a> <a href="torpedo%20bomber">torpedo bomber</a>s that had been <a href="crane%20%28machine%29">craned</a> aboard earlier. In early June, she loaded the personnel from <a href="806%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">806</a>, <a href="815%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">815</a>, and <a href="819%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">819 Squadrons</a> at <a href="Devonport%20Royal%20Dockyard">Devonport Royal Dockyard</a>; 806 Squadron was equipped with <a href="Blackburn%20Skua">Blackburn Skua</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s and <a href="Fairey%20Fulmar">Fairey Fulmar</a> fighters, and the latter two squadrons were equipped with Swordfish. She began <a href="Glossary%20of%20nautical%20terms%23W">working up</a> off <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>, but the German <a href="Battle%20of%20France">conquest of France</a> made this too risky, and "Illustrious" sailed for Bermuda later in the month to continue working up. This was complete by 23 July, when she arrived in the Clyde and flew off her aircraft. The ship was docked in <a href="Clydeside">Clydeside</a> for a minor refit the following day; she arrived in <a href="Scapa%20Flow">Scapa Flow</a> on 15 August, and became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Lumley%20Lyster">Lumley Lyster</a>. Her squadrons flew back aboard, and she sailed for the Mediterranean on 22 August with 15 Fulmars and 18 Swordfish aboard.

After refuelling in <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, "Illustrious" and the <a href="battleship">battleship</a> were escorted into the Mediterranean by Force H as part of <a href="Operation%20Hats">Operation Hats</a>, during which her Fulmars shot down five Italian bombers and her AA guns shot down two more. Now escorted by the bulk of the Mediterranean Fleet, eight of her Swordfish, together with some from the carrier , attacked the Italian <a href="seaplane">seaplane</a> base at <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a> on the morning of 3 September. A few days after the <a href="Italian%20invasion%20of%20Egypt">Italian invasion of Egypt</a>, "Illustrious" flew off 15 Swordfish during the moonlit night of 16/17 September to attack the port of <a href="Benghazi">Benghazi</a>. Aircraft from 819 Squadron laid six <a href="naval%20mine">mines</a> in the harbour entrance while those from 815 Squadron sank the <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a> and two freighters totalling . The destroyer later struck one of the mines and sank. During the return voyage to <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, the made an unsuccessful attack on the British ships. While escorting a convoy to Malta on 29 September, the carrier's Fulmars broke up attacks by Italian high-level and torpedo bombers, shooting down one for the loss of one fighter. While returning from another convoy escort mission, the Swordfish of "Illustrious" and "Eagle" attacked the Italian airfield on the island of Leros on the evening of 13/14 October.

Upon his arrival in the Mediterranean, Lyster proposed a carrier airstrike on the Italian fleet at its base in <a href="Taranto">Taranto</a>, as the Royal Navy had been planning since the <a href="Abyssinia%20Crisis">Abyssinia Crisis</a> of 1935, and Admiral <a href="Andrew%20Cunningham%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Cunningham%20of%20Hyndhope">Andrew Cunningham</a>, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, approved the idea by 22 September 1940. The attack, with both available carriers, was originally planned for 21 October, the anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar, but a hangar fire aboard "Illustrious" on 18 October forced its postponement until 11 November when the next favourable phase of the moon occurred. The fire destroyed three Swordfish and heavily damaged two others, but they were replaced by aircraft from "Eagle", whose contaminated fuel tanks prevented her from participating in the attack.

Repairs were completed before the end of the month, and she escorted a convoy to Greece, during which her Fulmars shot down one shadowing <a href="CANT%20Z.506">CANT Z.506</a>B <a href="floatplane">floatplane</a>. She sailed from Alexandria on 6 November, escorted by the battleships , , and "Valiant", two <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s, and 13 destroyers, to provide air cover for another convoy to Malta. At this time her air group was reinforced by several of "Eagles"s <a href="Gloster%20Gladiator">Gloster Sea Gladiator</a>s supplementing the fighters of 806 Squadron as well as torpedo bombers from <a href="813%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">813</a> and <a href="824%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">824 Squadrons</a>. The former aircraft were carried "...as a permanent deck park..." and they shot down a <a href="CANT%20Z.501">CANT Z.501</a> seaplane two days later. Later that day seven <a href="Savoia-Marchetti%20SM.79">Savoia-Marchetti SM.79</a> medium bombers were intercepted by three Fulmars, which claimed to have shot down one bomber and damaged another. In reality, they heavily damaged three of the Italian aircraft. A Z.501 searching for the fleet was shot down on 10 November by a Fulmar and another on the 11th. A flight of nine SM.79s was intercepted later that day and the Fulmars claimed to have damaged one of the bombers, although it actually failed to return to base. Three additional Fulmars had been flown aboard from "Ark Royal" a few days earlier, when both carriers were near Malta; that brought its strength up to 15 Fulmars, 24 Swordfish, and two to four Sea Gladiators. Three Swordfish crashed shortly after take-off on 10 and 11 November, probably due to fuel contamination, and the maintenance crewmen spent all day laboriously draining all of the fuel tanks and refilling them with clean petrol. This left only 21 aircraft available for the attack.
Now augmented by reinforcements from the UK, the Mediterranean Fleet detached "Illustrious", four cruisers, and four destroyers to a point south-east of Taranto. The first wave of a dozen aircraft, all that the ship could launch at one time, flew off by 20:40 and the second wave of nine by 21:34. Six aircraft in each airstrike were armed with torpedoes and the remainder with bombs or flares or both to supplement the three-quarter moon. The <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF) had positioned a <a href="Short%20Sunderland">Short Sunderland</a> <a href="flying%20boat">flying boat</a> off the harbour to search for any movement to or from the port and this was detected at 17:55 by <a href="acoustic%20location">acoustic locators</a> and again at 20:40, alerting the defenders. The noise of the on-coming first airstrike was heard at 22:25 and the anti-aircraft guns defending the port opened fire shortly afterwards, as did those on the ships in the harbour. The torpedo-carrying aircraft of the first wave scored one hit on the battleship and two on the recently completed battleship while the two flare droppers bombed the oil storage depot with little effect. The four aircraft loaded with bombs set one hangar in the seaplane base on fire and hit the destroyer with one bomb that failed to detonate. The destroyer , or "Conte di Cavour", shot down the aircraft that put a torpedo into the latter ship, but the remaining aircraft returned to "Illustrious".

One torpedo-carrying aircraft of the second wave was forced to return when its long-range external fuel tank fell off, but the others hit the "Littorio" once more and the was hit once when they attacked beginning at 23:55. The two flare droppers also bombed the oil storage depot with minimal effect, and one bomb penetrated through the hull of the <a href="heavy%20cruiser">heavy cruiser</a> without detonating. One torpedo bomber was shot down, but the other aircraft returned. A follow on airstrike was planned for the next night based on the pessimistic assessments of the aircrews, but it was cancelled due to bad weather. Reconnaissance photos taken by the <a href="R.A.F.">R.A.F.</a> showed three battleships with their decks awash and surrounded by pools of oil. The two airstrikes had changed the balance of power in the Mediterranean by sinking the "Conte di Cavour", and badly damaging the "Littorio" and the "Caio Duilio".

While en route to Alexandria the ship's Fulmars engaged four CANT Z.506Bs, claiming three shot down and the fourth damaged, although Italian records only indicate the loss of two aircraft on 12 November. Two weeks later, 15 Swordfish attacked Italian positions on Leros, losing one Swordfish. While off Malta two days later, six of the carrier's fighters engaged an equal number of <a href="Fiat%20CR.42">Fiat CR.42</a> <a href="biplane">biplane</a> fighters, shooting down one and damaging two others. One Fulmar was lightly damaged during the battle. On the night of 16/17 December, 11 Swordfish bombed Rhodes and the island of <a href="Stampalia">Stampalia</a> with little effect. Four days later "Illustrious"s aircraft attacked two convoys near the <a href="Kerkennah%20Islands">Kerkennah Islands</a> and sank two merchant ships totalling . On the morning of 22 December, 13 Swordfish attacked <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> harbour, starting fires and hitting warehouses multiple times. The ship arrived back at Alexandria two days later.
On 7 January 1941, "Illustrious" set sail to provide air cover for convoys to <a href="Piraeus">Piraeus</a>, Greece and Malta as part of <a href="Operation%20Excess">Operation Excess</a>. For this operation, her fighters were reinforced by a detachment of three Fulmars from <a href="805%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">805 Squadron</a>. During the morning of 10 January, her Swordfish attacked an Italian convoy without significant effect. Later that morning three of the five Fulmars on <a href="Combat%20Air%20Patrol">Combat Air Patrol</a> (CAP) engaged three SM.79s at low altitude, claiming one shot down. One Fulmar was damaged and forced to return to the carrier, while the other two exhausted their ammunition and fuel during the combat and landed at <a href="RAF%20Hal%20Far">Hal Far</a> airfield on Malta. The remaining pair engaged a pair of torpedo-carrying SM.79s, damaging one badly enough that it crashed upon landing. They were low on ammunition and out of position, as they chased the Italian aircraft over from "Illustrious". The carrier launched four replacements at 12:35, just when 24–36 <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2087%20Stuka">Junkers Ju 87 Stuka</a> dive bombers of the First Group/Dive Bomber Wing 1 (I. <a href="Glossary%20of%20German%20military%20terms%23G">Gruppe</a>/<a href="Sturzkampfgeschwader%201">Sturzkampfgeschwader (StG) 1</a>) and the Second Group/Dive Bomber Wing 2 (II. Gruppe/<a href="Sturzkampfgeschwader%202">StG 2</a>) began their attack, led by <a href="Paul-Werner%20Hozzel">Paul-Werner Hozzel</a>. Another pair were attempting to take off when the first bomb struck just forward of the aft lift, destroying the Fulmar whose engine had failed to start and detonating high in the lift well; the other aircraft took off and engaged the Stukas as they pulled out of their dive.

The ship was hit five more times in this attack, one of which penetrated the un-armoured aft lift and detonated beneath it, destroying it and the surrounding structure. One bomb struck and destroyed the starboard forward "pom-pom" mount closest to the island, while another passed through the forwardmost port "pom-pom" mount and failed to detonate, although it did start a fire. One bomb penetrated the outer edge of the forward port flight deck and detonated about above the water, riddling the adjacent hull structure with holes which caused flooding in some compartments and starting a fire. The most damaging hit was a large bomb that penetrated through the deck armour forward of the aft lift and detonated 10 feet above the hangar deck. The explosion started a severe fire, destroyed the rear fire sprinkler system, bent the forward lift like a hoop and shredded the fire curtains into lethal splinters. It also blew a hole in the hangar deck, damaging areas three decks below. The Stukas also near-missed "Illustrious" with two bombs, which caused minor damage and flooding. The multiple hits at the aft end of the carrier knocked out her steering gear, although it was soon repaired.

Another attack by 13 Ju 87s at 13:20 hit the ship once more in the aft lift well, which again knocked out her steering and reduced her speed to . This attack was intercepted by six of the ship's Fulmars which had rearmed and refuelled ashore after they had dropped their bombs, but only two of the dive bombers were damaged before the Fulmars ran out of ammunition. The carrier, steering only by using her engines, was attacked several more times before she entered <a href="Grand%20Harbour">Grand Harbour</a>'s <a href="breakwater%20%28structure%29">breakwater</a> at 21:04, still on fire. The attacks killed 126 officers and men and wounded 91. Nine Swordfish and five Fulmars were destroyed during the attack. One additional Swordfish, piloted by <a href="Lieutenant%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Lieutenant</a> <a href="Charles%20Lamb%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Charles Lamb</a>, was attempting to land when the bombs began to strike and was forced to <a href="Water%20landing">ditch</a> when it ran out of fuel; the crew was rescued by the destroyer . The British fighters claimed to have shot down five Ju 87s, with the fleet's anti-aircraft fire claiming three others. Germans records show the loss of three Stukas, with another forced to make an emergency landing.
While her steering was being repaired in Malta, the "Illustrious" was bombed again on 16 January by 17 <a href="Junkers%20Ju%2088">Junkers Ju 88</a> medium bombers and 44 Stukas. The pilots of 806 Squadron claimed to have shot down two of the former and possibly damaged another pair, but a 500 kg bomb penetrated her flight deck aft of the rear lift and detonated in the captain's day cabin; several other bombs nearly hit the ship but only caused minor damage. Two days later, one of three Fulmars that intercepted an Axis air raid on the Maltese airfields was shot down with no survivors. Only one Fulmar was serviceable on 19 January, when the carrier was attacked several times and it was shot down. "Illustrious" was not struck during these attacks but was near-missed several times and the resulting shock waves from their detonations dislodged enough hull plating to cause an immediate 5-degree <a href="list%20%28watercraft%29">list</a>, cracked the cast-iron foundations of her port turbine, and damaged other machinery. The naval historian J. D. Brown noted that "There is no doubt that the armoured deck saved her from destruction; no other carrier took anything like this level of punishment and survived."

Without aircraft aboard, she sailed to Alexandria on 23 January escorted by four destroyers, for temporary repairs that lasted until 10 March. Boyd was promoted to rear admiral on 18 February and relieved Lyster as Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers. He transferred his flag to "Formidable" when she arrived at Alexandria on 10 March, just before "Illustrious" sailed for <a href="Port%20Said">Port Said</a> to begin her transit of the <a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>. The Germans had laid mines in the canal earlier. Clearing the mines and the ships sunk by them was a slow process and "Illustrious" did not reach Suez Bay until 20 March. The ship then sailed for <a href="Durban">Durban</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, to have the extent of her underwater damage assessed in the drydock there. She reached Durban on 4 April and remained there for two weeks. The ship ultimately arrived at the <a href="Norfolk%20Navy%20Yard">Norfolk Navy Yard</a> in the United States on 12 May for permanent repairs.
Some important modifications were made to her flight deck arrangements, including the installation of a new aft lift and modification of the catapult for use by American-built aircraft. Her light antiaircraft armament was also augmented during the refit. Captain Lord <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten">Louis Mountbatten</a> relieved her acting captain on 12 August, although he did not arrive aboard her until 28 August. He was almost immediately sent on a speaking tour to influence American public opinion, until he was recalled home in October and relieved by Captain A. G. Talbot on 1 October. The work was completed in November and "Illustrious" departed on 25 October, for trials off <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> and to load the dozen Swordfish of <a href="810%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">810</a> and <a href="829%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">829 Squadrons</a>. She returned to Norfolk on 9 December, to rendezvous with "Formidable", which had also been repaired there, and the carriers sailed for home three days later. On the night of 15/16 December, "Illustrious" collided with "Formidable" in a moderate storm. Neither ship was seriously damaged, but "Illustrious" had to reduce speed to shore up sprung bulkheads in the bow and conduct temporary repairs to the forward flight deck. She arrived at <a href="Greenock">Greenock</a> on 21 December and permanent repairs were made from 30 December to late February 1942 at <a href="Cammell%20Laird">Cammell Laird</a>'s shipyard in <a href="Birkenhead">Birkenhead</a>. While working up her air group in March, reinforced by the <a href="Grumman%20F4F%20Wildcat">Grumman Martlet</a> fighters (the British name of the F4F Wildcat) of <a href="881%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">881</a> and <a href="882%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">882 Squadrons</a>, she conducted trials of a "hooked" <a href="Supermarine%20Spitfire">Supermarine Spitfire</a> fighter, the prototype of the <a href="Supermarine%20Seafire">Seafire</a>.

The <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20Malaya">conquest of British Malaya</a> and the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies%20campaign">Dutch East Indies</a> in early 1942 opened the door for Japanese advances into the Indian Ocean. The Vichy French-controlled island of <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a> stood astride the line of communication between India and the UK and the British were worried that the French would accede to occupation of the island as they had to the <a href="Japanese%20invasion%20of%20French%20Indochina">Japanese occupation of French Indochina</a> in 1940. Preventing this required a preemptive invasion of <a href="Antsiranana">Diego Suarez</a> scheduled for May 1942. "Illustrious" had her work up cut short on 19 March to prepare to join the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and participate in the attack. She sailed four days later, escorting a troop convoy carrying some of the men allocated for the assault. A hangar fire broke out on 2 April that destroyed 11 aircraft and killed one crewman, but failed to cause any serious damage to the ship. Repairs were made in <a href="Freetown">Freetown</a>, <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a>, and the convoy reached Durban on 22 April where her destroyed aircraft were replaced.

"Illustrious"s aircraft were tasked to attack French naval units and shipping and to defend the invasion fleet, while her half-sister provided air support for the ground forces. For the operation the carrier's air group numbered 20 Martlets, 1 <a href="night%20fighter">night-fighting</a> Fulmar and 20 Swordfish. Before dawn on 5 May, she launched 18 Swordfish in three flights together with 8 Martlets. The first flight of six Swordfish, carrying torpedoes, unsuccessfully attacked the <a href="aviso">aviso</a> , but sank the <a href="armed%20merchant%20cruiser">armed merchant cruiser</a> . The second flight, carrying <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a>s, sank the submarine while the third flight dropped leaflets over the defenders before attacking an <a href="artillery%20battery">artillery battery</a> and "D'Entrecasteaux". One aircraft of the third flight was forced to make an emergency landing and its crew was captured by the French. Later in the day, "D'Entrecasteaux" attempted to put to sea, but she was successfully bombed by an 829 Squadron Swordfish and deliberately <a href="Ship%20grounding">run aground</a> to avoid sinking. Three other Swordfish completed her destruction. The next morning, Martlets from 881 Squadron intercepted three <a href="Potez%2063.11">Potez 63.11</a> reconnaissance bombers, shooting down two and forcing the other to retreat, while Swordfish dropped dummy parachutists as a diversion. One patrolling Swordfish sank the submarine and another spotted for ships bombarding French defences. On the morning of 7 May, Martlets from 881 Squadron intercepted three <a href="Morane-Saulnier%20M.S.406">Morane-Saulnier M.S.406</a> fighters on a reconnaissance mission. All three were shot down for the loss of one Martlet. In addition to the other losses enumerated, 882 Squadron's Fulmar was shot down while providing ground support.
She was then formally assigned to the Eastern Fleet and, after a short refit in Durban, sailed to <a href="Colombo">Colombo</a>, <a href="Ceylon">Ceylon</a>, and became the flagship of the Rear Admiral Aircraft Carriers, Eastern Fleet, Denis Boyd, her former captain. At the beginning of August, the ship participated in Operation Stab, a decoy invasion of the <a href="Andaman%20Islands">Andaman Islands</a> to distract the Japanese when the Americans were <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">invading the island of Guadalcanal</a> in the South Pacific. Captain Robert Cunliffe relieved Talbott on 22 August. On 10 September the carrier covered the amphibious landing that opened <a href="Operation%20Streamline%20Jane">Operation Streamline Jane</a>, the occupation of the remainder of Madagascar, and the landing at <a href="Tamatave">Tamatave</a> eight days later, but no significant resistance was encountered and her aircraft were not needed. For this operation she had aboard 6 Fulmars of 806 Squadron, 12 Martlets of 881 Squadron and 18 Swordfish of 810 and 829 Squadrons.

After a farewell visit from the Eastern Fleet commander, Admiral Sir <a href="James%20Somerville">James Somerville</a> on 12 January 1943, "Illustrious" sailed for home the next day. She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January and continued on to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the <a href="Blackburn%20Firebrand">Blackburn Firebrand</a> and <a href="Fairey%20Firefly">Fairey Firefly</a> fighters, as well as the <a href="Fairey%20Barracuda">Fairey Barracuda</a> dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new <a href="radar">radar</a>s were installed, her light anti-aircraft armament was augmented, and two new <a href="arrestor%20wire">arrestor wire</a>s were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her post-refit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the "Illustrious" had joined the Home Fleet.

On 26 July, she sortied for the <a href="Norwegian%20Sea">Norwegian Sea</a> as part of Operation Governor, together with the battleship , the American battleship , and the <a href="light%20carrier">light carrier</a> , an attempt to fool the Germans into thinking that <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> was not the only objective for an Allied invasion. 810 Squadron was the only unit retained from her previous air group and it had been re-equipped with Barracudas during her refit. Her fighter complement was augmented by <a href="878%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">878</a> and <a href="890%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">890 Squadrons</a>, each with 10 Martlet Vs, and <a href="894%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">894 Squadron</a> with 10 Seafire IICs. These latter aircraft lacked folding wings and could not fit on the lifts. The British ships were spotted by <a href="Blohm%20%26amp%3B%20Voss%20BV%20138">Blohm & Voss BV 138</a> flying boats and 890 Squadron shot down two of them before the fleet returned to Scapa Flow on 29 July. She transferred to Greenock at the end of the month and sailed on 5 August to provide air cover for the <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a> as she conveyed <a href="Prime%20Minister">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> to the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quebec Conference</a>. Once the convoy was out of range of German aircraft, the "Illustrious" left the convoy and arrived back at Greenock on 8 August.
Together with the "Unicorn", she sailed for the Mediterranean on 13 August to prepare for the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy">landings at Salerno</a> (Operation Avalanche), reaching Malta a week later. Her air group was reinforced at this time by four more Martlets each for 878 and 890 Squadrons. She was assigned to <a href="Force%20H">Force H</a> for the operation which was tasked to protect the amphibious force from attack by the Italian Fleet and provide air cover for the carriers supporting the assault force. The Italians made no effort to attack the Allied forces, and the most noteworthy thing that any of her aircraft did was when one of 890 Squadron's Martlets escorted a surrendering Italian aircraft to Sicily. Before the "Illustrious" steamed for Malta she transferred six Seafires to the "Unicorn" to replace some of the latter's aircraft wrecked in deck-landing accidents. Four of these then flew ashore to conduct operations until they rejoined "Illustrious" on 14 September at Malta.

She then returned to Britain on 18 October for a quick refit at Birkenhead that included further improvements to the flight deck and the reinforcement of her light anti-aircraft armament. She embarked the Barracudas of 810 and <a href="847%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">847 Squadrons</a> of <a href="No.%2021%20Naval%20Torpedo-Bomber%20Reconnaissance%20Wing">No. 21 Naval Torpedo-Bomber Reconnaissance Wing</a> on 27 November before beginning her work up three days later. <a href="No.%2015%20Naval%20Fighter%20Wing">No. 15 Naval Fighter Wing</a> with the Vought Corsairs of <a href="1830%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1830</a> and <a href="1833%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1833 Squadrons</a> were still training ashore and flew aboard before the work up was finished on 27 December.

"Illustrious" departed Britain on 30 December and arrived in <a href="Trincomalee">Trincomalee</a>, Ceylon, on 28 January 1944. She spent most of the next several months training although she participated in several sorties with the Eastern Fleet searching for Japanese warships in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> and near the coast of <a href="Sumatra">Sumatra</a>. The fleet departed Trincomalee on 21 March to rendezvous with the American carrier in preparation for combined operations against the Japanese facilities in the Dutch East Indies and the Andaman Islands. The first operation carried out by both carriers was an airstrike on the small naval base at <a href="Sabang%2C%20Indonesia">Sabang</a> at the northern tip of Sumatra (<a href="Operation%20Cockpit">Operation Cockpit</a>). The carrier's air group consisted of 21 Barracudas and 28 Corsairs for the operation; "Illustrious" launched 17 of the former escorted by 13 of the latter on the morning of 19 April. The American bombers attacked the shipping in the harbour while the British aircraft attacked the shore installations. The oil storage tanks were destroyed and the port facilities badly damaged by the Barracudas. There was no aerial opposition and the fighters claimed to have destroyed 24 aircraft on the ground. All British aircraft returned safely although one American fighter was forced to ditch during the return home.

The "Saratoga" was ordered to depart for home for a refit by 19 May and Somerville wanted to mount one more attack as she was leaving the Indian Ocean. He chose the naval base and <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> at <a href="Surabaya">Surabaya</a>, <a href="Java">Java</a> (<a href="Operation%20Transom">Operation Transom</a>), and the distance from the newly renamed East Indies Fleet's base at Ceylon required refuelling at <a href="Exmouth%20Gulf">Exmouth Gulf</a> on the western coast of Australia before the attack. The necessity to attack from the south, across the full width of Java, meant that the target was outside the Barracuda's range and 810 and 847 Squadrons were replaced by the 18 <a href="Grumman%20TBF%20Avenger">Grumman Avenger</a>s of <a href="832%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">832</a> and <a href="845%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">845 Squadrons</a> for the mission. Early on the morning of 17 May, the ship launched all 18 Avengers, escorted by 16 Corsairs. One Avenger crashed on take-off and an American Avenger was shot down over the target; only one small ship was sunk, and little damage was done to the refinery. The "Saratoga" and her escorts separated after refuelling again in Exmouth Gulf and the East Indies Fleet was back in Trincomalee on 27 May where No. 21 Wing reembarked.

On 10 June, the "Illustrious" and the <a href="escort%20carrier">escort carrier</a> put to sea to simulate another airstrike on Sabang as a means of distracting the Japanese while the Americans were attacking airfields in the <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Mariana Islands</a> and preparing to <a href="Battle%20of%20Saipan">invade the island of Saipan</a>. For the planned attack on <a href="Port%20Blair">Port Blair</a> in the Andaman Islands in mid-June her air group was reinforced by the 14 Corsairs of <a href="1837%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">1837 Squadron</a>; six Barracudas from No. 21 TBR Wing were landed to make room for the additional fighters. On 21 June, the ship launched 15 Barracudas and 23 Corsairs against the airfield and harbour of Port Blair. Two of the Barracudas were forced to return with engine trouble before the attack began and another was shot down over the target. In addition, one Corsair was forced to ditch; the pilot was rescued by a destroyer. Bad weather degraded the accuracy of the Barracudas and little damage was inflicted aside from a few aircraft destroyed on the ground and a few small craft sunk in the harbour. With over 50 aircraft airborne at one point, the British realised that a single deck accident might result in the loss of every aircraft in the air because there was no other carrier available to land aboard. The carrier and her escorts arrived back at Trincomalee on 23 June where 847 Squadron was merged into 810 Squadron a week later.

Her sister ships, the "Indomitable" and the arrived at the end of June although only the latter's pilots were combat-ready. Captain <a href="Charles%20Lambe">Charles Lambe</a> was appointed as the new captain of the "Illustrious" on 21 May, but he could not join his new ship until 9 July. Somerville decided to attack Sabang again (<a href="Operation%20Crimson">Operation Crimson</a>), although the ships of the East Indies Fleet would bombard the port while the fighters from the "Illustrious" and the "Victorious" spotted for them and protected the fleet. As the Barracudas were only needed for anti-submarine patrols, the former only embarked nine while the latter ship flew off all of her Barracudas. On the early morning of 25 July, "Illustrious" launched 22 Corsairs for CAP and to observe the naval gunfire and take photos for post-attack damage assessments. The bombardment was very effective, sinking two small freighters, and severely damaging the oil storage and port facilities. One Corsair was shot down by Japanese flak although the pilot was rescued after ditching. As the fleet was withdrawing, "Illustrious"s CAP intercepted and shot down a <a href="Nakajima%20Ki-43">Nakajima Ki-43</a> (<a href="World%20War%20II%20Allied%20names%20for%20Japanese%20aircraft">codenamed "Oscar"</a>) fighter and a <a href="Mitsubishi%20Ki-21">Mitsubishi Ki-21</a> "Sally" medium bomber on reconnaissance missions. Later in the day her Corsairs intercepted 10 Ki-43s and shot down two of them while driving off the remainder. After arriving in Trincomalee, 1837 Squadron was transferred to the "Victorious".

On 30 July, she sailed for Durban to begin a refit that lasted from 15 August to 10 October and arrived back at Trincomalee on 1 November. 810 Squadron and its Barracudas were transferred off the ship the next day and were later replaced by the Avengers of <a href="854%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">854 Squadron</a>. For the next six weeks she carried out an intensive flying regime in preparation for the next operations against the Japanese together with the other carriers of the fleet. On 22 November she was assigned to the newly formed <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a> (BPF), commanded by Admiral Sir <a href="Bruce%20Fraser%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fraser%20of%20North%20Cape">Bruce Fraser</a>. She was assigned to the <a href="1st%20Aircraft%20Carrier%20Squadron%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">1st Aircraft Carrier Squadron</a> (1st ACS), commanded by Rear Admiral Sir <a href="Philip%20Vian">Philip Vian</a> when he arrived at Colombo aboard the carrier . A week later, "Illustrious" and "Indomitable" sortied to attack an oil refinery at <a href="Pangkalan%20Brandan">Pangkalan Brandan</a>, Sumatra (<a href="Operation%20Outflank">Operation Outflank</a>); the former's airgroup now consisted of 36 Corsairs of 1830 and 1833 Squadrons and 21 Avengers of 857 Squadron. When the aircraft approached the target on the morning of 20 December, it was obscured by clouds so they diverted to the secondary target of the port at <a href="Belawan">Belawan</a> Deli. It was partially obscured by clouds and heavy <a href="squall">squall</a>s so the attacking aircraft only had moderate success, setting some structures on fire and destroying several aircraft on the ground.

On 16 January 1945 the BPF sailed for its primary base in the Pacific Ocean, <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Australia. En route, the carriers of the 1st ACS attacked <a href="Palembang">Palembang</a> on 24 January and 29 January (<a href="Operation%20Meridian">Operation Meridian</a>). "Illustrious"s air group consisted of 32 Corsairs and 21 Avengers by now and she contributed 12 of her Avengers and 16 Corsairs to the first attack, which destroyed most of the oil storage tanks and cut the refinery's output by half for three months. Five days later, the BPF attacked a different refinery and the ship launched 12 Avengers and 12 Corsairs. The attack was very successful at heavy cost; between the two air operations, her squadrons lost five Corsairs to enemy flak or fighters and one due to a mechanical problem on take-off as well as three Avengers to enemy action. Her Corsairs claimed four enemy aircraft shot down as did one Avenger pilot who claimed victory over a <a href="Nakajima%20Ki-44">Nakajima Ki-44</a> "Tojo" fighter. The fleet's fire discipline was poor when it was attacked by seven Japanese bombers shortly after the strike aircraft began landing. The attackers were all shot down, but two shells fired by either "Indomitable" or the battleship struck "Illustrious", killing 12 and wounding 21 men.

She arrived on 10 February and repairs began when she entered the Captain Cook Dock in the <a href="Garden%20Island%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Garden Island Dockyard</a> the next day, well before it was officially opened by the <a href="Prince%20Henry%2C%20Duke%20of%20Gloucester">Duke of Gloucester</a>, the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General of Australia</a> on 24 March. By this time the vibration problems with her centre propeller shaft, which had never been properly repaired after she was bombed at Malta, were so bad that the propeller was removed and the shaft locked in place, reducing her maximum speed to 24 knots. On 6 March she sailed to the BPF's advance base at <a href="Manus%20Island">Manus Island</a> and, after her arrival a week later, "Illustrious" and her sisters "Indomitable" and "Victorious", as well as the carrier "Indefatigable", exercised together before sailing for <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> on 18 March. The BPF joined the American <a href="United%20States%20Fifth%20Fleet">Fifth Fleet</a> there two days later, under the designation <a href="Task%20Force%2057">Task Force 57</a> (TF 57), to participate in the preliminary operations for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">invasion of Okinawa</a> (Operation Iceberg). The British role during the operation was to neutralise airfields on the <a href="Sakishima%20Islands">Sakishima Islands</a>, between Okinawa and <a href="Formosa">Formosa</a>, beginning on 26 March. Her air group now consisted of 36 Corsairs, 16 Avengers and two <a href="Supermarine%20Walrus">Supermarine Walrus</a> flying boats for rescue work.

From 26 March to 9 April, the BPF attacked the airfields with each two-day period of flying operations followed by two or three days required to replenish fuel, ammunition and other supplies. While the precise details on activities of the carrier's squadrons are not readily available, it is known that the commanding officer of 854 Squadron was forced to ditch his Avenger on the morning of 27 March with the loss of both his crewmen; he was ultimately rescued that evening by an American submarine. On the afternoon of 6 April, four <a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a> aircraft evaded detection and interception by the CAP, and one, a <a href="Yokosuka%20D4Y">Yokosuka D4Y</a>3 "Judy" dive bomber, attacked "Illustrious" in a steep dive. The light AA guns managed to sever its port wing so that it missed the ship, although its starboard wingtip shattered the Type 272's <a href="radome">radome</a> mounted on the front of the bridge. When the bomb that it was carrying detonated in the water only from the side of the ship, the resulting shock wave badly damaged two Corsairs parked on the deck and severely shook the ship. The initial damage assessment was that little harm had been done, although vibrations had worsened, but this was incorrect as the damage to the hull structure and plating proved to be extensive. Vice Admiral Sir <a href="Bernard%20Rawlings%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Bernard Rawlings</a>, commander of Task Force 57, ordered the recently arrived "Formidable" to join the task force to replace "Illustrious" on 8 April. In the meantime, she continued to conduct operations with the rest of the fleet. On 12 and 13 April, the BPF switched targets to airfields in northern Formosa and her sister joined the task force on 14 April. Since the beginning of the operation, her aircraft had flown 234 offensive and 209 defensive sorties, claiming at least two aircraft shot down. Her own losses were two Avengers and three Corsairs lost in action and one Avenger and six Corsairs due to non-combat causes.
"Formidable"s arrival allowed Rawlings to order "Illustrious" to the advance base in <a href="San%20Pedro%20Bay%20%28Philippines%29">San Pedro Bay</a>, in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>, for a more thorough inspection. She arrived on 16 April and the examination by divers revealed that some of her outer plating was split and that some transverse frames were cracked. The facilities there could only provide emergency repairs, enough to allow her to reach the bigger dockyard in Sydney. Task Force 57 arrived in San Pedro Bay on 23 April for a more thorough replenishment period and "Illustrious" transferred aircraft, spares, stores, and newly arrived pilots to the other carriers before sailing for Sydney on 3 May. She arrived on 14 May and departed 10 days later, bound for <a href="Rosyth">Rosyth</a> for permanent repairs. 854 Squadron was disembarked while at Sydney, but the carrier kept her two Corsair squadrons until after arriving in the UK on 27 June.

On 31 July Captain W. D. Stephens relieved Lambe. The end of the war several weeks later meant that there was no longer any urgency in refitting the "Illustrious" in time to participate in the invasion of the <a href="Japanese%20Home%20Islands">Japanese Home Islands</a> and the Admiralty decided that she would become the Home Fleet training and trials carrier. Her catapult was upgraded to handle heavier aircraft, her flight deck was further improved, and her radar suite was modernized. She began her postrefit trials on 24 June 1946 and flying trials the following month. She relieved as the trials carrier in August and conducted trials on Firefly FR.4s, Firebrand TF.4s, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Sea%20Mosquito">de Havilland Sea Mosquito</a>es and <a href="de%20Havilland%20Sea%20Vampire">de Havilland Sea Vampire</a>s over the next several months. Captain <a href="Ralph%20Edwards%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Ralph Edwards</a> relieved Stephens on 7 January 1947.
On 1 February, she joined the other ships of the Home Fleet as they rendezvoused with the battleship , which was serving as the <a href="royal%20yacht">royal yacht</a> to escort <a href="George%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George VI</a> as he set out for the first royal tour of South Africa. Over the next several months she conducted deck-landing practice for Avenger and Seafire pilots before starting a short refit on 2 April. After the tour's conclusion on 12 May, she sailed for Scottish waters for more deck-landing practice with the destroyer as her <a href="planeguard">planeguard</a>. On 18 July she rendezvoused with the Home Fleet to participate in manoeuvres before George VI reviewed the fleet on 22–23 July. The King and Queen inspected "Illustrious" and her crew, as did Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> and his wife. Afterwards, she was opened for visits by the public before returning to <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a>. En route she served as the centrepiece of a convoy-defence exercise as the RAF successfully "attacked" the convoy. After summer leave for her crew, she resumed deck-landing trials in September and October, including the initial trials of the prototype <a href="Supermarine%20Attacker">Supermarine Attacker</a> jet-powered fighter in the latter month. In November the government accelerated the demobilisation of some <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">National Servicemen</a> and almost 2,000 men serving in the Mediterranean became eligible for release. They had to be replaced by men from the UK so "Illustrious" ferried the replacements to Malta, sailing on 21 November and returning on 11 December to Portsmouth.

She was refitted and modernised from January to August 1948. Captain John Hughes-Hallett relieved Edwards on 14 June. The ship was recommissioned in early September. While at anchor in Portland Harbour on 17 October, one of her boats foundered short of the ship in heavy weather; 29 men lost their lives. "Illustrious" resumed her duties in early 1949 and conducted trials and training for Avengers, Fireflies, <a href="Gloster%20Meteor">Gloster Meteor</a>s, <a href="de%20Havilland%20Sea%20Hornet">de Havilland Sea Hornet</a>s, Vampires and Seafires. On 10 June Hughes-Hallet was relieved by Captain <a href="Eric%20Clifford">Eric Clifford</a>. During a severe gale in late October, the ship aided the small coastal steamer that had lost power. The weather was too bad for "Illustrious" to rescue the steamer's crew, but she pumped fuel oil overboard to flatten the seas until a tug arrived to rescue the ship on 27 October. On 2 May 1950, she arrived at Birkenhead to commemorate the launch of the new carrier the following day with the <a href="First%20Lord%20of%20the%20Admiralty">First Lord of the Admiralty</a>, <a href="George%20Henry%20Hall%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hall">George Henry Hall, 1st Viscount Hall</a>, aboard. A <a href="Hawker%20Sea%20Fury">Hawker Sea Fury</a> crashed while landing on 15 May, killing the pilot and two members of the deck crew. The prototype of the <a href="turboprop">turboprop</a>-powered <a href="Fairey%20Gannet">Fairey Gannet</a> <a href="antisubmarine%20warfare">anti-submarine aircraft</a> made its first carrier landing aboard on 16 June. This event was also the first landing of any turboprop aircraft aboard an aircraft carrier.
Captain S. H. Carlill assumed command on 24 June and the "Illustrious" resumed deck-landing training. On 8 and 9 November the <a href="Supermarine%20510">Supermarine 510</a> research aircraft made the first ever landings by a swept-wing aircraft aboard a carrier. This aircraft was one of the ancestors of the <a href="Supermarine%20Swift">Supermarine Swift</a> fighter. A month later the ship began a four-month refit and hosted the first carrier landing of the <a href="de%20Havilland%20Sea%20Venom">de Havilland Sea Venom</a> on 9 July 1951. Later in the month she hosted the Sea Furies of <a href="802%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">802</a> and the Fireflies of <a href="814%20Naval%20Air%20Squadron">814 Squadrons</a> for Exercise Winged Fleet. Captain C. T. Jellicoe relieved Carlill on 27 August and the ship ferried 10 Fireflies of 814 Squadron to Malta beginning on 1 October. She exchanged them for Firebrands for the return voyage. On 3 November she began loading the <a href="39th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">39th Infantry Brigade</a> of the <a href="3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Infantry Division</a> in response to the riots in Cyprus that broke out when Egypt abrogated the <a href="Anglo-Egyptian%20treaty%20of%201936">Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936</a>. She set sail two days later and arrived at <a href="Famagusta">Famagusta</a> on 11 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 19 November and began loading the 45th Field Regiment, Royal Artillery, the 1st Battalion, <a href="Coldstream%20Guards">Coldstream Guards</a>, and the <a href="Bedfordshire%20and%20Hertfordshire%20Regiment">Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment</a> two days later. "Illustrious" set sail on 23 November and reached Famagusta on 29 November. She returned to Portsmouth on 7 December and she did not leave harbour until 30 January 1952 when she resumed her customary role as a training ship.

After a brief refit in early 1952, she participated in Exercise Castanets off the Scottish coast in June and hosted 22,000 visitors during Navy Days at Devonport Royal Dockyard in August. On 1 September she hosted No. 4 Squadron and No. 860 Squadrons, Royal Netherlands Naval Aviation Service (RNNAS) for training, as well as 824 Squadron. Between the three squadrons they had 20 Fireflies and 8 Sea Furies when they participated in the major NATO exercise Main Brace later in the month. Jellicoe was relieved by Captain R. D. Watson on 26 September and "Illustrious" resumed training until 9 December when her crew was granted leave and the ship began a refit. She next put to sea on 24 April 1953 for trials and did not resume training pilots until the following month. She was reunited with the four other carriers that served with the BPF for the first time since the war for the <a href="Fleet%20review%20%28Commonwealth%20realms%29%23Elizabeth%20II">Coronation Fleet Review</a> of <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> on 15 June at <a href="Spithead">Spithead</a>. The following day, the Fireflies of No. 4 Squadron, RNNAS and 824 Squadron landed aboard for more deck-landing training. During September she participated in Exercise Mariner with three British squadrons of Fireflies and Sea Furies and a Dutch Squadron of Avengers. The ship resumed flying training off the north coast of Scotland in October for two weeks, but she spent most of the rest of the year on trials of the new <a href="Optical%20landing%20system">mirror-landing system</a> that automated the process of landing aircraft aboard. "Illustrious" began her final maintenance period at Devonport Royal Dockyard on 10 December. Captain K. A. Short relieved Watson on 28 December. The refit was completed by the end of January 1954 and she resumed her normal role. The ship completed 1,051 deck landings and steamed by April. She made her first foreign port visit in many years at <a href="Le%20Havre">Le Havre</a>, France, on 20–22 March, where 13,000 people came aboard. After another round of flying operations, she visited <a href="Trondheim">Trondheim</a>, Norway, on 19 June. During 12 days of training in September, she completed 950 daytime and nighttime arrested landings and 210 helicopter landings. She conducted her last landings on 3 December and arrived at Devonport four days later to begin <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">decommissioning</a>. "Illustrious" was paid off at the end of February 1955 and she was towed to <a href="Gareloch">Gareloch</a> and placed in <a href="Reserve%20fleet">reserve</a>. She was sold on 3 November 1956 and broken up in early 1957.

He is also known for his work in <a href="New%20Japan%20Pro-Wrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> (NJPW) and <a href="Pro%20Wrestling%20Noah">Pro Wrestling Noah</a> through their working relationship under the <a href="ring%20name">ring name</a> Shelton X Benjamin and for American promotion <a href="Ring%20of%20Honor">Ring of Honor</a> (ROH) under his real name. Prior to becoming a professional wrestler, he was a two-sport athlete in <a href="college">college</a>. Benjamin won an <a href="NJCAA">NJCAA</a> championship in both <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a> and <a href="collegiate%20wrestling">collegiate wrestling</a>. After attending <a href="junior%20college">junior college</a>, he completed his degree from the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>.

Benjamin started his professional wrestling career in WWE's developmental territory <a href="Ohio%20Valley%20Wrestling">Ohio Valley Wrestling</a> (OVW), where he held the <a href="OVW%20Southern%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">Southern Tag Team Championship</a> <a href="OVW%20Southern%20Tag%20Team%20Championship%23Title%20history">four times</a> (three times with <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>, and once with <a href="Rodney%20Mack">Rodney Mack</a>). WWE then moved him to the main roster in 2002 where he formed an alliance with <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a> and <a href="Charlie%20Haas">Charlie Haas</a>, known as Team Angle (and later <a href="the%20World%27s%20Greatest%20Tag%20Team">the World's Greatest Tag Team</a> with Haas). During his tenure with the company, he won the <a href="WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship">Intercontinental Championship</a> <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20Intercontinental%20Champions">three times</a>, the <a href="WWE%20United%20States%20Championship">United States Championship</a> <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20United%20States%20Champions">once</a> and the <a href="WWE%20Raw%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">WWE Tag Team Championship</a> <a href="List%20of%20WWE%20Raw%20Tag%20Team%20Champions">twice</a> with Haas. Within the <a href="World%20Wrestling%20Council">World Wrestling Council</a> (WWC), he won the <a href="WWC%20Universal%20Heavyweight%20Championship">Universal Heavyweight Championship</a> <a href="List%20of%20WWC%20Universal%20Heavyweight%20Champions">once</a>.

Benjamin was born and raised in <a href="Orangeburg%2C%20South%20Carolina">Orangeburg, South Carolina</a>. He began <a href="amateur%20wrestling">wrestling</a> his sophomore year at Orangeburg-Wilkinson High School. Benjamin recorded a 122–10 overall win-loss record in his <a href="high%20school">high school</a> career and was a two-time South Carolina state high school heavyweight wrestling champion (1993-1994). Benjamin then attended Lassen Community College in <a href="Susanville%2C%20California">Susanville, California</a> and became a <a href="National%20Junior%20College%20Athletic%20Association">National Junior College Athletic Association</a> (NJCAA) <a href="track%20and%20field">track and field</a> champion in the 100 meter as well as a NJCAA <a href="collegiate%20wrestling">collegiate wrestling</a> champion. He then transferred to the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a> on a wrestling <a href="scholarship">scholarship</a> for his junior and senior years of college where he achieved a 36–6 overall win-loss record. After graduation, he served as an assistant wrestling coach at his <a href="alma%20mater">alma mater</a> and trained with future <a href="Ohio%20Valley%20Wrestling">Ohio Valley Wrestling</a> (OVW) <a href="tag%20team">tag team</a> partner <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>. Benjamin thought about trying to qualify for the <a href="2000%20Summer%20Olympics">2000 Summer Olympics</a> but decided instead to pursue a professional wrestling career.

In 2000, Benjamin signed a contract with the <a href="WWE">World Wrestling Federation</a> (WWF) and was placed in its developmental territory <a href="Ohio%20Valley%20Wrestling">Ohio Valley Wrestling</a> (OVW). There, he formed a tag team with <a href="Brock%20Lesnar">Brock Lesnar</a>, whom he coached at the <a href="University%20of%20Minnesota">University of Minnesota</a>. Together, they were known as the "<a href="Minnesota%20Wrecking%20Crew">Minnesota Stretching Crew</a>," and they held the <a href="OVW%20Southern%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">OVW Southern Tag Team Championship</a> on three occasions. The first two reigns occurred during February and July 2001. They won the title for a third time from <a href="Rico%20Constantino">Rico Constantino</a> and <a href="John%20Cena">The Prototype</a> on October 29, 2001. After Lesnar was called up to the main roster in November 2001, Benjamin formed a tag team with <a href="Rodney%20Mack">Redd Dogg Begnaud</a> called "The Dogg Pound" and once again won the OVW Southern Tag Team Championship on July 17, 2002. Benjamin then wrestled at several <a href="house%20show">house show</a>s for the main WWE roster and eventually made his WWE television debut on "<a href="WWE%20Heat">Sunday Night Heat</a>" as a <a href="Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">heroic character</a>.

He joined WWE's <a href="SmackDown%20%28WWE%20brand%29">SmackDown</a> brand as a <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">heel</a> on December 26, 2002, forming an alliance with <a href="Charlie%20Haas">Charlie Haas</a> and <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic</a> gold-medalist <a href="Kurt%20Angle">Kurt Angle</a> as their <a href="mentor">mentor</a> known as "Team Angle". Their first televised match together in WWE was on the January 2, 2003 episode of "SmackDown" against <a href="Edge%20%28wrestler%29">Edge</a> and <a href="Chris%20Benoit">Chris Benoit</a>.

They continued their <a href="Feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">feud</a> with Benoit until <a href="No%20Way%20Out%20%282003%29">No Way Out</a>, when Benoit teamed with Brock Lesnar to defeat Team Angle. The duo won the <a href="WWE%20Raw%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">WWE Tag Team Championship</a> just a month after their debut by defeating the champions, <a href="Los%20Guerreros%23World%20Wrestling%20Entertainment%20%282002%E2%80%932004%29">Los Guerreros</a> (<a href="Eddie%20Guerrero">Eddie</a> and <a href="Chavo%20Guerrero%2C%20Jr.">Chavo Guerrero</a>) on February 6, 2003. The two then went on to compete in their first <a href="WrestleMania">WrestleMania</a> match at <a href="WrestleMania%20XIX">WrestleMania XIX</a>, retaining their tag title in a Triple Threat match against Los Guerreros, and Chris Benoit and <a href="Rhyno">Rhyno</a>. Team Angle later lost the title to Eddie Guerrero and his new partner <a href="Yoshihiro%20Tajiri">Tajiri</a> at <a href="Judgment%20Day%20%282003%29">Judgment Day</a> in a <a href="ladder%20match">ladder match</a>. The storyline concluded on the June 12, 2003 episode of "SmackDown!", when Angle confronted Benjamin and Haas and fired them from Team Angle. They then began referring to themselves as "The World's Greatest Tag Team" and won the tag titles back on the July 3 episode of "Smackdown". They lost the titles on September 18, after Benjamin suffered a <a href="glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Legit">legitimate</a> knee injury during a match against Los Guerreros. Benjamin was sidelined for approximately one month, but the pair competed together again, taking part in a Fatal Four-Way match at <a href="WrestleMania%20XX">WrestleMania XX</a>.

On March 22, 2004, Benjamin was drafted to the <a href="Raw%20%28WWE%20brand%29">Raw</a> brand as part of the <a href="2004%20WWE%20draft%20lottery">2004 WWE draft</a>. After arriving, Benjamin quickly became a face when he scored an <a href="Upset%20%28competition%29">upset victory</a> over <a href="Triple%20H">Triple H</a>. Benjamin then feuded with Triple H, beating him three times in total: once by pinfall, once by <a href="countout">countout</a> and once by <a href="Disqualification%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">disqualification</a>. As part of the storyline, Benjamin then feuded with the other members of Triple H's <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20stable">stable</a> <a href="Evolution%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">Evolution</a>. Benjamin defeated <a href="Ric%20Flair">Ric Flair</a> at <a href="Backlash%20%282004%29">Backlash</a> and lost to <a href="Randy%20Orton">Randy Orton</a> in an <a href="WWE%20Intercontinental%20Championship">Intercontinental Championship</a> match at <a href="Bad%20Blood%20%282004%29">Bad Blood</a>.

During a match with <a href="Lance%20Cade">Garrison Cade</a> on "<a href="WWE%20Heat">Heat</a>", Benjamin <a href="Punch%20%28strike%29">punched</a> Cade's knee brace, breaking his hand in the process and briefly taking him out of action. Benjamin returned in the fall of 2004 helping Randy Orton fight off Evolution and was later chosen by the fans to compete for the Intercontinental Championship in a match against then-champion <a href="Chris%20Jericho">Chris Jericho</a> at <a href="Taboo%20Tuesday%20%282004%29">Taboo Tuesday</a>. Benjamin won the match, giving him his first singles title in the company. During his reign as Intercontinental Champion, Benjamin retained the title against challengers such as <a href="Christian%20%28wrestler%29">Christian</a> at <a href="Survivor%20Series%20%282004%29">Survivor Series</a>, <a href="Maven%20Huffman">Maven</a> at <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Revolution%20%282005%29">New Year's Revolution</a>, and Chris Jericho at <a href="Backlash%20%282005%29">Backlash</a>. Benjamin lost the title to <a href="Carly%20Col%C3%B3n">Carlito</a> when he debuted on "Raw" (Carlito used the ropes during the pinfall.) during the June 20, 2005 episode, ending the longest Intercontinental Championship reign of the decade at 244 days.
Benjamin was then depicted as having a "losing streak" over the next several weeks, which led to Benjamin's "<a href="Mammy%20archetype">Momma</a>" (played by comedian/actress <a href="Thea%20Vidale">Thea Vidale</a>) coming to "Raw" to confront Benjamin. Momma slapped and yelled at Benjamin every time he lost a match. Before long, she assisted Benjamin in his matches, often interfering on his behalf. This led to Benjamin turning heel for the second time in his career. In 2006, Benjamin then began a rivalry with then-Intercontinental Champion <a href="Ric%20Flair">Ric Flair</a>. On the February 20 episode of "Raw", Benjamin defeated Flair to regain the Intercontinental Championship after Momma faked a heart problem, causing enough of a distraction to allow Benjamin to cheat and win the title. Benjamin continued to feud with Flair, but Momma no longer accompanied him to ringside. Benjamin explained her absence by stating that she was undergoing heart surgery in the hospital. She actually left due to being sexually harassed by someone in WWE.

Benjamin competed in the second <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20ladder%20match">Money in the Bank ladder match</a> at <a href="WrestleMania%2022">WrestleMania 22</a>. Benjamin then began a rivalry with <a href="Rob%20Van%20Dam">Rob Van Dam</a>, the winner of that MITB match, in an attempt to take Van Dam's Money in the Bank contract. During this time, Benjamin emphasized his new heel persona by now wearing shades, jewelry, and occasional colored shirts while entering the ring. At one point, Benjamin was defeated by his former tag team partner, the returning <a href="Charlie%20Haas">Charlie Haas</a>, during an episode of "Raw". A stipulation added to the match meant that due to this loss, Benjamin had to defend the Intercontinental Title in the same match as his shot at Van Dam's contract, meaning at <a href="Backlash%20%282006%29">Backlash</a> it would be a "Winner Takes All" match. Rob Van Dam won at Backlash and became Intercontinental Champion. Benjamin regained the title from Rob Van Dam in a <a href="Tornado%20tag%20team%20match">Tornado Tag Team match</a>, pitting Benjamin, Triple H and <a href="Chris%20Masters">Chris Masters</a> against Van Dam and <a href="WWE%20Championship">WWE Champion</a> <a href="John%20Cena">John Cena</a>; both the WWE Championship and WWE Intercontinental Championship could be won by whoever pinned the appropriate champion. Benjamin pinned Van Dam, picking up his third Intercontinental Championship. Subsequently, Benjamin feuded with Carlito and others for his Intercontinental Championship before losing the title to <a href="John%20Morrison%20%28wrestler%29">Johnny Nitro</a> in a <a href="Triple%20Threat%20Match">Triple Threat match</a> also involving Carlito at <a href="Vengeance%20%282006%29">Vengeance</a>.

On the December 4 episode of "Raw", Benjamin's former tag team partner Charlie Haas came out to celebrate with Benjamin after he defeated <a href="Super%20Crazy">Super Crazy</a>. On the following week's "Raw", Benjamin announced <a href="The%20World%27s%20Greatest%20Tag%20Team">The World's Greatest Tag Team</a> was officially back in a segment with <a href="Cryme%20Tyme">Cryme Tyme</a>. They defeated <a href="The%20Highlanders%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Highlanders</a> in a match later that same night. They then started a feud with Cryme Tyme, but were largely unsuccessful in defeating them, including a tag team turmoil match at <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Revolution%20%282007%29">New Year's Revolution</a> on January 7, 2007, where they were eliminated by Cryme Tyme. They finally managed a win over Cryme Tyme, ending their undefeated streak, on the January 29 episode of "Raw". Benjamin entered the Royal Rumble match at the <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282007%29">namesake pay-per-view</a>, but was eliminated by Shawn Michaels.

On the April 2 episode of "Raw", The World's Greatest Tag Team was unsuccessful in defeating the team of <a href="Ric%20Flair">Ric Flair</a> and <a href="Carly%20Col%C3%B3n">Carlito</a>, but defeated them in a rematch the following week when Haas distracted Carlito, allowing Benjamin to gain the pin over Flair. They won again two weeks later when Carlito <a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Turn">turned</a> on Flair, attacking him and allowing The World's Greatest Tag Team to win via <a href="Countout">countout</a>. They then challenged <a href="the%20Hardy%20Boyz">the Hardy Boyz</a> for the <a href="World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship%20%28WWE%29">World Tag Team Championship</a> at <a href="One%20Night%20Stand%20%282007%29">One Night Stand</a> in a ladder match, but were unsuccessful.

Following this, The World's Greatest Tag Team began a rivalry with <a href="Paul%20London">Paul London</a> <a href="Paul%20London%20and%20Brian%20Kendrick">and</a> <a href="Brian%20Kendrick">Brian Kendrick</a> after losing to the duo in their debut match on "Raw". A few weeks later, London defeated Benjamin in a singles match, however, on the July 23 episode of "Raw", The World's Greatest Tag Team got a tag team win over London and Kendrick to end the rivalry. 

Benjamin and Haas then routinely competed against the teams of Hardcore Holly and <a href="Cody%20Rhodes">Cody Rhodes</a> and <a href="Super%20Crazy">Super Crazy</a> and <a href="Jim%20Duggan">Jim Duggan</a> until November, when the team was disbanded due to Benjamin joining the <a href="ECW%20%28WWE%20brand%29">ECW</a> roster.

On the November 20, 2007 airing of "<a href="ECW%20%28WWE%29">ECW</a>", <a href="D%27Angelo%20Dinero">Elijah Burke</a> introduced Benjamin as the newest ECW superstar. Benjamin, who had dyed his hair blond before leaving "Raw", began wearing gold wrestling attire and referring to himself as "The Gold Standard". On ECW, Benjamin began once again receiving more airtime and higher profile matches, defeating <a href="Tommy%20Dreamer">Tommy Dreamer</a> in his debut. Benjamin then qualified for the <a href="Royal%20Rumble%20%282008%29">Royal Rumble</a> match and won an over the top rope preview. Benjamin appeared in the Rumble match, entering at number 17, but was eliminated by <a href="Shawn%20Michaels">Shawn Michaels</a>. He suffered his first loss since coming to ECW to <a href="Kane%20%28wrestler%29">Kane</a> by count-out, on the January 29, 2008 episode of "ECW on Sci Fi". On the February 22 episode of "SmackDown!", Benjamin defeated <a href="Jimmy%20Yang">Jimmy Wang Yang</a> in a qualifying match for the <a href="Money%20in%20the%20Bank%20ladder%20match">Money in the Bank ladder match</a> at <a href="WrestleMania%20XXIV">WrestleMania XXIV</a>, which was won by <a href="CM%20Punk">CM Punk</a>. After WrestleMania, Benjamin briefly feuded with Punk, before he began an on-screen rivalry with <a href="Kofi%20Kingston">Kofi Kingston</a>, who defeated Benjamin on the April 22 episode of "ECW". On ECW's 100th episode, however, Benjamin defeated Kingston, thus ending the latter's undefeated streak. To end the feud, Kingston then defeated Benjamin in an ECW Extreme Rules match.

As part of the <a href="2008%20WWE%20draft%23Supplemental%20draft">2008 supplemental draft</a>, Benjamin was drafted to the SmackDown! brand.

Charles-Valentin Alkan

Charles-Valentin Alkan (; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a> and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a>, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life.

Alkan earned many awards at the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a>, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Delacroix">Eugène Delacroix</a> and <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand</a>, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale <a href="%C3%A9tude">studies</a> in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his <a href="Symphony%20for%20Solo%20Piano%20%28Charles-Valentin%20Alkan%29">Symphony for Solo Piano</a> (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and <a href="Concerto%20for%20Solo%20Piano%20%28Alkan%29">Concerto for Solo Piano</a> (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians.

Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in <a href="art%20music">art music</a>. Fluent in <a href="Hebrew%20%28language%29">Hebrew</a> and <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son <a href="%C3%89lie-Miriam%20Delaborde">Élie-Miriam Delaborde</a> was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the <a href="pedal%20piano">pedal piano</a>, and edited a number of the elder composer's works.

Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including <a href="Ferruccio%20Busoni">Ferruccio Busoni</a>, <a href="Egon%20Petri">Egon Petri</a> and <a href="Kaikhosru%20Shapurji%20Sorabji">Kaikhosru Sorabji</a>. From the late 1960s onwards, led by <a href="Raymond%20Lewenthal">Raymond Lewenthal</a> and <a href="Ronald%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Ronald Smith</a>, many pianists have recorded his music and brought it back into the repertoire.

Alkan was born Charles-Valentin Morhange on 30 November 1813 at 1, Rue de Braque in Paris to Alkan Morhange (1780–1855) and Julie Morhange, née Abraham. Alkan Morhange was descended from a long-established Jewish <a href="Ashkenazi">Ashkenazi</a>c community in the region of <a href="Metz">Metz</a>; the village of <a href="Morhange">Morhange</a> is located about from the city of Metz. Charles-Valentin was the second of six children – one elder sister and four younger brothers; his birth certificate indicates that he was named after a neighbour who witnessed the birth.

Alkan Morhange supported the family as a musician and later as the proprietor of a private music school in <a href="le%20Marais">le Marais</a>, the Jewish quarter of Paris. At an early age, Charles-Valentin and his siblings adopted their father's first name as their last (and were known by this during their studies at the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Paris">Conservatoire de Paris</a> and subsequent careers). His brother <a href="Napol%C3%A9on%20Alkan">Napoléon</a> (1826–1906) became professor of <a href="solf%C3%A8ge">solfège</a> at the Conservatoire, his brother Maxim (1818–1897) had a career writing light music for Parisian theatres, and his sister, <a href="C%C3%A9leste%20Alkan">Céleste</a> (1812–1897), was a singer. His brother Ernest (1816–1876) was a professional <a href="flute">flautist</a>, while the youngest brother Gustave (1827–1882) was to publish various dances for the piano.

Alkan was a <a href="child%20prodigy">child prodigy</a>. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris at an unusually early age, and studied both piano and organ. The records of his auditions survive in the <a href="Archives%20nationales%20%28France%29">Archives Nationales</a> in Paris. At his solfège audition on 3 July 1819, when he was just over 5 years 7 months, the examiners noted Alkan (who is referred to even at this early date as "Alkan (Valentin)", and whose age is given incorrectly as six-and-a-half) as "having a pretty little voice". The profession of Alkan Morhange is given as "music-paper ruler". At Charles-Valentin's piano audition on 6 October 1820, when he was nearly seven (and where he is named as "Alkan (Morhange) Valentin"), the examiners comment "This child has amazing abilities."

Alkan became a favourite of his teacher at the Conservatoire, <a href="Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume%20Zimmerman">Joseph Zimmerman</a>, who also taught <a href="Georges%20Bizet">Georges Bizet</a>, <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a>, <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Charles Gounod</a>, and <a href="Ambroise%20Thomas">Ambroise Thomas</a>. At the age of seven, Alkan won a first prize for solfège and in later years prizes in piano (1824), <a href="harmony">harmony</a> (1827, as student of <a href="Victor%20Dourlen">Victor Dourlen</a>), and <a href="organ%20%28music%29">organ</a> (1834). At the age of seven-and-a-half he gave his first public performance, appearing as a violinist and playing an air and variations by <a href="Pierre%20Rode">Pierre Rode</a>. Alkan's <a href="opus%20number">Opus</a> 1, a set of <a href="variation%20%28music%29">variations</a> for piano based on a theme by <a href="Daniel%20Steibelt">Daniel Steibelt</a>, dates from 1828, when he was 14 years old. At about this time he also undertook teaching duties at his father's school. <a href="Antoine%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Marmontel">Antoine Marmontel</a>, one of Charles-Valentin's pupils there, who was later to become his "<a href="wikt%3Ab%C3%AAte%20noire">bête noire</a>", wrote of the school:

Young children, mostly Jewish, were given elementary musical instruction and also learnt the first rudiments of French grammar ... [There] I received a few lessons from the young Alkan, four years my senior ... I see once more ... that really parochial environment where the talent of Valentin Alkan was formed and where his hard-working youth blossomed ... It was like a preparatory school, a juvenile annexe of the Conservatoire.

From about 1826 Alkan began to appear as a piano soloist in leading Parisian "<a href="salon%20%28gathering%29">salons</a>", including those of the Princesse de la Moskova (widow of <a href="Michel%20Ney">Marshal Ney</a>), and the <a href="Louise%20Antoinette%20Lannes%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Montebello">Duchesse de Montebello</a>. He was probably introduced to these venues by his teacher Zimmermann. At the same time, Alkan Morhange arranged concerts featuring Charles-Valentin at public venues in Paris, in association with leading musicians including the <a href="soprano">soprano</a>s <a href="Giuditta%20Pasta">Giuditta Pasta</a> and <a href="Henriette%20Sontag">Henriette Sontag</a>, the cellist <a href="Auguste%20Franchomme">Auguste Franchomme</a> and the violinist <a href="Lambert%20Massart">Lambert Massart</a>, with whom Alkan gave concerts in a rare visit out of France to <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a> in 1827. In 1829, at the age of 15, Alkan was appointed joint professor of solfège – among his pupils in this class a few years later was his brother Napoléon. In this manner Alkan's musical career was launched well before the <a href="July%20Revolution">July Revolution</a> of 1830, which initiated a period in which "keyboard virtuosity ... completely dominated professional music making" in the capital, attracting from all over Europe pianists who, as <a href="Heinrich%20Heine">Heinrich Heine</a> wrote, invaded "like a plague of locusts swarming to pick Paris clean". Alkan nonetheless continued his studies and in 1831 enrolled in the organ classes of <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Benoist">François Benoist</a>, from whom he may have learnt to appreciate the music of <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a>, of whom Benoist was then one of the few French advocates.

 Throughout the early years of the <a href="July%20Monarchy">July Monarchy</a>, Alkan continued to teach and play at public concerts and in eminent social circles. He became a friend of many who were active in the world of the arts in Paris, including <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Franz Liszt</a> (who had been based there since 1827), <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand</a>, and <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>. It is not clear exactly when he first met <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>, who arrived in Paris in September 1831. In 1832 Alkan took the solo role in his first "Concerto da camera" for piano and strings at the Conservatoire. In the same year, aged 19, he was elected to the influential "Société Académique des Enfants d'Apollon (Society of the Children of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>)", whose members included <a href="Luigi%20Cherubini">Luigi Cherubini</a>, <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Fromental Halévy</a>, the conductor <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Habeneck">François Habeneck</a>, and Liszt, who had been elected in 1824 at the age of twelve. Between 1833 and 1836 Alkan participated at many of the Society's concerts. Alkan twice competed unsuccessfully for the <a href="Prix%20de%20Rome">Prix de Rome</a>, in 1832 and again in 1834; the <a href="cantata">cantata</a>s which he wrote for the competition, "Hermann et Ketty" and "L'Entrée en loge", have remained unpublished and unperformed.

In 1834 Alkan began his friendship with the Spanish musician <a href="Santiago%20Masarnau%20Fern%C3%A1ndez">Santiago Masarnau</a>, which was to result in an extended and often intimate correspondence which only came to light in 2009. Like virtually all of Alkan's correspondence, this exchange is now one-sided; all of his papers (including his manuscripts and his extensive library) were either destroyed by Alkan himself, as is clear from his will, or became lost after his death. Later in 1834 Alkan made a visit to England, where he gave recitals and where the second "Concerto da camera" was performed in <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> by its dedicatee <a href="Henry%20Ibbot%20Field">Henry Ibbot Field</a>; it was published in London together with some solo piano pieces. A letter to Masarnau and a notice in a French journal that Alkan played in London with <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Moscheles</a> and <a href="Johann%20Baptist%20Cramer">Cramer</a>, indicate that he returned to England in 1835. Later that year, Alkan, having found a place of retreat at <a href="Piscop">Piscop</a> outside Paris, completed his first truly original works for solo piano, the "Twelve Caprices", published in 1837 as Opp. 12, 13, 15 and 16. Op. 16, the "Trois <a href="scherzo">scherzi</a> de bravoure", is dedicated to Masarnau. In January 1836, Liszt recommended Alkan for the post of Professor at the <a href="Conservatoire%20de%20Musique%20de%20Gen%C3%A8ve">Geneva Conservatoire</a>, which Alkan declined, and in 1837 he wrote an enthusiastic review of Alkan's Op. 15 Caprices in the "<a href="Revue%20et%20gazette%20musicale">Revue et gazette musicale</a>".

From 1837, Alkan lived in the <a href="Square%20d%27Orl%C3%A9ans">Square d'Orléans</a> in Paris, which was inhabited by numerous celebrities of the time including <a href="Marie%20Taglioni">Marie Taglioni</a>, <a href="Alexandre%20Dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a>, George Sand, and Chopin. Chopin and Alkan were personal friends and often discussed musical topics, including a work on musical theory that Chopin proposed to write. By 1838, at 25 years old, Alkan had reached a peak of his career. He frequently gave recitals, his more mature works had begun to be published, and he often appeared in concerts with Liszt and Chopin. On 23 April 1837 Alkan took part in Liszt's farewell concert in Paris, together with the 14-year-old <a href="C%C3%A9sar%20Franck">César Franck</a> and the virtuoso <a href="Johann%20Peter%20Pixis">Johann Peter Pixis</a>. On 3 March 1838, at a concert at the piano-maker Pape, Alkan played with Chopin, Zimmerman, and Chopin's pupil <a href="Adolphe%20Gutmann">Adolphe Gutmann</a> in a performance of Alkan's transcription, now lost, of two movements of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%207%20%28Beethoven%29">Seventh Symphony</a> for two pianos, eight hands.

At this point, for a period which coincided with the birth and childhood of his <a href="wikt%3Anatural%20son">natural son</a>, <a href="%C3%89lie-Miriam%20Delaborde">Élie-Miriam Delaborde</a> (1839–1913), Alkan withdrew into private study and composition for six years, returning to the concert platform only in 1844. Alkan neither asserted nor denied his paternity of Delaborde, which, however, his contemporaries seemed to assume. Marmontel wrote cryptically in a biography of Delaborde that "[his] birth is a page from a novel in the life of a great artist". Alkan gave early piano lessons to Delaborde, who was to follow his natural father as a keyboard virtuoso.

Alkan's return to the concert platform in 1844 was greeted with enthusiasm by critics, who noted the "admirable perfection" of his technique, and lauded him as "a model of science and inspiration", a "sensation" and an "explosion". They also commented on the attending celebrities including Liszt, Chopin, Sand and Dumas. In the same year he published his piano étude "<a href="Le%20chemin%20de%20fer%20%28Alkan%29">Le chemin de fer</a>", which critics, following Ronald Smith, believe to be the first representation in music of a steam engine. Between 1844 and 1848 Alkan produced a series of virtuoso pieces, the 25 "Préludes" Op. 31 for piano or organ, and the <a href="Grande%20sonate%20%27Les%20quatre%20%C3%A2ges%27">sonata Op. 33 "Les quatre âges"</a>. Following an Alkan recital in 1848, the composer <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Giacomo Meyerbeer</a> was so impressed that he invited the pianist, whom he considered "a most remarkable artist", to prepare the piano arrangement of the overture to his forthcoming opera, "<a href="Le%20proph%C3%A8te%20%28opera%29">Le prophète</a>". Meyerbeer heard and approved Alkan's arrangement of the overture for four hands (which Alkan played with his brother Napoléon) in 1849; published in 1850, it is the only record of the overture, which was scrapped during rehearsals at the <a href="Paris%20Op%C3%A9ra">Opéra</a>.

In 1848 Alkan was bitterly disappointed when the head of the Conservatoire, <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Daniel Auber</a>, replaced the retiring Zimmerman with the mediocre Marmontel as head of the Conservatoire piano department, a position which Alkan had eagerly anticipated, and for which he had strongly lobbied with the support of Sand, Dumas, and many other leading figures. A disgusted Alkan described the appointment in a letter to Sand as "the most incredible, the most shameful nomination"; and Delacroix noted in his journal: "By his confrontation with Auber, [Alkan] has been very put out and will doubtless continue to be so." The upset arising from this incident may account for Alkan's reluctance to perform in public in the ensuing period. His withdrawal was also influenced by the death of Chopin; in 1850 he wrote to Masarnau "I have lost the strength to be of any economic or political use", and lamented "the death of poor Chopin, another blow which I felt deeply." Chopin, on his deathbed in 1849, had indicated his respect for Alkan by bequeathing him his unfinished work on a piano method, intending him to complete it, and after Chopin's death a number of his students transferred to Alkan. After giving two concerts in 1853, Alkan withdrew, in spite of his fame and technical accomplishment, into virtual seclusion for some twenty years.

Little is known of this period of Alkan's life, other than that apart from composing he was immersed in the study of the Bible and the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a>. Throughout this period Alkan continued his correspondence with <a href="Ferdinand%20Hiller">Ferdinand Hiller</a>, whom he had probably met in Paris in the 1830s, and with Masarnau, from which some insights can be gained. It appears that Alkan completed a full translation into French, now lost, of both the <a href="Old%20Testament">Old Testament</a> and the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>, from their original languages. In 1865, he wrote to Hiller: "Having translated a good deal of the <a href="Apocrypha">Apocrypha</a>, I'm now onto the <a href="Gospel%20of%20Mark">second Gospel</a> which I am translating from the <a href="Syriac%20language">Syriac</a> ... In starting to translate the New Testament, I was suddenly struck by a singular idea – that you have to be Jewish to be able to do it."

Despite his seclusion from society, this period saw the composition and publication of many of Alkan's major piano works, including the "Douze études dans tous les tons mineurs", Op. 39 (1857), the "Sonatine", Op. 61 (1861), the 49 "<a href="Esquisses%20%28Alkan%29">Esquisses</a>", Op. 63 (1861), and the five collections of "Chants" (1857–1872), as well as the "Sonate de concert" for cello and piano, Op. 47 (1856). These did not pass unremarked; <a href="Hans%20von%20B%C3%BClow">Hans von Bülow</a>, for example, gave a laudatory review of the Op. 35 "Études" in the "<a href="Neue%20Berliner%20Musikzeitung">Neue Berliner Musikzeitung</a>" in 1857, the year in which they were published in Berlin, commenting that "Alkan is unquestionably the most eminent representative of the modern piano school at Paris. The virtuoso's disinclination to travel, and his firm reputation as a teacher, explain why, at present, so little attention has been given to his work in Germany."

From the early 1850s Alkan began to turn his attention seriously to the <a href="pedal%20piano">pedal piano</a> (pédalier). Alkan gave his first public performances on the pédalier to great critical acclaim in 1852. From 1859 onwards he began to publish pieces designated as "for organ or piano à pédalier".

It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six "Petits Concerts" at the <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20%C3%89rard">Érard</a> piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the "Petits Concerts" led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The "Petits Concerts" featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, <a href="Camille%20Saint-Sa%C3%ABns">Camille Saint-Saëns</a>, and Auguste Franchomme.

Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young <a href="Vincent%20d%27Indy">Vincent d'Indy</a>, who recalled Alkan's "skinny, hooked fingers" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: "I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing." Alkan later played Beethoven's <a href="Piano%20Sonata%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B31%20%28Beethoven%29">Op. 110 sonata</a>, of which d'Indy said: "What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ... I couldn't begin to describe – above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to a blaze of light, affected me with an excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since. This was not Liszt—perhaps less perfect, technically—but it had greater intimacy and was more humanly moving..."

The biographer of Chopin, <a href="Frederick%20Niecks">Frederick Niecks</a>, sought Alkan for his recollections in 1880 but was sternly denied access by Alkan's <a href="concierge">concierge</a> – "To my ... enquiry when he could be found at home, the reply was a ... decisive 'Never'." However, a few days later he found Alkan at Érard's, and Niecks writes of their meeting that "his reception of me was not merely polite but most friendly."

According to his death certificate, Alkan died in Paris on 29 March 1888 at the age of 74. Alkan was buried on 1 April (<a href="Easter">Easter Sunday</a>) in the Jewish section of <a href="Montmartre%20Cemetery">Montmartre Cemetery</a>, Paris, not far from the tomb of his contemporary <a href="Fromental%20Hal%C3%A9vy">Fromental Halévy</a>; his sister Céleste was later buried in the same tomb.

For many years it was believed that Alkan met his death when a bookcase toppled over and fell on him as he reached for a volume of the <a href="Talmud">Talmud</a> from a high shelf. This tale, which was circulated by the pianist <a href="Isidor%20Philipp">Isidor Philipp</a>, is dismissed by <a href="Hugh%20Macdonald">Hugh Macdonald</a>, who reports the discovery of a contemporary letter by one of his pupils explaining that Alkan had been found prostrate in his kitchen, under a "porte-parapluie" (a heavy coat/umbrella rack), after his concierge heard his moaning. He had possibly fainted, bringing it down on himself while grabbing out for support. He was reportedly carried to his bedroom and died later that evening. The story of the bookcase may have its roots in a legend told of <a href="Aryeh%20Leib%20ben%20Asher%20Gunzberg">Aryeh Leib ben Asher</a>, rabbi of <a href="Metz">Metz</a>, the town from which Alkan's family originated.

Alkan was described by Marmontel (who refers to "a regrettable misunderstanding at a moment of our careers in 1848"), as follows:

We will not give the portrait of Valentin Alkan from the rear, as in some photographs we have seen. His intelligent and original physiognomy deserves to be taken in profile or head-on. The head is strong; the deep forehead is that of a thinker; the mouth large and smiling, the nose regular; the years have whitened the beard and hair ... the gaze fine, a little mocking. His stooped walk, his puritan comportment, give him the look of an <a href="Church%20of%20England">Anglican</a> minister or a rabbi – for which he has the abilities.

Alkan was not always remote or aloof. Chopin describes, in a letter to friend, visiting the theatre with Alkan in 1847 to see the comedian <a href="%C3%89tienne%20Arnal">Arnal</a>: "[Arnal] tells the audience how he was desperate to pee in a train, but couldn't get to a toilet before they stopped at Orléans. There wasn't a single vulgar word in what he said, but everyone understood and split their sides laughing." Hugh Macdonald notes that Alkan "particularly enjoyed the patronage of Russian aristocratic ladies, 'des dames très parfumées et froufroutantes [highly perfumed and frilled ladies]', as Isidore Philipp described them."

Alkan's aversion to socialising and publicity, especially following 1850, appeared to be self-willed. Liszt is reported to have commented to the Danish pianist <a href="Frits%20Hartvigson">Frits Hartvigson</a> that "Alkan possessed the finest technique he had ever known, but preferred the life of a recluse." <a href="Stephanie%20McCallum">Stephanie McCallum</a> has suggested that Alkan may have suffered from <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> or <a href="obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive%20disorder">obsessive–compulsive disorder</a>.

Alkan's later correspondence contains many despairing comments. In a letter of about 1861 he wrote to Hiller:

I'm becoming daily more and more misanthropic and misogynous ... nothing worthwhile, good or useful to do ... no one to devote myself to. My situation makes me horridly sad and wretched. Even musical production has lost its attraction for me for I can't see the point or goal."

This spirit of <a href="anomie">anomie</a> may have led him to reject requests in the 1860s to play in public, or to allow performances of his orchestral compositions. However, it should not be ignored that he was writing similarly frantic self-analyses in his letters of the early 1830s to Masarnau.

Hugh MacDonald writes that "Alkan's enigmatic character is reflected in his music – he dressed in a severe, old-fashioned, somewhat clerical manner – only in black – discouraged visitors and went out rarely – he had few friends – was nervous in public and was pathologically worried about his health, even though it was good". <a href="Ronald%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Ronald Smith</a> writes that "Alkan's characteristics, exacerbated no doubt by his isolation, are carried to the edge of fanaticism, and at the heart of Alkan's creativity there is also fierce obsessional control; his obsession with a specific idea can border on the pathological."

<a href="Jack%20Gibbons">Jack Gibbons</a> writes of Alkan's personality: "Alkan was an intelligent, lively, humorous and warm person (all characteristics which feature strongly in his music) whose only crime seems to have been having a vivid imagination, and whose occasional eccentricities (mild when compared with the behaviour of other 'highly-strung' artistes!) stemmed mainly from his hypersensitive nature." Macdonald, however, suggests that "Alkan was a man of profoundly conservative ideas, whose lifestyle, manner of dress, and belief in the traditions of historic music, set him apart from other musicians and the world at large."
Alkan grew up in a religiously observant Jewish household. His grandfather Marix Morhange had been a printer of the Talmud in Metz, and was probably a "<a href="melamed">melamed</a>" (Hebrew teacher) in the Jewish congregation at Paris. Alkan's widespread reputation as a student of the Old Testament and religion, and the high quality of his Hebrew handwriting testify to his knowledge of the religion, and many of his habits indicate that he practised at least some of its obligations, such as maintaining the laws of <a href="kashrut">kashrut</a>. Alkan was regarded by the Paris <a href="Consistory%20%28Judaism%29">Consistory</a>, the central Jewish organisation of the city, as an authority on Jewish music. In 1845 he assisted the Consistory in evaluating the musical ability of <a href="Samuel%20Naumbourg">Samuel Naumbourg</a>, who was subsequently appointed as "<a href="hazzan">hazzan</a>" (cantor) of the main Paris synagogue; and he later contributed choral pieces in each of Naumbourg's collections of synagogue music (1847 and 1856). Alkan was appointed organist at the <a href="Synagogue%20de%20Nazareth">Synagogue de Nazareth</a> in 1851, although he resigned the post almost immediately for "artistic reasons".

Alkan's Op. 31 set of "Préludes" includes a number of pieces based on Jewish subjects, including some titled "Prière (Prayer)", one preceded by a quote from the "<a href="Song%20of%20Songs">Song of Songs</a>", and another titled "Ancienne mélodie de la synagogue (Old synagogue melody)." The collection is believed to be "the first publication of <a href="art%20music">art music</a> specifically to deploy Jewish themes and ideas." Alkan's three settings of synagogue melodies, prepared for his former pupil Zina de Mansouroff, are further examples of his interest in Jewish music; Kessous Dreyfuss provides a detailed analysis of these works and their origins. Other works evidencing this interest include no. 7 of his Op. 66. "11 Grands préludes et 1 Transcription" (1866), entitled "Alla giudesca" and marked "con divozione", a parody of excessive "hazzanic" practice; and the slow movement of the cello sonata Op. 47 (1857), which is prefaced by a quotation from the Old Testament prophet <a href="Micah%20%28prophet%29">Micah</a> and uses melodic <a href="trope%20%28music%29">tropes</a> derived from the <a href="cantillation">cantillation</a> of the "<a href="haftarah">haftarah</a>" in the synagogue.

The inventory of Alkan's apartment made after his death indicates over 75 volumes in Hebrew or related to Judaism, left to his brother Napoléon (as well as 36 volumes of music manuscript). These are all lost. Bequests in his will to the Conservatoire to found prizes for composition of cantatas on Old Testament themes and for performance on the pedal-piano, and to a Jewish charity for the training of apprentices, were refused by the beneficiaries.

<a href="Brigitte%20Fran%C3%A7ois-Sappey">Brigitte François-Sappey</a> points out the frequency with which Alkan has been compared to <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Berlioz</a>, both by his contemporaries and later. She mentions that Hans von Bülow called him "the Berlioz of the piano", while Schumann, in criticising the Op. 15 "Romances", claimed that Alkan merely "imitated Berlioz on the piano." She further notes that Ferruccio Busoni repeated the comparison with Berlioz in a draft (but unpublished) monograph, while Kaikhosru Sorabji commented that Alkan's Op. 61 "Sonatine" was like "a Beethoven sonata written by Berlioz". Berlioz was ten years older than Alkan, but did not attend the Conservatoire until 1826. The two were acquainted, and were perhaps both influenced by the unusual ideas and style of <a href="Anton%20Reicha">Anton Reicha</a> who taught at the Conservatoire from 1818 to 1836, and by the sonorities of the composers of the period of the French Revolution. They both created individual, indeed, idiosyncratic sound-worlds in their music; there are, however, major differences between them. Alkan, unlike Berlioz, remained closely dedicated to the German musical tradition; his style and composition were heavily determined by his pianism, whereas Berlioz could hardly play at the keyboard and wrote nothing for piano solo. Alkan's works therefore also include miniatures and (among his early works) "salon" music, genres which Berlioz avoided.

Alkan's attachment to the music of his predecessors is demonstrated throughout his career, from his arrangements for keyboard of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony (1838), and of the minuet of <a href="Wolfgang%20Amadeus%20Mozart">Mozart</a>'s <a href="Symphony%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B40%20%28Mozart%29">40th Symphony</a> (1844), through the sets "Souvenirs des concerts du Conservatoire" (1847 and 1861) and the set "Souvenirs de musique de chambre" (1862), which include <a href="transcription%20%28music%29">transcriptions</a> of music by Mozart, Beethoven, J. S. Bach, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Haydn</a>, <a href="Christoph%20Willibald%20Gluck">Gluck</a>, and others. In this context should be mentioned Alkan's extensive <a href="cadenza">cadenza</a> for <a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B3%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's 3rd Piano Concerto</a> (1860), which includes quotes from the finale of <a href="Symphony%20No.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B5%20%28Beethoven%29">Beethoven's 5th Symphony</a>. Alkan's transcriptions, together with original music of Bach, Beethoven, <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a>, <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Mendelssohn</a>, <a href="Louis%20Couperin">Couperin</a> and <a href="Jean-Philippe%20Rameau">Rameau</a>, were frequently played during the series of "Petits Concerts" given by Alkan at Erard.

As regards the music of his own time, Alkan was unenthusiastic, or at any rate detached. He commented to Hiller that "<a href="Richard%20Wagner">Wagner</a> is not a musician, he is a disease." While he admired Berlioz's talent, he did not enjoy his music. At the "Petits Concerts", little more recent than Mendelssohn and Chopin (both of whom had died around 25 years before the series of concerts was initiated) was played, except for Alkan's own works and occasionally some by his favourites such as Saint-Saëns.

 "Like ... Chopin", writes pianist and academic <a href="Kenneth%20Hamilton">Kenneth Hamilton</a>, "Alkan's musical output was centred almost exclusively on the piano". Some of his music requires extreme technical virtuosity, clearly reflecting his own abilities, often calling for great velocity, enormous leaps at speed, long stretches of fast repeated notes, and the maintenance of widely spaced <a href="counterpoint">contrapuntal</a> lines. The illustration (right) from the "Grande sonate" is analysed by Smith as "six <a href="part%20%28music%29">parts</a> in <a href="invertible%20counterpoint">invertible counterpoint</a>, plus two extra voices and three doublings – eleven parts in all." Some typical musical devices, such as a sudden explosive final chord following a quiet passage, were established at an early stage in Alkan's compositions.

Macdonald suggests that

unlike Wagner, Alkan did not seek to refashion the world through opera; nor, like Berlioz, to dazzle the crowds by putting orchestral music at the service of literary expression; nor even, as with Chopin or Liszt, to extend the field of harmonic idiom. Armed with his key instrument, the piano, he sought incessantly to transcend its inherent technical limits, remaining apparently insensible to the restrictions which had withheld more restrained composers.

However, not all of Alkan's music is either lengthy or technically difficult; for example, many of the Op. 31 "Préludes" and of the set of "Esquisses", Op. 63.

Moreover, in terms of structure, Alkan in his compositions sticks to traditional <a href="musical%20form">musical form</a>s, although he often took them to extremes, as he did with piano technique. The study Op. 39, no. 8 (the first movement of the "Concerto for solo piano") takes almost half an hour in performance. Describing this "gigantic" piece, Ronald Smith comments that it convinces for the same reasons as does the music of the classical masters; "the underlying unity of its principal themes, and a <a href="key%20%28music%29">key</a> structure that is basically simple and sound."

Some of Alkan's music gives hints of the obsessiveness which some have detected in his personality. The "Chant" Op. 38, no. 2, entitled "<a href="F%20%28musical%20note%29">Fa</a>", repeats the note of its title incessantly (in total 414 times) against shifting harmonies which make it "cut ... into the texture with the ruthless precision of a <a href="laser">laser</a> beam." In modelling his five sets of "Chants" on the first book of Mendelssohn's "<a href="Songs%20Without%20Words">Songs Without Words</a>", Alkan ensured that the pieces in each of his sets followed precisely the same key signatures, and even the moods, of the original. Alkan was rigorous in his <a href="enharmonic">enharmonic</a> spelling, occasionally <a href="Modulation%20%28music%29">modulating</a> to keys containing <a href="double-sharp">double-sharp</a>s or <a href="double-flat">double-flat</a>s, so pianists are occasionally required to come to terms with unusual keys such as E major, the enharmonic equivalent to <a href="F%20major">F major</a>, and the occasional triple-sharp.

Alkan's earliest works indicate, according to Smith, that in his early teens he "was a formidable musician but as yet ... industrious rather than ... creative". Only with his 12 "Caprices" (Opp.12–13 and 15–16, 1837) did his compositions begin to attract serious critical attention. The op. 15 set, "Souvenirs: Trois morceaux dans le genre pathétique", dedicated to Liszt, contains "Le vent (The Wind)", which was at one time the only piece by the composer to figure regularly in recitals. These works, however, did not meet with the approval of <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>, who wrote: "One is startled by such false, such unnatural art ... the last [piece, titled "Morte (Death)", is] a crabbed waste, overgrown with brush and weeds ... nothing is to be found but black on black". Ronald Smith, however, finds in this latter work, which cites the "<a href="Dies%20Irae">Dies Irae</a>" theme also used by Berlioz, Liszt and others, foreshadowings of <a href="Maurice%20Ravel">Maurice Ravel</a>, <a href="Modest%20Mussorgsky">Modest Mussorgsky</a> and <a href="Charles%20Ives">Charles Ives</a>. Schumann did, however, respond positively to the pieces of "Les mois" (originally part published as Op. 8 in 1838, later published as a complete set in 1840 as Op. 74): "[Here] we find such an excellent jest on operatic music in no. 6 ["L'Opéra"] that a better one could scarcely be imagined ... The composer ... well understands the rarer effects of his instrument." Alkan's technical mastery of the keyboard was asserted by the publication in 1838 of the "Trois grandes études" (originally without opus number, later republished as Op. 76), the first for the left hand alone, the second for the right hand alone, the third for both hands; and all of great difficulty, described by Smith as "a peak of pianistic transcendentalism". This is perhaps the earliest example of writing for a single hand as "an entity in its own right, capable of covering all registers of the piano, of rendering itself as accompanied soloist or <a href="polyphony">polyphonist</a>."

Alkan's large scale "Duo" (in effect a sonata) Op. 21 for violin and piano (dedicated to <a href="Chr%C3%A9tien%20Urhan">Chrétien Urhan</a>) and his Piano Trio Op. 30 appeared in 1841. Apart from these, Alkan published only a few minor works between 1840 and 1844, after which a series of virtuoso works was issued, many of which he had played at his successful recitals at Érard and elsewhere; these included the "Marche funèbre" (Op. 26), the "Marche triomphale " (Op. 27) and "Le chemin de fer" (also published, separately, as Op. 27). In 1847 appeared the Op. 31 "Préludes" and his first large-scale unified piano work, the Grande sonate "Les quatre âges" (Op. 33). The sonata is structurally innovative in two ways; each movement is slower than its predecessor, and the work anticipates the practice of <a href="progressive%20tonality">progressive tonality</a>, beginning in <a href="D%20major">D major</a> and ending in <a href="G-sharp%20minor">G minor</a>. Dedicated to Alkan Morhange, the sonata depicts in its successive movements its 'hero' at the ages of 20 (optimistic), 30 (""Quasi-<a href="Faust">Faust</a>"", impassioned and fatalistic), 40 (domesticated) and 50 (suffering: the movement is prefaced by a quotation from <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a>'s "<a href="Prometheus%20Unbound%20%28Aeschylus%29">Prometheus Unbound</a>"). In 1848 followed Alkan's set of "12 études dans tous les tons majeurs" Op. 35, whose substantial pieces range in mood from the hectic "Allegro barbaro" (no. 5) and the intense "Chant d'amour-Chant de mort (Song of Love – Song of Death)" (no. 10) to the descriptive and picturesque "L'incendie au village voisin (The Fire in the Next Village)" (no. 7).

A number of Alkan's compositions from this period were never performed and have been lost. Among the missing works are some string <a href="sextet">sextet</a>s and a full-scale orchestral <a href="symphony">symphony</a> in <a href="B%20minor">B minor</a>, which was described in an article in 1846 by the critic Léon Kreutzer, to whom Alkan had shown the score. Kreutzer noted that the introductory "<a href="Tempo%23Basic%20tempo%20markings">adagio</a>" of the symphony was headed "by Hebrew characters in red ink ... This is no less than the verse from <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis</a>: And God said, Let there be light: and there was light." Kreutzer opined that, set beside Alkan's conception, <a href="Joseph%20Haydn">Joseph Haydn</a>'s "<a href="The%20Creation%20%28Haydn%29">Creation</a>" was a "mere candle ("lampion")." A further missing work is a one-act opera, mentioned frequently in the French musical press of 1846-7 as being shortly to be produced at the <a href="Op%C3%A9ra-Comique">Opéra-Comique</a>, which however never materialized. Alkan also referred to this work in a letter of 1847 to the musicologist <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois-Joseph%20F%C3%A9tis">François-Joseph Fétis</a>, stating that it had been written "a few years ago." Its subject, title and librettist remain unknown.

During his twenty-year absence from the public between 1853 and 1873 Alkan produced many of his most notable compositions, although there is a ten-year gap between publication of the Op. 35 studies and that of his next group of piano works in 1856 and 1857. Of these, undoubtedly the most significant was the enormous Opus 39 collection of twelve studies in all the minor keys, which contains the "<a href="Symphony%20for%20Solo%20Piano%20%28Charles-Valentin%20Alkan%29">Symphony for Solo Piano</a>" (numbers four, five, six and seven), and the "<a href="Concerto%20for%20solo%20piano%20%28Alkan%29">Concerto for Solo Piano</a>" (numbers eight, nine and ten). The "Concerto" takes nearly an hour in performance. Number twelve of Op. 39 is a set of variations, "<a href="Le%20festin%20d%27%C3%89sope">Le festin d'Ésope</a>" ("<a href="Aesop">Aesop</a>'s Feast"). The other components of Op. 39 are of a similar stature. Smith describes Op. 39 as a whole as "a towering achievement, gathering ... the most complete manifestation of Alkan's many-sided genius: its dark passion, its vital rhythmic drive, its pungent harmony, its occasionally outrageous humour, and, above all, its uncompromising piano writing."

In the same year appeared the "Sonate de Concert", Op. 47, for cello and piano, "among the most difficult and ambitious in the romantic repertoire ... anticipating <a href="Gustav%20Mahler">Mahler</a> in its juxtaposition of the sublime and the trivial". In the opinion of the musicologist Brigitte François-Sappey, its four movements again show an anticipation of progressive tonality, each ascending by a <a href="major%20third">major third</a>. Other anticipations of Mahler (who was born in 1860) can be found in the two "military" Op. 50 piano studies of 1859 "Capriccio alla soldatesca" and "Le tambour bat aux champs (The drum beats the retreat)", as well as in certain of the miniatures of the 1861 "Esquisses", Op. 63. The bizarre and unclassifiable "Marcia funebre, sulla morte d'un Pappagallo" ("<a href="Funeral%20march">Funeral march</a> on the death of a parrot", 1859), for three <a href="oboe">oboe</a>s, <a href="bassoon">bassoon</a> and voices, described by Kenneth Hamilton as "<a href="Dead%20Parrot%20sketch">Monty-Pythonesque</a>", is also of this period.

The "Esquisses" of 1861 are a set of highly varied miniatures, ranging from the tiny 18-bar no. 4, "Les cloches (The Bells)", to the strident <a href="tone%20cluster">tone cluster</a>s of no. 45, "Les diablotins (The Imps)", and closing with a further evocation of church bells in no. 49, "Laus Deo (Praise God)." They were preceded in publication by Alkan's deceptively titled "Sonatine", Op. 61, in 'classical' format, but a work of "ruthless economy [which] although it plays for less than twenty minutes ... is in every way a major work."

Two of Alkan's substantial works from this period are musical paraphrases of literary works. "Salut, cendre du pauvre", Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem "La Mélancolie" by <a href="Gabriel-Marie%20Legouv%C3%A9">Gabriel-Marie Legouvé</a>; while "Super flumina Babylonis", Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of <a href="Psalm%20137">Psalm 137</a> ("By the waters of Babylon ..."). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of "Chants" inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces.

Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his "Benedictus", Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight <a href="Gregorian%20mode">Gregorian mode</a>s (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith's opinion, "seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space", and which he believes reveal "Alkan's essential spiritual modesty." These were followed by pieces such as the "13 Prières (Prayers)", Op. 64 (1865), and the "Impromptu sur le Choral de <a href="Martin%20Luther">Luther</a> "<a href="A%20Mighty%20Fortress%20Is%20Our%20God">Un fort rempart est notre Dieu</a>" ", op. 69 (1866). Alkan also issued a book of 12 studies for the <a href="Pedal%20keyboard">pedalboard</a> alone (no opus number, 1866) and the "Bombardo-carillon" for pedalboard duet (four feet) of 1872.

Alkan's return to the concert platform at his "Petits Concerts", however, marked the end of his publications; his final work to be issued was the "Toccatina", Op. 75, in 1872.

Alkan had few followers; however, he had important admirers, including Liszt, <a href="Anton%20Rubinstein">Anton Rubinstein</a>, Franck, and, in the early twentieth century, Busoni, <a href="Egon%20Petri">Petri</a> and <a href="Kaikhosru%20Shapurji%20Sorabji">Sorabji</a>. Rubinstein dedicated his fifth piano concerto to him, and Franck dedicated to Alkan his "Grand pièce symphonique" op. 17 for organ. Busoni ranked Alkan with Liszt, Chopin, Schumann and <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> as one of the five greatest composers for the piano since Beethoven. Isidor Philipp and Delaborde edited new printings of his works in the early 1900s. In the first half of the twentieth century, when Alkan's name was still obscure, Busoni and Petri included his works in their performances. Sorabji published an article on Alkan in his 1932 book "Around Music"; he promoted Alkan's music in his reviews and criticism, and his Sixth Symphony for Piano ("Symphonia claviensis") (1975–76), includes a section entitled "Quasi Alkan". The English composer and writer <a href="Bernard%20van%20Dieren">Bernard van Dieren</a> praised Alkan in an essay in his 1935 book, "Down Among the Dead Men", and the composer <a href="Humphrey%20Searle">Humphrey Searle</a> also called for a revival of his music in a 1937 essay. The pianist and writer <a href="Charles%20Rosen">Charles Rosen</a> however considered Alkan "a minor figure", whose only music of interest comes after 1850 as an extension of Liszt's techniques and of "the operatic techniques of Meyerbeer."

For much of the 20th century, Alkan's work remained in obscurity, but from the 1960s onwards it was steadily revived. <a href="Raymond%20Lewenthal">Raymond Lewenthal</a> gave a pioneering extended broadcast on Alkan on <a href="WBAI">WBAI</a> radio in New York in 1963, and later included Alkan's music in recitals and recordings. The English pianist <a href="Ronald%20Smith%20%28musician%29">Ronald Smith</a> championed Alkan's music through performances, recordings, a biography and the Alkan Society of which he was president for many years. Works by Alkan have also been recorded by <a href="Jack%20Gibbons">Jack Gibbons</a>, <a href="Marc-Andr%C3%A9%20Hamelin">Marc-André Hamelin</a>, <a href="Mark%20Latimer">Mark Latimer</a>, <a href="John%20Ogdon">John Ogdon</a>, and <a href="H%C3%BCseyin%20Sermet">Hüseyin Sermet</a>, among many others. <a href="Ronald%20Stevenson">Ronald Stevenson</a> has composed a piano piece "Festin d'Alkan" (referring to Alkan's Op. 39, no. 12) and the composer <a href="Michael%20Finnissy">Michael Finnissy</a> has also written piano pieces referring to Alkan, e.g. "Alkan-Paganini", no. 5 of "The History of Photography in Sound". Marc-André Hamelin's "Étude No. IV" is a <a href="perpetual%20motion">moto perpetuo</a> study combining themes from Alkan's <a href="Symphony%20for%20Solo%20Piano%20%28Charles-Valentin%20Alkan%29">Symphony</a>, Op. 39, no. 7, and Alkan's own perpetual motion étude, Op. 76, no. 3. It is dedicated to Averil Kovacs and François Luguenot, respectively activists in the English and French Alkan Societies. As Hamelin writes in his preface to this étude, the idea to combine these came from the composer <a href="Alistair%20Hinton">Alistair Hinton</a>, the finale of whose Piano Sonata No. 5 (1994–95) includes a substantial section entitled "Alkanique".

Alkan's compositions for organ have been among the last of his works to be brought back to the repertoire. As to Alkan's pedal-piano works, due to a recent revival of the instrument, they are once again being performed as originally intended (rather than on an organ), such as by Italian pedal-pianist <a href="Roberto%20Prosseda">Roberto Prosseda</a>, and recordings of Alkan on the pedal piano have been made by <a href="Jean%20Dub%C3%A9%20%28musician%29">Jean Dubé</a> and <a href="Olivier%20Latry">Olivier Latry</a>.

This list comprises a selection of some premiere and other recordings by musicians who have become closely associated with Alkan's works. A comprehensive discography is available at the Alkan Society website.

Jarome Arthur-Leigh Adekunle Tig Junior Elvis Iginla (; born July 1, 1977) is a Canadian former professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="Forward%20%28ice%20hockey%29">forward</a>. He played over 1500 games in the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) for the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a>, <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>, <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>, <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> and <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>.

As a <a href="junior%20ice%20hockey">junior</a>, Iginla was a member of two <a href="Memorial%20Cup">Memorial Cup</a> winning teams with the <a href="Kamloops%20Blazers">Kamloops Blazers</a> and was named the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League">Western Hockey League</a> (WHL) <a href="Four%20Broncos%20Memorial%20Trophy">Player of the Year</a> in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20WHL%20season">1996</a>. He was selected 11th overall by the <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a> in the <a href="1995%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1995 NHL Entry Draft</a>, but was traded to Calgary prior to making his NHL debut. He led the NHL in goals and points in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02</a>, and won the <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson%20Award">Lester B. Pearson Award</a> as its most valuable player as voted by the players. In <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season">2003–04</a>, Iginla led the league in goals for the second time and captained the Flames to the <a href="2004%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Finals</a>, leading the playoffs in goals.

A six-time <a href="National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star</a>, Iginla is the Flames' all-time leader in goals, points, and games played, and is second in assists to <a href="Al%20MacInnis">Al MacInnis</a>. Iginla <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%2050-goal%20seasons">scored 50 goals</a> in a season on two occasions and is one of seven players in NHL history to score 30 goals in 11 consecutive seasons. He is one of 20 players in NHL history to score over <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%20500%20goals">600 goals</a> and is one of 34 players to record <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201000%20points">1,300 points</a> in his career. He is a past winner of the <a href="Mark%20Messier%20Leadership%20Award">Mark Messier Leadership Award</a> and has been recognized by both the Flames and the league for his community work; while a member of the Flames, Iginla donated $2,000 to the children's charity Kidsport for every goal he scored. His number 12 was retired by the Flames during a pre-game ceremony on March 2, 2019.

Internationally, Iginla has represented <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canada</a> on numerous occasions. He was a member of championship teams at the <a href="1996%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1996 World Junior</a> and <a href="1997%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1997 World Championships</a> as well as the <a href="2004%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">2004 World Cup of Hockey</a>. He is a three-time Olympian and two-time gold medal winner, including at the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a> where he helped lead Canada to its first Olympic hockey championship in 50 years.

Iginla was born in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, and raised in the adjoining city of <a href="St.%20Albert%2C%20Alberta">St. Albert</a>. His father, a lawyer, was originally from Nigeria and changed his first name from Adekunle to Elvis when he arrived in Canada. His surname means "Big tree" in <a href="Yoruba%20language">Yoruba</a>, his father's native language. Iginla's mother, Susan, is originally from <a href="Oregon">Oregon</a>, and has worked as a massage therapist and music teacher. Iginla grew up with his mother and grandparents after his parents divorced when he was a year old.

In addition to hockey, Iginla played <a href="baseball">baseball</a> as a young man and was the <a href="catcher">catcher</a> on the Canadian national junior team. He credits his grandfather for his hockey career, as with his mother working and father attending law school, he would not have had the opportunity to play sports at a high level if not for his grandfather's support. Iginla grew up admiring other black hockey players, including <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a> <a href="goaltender">goaltender</a> <a href="Grant%20Fuhr">Grant Fuhr</a>. Emulating Fuhr, Iginla played goaltender in his first two years of organized hockey before switching to the <a href="winger%20%28ice%20hockey%29">right wing</a>. He played his entire minor hockey career in St. Albert, leading the <a href="Alberta%20Midget%20Hockey%20League">Alberta Midget Hockey League</a> in scoring as a 15-year-old with 87 points for the St. Albert Midget Raiders in 1992–93.

Iginla played three years with the <a href="Kamloops%20Blazers">Kamloops Blazers</a> of the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League">Western Hockey League</a> (WHL). As a 16-year-old in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20WHL%20season">1993–94</a>, he recorded six goals and 29 points in 48 regular season games before playing an additional 19 in the playoffs. The Blazers captured both the <a href="Ed%20Chynoweth%20Cup">league title</a> and the <a href="1994%20Memorial%20Cup">1994 Memorial Cup</a>, Canada's national junior championship. In reference to the Blazers' dominance of the league at the time (they had won their third WHL title in five seasons), Iginla described the expectations of success as being similar to those placed on the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>, the NHL's most successful franchise: "When you put on a Blazers jersey, it's like putting on the Canadiens'. You've got to perform."

Iginla scored 33 goals and 71 points in <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20WHL%20season">1994–95</a>, his first full WHL season. The Blazers repeated as league champions, earning a trip to the <a href="1995%20Memorial%20Cup">1995 Memorial Cup</a>. Iginla scored five goals in the tournament to lead the Blazers to a second consecutive national championship. He received the <a href="George%20Parsons%20Trophy">George Parsons Trophy</a> as the most sportsmanlike player of the tournament.

The <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a> selected Iginla with their first pick, 11th overall, in the <a href="1995%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1995 NHL Entry Draft</a>; however, on December 20, 1995, they traded him to the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a>, along with <a href="Corey%20Millen">Corey Millen</a>, for the rights to forward <a href="Joe%20Nieuwendyk">Joe Nieuwendyk</a>, who was then in a contract dispute with the Flames.

In his final season in Kamloops in <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20WHL%20season">1995–96</a>, Iginla finished fourth in league scoring with 136 points, including 63 goals in 63 games played, and was awarded the <a href="Four%20Broncos%20Memorial%20Trophy">Four Broncos Memorial Trophy</a> as the league's most outstanding player. The Blazers were upset in the Western Conference Final by the <a href="Spokane%20Chiefs">Spokane Chiefs</a>, but Iginla still finished fourth in playoff scoring, recording 29 points in 16 games. His performance during the season earned him an invitation to play for <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> at the <a href="1996%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a> in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>, where he led the tournament in scoring with 12 points and helped Canada to its fourth consecutive gold medal.

Iginla made his NHL debut in the <a href="1996%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">1996 Stanley Cup playoffs</a>, as he was signed to a contract and flown to Calgary immediately after his junior season ended in Kamloops. He appeared in two games for the Flames in their series against the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a>. In doing so, he became the first 18-year-old to play for the Flames since <a href="Dan%20Quinn%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Dan Quinn</a> in 1983. In his first NHL game, Iginla assisted on a <a href="Theoren%20Fleury">Theoren Fleury</a> goal to record his first point; he scored his first goal in his second game. He remained with the Flames, and played his first NHL season in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season">1996–97</a>. He earned a spot on that year's <a href="NHL%20All-Rookie%20Team">NHL All-Rookie Team</a> and finished as the runner-up to <a href="Bryan%20Berard">Bryan Berard</a> in voting for the <a href="Calder%20Memorial%20Trophy">Calder Memorial Trophy</a> as rookie of the year after leading all first-year players in scoring with 50 points.

By his third season, <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">1998–99</a>, Iginla led the Flames in goals with 28. His success complicated negotiations for a new contract, as he and the Flames struggled to agree on a new deal following the season. Hoping to help resolve the contract impasse, Iginla agreed to attend training camp without a contract and purchased his own insurance as the team would not have been responsible financially if he suffered an injury. He remained without a contract at the start of the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">1999–2000 season</a> and missed the first three games as a holdout before signing a three-year deal worth <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>4.9 million, plus bonuses. He finished the year with career highs in goals (29) and points (63). He then topped both marks in <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season">2000–01</a> by recording 31 goals and 71 points.

After participating in Canada's Olympic summer camp before the season, Iginla again set new personal highs in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02</a> when he registered 52 goals and 96 points. This season elevated Iginla to superstar status. He earned the <a href="Art%20Ross%20Trophy">Art Ross</a> and <a href="Maurice%20%26quot%3BRocket%26quot%3B%20Richard%20Trophy">Maurice Richard</a> trophies as the NHL's leading point and goal scorer, respectively. He was also awarded the <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson%20Award">Lester B. Pearson Award</a> as the league's most valuable player as voted by his peers, and was a nominee for both the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> and the <a href="King%20Clancy%20Memorial%20Trophy">King Clancy Memorial Trophy</a>. The Hart Trophy voting proved to be controversial: Iginla tied Canadiens goaltender <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Th%C3%A9odore">José Théodore</a> in voting points, but received fewer first place votes than Théodore. However, one voter, rumoured to be from <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>—Théodore and the Canadiens' home province—inexplicably left Iginla off his ballot. As a result of the controversy that followed, the Professional Hockey Writers Association changed the rules on how its members voted for the award to prevent a recurrence.

There were fears Iginla would again hold out after his contract expired following the season. They were unfounded, however, as he signed a two-year, $13 million deal before the season and was looked on to again lead the Flames offensively. Iginla fell back to 67 points in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">2002–03</a> as injuries, including a lingering finger dislocation following a fight, diminished his play. His 35 goals were still enough to lead the Flames for the fourth time in five seasons. Despite his offensive contributions, the Flames missed the playoffs.

At the start of the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season">2003–04 season</a>, Iginla was named the 18th captain in Flames franchise history, and 14th since the team moved to Calgary from <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> in 1980. His predecessor as captain, <a href="Craig%20Conroy">Craig Conroy</a>, cited Iginla's experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy. "He was a leader on that team and old enough to where he'd been there a long time. It was time for him. He took us to the Stanley Cup Final that year so it worked out pretty well." Iginla was reported to be the first black captain in NHL history, though former Blackhawks captain <a href="Dirk%20Graham">Dirk Graham</a>, who is of African descent, has also been said to hold that honour.
Iginla responded to being named captain by capturing his second <a href="Maurice%20%26quot%3BRocket%26quot%3B%20Richard%20Trophy">Rocket Richard Trophy</a>, sharing the goal-scoring title with <a href="Ilya%20Kovalchuk">Ilya Kovalchuk</a> and <a href="Rick%20Nash">Rick Nash</a> with 41 goals. The Flames qualified for the <a href="2004%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2004 Stanley Cup playoffs</a> as the sixth seed, the team's first playoff appearance in eight years. Iginla led all playoff scorers with 13 goals as he captained the Flames to their first <a href="2004%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup finals</a> appearance in 15 years. The Flames were unable to defeat the <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a>, however, falling to the <a href="Eastern%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Eastern Conference</a> champions in seven games. A dejected Iginla sat in the Flames locker room after the final game and was met by his father, who told his son that "I'm proud of you. All of Canada is proud of you."

While he was hailed as the best player in the world following his performance in the playoffs, Iginla spent the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lock-out</a> focused on improving his game further. Following the lock-out, he was named as one of six player representatives on the newly created NHL competition committee, with a mandate to suggest recommendations for ways to improve the game. He held this position until early 2008.

On December 7, 2006, Iginla reached career milestones when he scored his 300th career goal and 600th career point against the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a>. He was expected to play in the <a href="55th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">2007 NHL All-Star Game</a> in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>; however, he missed the game with a knee injury. The injury kept him out of 12 games in <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2006–07</a>. He nevertheless scored 94 points, including a career-high 55 assists.

The <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08</a> season saw Iginla post his second career 50 goal season, adding 48 assists for a career high 98 points, good for third overall in the league. He was voted to the starting line-up of the <a href="56th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">2008 NHL All-Star Game</a> along with teammate <a href="Dion%20Phaneuf">Dion Phaneuf</a>, and was named captain of the Western All-Star Team. He broke the Flames' franchise record for games played when he played his 804th career game on November 29, 2007, against the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Anaheim Ducks</a>. He also broke <a href="Theoren%20Fleury">Theoren Fleury</a>'s franchise record for goals when he scored his 365th on March 10, 2008, against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>. Iginla was nominated as a Hart Trophy finalist for league most valuable player for the third time, though he again did not win the award. During the season, he signed a five-year contract extension with the Flames at $7 million per season.

Iginla continued his pursuit of Fleury's franchise record of 830 points in <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09</a>. He recorded his 800th point with a first period assist against the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> on December 19, 2008. He ended 2008 with a career high five points in a New Year's Eve game against the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>. He had 14 previous four point games. In January, he was named to the <a href="2009%20NHL%20All-Star%20Game">2009 NHL All-Star Game</a> in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, his fifth such selection. Representing the <a href="Western%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Western Conference</a>, Iginla scored his first career NHL All-Star Game goal in a 12–11 shootout loss. He passed Fleury as the Flames' all-time scoring leader on March 1, 2009, by recording five points, including his 400th career goal, in an 8–6 loss to the Lightning. He finished the season with 35 goals and 89 points, but a disappointing playoff performance led to questions of whether he had been playing with an injury. Iginla quickly denied the rumour, admitted that he had not played with the level of consistency he expected and stated that he would spend the summer focused on improving his play in <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NHL%20season">2009–10</a>.

The Flames struggled in 2009–10, failing to qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2003. Iginla accepted responsibility for the team's failure, admitting that finishing around 70 points for the season was "not enough". The Flames' declining fortunes and Iginla's season led to increasing questions on whether he could be traded from the team with whom he has played his entire NHL career. Iginla, who would have to approve any trade the team attempts to make due to a no-movement clause in his contract, expressed that he did not wish to leave Calgary, but would accommodate a trade if the Flames wished to do so. Former Flames' general manager <a href="Craig%20Button">Craig Button</a> argued against trading Iginla, blaming a lack of complementary players for both Iginla and Calgary's failures: "There's nothing easier in hockey than to be able to shut down one player. And the Calgary Flames, I would argue, have made it really easy for teams to shut down Jarome." The Flames publicly stated that they had no plans to trade him.

Individually, Iginla reached 900 career points in a two-goal, two-assist effort against the Oilers on January 30, 2010. Six nights later, he played his <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201000%20games%20played">1,000th career game</a> against the <a href="Florida%20Panthers">Florida Panthers</a>. Iginla struggled offensively to begin the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2010–11 season</a>, and with the Flames falling to the bottom of the standings, there was renewed speculation over his future in Calgary. Team management repeatedly reiterated that they were not interested in moving him to another team. Improving his game as the season wore on, Iginla reached another personal milestone, recording his 500th career assist on January 11, 2011, the same day he was named to play in his sixth All-Star Game. He announced several days later that he had declined to play in the All-Star Game as he wished to spend the time with his ailing grandmother.

Iginla scored his 30th goal of the season on a penalty shot against the <a href="Nashville%20Predators">Nashville Predators</a> on March 6, 2011, and in doing so became the 10th player in NHL history to score at least 30 goals in ten consecutive seasons. A month later, he scored his <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%201000%20points">1,000th career point</a>, notching the game-winning goal against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> in a 3–2 win on April 1, 2011.

Iginla scored his <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20players%20with%20500%20goals">500th goal</a> on January 7, 2012, against <a href="Niklas%20B%C3%A4ckstr%C3%B6m">Niklas Bäckström</a> of the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a> in a 3–1 victory. He was the 42nd player in league history to achieve the feat, and the 15th to do so with one organization. Midway through the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20NHL%20season">2011–12 season</a>, Iginla was named an All-Star for the seventh time in his career (the sixth played), representing the Flames at the <a href="59th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">2012 All-Star Game</a>.

Iginla scored his 30th goal of the 2011–12 season in a 3–2 win against <a href="goaltender">goaltender</a> <a href="Antti%20Niemi%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Antti Niemi</a> of the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a> on March 13, 2012. He is the seventh player in league history to score 30 goals in 11 consecutive seasons.

 Playing the final year of his contract in <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NHL%20season">2012–13</a> and with the team languishing near the bottom of the NHL standings, speculation about Iginla's future in Calgary was again raised as April 3, 2013, trade deadline neared. National media outlets reported that Iginla, who had a clause in his contract preventing the Flames from moving him to another team without his permission, had given the organization a list of four teams he would be willing to accept a trade with: the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a>, <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a>, <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> or <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a>. The Bruins were considered the leading contender to acquire Iginla's services, and after he was held out of the line-up of Calgary's March 27, 2013, game against the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a>, it was reported that a trade between the two teams had been completed. Instead, Iginla's 16-year career in Calgary ended when he was sent to the Penguins in exchange for Pittsburgh's first round selection at the <a href="2013%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2013 NHL Entry Draft</a> and college prospects <a href="Kenny%20Agostino">Kenny Agostino</a> and <a href="Ben%20Hanowski">Ben Hanowski</a>. Iginla stated that playing with <a href="Sidney%20Crosby">Sidney Crosby</a> and <a href="Evgeni%20Malkin">Evgeni Malkin</a> played a factor in his decision to move to the Penguins. The Bruins and Penguins met in the 2013 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite having the top scoring offence in the league, the Penguins lost the series without winning a game. Iginla, along with Crosby, Malkin, <a href="James%20Neal%20%28ice%20hockey%29">James Neal</a> and <a href="Kris%20Letang">Kris Letang</a>, registered a combined 0 points in the series. Iginla was moved to the third line after a 6–1 Game 2 loss. Bruins forward <a href="Milan%20Lucic">Milan Lucic</a> said after the series that Iginla's spurning of Boston ignited the series sweep: "When a guy chooses another team over your team, it does light a little bit of a fire underneath you."

As a <a href="free%20agent">free agent</a> following the season, Iginla chose to go to Boston and signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the Bruins. He required nine games before scoring his first goal as a Bruin, as part of a 2–1 win over the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>, but later settled in on Boston's first line with Milan Lucic and <a href="David%20Krej%C4%8D%C3%AD">David Krejčí</a>. He made his first return to Calgary on December 10, 2013, where the fans greeted him with a long standing ovation prior to the game as the Flames played a video tribute. Following the contest, a 2–1 Bruins victory, Iginla was named the game's third star and took two laps around the rink to more cheers from the crowd. He recorded his 600th career assist in a 3–1 victory over the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> on February 4, 2014.

<a href="NHL%20salary%20cap">Salary cap</a> constraints prevented the Bruins from re-signing Iginla. Consequently, he left the team as a free agent and signed a three-year, $16 million contract with the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a>. The Avalanche disappointed in <a href="2014%E2%80%9315%20NHL%20season">2014–15</a>; by mid-February, they stood in last place in the <a href="Central%20Division%20%28NHL%29">Central Division</a>, though Iginla himself was among the team's leading scorers. He led the team with 29 goals, however the Avalanche failed to qualify for the playoffs. On January 4, 2016, Iginla became the 19th player in NHL history to score 600 career goals. His milestone marker came in a 4–1 victory over the Los Angeles Kings. On December 10, 2016, Iginla played in his 1,500th NHL game, a 10–1 loss to the Montréal Canadiens. He is the 16th player to reach this milestone.

On March 1, 2017, Iginla was traded to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> for a <a href="2018%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2018</a> conditional fourth-round pick. He chose to wear the number 88, as number 12 was already taken by <a href="Mari%C3%A1n%20G%C3%A1bor%C3%ADk">Marián Gáborík</a>. As a 10-year-old, Iginla had purchased a Kings jersey and placed his name and the number 88 on the back after <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> was traded to the team. Kings general manager <a href="Dean%20Lombardi">Dean Lombardi</a> hoped a fresh start for Iginla would ignite him after playing for a struggling team in Colorado.

Iginla was not re-signed by the Kings for the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20NHL%20season">2017–18 season</a>. It was reported that he had hip surgery in the autumn of 2017, but that he hoped to make a return to the NHL when interviewed during a practice that he took part in with the <a href="Providence%20Bruins">Providence Bruins</a> in February 2018. On July 30, 2018, Iginla announced his retirement.

Iginla first represented Canada at the 1994 <a href="Ivan%20Hlinka%20Memorial%20Tournament">Nations Cup</a>, an unsanctioned tournament for players under the age of 18. He led Canada in scoring with five goals and nine points as it won the gold medal. Two years later, he joined the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">national junior team</a> at the <a href="1996%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships</a>. He led the tournament in scoring with five goals and 12 points as Canada won its fourth consecutive gold medal. He was named an all-star and the tournament's top forward. One year later, Iginla played in his first tournament with the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">senior team</a>, competing at the <a href="1997%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1997 World Championships</a> as a 19-year-old, the youngest player on the team. He recorded two goals and three assists in 11 games as Canada won the gold medal.

A late invitation to join Team Canada's summer camp in preparation for the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202002%20Winter%20Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a> helped Iginla emerge as a star player. He was so surprised by the invite he initially thought one of his <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> teammates was playing a prank on him. He scored two goals in the gold medal game, a 5–2 victory over the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">United States</a>, as Canada won its first Olympic gold medal in 50 years. With this win, Iginla became the first black man to win a gold medal at the Winter Olympics. Iginla also represented Canada at the <a href="2004%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">2004 World Cup of Hockey</a> as an alternate captain, playing on a line with <a href="Joe%20Sakic">Joe Sakic</a> and <a href="Mario%20Lemieux">Mario Lemieux</a>. Canada won the gold medal.

Iginla participated in his second Olympics and was an alternate captain at the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Turin</a> games, recording three points in six games. The Canadians were unable to defend their 2002 gold medal, losing to Russia in the quarter-finals. Named an alternate captain once again for the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 team</a> in Vancouver, he opened the tournament with a hat trick against Norway. He finished as the tournament leader with five goals, and assisted on <a href="Sidney%20Crosby">Sidney Crosby</a>'s overtime winning goal in the gold medal final against the United States.

In his prime, Iginla was considered to be one of the NHL's most prominent <a href="Power%20forward%20%28ice%20hockey%29">power forwards</a>. Upon entering the league, he tried to emulate players like <a href="Brendan%20Shanahan">Brendan Shanahan</a> and <a href="Keith%20Tkachuk">Keith Tkachuk</a>, hoping to match their combination of finesse and physicality. He is one of the most consistent scorers in the league; between 1998 and 2008, only <a href="Jarom%C3%ADr%20J%C3%A1gr">Jaromír Jágr</a> scored more NHL goals than Iginla. Even so, scouting reports have argued that Iginla's lack of speed makes it easier for opponents to isolate him and restrict his ability to move if his teammates rely on him too much to lead the offence.

The abuse he faced at the hands of opponents early in his NHL career prompted Iginla's coaches to work at developing his physical play. While he was not enthusiastic about fighting, Iginla accepted then head coach <a href="Brian%20Sutter">Brian Sutter</a>'s arguments that he needed to adopt a more aggressive style to improve as a player. Iginla is most effective when he has room to manoeuvre, and to create that space, he had to intimidate his opponents. The lessons Iginla learned have carried throughout his career. "You've got a power forward who does it all," said <a href="Craig%20Conroy">Craig Conroy</a>. "I mean, he'll fight, and hit, and score goals. Maybe it's not the end-to-end rushes, but he does all those little things that win games and get things done." His opponents also respect his play. <a href="Rob%20Blake">Rob Blake</a> said that while Iginla is not known for fancy play, "he'll run you over. Or he'll fight somebody. And then he'll score a goal. He does pretty much everything you'd want a guy to do."

Iginla has recorded several <a href="Gordie%20Howe%20hat%20trick">Gordie Howe hat trick</a>s – a fight, a goal and an assist in the same game – and as it is not an official statistic, "<a href="The%20Hockey%20News">The Hockey News</a>" estimated that as of 2012, he was the active leader with nine. His fights, including one with <a href="Tampa%20Bay%20Lightning">Tampa Bay Lightning</a> star <a href="Vincent%20Lecavalier">Vincent Lecavalier</a> in the <a href="2004%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">2004 Stanley Cup Finals</a>, have had a motivating effect on his play and that of his teammates. Iginla has suffered injuries as a result of his fighting, including a broken hand from a 2003 fight with <a href="Bill%20Guerin">Bill Guerin</a> of the <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a>. His physical style of play also leads to a greater risk of persistent injuries and <a href="Penalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29">penalties</a>. Iginla's truculent style of play has gained approval from hockey commentator Don Cherry.

He commands the respect of his peers, and has been known to stand up to the coaching staff to defend a fellow player. Former teammate <a href="Andrew%20Ference">Andrew Ference</a> — a former Bruins player himself, before Iginla's arrival on the Boston team's roster — once described following Iginla as like "following a friend." Preferring to lead by example, Iginla is not regarded as a vocal captain. He likes to speak with players individually, and tries to ensure that all of his teammates are comfortable. He was named the recipient of the <a href="Mark%20Messier%20Leadership%20Award">Mark Messier Leadership Award</a> in 2009.

Iginla married his high school sweetheart, Kara, and the couple has three children: daughter Jade and sons Tij and Joe. They had been dating since they were in grade eight. He has two half-brothers, Jason and Stephen, and two half-sisters, Theresa and Elizabeth. Theresa played for the <a href="University%20of%20Saskatchewan%20Huskies">University of Saskatchewan Huskies</a> women's hockey team for three seasons from 2004 to 2007. Jarome is an avid <a href="golf">golf</a>er and a regular participant in the Calgary Flames Celebrity Charity Golf Classic.

Iginla is well known for his kind-hearted nature. Former Flames General manager <a href="Craig%20Button">Craig Button</a> described Iginla as being grounded: "He doesn't carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He's confident in his abilities. He's self-assured. He's genuine. He's a better person than he is a player, and we all know what kind of player he is." In 2002, while in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a> for the <a href="2002%20Winter%20Olympics">Winter Olympic Games</a>, Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table, and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel. He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.

Since 2002, he has operated the Jarome Iginla Hockey School in Calgary as a non-profit organization, donating proceeds to the Diabetes Research Association. In 2004, he was awarded the <a href="NHL%20Foundation%20Player%20Award">NHL Foundation Player Award</a> for his community service and the <a href="King%20Clancy%20Memorial%20Trophy">King Clancy Memorial Trophy</a> in recognition of his humanitarian contributions. Iginla supports many charities. In 2000, he began donating $1,000 per goal he scored to <a href="KidSport">KidSport</a>, a figure he doubled to $2,000 in 2005. Between 2000 and 2013, he donated more than $700,000 from this initiative.

Iginla is a part owner of the <a href="Kamloops%20Blazers">Kamloops Blazers</a> of the <a href="Western%20Hockey%20League">Western Hockey League</a>, for whom he played during his junior hockey days. He purchased a minority share in the franchise, along with fellow NHL players <a href="Shane%20Doan">Shane Doan</a>, <a href="Mark%20Recchi">Mark Recchi</a> and <a href="Darryl%20Sydor">Darryl Sydor</a>, in October 2007. He is also an ambassador with the <a href="NHL%20Diversity">NHL Diversity</a> program, which supports youth hockey organizations that offer economically disadvantaged kids the opportunity to play. Since 2008, he has been a hockey spokesperson for <a href="Scotiabank">Scotiabank</a>, appearing in commercials and at events supporting its grassroots hockey programs, as well as for <a href="Samsung%20Canada">Samsung Canada</a>.

Iginla is also a Christian, which is his father's faith, and was the cover athlete and spokesperson for the <a href="EA%20Sports">EA Sports</a> video game <a href="NHL%202003">NHL 2003</a>.

Roberto Luongo

Roberto Luongo (, , ; born April 4, 1979) is a Canadian professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> <a href="goaltender">goaltender</a> for the <a href="Florida%20Panthers">Florida Panthers</a> of the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL). Born in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, he is of Italian and Irish ancestry. He employs the <a href="butterfly%20style">butterfly style</a> of goaltending, and has previously played in the NHL for the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a> and the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a>. Luongo is a two-time <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Team">NHL Second All-Star</a> (<a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season">2004</a> and <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2007</a>) and a winner of the <a href="William%20M.%20Jennings%20Trophy">William M. Jennings Trophy</a> for backstopping his team to the lowest <a href="goals-against%20average">goals-against average</a> in the league (<a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2011</a>; with backup <a href="Cory%20Schneider">Cory Schneider</a>). He has additionally been a finalist for the <a href="Vezina%20Trophy">Vezina Trophy</a> as the league's best goaltender (2004, 2007 and 2011), the <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson%20Award">Lester B. Pearson Award</a> as the top player voted by his peers (2004 and 2007) and the <a href="Hart%20Memorial%20Trophy">Hart Memorial Trophy</a> as the league's most valuable player (2007). Luongo is second-all time in games played as an NHL goaltender, and is third all-time in wins. 

Prior to his NHL career, Luongo played in the <a href="Quebec%20Major%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">Quebec Major Junior Hockey League</a> (QMJHL) for the <a href="Val-d%27Or%20Foreurs">Val-d'Or Foreurs</a> and the <a href="Acadie-Bathurst%20Titan">Acadie-Bathurst Titan</a>, winning back-to-back <a href="President%27s%20Cup%20%28QMJHL%29">President's Cups</a> and establishing the league's all-time play-off records in games played and wins. Following his second QMJHL season, Luongo was selected fourth overall by the Islanders in the <a href="1997%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1997 NHL Entry Draft</a>. After splitting his professional rookie season between the Islanders and their <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL) affiliate, the <a href="Lowell%20Lock%20Monsters">Lowell Lock Monsters</a> in <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NHL%20season">1999–2000</a>, he was traded to the Panthers. In five seasons with Florida, Luongo established team all-time records for most games played, wins and shutouts. During the 2006 off-season, he was traded to the Canucks after failed contract negotiations with the Panthers. Following his second year with the Canucks, he became the first NHL goaltender to serve as a <a href="captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">team captain</a> since <a href="Bill%20Durnan">Bill Durnan</a> in the <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20NHL%20season">1947–48 season</a>. Luongo served in that capacity for two seasons before resigning from the position in September 2010. In the subsequent 2010–11 season, he helped the Canucks to Game 7 of the <a href="2011%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Finals</a> and lost to the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>. During his tenure with Vancouver, Luongo became the team's all-time wins and shutouts leader.

Internationally, Luongo has competed for <a href="Canada%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> in numerous tournaments. As a junior, he won a silver medal at the <a href="1999%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1999 World Junior Championships</a>, while being named <a href="List%20of%20IIHF%20World%20Under%2020%20Championship%20Directorate%20award%20winners">Best Goaltender</a> in his second tournament appearance. Luongo has won two gold medals at the <a href="2003%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2003</a> and <a href="2004%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2004 World Championships</a> and a silver in the <a href="2005%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2005 World Championships</a>. He also won the <a href="2004%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">2004 World Cup</a> championship and appeared in the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Turin">Turin</a> as a backup to <a href="Martin%20Brodeur">Martin Brodeur</a> in both instances. He succeeded Brodeur as Canada's starting goaltender during the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, winning a gold medal. On January 7, 2014, he was named to the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team%23Players">2014 Canadian Olympic Hockey Team</a>, where he won his second Olympic gold medal in a largely backup role to <a href="Carey%20Price">Carey Price</a>.

Luongo was born to Pasqualina and Antonio Luongo in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>. His father is an Italian immigrant, born in <a href="Santa%20Paolina">Santa Paolina</a>, <a href="Avellino">Avellino</a>. He worked in the construction and delivery of furniture, while Luongo's mother, an Irish-Canadian worked in <a href="marketing">marketing</a> with <a href="Air%20Canada">Air Canada</a>. Antonio and Pasqualina married in Montreal after Antonio emigrated there in 1976.

Luongo has two younger brothers, Leo and Fabio, who were also aspiring goaltenders. Fabio progressed the further of the two, playing Junior A in the <a href="British%20Columbia%20Hockey%20League">British Columbia Hockey League</a> (BCHL) with the <a href="Williams%20Lake%20Timberwolves">Williams Lake Timberwolves</a> in 2004–05 before succumbing to injuries. He has since become a Junior AAA coach, while Leo is a goaltending coach with <a href="HC%20Lugano">HC Lugano</a>. Luongo and his family lived in <a href="St.%20Leonard%2C%20Quebec">St. Leonard, Quebec</a>, a <a href="borough">borough</a> north of Montreal with a strong Italian community, just four blocks away from <a href="Martin%20Brodeur">Martin Brodeur</a>, who became the goaltender for the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> six years before Luongo entered the NHL. Luongo is fluent in English, French and Italian. His father spoke Italian and his mother spoke English with a little French at home.

Luongo graduated from Montreal <a href="Francophone">Francophone</a> <a href="high%20school">high school</a> Antoine de St-Exupéry in in 1996. He began playing organized hockey at the age of eight as a <a href="forward%20%28ice%20hockey%29">forward</a>. His father taught all his sons <a href="soccer">soccer</a> and Luongo played until he was 14, at which point he decided to concentrate on hockey. Although he initially had the desire to play in net, his parents wanted him to develop his skating first. Several years later, after Luongo was cut from a peewee team, he made the switch to goaltender. At 11 years old, his team's usual goaltender did not show up and after begging his mother, still hesitant about Luongo playing the position, he went in net and posted a <a href="shutout">shutout</a>. In August 2009, the arena in which Luongo played his minor hockey in St. Leonard was named after him as the Roberto Luongo Arena. It is the second arena in the community to be named after an NHL goalie after the Martin Brodeur Arena was renamed as such in 2000.

By 15, Luongo was playing midget with Montreal-Bourassa, the same team that produced NHL Quebecer goalies Brodeur and <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Potvin">Félix Potvin</a>. Luongo has credited <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> goaltender <a href="Grant%20Fuhr">Grant Fuhr</a> as his inspiration growing up, citing an admiration for his "spectacular glove saves". He had the opportunity to first meet Fuhr before a game against the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> during his rookie season with the Islanders.

The <a href="Val-d%27Or%20Foreurs">Val-d'Or Foreurs</a> made Luongo the highest-drafted goaltender in <a href="Quebec%20Major%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">QMJHL</a> history, at second overall, in 1995. He began his <a href="junior%20ice%20hockey">junior</a> career in the <a href="1995%E2%80%9396%20QMJHL%20season">1995–96 season</a> with Val-d'Or and posted six wins in 23 games played. As the team's starting goaltender the following season in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20QMJHL%20season">1996–97</a>, he improved to a team-record 32 wins, and was awarded the <a href="Mike%20Bossy%20Trophy">Mike Bossy Trophy</a> as the league's best professional prospect. After his performance at the 1997 <a href="CHL%20Top%20Prospects%20Game">CHL Top Prospects Game</a>, opposing coach <a href="Don%20Cherry">Don Cherry</a> likened Luongo to <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>' <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>r <a href="Ken%20Dryden">Ken Dryden</a>, while <a href="NHL%20Central%20Scouting%20Bureau">NHL Central Scouting Bureau</a> director Frank Bonello heralded him as a "franchise goalie".

At the <a href="1997%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1997 NHL Entry Draft</a>, Luongo was selected in the first round, fourth overall, by the <a href="New%20York%20Islanders">New York Islanders</a>. The pick originally belonged to the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> but was traded to the Islanders in exchange for <a href="Wendel%20Clark">Wendel Clark</a>, <a href="Mathieu%20Schneider">Mathieu Schneider</a> and <a href="D.%20J.%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%29">D. J. Smith</a>. At the time of the draft, Luongo was the highest-picked goaltender in NHL history, surpassing <a href="Tom%20Barrasso">Tom Barrasso</a> and <a href="John%20Davidson%20%28ice%20hockey%29">John Davidson</a>'s fifth overall selections in <a href="1983%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1983</a> and <a href="1973%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">1973</a> (Luongo's selection was later surpassed by <a href="Rick%20DiPietro">Rick DiPietro</a>'s first overall selection by the Islanders in <a href="2000%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2000</a>).

Upon his draft, Luongo continued to play junior with the Foreurs in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20QMJHL%20season">1997–98</a>. He recorded 27 wins and a 3.09 <a href="goals%20against%20average">goals against average</a> (GAA). His seven <a href="shutout">shutout</a>s tied <a href="Nick%20Sanza">Nick Sanza</a>'s QMJHL record, set in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20QMJHL%20season">1974–75</a> (<a href="Adam%20Russo">Adam Russo</a> later tied it as well in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20QMJHL%20season">2002–03</a>).

Although the Islanders planned to have Luongo play in the NHL for the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NHL%20season">1998–99 season</a>, an inconsistent performance at training camp led to Luongo's return to the QMJHL that season. Due to having failed to come to terms on a contract before October 1, 1998, Luongo was not allowed to be called up to the Islanders from junior over the course of the subsequent season. He started the season with Val-d'Or but was traded to the <a href="Acadie-Bathurst%20Titan">Acadie-Bathurst Titan</a> during the <a href="1999%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1999 World Junior Championships</a> for the remainder of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20QMJHL%20season">1998–99 season</a>. He went on to lead the Titan to his second consecutive President's Cup championship with a 2.74 GAA in 23 games. He finished his QMJHL playoff career with the all-time league record in games played (56), minutes played (3,264:22), wins (38) and shots faced (1,808).

After his performance at the <a href="1999%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1999 World Junior Championships</a>, Luongo was signed by the Islanders to a three-year, $2.775 million contract on January 8, 1999. The <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20AHL%20season">following season</a>, he made his professional debut with the <a href="Lowell%20Lock%20Monsters">Lowell Lock Monsters</a>, the Islanders' <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL) affiliate. Early in the season, Luongo was called up to the Islanders on November 22, 1999, after a shoulder injury to backup <a href="Wade%20Flaherty">Wade Flaherty</a>. He made his NHL debut six days later on November 28, stopping 43 shots in a 2–1 win against the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>. Luongo's early performances solidified him as the Islanders' starting goalie over veteran <a href="F%C3%A9lix%20Potvin">Félix Potvin</a>. Nearly a month after Luongo's debut in New York, Potvin was traded to the <a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> on December 19 in exchange for backup goaltender <a href="Kevin%20Weekes">Kevin Weekes</a>. The next month, he recorded his first career NHL shutout in his eighth game, stopping 34 shots in a 3–0 victory over the Bruins on December 27.

In January 2000, Luongo was publicly criticized by Islanders <a href="General%20manager%20%28ice%20hockey%29">general manager</a> <a href="Mike%20Milbury">Mike Milbury</a> for having gone looking for an apartment in New York on a game day before letting in seven goals to the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>. Milbury told the media, "You can't do that in the NHL. You have to prepare yourself." Luongo defended himself by saying he did not divert from his usual game day routine by looking at just one apartment.

In the off-season, the Islanders selected goaltender <a href="Rick%20DiPietro">Rick DiPietro</a> with the first overall pick in the <a href="2000%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2000 NHL Entry Draft</a>. DiPietro's selection supplanted Luongo as the highest-drafted goaltender in NHL history and the Islanders' goaltender of the future. Consequently, Milbury traded Luongo to the <a href="Florida%20Panthers">Florida Panthers</a> along with centre <a href="Olli%20Jokinen">Olli Jokinen</a> for winger <a href="Mark%20Parrish">Mark Parrish</a> and centre <a href="Oleg%20Kvasha">Oleg Kvasha</a> that same day on June 24, 2000. The deal would later be seen to have disproportionately benefited the Panthers, as both Jokinen and Luongo would eventually develop into star players, in contrast to Parrish and Kvasha. Luongo expressed surprise at the trade, saying, "I didn't expect it at all. One day they're telling me I'm the goalie of the future, and the next day I'm gone. I didn't really appreciate that. The good side is that [the Panthers] wanted me."

The Panthers' organization expressed high praise for Luongo following the trade. General manager <a href="Bryan%20Murray%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Bryan Murray</a> characterized him as "a franchise guy", while <a href="coach%20%28ice%20hockey%29">head coach</a> <a href="Terry%20Murray">Terry Murray</a> added "He's the guy teams have to have to win the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a>." He entered his first training camp with the Panthers competing for the starting role with veteran goaltender <a href="Trevor%20Kidd">Trevor Kidd</a>; coach Terry Murray opted to begin the season with Kidd due to his experience. Luongo made his first start with the Panthers on October 9, 2000, making 18 saves in a 4–2 loss to the Boston Bruins. When splitting the goaltending duties, Luongo went on to appear in 43 games, in comparison to Kidd's 42. He finished his <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NHL%20season">2000–01</a> rookie season (Luongo qualified as a rookie because he had not played in at least 26 games the previous season with New York) by notching a franchise record fifth shutout of the season in a 3–0 win against the <a href="New%20York%20Rangers">New York Rangers</a> on April 7, 2001. The total surpassed <a href="John%20Vanbiesbrouck">John Vanbiesbrouck</a>'s four-shutout mark, set in both the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20NHL%20season">1994–95</a> and <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NHL%20season">1997–98</a> seasons. He posted a 12–24–7 record with the struggling Panthers, who finished 12th in the <a href="Eastern%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Eastern Conference</a>, while recording a 2.44 GAA. His .920 save percentage was sixth in the league and second all-time among rookie goaltenders, behind <a href="Manny%20Fernandez%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Manny Fernandez</a>'s mark set the previous season.

Approaching his third NHL season, Luongo agreed on a four-year contract extension with the Panthers on September 13, 2001. He was chosen to play in the inaugural <a href="NHL%20YoungStars%20Game">NHL YoungStars Game</a> in <a href="2002%20NHL%20All-Star%20Game">2002</a> for Team <a href="Barry%20Melrose">Melrose</a>, winning 13–7 over Team <a href="Jim%20Fox%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Fox</a>. After appearing in 58 games in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02</a>, Luongo suffered a <a href="sprained%20ankle">torn ligament</a> in his right ankle in a game against the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> on March 20, 2002. Sidelined for the remainder of the season, he finished with a 16–33–4 record, a 2.77 GAA and .915 save percentage. Luongo returned in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NHL%20season">2002–03</a> to a heavier workload, playing a 65-game season. He had a franchise record-setting shutout streak that lasted 144:51 minutes; it was snapped on January 20, 2003, against the Montreal Canadiens.

In his fourth season with the Panthers (<a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season">2003–04</a>), Luongo emerged with his first <a href="Vezina%20Trophy">Vezina Trophy</a> and <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson%20Award">Lester B. Pearson Award</a> nominations as the top goaltender and top player as selected by the players, respectively. Playing in 72 games, he set NHL marks for most saves and shots faced in a single season with 2,303 and 2,475, respectively. Both marks were previously set by former Islanders teammate Félix Potvin in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season">1996–97</a> as a Toronto Maple Leaf. His resulting .931 save percentage was first among those goalies with at least 50 starts and set a Panthers franchise record, breaking Vanbiesbrouck's .924 mark, set in <a href="1993%E2%80%9394%20NHL%20season">1993–94</a>. His seven shutouts furthered his franchise record and was good enough for fifth in the league. At mid-season, he was named to his first <a href="2004%20NHL%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star Game</a>, held in February 2004. Competing for the Eastern Conference, he won the Goaltenders Competition segment of the <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Game%20SuperSkills%20Competition">SkillsCompetition</a>, allowing the fewest goals on goaltender-related events. The following day, he played in the third period of the All-Star Game and helped the East to a 6–4 win against the West. At the end of the season, he was named to the <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Team">Second NHL All-Star Team</a>, but lost the Vezina Trophy to fellow <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>-native <a href="Martin%20Brodeur">Martin Brodeur</a> of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a>, while <a href="Martin%20St.%20Louis">Martin St. Louis</a> of the Tampa Bay Lightning won the Pearson Award.
Due to the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>, Luongo was inactive, with the exception of two international tournaments, the <a href="2004%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">2004 World Cup</a> and the <a href="2005%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2005 World Championships</a>. With the NHL set to resume in <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20NHL%20season">2005–06</a>, Luongo was without a contract. After negotiations failed, the Panthers filed for <a href="arbitration">arbitration</a> on August 11, 2005. The process awarded Luongo a one-year, $3.2 million contract on August 25.

On April 13, 2006, Luongo became the most-wins Panthers goaltender of all-time, passing Vanbiesbrouck, with his 107th win with the team – a 5–4 overtime victory against the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a>. He went on to post 35 wins, breaking Vanbiesbrouck's 27-win single-season Panthers mark, set in <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NHL%20season">1996–97</a>. Set to become a free agent for the second consecutive off-season, he could not come to an agreement with the Panthers, having formally turned down a five-year, $30 million contract offer in January 2006. It was also reported that among Luongo's demands were that backup goaltender <a href="Jamie%20McLennan">Jamie McLennan</a> be re-signed, his long-time goaltending coach <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Allaire">François Allaire</a> be hired and that a public statement be released that he would not be traded until the no-trade clause of his contract took effect.

Prior to the start of the <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NHL%20season">2006–07 season</a>, Panthers general manager <a href="Mike%20Keenan">Mike Keenan</a> traded Luongo to the Vancouver Canucks on June 23, 2006. He was packaged with defenceman <a href="Luk%C3%A1%C5%A1%20Kraj%C3%AD%C4%8Dek">Lukáš Krajíček</a> and a sixth round draft pick (<a href="Sergei%20Shirokov">Sergei Shirokov</a>) in exchange for forward <a href="Todd%20Bertuzzi">Todd Bertuzzi</a>, defenceman <a href="Bryan%20Allen%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Bryan Allen</a> and goaltender <a href="Alex%20Auld">Alex Auld</a>. Immediately following the deal, Vancouver signed Luongo to a four-year, $27 million deal. He expressed surprise, claiming that he and the Panthers were very close to a deal the day before the trade.
Luongo's arrival in Vancouver ended a seven-and-a-half-year period of instability for Canucks netminding, with a total of 18 goaltenders having played for the club since <a href="Kirk%20McLean">Kirk McLean</a>'s departure in <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NHL%20season">1998</a>. General manager <a href="Brian%20Burke%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Brian Burke</a> had coined the term "goalie graveyard" during his tenure in Vancouver to describe the club's goaltending fortunes.

Luongo recorded a 3–1 win against the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> in his Canucks debut on October 5, 2006. Later in the month, he notched his first shutout with the Canucks, stopping 32 shots in a 5–0 win over the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Blackhawks</a> on October 25. On January 9, 2007, Luongo was voted in as a starting goaltender for the first time in his career for the <a href="Western%20Conference%20%28NHL%29">Western Conference</a> All-Stars. Six days after the announcement, he was hospitalized after taking a puck to the throat in practice. He spent the night in the <a href="intensive%20care%20unit">intensive care unit</a> for fears his <a href="Vertebrate%20trachea">windpipe</a> would swell and become blocked. Discharged from the hospital on game day, Luongo recorded a shutout that night against the Montreal Canadiens on January 16, 2007. During the <a href="2007%20NHL%20All-Star%20Game">2007 NHL All-Star Game</a> in <a href="Dallas">Dallas</a>, Luongo was named the Skills Competition's top goaltender and helped the West to a 12–9 win over the East. Late in the season, Luongo recorded his franchise record-setting 39th win in a 2–1 <a href="overtime%20%28ice%20hockey%29">overtime</a> victory on March 9. He surpassed Kirk McLean's 38-win mark set in <a href="1991%E2%80%9392%20NHL%20season">1991–92</a>. He went on to finish with a career-high 47 wins, one shy of league-leader Martin Brodeur, who broke <a href="Bernie%20Parent">Bernie Parent</a>'s thirty-three-year-old NHL record of wins in a season. Luongo and Brodeur are considered, however, to have been given an advantage to Parent with the inauguration of the <a href="shootout%20%28ice%20hockey%29">shootout</a> that season by the NHL, allowing more games to be decided with wins, as opposed to ties.

In addition to his 47 wins, Luongo recorded a 2.29 GAA (which was at that time, a personal best) and a team-record .921 save percentage (surpassing <a href="Dan%20Cloutier">Dan Cloutier</a>'s .914 save percentage in 2003–04; later broken by <a href="Cory%20Schneider">Cory Schneider</a>'s .929 save percentage in 2010–11). He won three team awards – the <a href="Cyclone%20Taylor%20Trophy">Cyclone Taylor Trophy</a> as MVP, the <a href="Molson%20Cup%23Vancouver%20Canucks">Molson Cup</a> as the player with the most three-star selections, and the <a href="Most%20Exciting%20Player%20Award">Most Exciting Player Award</a>. He led the Canucks to a <a href="Northwest%20Division%20%28NHL%29">Northwest Division</a> title and what was then a franchise record of 105 points, The team was seeded third in the Western Conference. The <a href="2007%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2007 playoffs</a> marked Luongo's first NHL post-season appearance. Facing the <a href="Dallas%20Stars">Dallas Stars</a> in the opening round, he almost set an NHL record for most saves in a playoff game in his post-season debut. He stopped 72 shots, en route to a 5–4 quadruple overtime victory, one save shy of <a href="Kelly%20Hrudey">Kelly Hrudey</a>'s 73-save mark set in <a href="1987%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">1987</a>. Luongo went on to win his first playoff series as the Canucks eliminated the Stars in seven games. They were, however, defeated in the second round by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the <a href="Anaheim%20Ducks">Anaheim Ducks</a>. Luongo put forth a losing 56-save performance in the deciding fifth game against the Ducks. After the game ended in regulation at a 1–1 tie, he missed the first three minutes of the first overtime period to what was first believed to be an equipment malfunction. However, after the series ended, it was revealed that Luongo, instead, had an untimely case of <a href="diarrhea">diarrhea</a>. The Canucks lost the game 2–1 in the second overtime when Luongo took his eye off the puck to look at the referee, believing a penalty should have been issued to the Ducks on a play in which Canucks forward <a href="Jannik%20Hansen">Jannik Hansen</a> was hit by Ducks forward <a href="Rob%20Niedermayer">Rob Niedermayer</a>. With Luongo not paying attention, Ducks defenceman <a href="Scott%20Niedermayer">Scott Niedermayer</a> shot the puck from the point to score the series-winning goal.

At the end of the season, Luongo was nominated for three major NHL awards: the Vezina Trophy, Lester B. Pearson Award and Hart Memorial Trophy as the league MVP. However, Luongo finished second in the voting for all three awards, behind Brodeur for the Vezina and <a href="Sidney%20Crosby">Sidney Crosby</a> of the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> for the Hart and Pearson.

Luongo kept pace statistically with his previous season's work in <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08</a> and continued to set significant marks, including a three-game shutout streak spanning 210:34 in late-November (breaking the Canucks' previous franchise record of 184:20 set by <a href="Ken%20Lockett">Ken Lockett</a> in <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20NHL%20season">1975</a>). He was voted in as the <a href="2008%20NHL%20All-Star%20Game">2008 NHL All-Star Game</a>'s Western Conference starting goalie for the second consecutive season, although he did not attend in order to be with his pregnant wife in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>.

With the Canucks battling for the Northwest Division title all season long, a losing streak that saw Luongo win only one of his final eight starts caused the Canucks to miss the playoffs altogether. Nevertheless, he received his second consecutive team MVP and Molson Cup awards. He also finished seventh in Vezina Trophy balloting.

On September 30, 2008, prior to the start of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09 season</a>, Vancouver Canucks general manager <a href="Mike%20Gillis">Mike Gillis</a> and head coach <a href="Alain%20Vigneault">Alain Vigneault</a> named Luongo the 12th <a href="captain%20%28ice%20hockey%29">captain</a> in team history, replacing the departed <a href="Markus%20N%C3%A4slund">Markus Näslund</a>. The decision was unconventional, as league rules forbid goaltenders from being captains. As such, Luongo became only the seventh goaltender in NHL history to be named a captain, and the first since <a href="Bill%20Durnan">Bill Durnan</a> captained the Montreal Canadiens in <a href="1947%E2%80%9348%20NHL%20season">1947–48</a> (after which the league implemented the rule). In order to account for the league rule, Luongo did not perform any of the on-ice duties reserved for captains and did not wear the captain's "C" on his jersey. Instead he incorporated it into the artwork on the front of one of his <a href="goaltender%20mask">masks</a> which he occasionally wore for the early months of the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20Vancouver%20Canucks%20season">2008–09 season</a>. Canucks defenceman <a href="Willie%20Mitchell%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Willie Mitchell</a> was designated to handle communications with on-ice officials, while defenceman <a href="Mattias%20%C3%96hlund">Mattias Öhlund</a> was responsible for ceremonial faceoffs and other such formalities associated with captaincy. Centre <a href="Ryan%20Kesler">Ryan Kesler</a> was chosen along with Mitchell and Öhlund as the third alternate captain.

A month into the 2008–09 season, Luongo began a shutout streak that lasted three games against the <a href="Nashville%20Predators">Nashville Predators</a>, <a href="Phoenix%20Coyotes">Phoenix Coyotes</a>, and the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a>, akin to the feat he accomplished in the same month of November the previous year. His overall shutout streak was snapped at 242:36 minutes, in a 2–1 shootout loss against the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a>, surpassing the Canucks record he set the previous season. Later that month, on November 22, Luongo left a game versus the Pittsburgh Penguins after suffering an <a href="adduction">adductor</a> strain in his <a href="groin">groin</a>. Initially listed as week-to-week, he attempted what was considered an early comeback within two weeks of the injury, but suffered a setback during a team practice on December 10, leaving early in discomfort. After missing 24 games, Luongo made his return on January 15, 2009, in a 4–1 loss to the Phoenix Coyotes. While injured, Luongo was chosen for the fourth time to the <a href="2009%20NHL%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star Game in 2009</a> as the lone Canucks representative. Despite speculation he would have to miss his second straight All-Star Game, Luongo recovered in time and took part in a 12–11 shootout loss to the Eastern Conference. He finished the season with back-to-back shutouts in the final two games against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> and Colorado Avalanche to establish a new career-high of nine shutouts on the season, breaking <a href="Dan%20Cloutier">Dan Cloutier</a>'s previous franchise single-season shutout record of seven, set in <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NHL%20season">2001–02</a>.

Winning their second Northwest Division title in three years, Luongo and the Canucks returned to the playoffs after a one-year absence. During the <a href="2009%20Stanley%20Cup%20Playoffs">2009 playoffs</a>, he led the Canucks to a first round sweep of the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a>. The Canucks then faced the Chicago Blackhawks in the second round, which Chicago ultimately won in six games. Luongo was heavily criticized following his performance in the sixth and deciding game, allowing seven goals in the 7–5 loss. In a post-game interview, Luongo told reporters that he "let [his] teammates down". Many in the Vancouver media were quick to suggest trading Luongo, arguing that his large salary could be better spent, while pointing to several successful teams with relatively low-salary goalies. Nevertheless, Luongo was presented at the year-end awards ceremony with the <a href="Scotiabank%20Fan%20Fav%20Award">Scotiabank Fan Fav Award</a>, a fan-voted award in its inaugural year for the league's favourite player. Also finishing fourth in Vezina Trophy voting, he missed out on his second nomination in three years by one vote, behind <a href="Niklas%20B%C3%A4ckstr%C3%B6m">Niklas Bäckström</a> of the <a href="Minnesota%20Wild">Minnesota Wild</a>, <a href="Steve%20Mason%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Steve Mason</a> of the <a href="Columbus%20Blue%20Jackets">Columbus Blue Jackets</a> and trophy-winner <a href="Tim%20Thomas%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Tim Thomas</a> of the Boston Bruins.

With one season left on his original four-year deal with the Canucks, Luongo and agent <a href="Gilles%20Lupien">Gilles Lupien</a> began contract negotiations with general manager <a href="Mike%20Gillis">Mike Gillis</a> in the 2009 off-season. At the time of the <a href="2009%20NHL%20Entry%20Draft">2009 NHL Entry Draft</a>, <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> reported that Luongo and the Canucks had agreed on a long-term extension to be announced on July 1. The report was, however, denied by both Lupien and Gillis. A little over a month later in early-August, Gillis told Vancouver sports radio station <a href="TEAM%201040">TEAM 1040</a> in an interview that he was "philosophically" close to a deal with Luongo to be signed before the upcoming <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NHL%20season">2009–10 season</a>. That same month, while at <a href="Canada%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a>'s summer camp for the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a>, Luongo set a September 13 deadline to sign a contract before the Canucks' training camp began, explaining that he "will not be negotiating during the season ... [not wanting] that distraction".

Several days later, on September 2, the Canucks announced that they had signed Luongo to a 12-year contract extension worth $64 million for a $5.33 million annual salary cap hit. The front-loaded deal, which will expire by the time Luongo is 43 and includes a no-trade clause, sees him make $10 million in 2010–11, then approximately $6.7 million annually through to 2017–18, $3.3 million and $1.6 million the subsequent two seasons, before tailing off to $1 million for the final two years. The contract contains two additional clauses to circumvent the no-trade clause that allow Luongo to facilitate a trade after the fifth year and for the Canucks to also facilitate a trade after the seventh year.

Nearly a month into the 2009–10 season, on October 25, 2009, Luongo recorded his 21st shutout as a Canuck (48th career) in a 2–0 win against the <a href="Edmonton%20Oilers">Edmonton Oilers</a>, surpassing Kirk McLean as the franchise shutouts leader. The following game against the Detroit Red Wings on October 27, he suffered a rib injury that was revealed the following day to be a <a href="hairline%20fracture">hairline fracture</a>. Luongo originally injured his rib two games prior against the Toronto Maple Leafs on October 24 after taking a shot in the chest from Leafs' forward <a href="Niklas%20Hagman">Niklas Hagman</a>. The injury was re-aggravated during the Detroit game during a collision with Red Wings forward Todd Bertuzzi. He returned to the lineup on November 10 after missing six games. On January 7, 2010, Luongo recorded his 50th career shutout in a 4–0 win against the Phoenix Coyotes. Despite recording the second 40-win season of his career, Luongo finished with his worst statistical season as a Canuck, heavily affected by a poor second-half. Pulled seven times in 68 appearances, he recorded a 2.57 GAA and a .913 save percentage. In the subsequent <a href="2010%20Stanley%20Cup%20Playoffs">2010 playoffs</a>, the Canucks defeated the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> in six games only to be defeated by the Chicago Blackhawks for the second year in a row.

In the off-season, it was speculated by many in the media whether Luongo would remain Vancouver's captain, citing the added pressure of the goaltending position. After the Canucks' 3–1 series deficit in the second round, Luongo ceased to make himself available for pre-game interviews – a customary practice for goaltenders, but not for captains. When asked after the Canucks' elimination whether he thought he should remain team captain, he told reporters he did not think it was an issue. However, Gillis, who appointed him captain two seasons prior, asserted it was a topic to be addressed in the off-season. On September 13, 2010, Luongo confirmed he was stepping down, stating that "Serv[ing] as captain...in a Canadian city for a team with such passionate fans is a privilege and an experience I will always take pride in. I will continue to be a leader on this team and support my teammates the same way I always have while focusing on our ultimate goal." Centre <a href="Henrik%20Sedin">Henrik Sedin</a>, who won the Hart Trophy for the 2009–10 season, was named Luongo's successor in a pre-game ceremony to the Canucks' season-opener.

Also in the off-season, Gillis fired Luongo's goaltending coach Ian Clark and hired <a href="Roland%20Melanson">Roland Melanson</a> in his place. Luongo had been a personal friend of Clark's and publicly stated being surprised and disappointed with the switch. The decision to hire Melanson was largely precipitated on his willingness to work with Luongo on a full-time basis – something Clark was unable to do. Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson leading up to the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2010–11 season</a> and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.

During the 2010 pre-season, Luongo sustained a groin injury, but recovered in time for the regular season. Midway through the campaign, Luongo was named the NHL's Second Star of the Month for December 2010. He posted an 11–1–2 record with a 2.07 GAA, a .922 save percentage and one shutout. During the month, he started a 21-game regulation unbeaten streak that lasted until a loss against the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Blues">St. Louis Blues</a> on February 14, 2011. Luongo's record in that span was 16 wins and 5 overtime or shootout losses. Later in the campaign, he recorded his <a href="List%20of%20NHL%20goaltenders%20with%20300%20wins">300th career win</a> against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> on March 5, 2011. He became the 6th-youngest goaltender to reach the milestone and the 25th overall. The 2010–11 season constituted a decreased workload for Luongo, as he appeared in 60 games. Team management had asserted at the beginning of the campaign that rookie backup <a href="Cory%20Schneider">Cory Schneider</a> would be given the opportunity to play in 20 to 25 games. Luongo finished the season with a league-leading 38 wins, along with 22 losses (15 in regulation and 7 in overtime or a shootout). His career-high 2.11 GAA ranked second in the league, behind Tim Thomas' 2.00, and set a Canucks record, surpassing Dan Cloutier's 2.27 GAA, set in 2003–04. While his .928 save percentage improved upon his team-record setting .921 in 2006–07, it was bettered by one-hundredth of a point by Schneider. Together, Luongo and Schneider won the <a href="William%20M.%20Jennings%20Trophy">William M. Jennings Trophy</a> for leading the Canucks to the lowest GAA in the league; their combined 2.20 GAA was one-tenth better than the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a>'s second-place goaltending tandem of <a href="Tim%20Thomas%20%28ice%20hockey%29">Tim Thomas</a> and <a href="Tuukka%20Rask">Tuukka Rask</a>. Luongo helped the Canucks to their first <a href="Presidents%27%20Trophy">Presidents' Trophy</a> in team history with an NHL-best and franchise-record 54 wins and 117 points. His efforts in the regular season earned him his third career Vezina Trophy nomination, alongside the Boston Bruins' Tim Thomas and the Nashville Predators' <a href="Pekka%20Rinne">Pekka Rinne</a>.

Entering the <a href="2011%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2011 playoffs</a> as the first seed in the West, the Canucks were matched against the Blackhawks for the third straight year. After opening the series with three straight wins, the Canucks lost the next three, forcing a seventh game. After he was pulled in favour of Schneider during Games 4 and 5 – having allowed six and four goals, respectively – Luongo started Game 6 on the bench. During the third period, Schneider suffered an injury, forcing Luongo to finish the game. He made 12 saves in relief of Schneider before Blackhawks forward <a href="Ben%20Smith%20%28ice%20hockey%2C%20born%201988%29">Ben Smith</a> scored in overtime. Although Schneider was available to play for Game 7, Vigneault chose to start Luongo. He made 31 saves in the deciding game, helping the Canucks to a 2–1 overtime win. His efforts included a cross-ice save on a one-timer from forward <a href="Patrick%20Sharp">Patrick Sharp</a> during a Blackhawks powerplay early on in the extra period. Going head-to-head against fellow Vezina Trophy nominee <a href="Pekka%20Rinne">Pekka Rinne</a> and the <a href="Nashville%20Predators">Nashville Predators</a> in round two, Luongo kept Nashville to 11 goals over 6 games to help the Canucks advance. He maintained his performance in the Conference Finals against the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>, allowing 13 goals over 5 contests, including 54 saves in the fifth and deciding match, a game that went to double overtime. Luongo's efforts helped the Canucks reach the <a href="2011%20Stanley%20Cup%20Finals">Stanley Cup Finals</a> for the first time in 17 years. He opened the series against the Boston Bruins stopping all 36 shots in a 1–0 win for his third shutout of the post-season. As the series shifted to Boston's <a href="TD%20Garden">TD Garden</a> with a two-games-to-none Canucks lead, Luongo surrendered eight goals in Game 3. The following contest, he was pulled for the third time in the playoffs after allowing 4 goals on 20 shots. Amidst heavy scrutiny from the media and Canucks fans, Luongo recovered for Game 5, stopping all 31 Bruins shots in a 1–0 win. It was his 15th win and 4th shutout of the post-season, tying both of Kirk McLean's single-year playoff team records, previously set in <a href="1994%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">1994</a>. With an opportunity to clinch the Stanley Cup in Game 6, however, he was pulled again after allowing three goals in less than three minutes in the first period; the game ended in a 5–2 loss. Starting for the deciding seventh game, he allowed 3 goals on 20 shots, including one shorthanded goal, as the Canucks lost 4–0.

Nearly a month-and-a-half into the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20NHL%20season">2011–12 season</a>, Luongo suffered an upper-body injury that sidelined him for two games. The nature of the injury was unspecified, but was believed to have occurred during a game against the Islanders on November 13, 2011, when he appeared to be in discomfort. Prior to the injury, Luongo was struggling to perform with his statistics near the bottom of the league. Upon recovering, Schneider's play relegated Luongo to backup status for five games. By December, he resumed as the team's starter with improved performance. The following month, Luongo reached two milestones. On January 4, 2012, he became the 23rd goalie in league history to play in his 700th game, a contest in which he recorded a 3–0 shutout against the Wild. With his 212th victory as a Canuck on January 21 (a 4–3 win against the Sharks), he surpassed Kirk McLean as the most-wins goalie in team history. Luongo accomplished the feat in 364 games, 152 less than McLean.

Facing the eighth-seeded <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Kings">Los Angeles Kings</a> in the opening round of the <a href="2012%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">2012 Stanley Cup playoffs</a>, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Vigneault opted to start Schneider for the rest of the series, in order to give the Canucks some momentum, and Luongo remained on the bench for the remainder of the series as the Kings won four games to one. Dressing as a backup for the Canucks' final three playoff games led many in the media to believe that Luongo would be traded in the off-season, in favour of Schneider, who recorded better regular season and playoff statistics than him in 2011–12. Asked about his role with the Canucks following the defeat, Luongo told reporters that he would waive his <a href="no-trade%20clause">no-trade clause</a> if his management asked him to so. In June 2012, Schneider was signed to a three-year $12 million contract, which made Luongo expendable, but general manager <a href="Mike%20Gillis">Mike Gillis</a>' efforts to trade Luongo were unsuccessful due to his $64 million (U.S.), 12-year contract.

In the lockout-shortened <a href="2012%E2%80%9313%20NHL%20season">2012–13 NHL season</a>, both goaltenders split the playing duties although Schneider was the number one goalie. Luongo handled his demotion with class and remained supportive of Schneider, soon calling the Canucks "Cory's team." Head coach <a href="Alain%20Vigneault">Alain Vigneault</a> said "Cory is our MVP and one of reasons why we got into playoffs. I've got a lot of faith in him and that's why we're going with him". In the opening <a href="2013%20Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">playoff</a> round facing the <a href="San%20Jose%20Sharks">San Jose Sharks</a>, as Schneider had been injured near the end of the regular season, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Luongo came off the bench in game three after Schneider was pulled in the third period. Luongo was the backup in game four as the Canucks lost in overtime, ending his team's postseason in four straight games. Luongo put his penthouse up for sale, as it was accepted that he had played his final game as a Canuck. Although he had nine years left on a 12-year, $64-million contract, which represented a $5.33 million salary cap hit, general manager <a href="Mike%20Gillis">Mike Gillis</a> remained confident of making a deal in the summer.

Schneider was unexpectedly traded to the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a> on June 30, 2013, reinstating Luongo in the starting position for the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20NHL%20season">2013–14 NHL season</a>. <a href="John%20Tortorella">John Tortorella</a>, who had replaced <a href="Alain%20Vigneault">Alain Vigneault</a> as Canucks head coach after the conclusion of the 2012–13 season, chose rookie <a href="Eddie%20L%C3%A4ck">Eddie Läck</a> to start in goal instead of Luongo in the <a href="2014%20Heritage%20Classic">Heritage Classic</a> against the <a href="Ottawa%20Senators">Ottawa Senators</a> at <a href="BC%20Place">BC Place</a>. Tortorella's decision was unpopular with the crowd as they booed Läck, while Luongo was also unhappy as he had been looking forward to that game all season.

On March 4, 2014, a day before the NHL trade deadline, Luongo was traded back to the Florida Panthers along with prospect <a href="Steven%20Anthony">Steven Anthony</a> in exchange for goaltender <a href="Jacob%20Markstr%C3%B6m">Jacob Markström</a> and centre <a href="Shawn%20Matthias">Shawn Matthias</a>. The Canucks retain part of Luongo's salary. Luongo was seen as key to helping build the Panthers into a strong contender.

During the <a href="2017%E2%80%9318%20NHL%20season">2017–18 season</a>, Luongo played in his 1,000th NHL game, becoming just the third goaltender in NHL history to do so, the other two being <a href="Patrick%20Roy">Patrick Roy</a> and Martin Brodeur. At the conclusion of the regular season, Luongo was the Panthers' nomination for the <a href="Bill%20Masterton%20Memorial%20Trophy">Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy</a> and became the franchise all-time leader in games played, wins, and shutouts. On February 10, 2019, Roberto Luongo played in his 1030th career game, passing Roy for second all-time behind Brodeur, who played 1,266 games in his career. With a 4-3 win against the <a href="Colorado%20Avalanche">Colorado Avalanche</a> on February 25, Luongo passed <a href="Ed%20Belfour">Ed Belfour</a> for third-most wins as an NHL goaltender, once again behind Roy and Brodeur.

Luongo made his international debut at the 1995 World U-17 Hockey Challenge in <a href="Moncton%2C%20New%20Brunswick">Moncton, New Brunswick</a>, with Team <a href="Qu%C3%A9bec">Québec</a>, winning bronze. Three years later, he was named to the <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20junior%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canadian national junior team</a> for the <a href="1998%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1998 World Junior Championships</a> in Finland. He played backup to <a href="Victoriaville%20Tigres">Victoriaville Tigres</a> goaltender <a href="Mathieu%20Garon">Mathieu Garon</a>, going winless in three appearances with a 3.70 GAA, as Canada finished in eighth place. Luongo became the starting goaltender the following year at the <a href="1999%20World%20Junior%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">1999 World Junior Championships</a> in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, appearing in seven of Canada's eight games. He recorded a shutout in the first game of the tournament against the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>, making 36 saves in a 0–0 tie. He went on to help Team Canada to the gold medal game against Russia, but lost in <a href="overtime%20%28ice%20hockey%29">overtime</a>, surrendering a goal to <a href="Artem%20Chubarov">Artem Chubarov</a>. With a 1.92 GAA and two shutouts, Luongo was given <a href="List%20of%20IIHF%20World%20Under%2020%20Championship%20Directorate%20award%20winners">Best Goaltender</a> and All-Star Team honours.

Luongo first appeared with the <a href="Canada%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Canadian men's team</a> at the <a href="2001%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2001 World Championships</a> in Germany. He played backup to <a href="Fred%20Brathwaite">Fred Brathwaite</a> of the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> before injuring his finger during the first game of the qualification round against <a href="Switzerland%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Switzerland</a> on May 4, 2001.

During his next appearance at the <a href="2003%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2003 World Championships</a> in Finland, Luongo began the tournament as backup to the <a href="Phoenix%20Coyotes">Phoenix Coyotes</a>' <a href="Sean%20Burke">Sean Burke</a>. He earned wins against <a href="Latvia%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Latvia</a> in the preliminaries and Switzerland in the qualifying round. During the semifinals against the <a href="Czech%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Czech Republic</a>, Luongo replaced Burke after he left the game with a lower-body injury eight minutes into the second period. Luongo allowed four goals in relief, but earned the win as Canada defeated the Czechs 8–4. With Burke still out for the gold medal game, Luongo made 49 saves against <a href="Sweden%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Sweden</a> in a 3–2 overtime win. Despite Luongo's medal-round efforts, Burke was named the Best Goaltender for the tournament, as he played in the majority of Team Canada's games. The gold-medal winning 2003 team was later named the <a href="Canadian%20Press">Canadian Press</a> national sports team of the year on January 2, 2004.

Luongo made his third appearance at the <a href="2004%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">World Championships in 2004</a> in the <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>. He played in seven games as the starting goaltender, recording a 2.32 GAA and one shutout, as Canada captured its second straight gold medal at the tournament, beating Sweden 5–3 in the final. Several months later, Luongo competed for Team Canada in the <a href="2004%20World%20Cup%20of%20Hockey">2004 World Cup</a> as backup to <a href="Martin%20Brodeur">Martin Brodeur</a> of the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Devils">New Jersey Devils</a>. It marked Luongo's first international tournament in which all NHL players were eligible, as the annual World Championships conflict with the <a href="Stanley%20Cup%20playoffs">Stanley Cup playoffs</a>. He had another opportunity to step in as the starting goalie when Brodeur pulled out prior to the semi-final game against the Czech Republic due to a sprained wrist. Filling in for Brodeur, Luongo made 37 of 40 stops in a 4–3 overtime victory to put Team Canada into the finals against <a href="Finland%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Finland</a>. Brodeur returned for the championship game to backstop Team Canada to a 3–2 win.

Luongo appeared in his fourth World Championships in <a href="2005%20Men%27s%20World%20Ice%20Hockey%20Championships">2005</a>. Due to the <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NHL%20lockout">2004–05 NHL lockout</a>, all NHL players were available for the tournament in Austria, and Luongo played backup to Brodeur. He appeared in two games, including a shutout win against <a href="Slovenia%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Slovenia</a> in the round-robin. Luongo earned a silver medal as Team Canada was shut out by the Czech Republic 3–0 in the final.
Luongo was named to his first <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%20Winter%20Olympics">Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006</a>. The tournament was held in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy, his country of cultural origin. He again played behind Brodeur and appeared in two games. He made his Olympic debut in the second game of the round-robin with a 5–1 win against <a href="Germany%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Germany</a>. His second appearance of the tournament was a loss to Finland, also in the round-robin.

Leading up to the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a>, to be held in Luongo's NHL hometown of <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, Luongo and Brodeur were considered locks to be named to the national team heading into the summer orientation camp in August 2009 and speculation began as to who would be appointed the starting position. On December 31, 2009, Luongo was selected to Team Canada, along with Brodeur and <a href="Marc-Andr%C3%A9%20Fleury">Marc-André Fleury</a> of the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Penguins">Pittsburgh Penguins</a> as the three goaltenders. Luongo was given the start for the first game against <a href="Norway%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Norway</a>. He recorded his first Olympic shutout, making 15 saves in an 8–0 win to open the tournament. After Brodeur surrendered four goals in a 5–3 loss to the United States in their final preliminary game, Luongo replaced him as the starting goalie. He helped Canada to four consecutive single-elimination game wins against <a href="Germany%20national%20men%27s%20ice%20hockey%20team">Germany</a>, Russia, Slovakia and the United States to capture the gold medal. During the semifinal against Slovakia, Luongo made a game-saving stop against Canucks teammate <a href="Pavol%20Demitra">Pavol Demitra</a> with nine seconds to go in regulation. With Slovakia's goaltender pulled and down by a goal, the puck bounced to Demitra by the side of the net. Out of position, Luongo managed to get his glove on the puck, deflecting it away from the net and preserving the win. In the subsequent gold medal game, Luongo made 34 saves in Canada's overtime win against the United States.

The following month, Luongo carried the <a href="Olympic%20torch">torch</a> into <a href="Robson%20Square">Robson Square</a> in <a href="Downtown%20Vancouver">Downtown Vancouver</a> for the <a href="2010%20Paralympics">2010 Paralympics</a> on March 11, 2010.

Four years later, Luongo was selected to Team Canada for his third straight Olympics. Heading into the <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%202014%20Winter%20Olympics">Sochi Games</a> as the incumbent starter, there was much debate among the media as to whether he or <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a> goaltender <a href="Carey%20Price">Carey Price</a> would play most of Canada's games.

Luongo plays in the <a href="butterfly%20style">butterfly style</a> of goaltending, dropping to his knees with his skates pointing outwards and his pads meeting in the middle in order to cover the bottom portion of the net. Due to the style of play, groin injuries are common for butterfly goalies. Luongo suffered one during the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NHL%20season">2008–09 season</a> and missed 24 games.

An athletic goaltender, Luongo is known for having quick reflexes, particularly with his glove. One of Luongo's early goaltending coaches, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Allaire">François Allaire</a>, has remembered Luongo to have had the "best catching glove [he'd] ever seen in a kid" when he first came to his goaltending school in <a href="Sainte-Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se-de-Gasp%C3%A9%2C%20Qu%C3%A9bec">Sainte-Thérèse-de-Gaspé, Québec</a>, at the age of 14. Allaire is known to be a strong proponent of the butterfly style. At 6 feet and 3 inches, Luongo is able to cover a lot of net with his size. Observers also note the strong concentration, competitiveness and mental aspects of his game. On the other hand, his puck-handling skills have been described as a weakness.

His style began to be directed during his <a href="minor%20ice%20hockey%23Canada">midget</a> years with Allaire and Montreal-Bourassa goaltending coach Mario Baril. Luongo sent tapes of his play to Allaire during his rookie season in the <a href="Quebec%20Major%20Junior%20Hockey%20League">QMJHL</a> and his former goaltending coach advised him to be more aggressive and come out of the net more to cut off angles and challenge shooters. Later in his NHL career, the Canucks hired a new goaltending coach, <a href="Roland%20Melanson">Roland Melanson</a>, prior to the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2010–11 season</a>. Working with Melanson, Luongo began playing deeper in his crease against Allaire's original advice, allowing him to maintain positioning for rebounds. 

<a href="Vancouver%20Canucks">Vancouver Canucks</a> head coach <a href="Alain%20Vigneault">Alain Vigneault</a> has said that Luongo plays best with more playing time over the length of the season. Throughout his career, he has garnered lots of playing time, including four consecutive 70-game seasons from <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NHL%20season">2003–04</a> to <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NHL%20season">2007–08</a> between the <a href="Florida%20Panthers">Florida Panthers</a> and Canucks. He has been known to suffer from slow starts to the season, usually in the first month of October. In his first three Octobers with the Canucks, Luongo posted a combined 10–13–0 record and a .899 save percentage – numbers that are well below his career pace.

Luongo received the <a href="Mark%20Messier%20Leadership%20Award">Mark Messier Leadership Award</a> in his first season with the Canucks for the month of March 2007. Prior to his third season with Vancouver, he was named <a href="Markus%20N%C3%A4slund">Markus Näslund</a>'s successor as team captain and the first goaltender to be named a captain in 59 years. Teammate <a href="Mattias%20%C3%96hlund">Mattias Öhlund</a>, who served as alternate captain to Luongo for one season, described him as a vocal leader, while Luongo has also identified that quality in himself. General manager <a href="Mike%20Gillis">Mike Gillis</a> described his commitment level as "unprecedented", adding that "he'd be a great example for our younger guys", at the time of the captaincy announcement. He served in that capacity for two seasons before relinquishing the captaincy prior to the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NHL%20season">2010–11 season</a>.

While playing with the <a href="Florida%20Panthers">Florida Panthers</a>, Luongo met his wife, Gina (né e Cerbone), at a team hangout called the Pizza Time Trattoria. Gina is the daughter of the Italian restaurant owner, Umberto Cerbone, who is originally from <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, while Gina's mother is from <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a>. Luongo proposed to Gina under the <a href="Bridge%20of%20Sighs">Bridge of Sighs</a> in <a href="Venice">Venice</a> in 2004. They lived in <a href="Broward%20County%2C%20Florida">Broward County, Florida</a>, during his <a href="tenure">tenure</a> with the Panthers. However within a month of moving into a new home in Florida, Luongo was traded to Vancouver. They subsequently moved into the Vancouver neighbourhood of <a href="Yaletown">Yaletown</a>, while spending Luongo's off-seasons in <a href="Fort%20Lauderdale%2C%20Florida">Fort Lauderdale, Florida</a>. Their daughter was born on March 27, 2008. Luongo had been chosen as a starting goaltender for the <a href="2008%20NHL%20All-Star%20Game">2008 NHL All-Star Game</a>, but he chose not to attend in order to be with Gina, who was pregnant at the time and had returned to Florida. On December 27, 2010, Gina gave birth to the couple's son.

Luongo is involved with several charities. Like many Canucks players, he spent time with Canuck Place, a children's <a href="hospice">hospice</a> in Vancouver. He also sponsored a spectator's box in <a href="Rogers%20Arena">Rogers Arena</a> that is reserved for underprivileged children to attend Canucks games. At the end of games in which he was named one of the three stars, he was known to give away his goalie stick to a fan in the crowd. In the summer of 2009, he hosted the Roberto Luongo Golf Open to benefit <a href="Montreal%20Children%27s%20Hospital">Montreal Children's Hospital</a>, Sainte-Justine Hospital, and a seniors centre network in Saint-Léonard. After the <a href="Stoneman%20Douglas%20High%20School%20shooting">Stoneman Douglas High School shooting</a>, Luongo, who lives in Parkland, gave a pre-game speech acknowledging the victims of the shooting and calling for action against mass shootings.

In addition to being an avid <a href="golf">golf</a>er, Luongo also enjoys playing <a href="poker">poker</a>.

In September 2011, Luongo was inducted into the <a href="Italian%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Italian Walk of Fame</a> in <a href="Toronto">Toronto, Ontario</a>.

Knuckles' Chaotix

Knuckles' Chaotix is a 1995 <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> by <a href="Sega">Sega</a> for the <a href="32X">32X</a>. A <a href="Spin-off%20%28media%29">spinoff</a> from the "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" series, it features <a href="Knuckles%20the%20Echidna">Knuckles the Echidna</a> and four other characters known as the <a href="Chaotix">Chaotix</a>, who must prevent <a href="Doctor%20Robotnik">Doctor Robotnik</a> and <a href="Metal%20Sonic">Metal Sonic</a> from obtaining six magic rings and conquering a mysterious island. Gameplay is similar to previous "Sonic" games: players complete <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> while collecting rings and defeating enemies. "Knuckles' Chaotix" introduces a partner system whereby the player is connected to another character via a tether; the tether behaves like a rubber band and must be used to maneuver the characters.

While <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> is sometimes credited with creating "Knuckles' Chaotix", the game was developed by another development team at Sega. Production began with "Sonic Crackers", a 1994 <a href="prototype">prototype</a> for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> which experimented with the tethering system and featured <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic</a> and <a href="Tails%20%28character%29">Tails</a>. Development transitioned to the 32X under the <a href="working%20title">working title</a> "Knuckles' Ringstar"; Sonic and Tails were replaced by Knuckles and the Chaotix. One of the Chaotix members was <a href="Mighty%20the%20Armadillo">Mighty the Armadillo</a>, who first appeared in the arcade game "<a href="SegaSonic%20the%20Hedgehog">SegaSonic the Hedgehog</a>" (1993).

"Knuckles' Chaotix" was released in North America and Japan in April 1995, and in Europe in June 1995. It received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Reviewers found the tethering physics cumbersome, although some appreciated it as an attempt to innovate. The <a href="level%20design">level design</a> and low <a href="difficulty%20level">difficulty level</a> were also criticized. Journalists have described "Knuckles' Chaotix" as the last of the "classic" 2D "Sonic" games before the series moved to <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">3D</a>. Some characters and concepts introduced in the game feature in later "Sonic" games and media. Despite interest from fans, it has not been rereleased beyond a brief period through <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a> in the mid-2000s.

"Knuckles' Chaotix" is a <a href="Side-scrolling%20video%20game">side-scrolling</a> <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> similar to earlier entries in the <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog">"Sonic" series</a>. Unlike other "Sonic" games, players are tethered to a computer or human-controlled partner; the tether behaves like a rubber band and must be properly handled to maneuver through stages. There are five playable characters, each with their own unique abilities. <a href="Knuckles%20the%20Echidna">Knuckles the Echidna</a> can glide and climb walls; <a href="Mighty%20the%20Armadillo">Mighty the Armadillo</a> can perform a <a href="wall%20jump">wall jump</a>; <a href="Espio%20the%20Chameleon">Espio the Chameleon</a> can run along walls and ceilings; <a href="Vector%20the%20Crocodile">Vector the Crocodile</a> can boost through the air and climb walls; and <a href="Charmy%20Bee">Charmy Bee</a> can fly and hover. There are two other partner characters, Heavy the Robot and Bomb, who hinder players' progress due to their slow or destructive nature, respectively. The story takes place on a mysterious island and follows the group's efforts to stop <a href="Doctor%20Robotnik">Doctor Robotnik</a> and <a href="Metal%20Sonic">Metal Sonic</a> from harnessing the power of the island's mythical <a href="Chaos%20Emeralds">Chaos Rings</a> to satisfy their evil deeds.

The game takes place over six <a href="Level%20%28video%20gaming%29">levels</a> called attractions. Each attraction is divided into five acts; the fifth ends in a <a href="boss%20fight">boss fight</a> with Robotnik and one of his large robots. Each act has a different time of day decor, such as morning, noon, evening, and night. Like earlier "Sonic" games, players collect rings, jump to perform a spin attack to defeat enemies, and can perform a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. <a href="Power-up">Power-up</a>s include rings, shields, and speed shoes. The partner system enables players to perform actions not seen in earlier "Sonic" games. Players can call their partner if they are separated, which reunites them with the main character but costs 10 rings, or throw their partner to reach far platforms. If the partner is computer-controlled, the player can stop and anchor the partner to perform special moves such as "snapping" to a higher ledge or thrusting to gain speed.

Before entering a stage, the player begins in a <a href="Hub%20level%20system">hub world</a> where they choose a partner and level. Bonus stages are hidden throughout attractions, and can also be triggered by finishing a level with 20 or more rings. In the bonus levels, the player is free-falling and picks up power-ups. Special stages are reached by finishing a level with 50 or more rings. In these stages, the player collects blue spheres in a forward-scrolling platformer to earn a Chaos Ring. Collecting all Chaos Rings unlocks the "good" ending, in which <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28character%29">Sonic</a> and <a href="Tails%20%28character%29">Tails</a> are seen with the Chaotix, who have freed the island from Robotnik.

Development of "Knuckles' Chaotix" began in early 1994 as an <a href="Game%20engine">engine</a> test for the <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a> dubbed "Sonic Crackers". Although <a href="Sonic%20Team">Sonic Team</a> is sometimes credited for developing the game, it was developed by another internal Sega development team including young members of the staff who had worked on "<a href="Sonic%20CD">Sonic CD</a>" (1993). Developed as an idea for the next "Sonic" game, the prototype featured Sonic and Tails joined together by an elastic band of energy. Development eventually moved to the more powerful <a href="32X">32X</a> add-on for the Genesis. Sonic and Tails were replaced by a group of characters led by Knuckles the Echidna, but the core tethering gameplay was retained. The project was titled "Knuckles' Ringstar", and later "Knuckles' Chaotix". The "Sonic Crackers" prototype <a href="ROM%20image">ROM image</a> was later <a href="Internet%20leak">leaked</a> online and can be played with <a href="List%20of%20video%20game%20emulators">emulators</a>.

Along with Knuckles being given a starring role, the game includes Mighty the Armadillo, who had previously appeared in the arcade exclusive "<a href="SegaSonic%20the%20Hedgehog">SegaSonic the Hedgehog</a>" (1993). Vector the Crocodile also makes his debut; he was originally created to appear in "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%281991%20video%20game%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" (1991) but his appearance was scrapped before its release. The game also features two other new characters: Espio the Chameleon and Charmy Bee, the latter of whom originally appeared in the "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28manga%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" <a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28manga%29">manga</a>. These four characters have been dubbed "<a href="Chaotix">The Chaotix</a>" in retrospect. Tails was also intended to appear as a playable character, but was scrapped. A leaked <a href="prototype">prototype</a> version of the game lists Espio's name as the featured character on the title screen instead of Knuckles, suggesting he was once featured more prominently, possibly in a starring role. The 32X's processing power allowed for dynamic <a href="Sprite%20%28computer%20graphics%29">sprite</a>-scaling effects, and <a href="Polygon%20mesh">3D polygons</a> in the special stages. A complex <a href="Palette%20%28computing%29">palette</a> system was implemented, allowing each level to load its own unique colors. The music was composed by Junko Siratsu and <a href="Mariko%20Nanba">Mariko Nanba</a>.

"Knuckles' Chaotix" was released in North America in April 1995, in Japan on April 21, 1995, and in Europe in June 1995. It is considered a valuable <a href="Video%20game%20collecting">collector's item</a> due to the 32X's <a href="List%20of%20commercial%20failures%20in%20video%20gaming">commercial failure</a>. The game's only rerelease was in 2005, when it was made available for <a href="macOS">macOS</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> via the subscription service <a href="GameTap">GameTap</a>.

"Knuckles' Chaotix" received mixed reviews, and failed commercially, as did the 32X.

The game's presentation divided critics. The four reviewers of "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" ("EGM") praised its graphics and believed the game was one of the best for the 32X, and "<a href="GameFan">GameFan</a>" considered "Knuckles' Chaotix" the best entry in the franchise since "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%202">Sonic the Hedgehog 2</a>" (1992). On the other hand, a reviewer from "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" found the graphics garish, and felt that the game made "unimpressive attempts to show off". "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>", "<a href="Game%20Players">Game Players</a>", and "<a href="IGN">IGN</a>" believed the game failed to push the 32X to its limits, citing the lack of graphical effects and Genesis-quality audio, though "IGN" felt some elements, such as several musical tracks, were highlights. In 2008, "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>" wrote that "Knuckles' Chaotix" was the best game for the 32X and was underrated, though it still considered the game a "wasted opportunity".

The "rubber band" multiplayer system was largely panned, despite being acknowledged as an effort to innovate. Though "IGN" admired the attempt to "breathe life into a series that was running out of steam" and fix the lopsided multiplayer of "Sonic 2" and "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%203">Sonic 3</a>" (1994), whereby Tails would get lost off-screen, they felt the physics were "clunky" and unorthodox. "EGM" felt the system was original, but slowed down the gameplay, as did "GamesRadar". "Next Generation" felt the bond was tiring and not truly innovative, and "GamePro" called it "Knuckles' Chaotix"s biggest flaw, finding it frustrating and choppy. The reviewer also found that the bond complicated gameplay and compared it to being handcuffed.

The level design and low difficulty were also criticized. "GamePro" wrote that the levels, while fairly large, were not populated with enough enemies or secrets, a sentiment echoed by "IGN" and "<a href="Mean%20Machines%20Sega">Mean Machines Sega</a>". "IGN" considered the boss design simplistic and the level design bland and seemingly unfinished, and "Mean Machines Sega" thought that, without enemies, "this is just not half the game it could have been". "Game Players" criticized the game's lack of <a href="replay%20value">replay value</a>, saying the game's simplicity made secrets in levels impossible to miss. However, "IGN", "GameFan", and "EGM" praised the number of playable characters, and "IGN" felt the game's "marvelous" fully 3D special stages were the best of the "Sonic" series.

Overall, "IGN" described "Knuckles' Chaotix" as "a bad game with a good foundation", and in another article, concluded that the game was interesting, if flawed. "EGM" felt the game was the best for the 32X but failed to live up to previous games in the "Sonic" series. "Game Players" found the game a major disappointment, saying "other than a few color-enhanced backgrounds, you're gonna wonder why this isn't a Genesis title". Some journalists have referred to "Knuckles' Chaotix" as the series' declining point, and "<a href="AllGame">AllGame</a>" and "Complex" both wrote that it was among the worst games in the series.

"Knuckles' Chaotix" is considered the last of the "classic" "Sonic" games before the 3D game "<a href="Sonic%20Adventure">Sonic Adventure</a>" (1998) took the series in new gameplay directions. Several of its concepts were re-used in later "Sonic" games. A similar partner system features in the <a href="Game%20Boy%20Advance">Game Boy Advance</a> game "<a href="Sonic%20Advance%203">Sonic Advance 3</a>" (2004), and "IGN" noted similarities between the game's auto-running special stages and "<a href="Sonic%20and%20the%20Secret%20Rings">Sonic and the Secret Rings</a>" (2007). Two tracks from "Knuckles' Chaotix", "Tube Panic" and "Door Into Summer", appear in "<a href="Sonic%20Generations">Sonic Generations</a>" (2011). The "Hyper Ring" power-up re-appeared in "<a href="Sonic%20Mania">Sonic Mania</a>" (2017) and a recreation of "Knuckles' Chaotix"s final boss fight was added in a 2018 update.

With the exception of Mighty, who has made only cameos, all Chaotix members have become recurring characters in the "Sonic" series. The group had storylines in the "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Hedgehog%20%28Archie%20Comics%29">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>" comic series produced by <a href="Archie%20Comics">Archie Comics</a> and "<a href="Sonic%20the%20Comic">Sonic the Comic</a>" by <a href="Fleetway%20Publications">Fleetway Publications</a>, as well as in the <a href="anime">anime</a> series "<a href="Sonic%20X">Sonic X</a>". "GamesRadar" considered the introduction of the Chaotix a turning point for the series, as it "diluted the "Sonic"-verse by introducing tons of shitty characters".

In 2011, Sega noted fans frequently requested "Knuckles' Chaotix" as a game desired to be rereleased. "<a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a>" and "<a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>" expressed disappointment the 2005 compilation "<a href="Sonic%20Gems%20Collection">Sonic Gems Collection</a>" did not include the game. In 2010, the head of Sonic Team, <a href="Takashi%20Iizuka%20%28game%20designer%29">Takashi Iizuka</a>, expressed interest in developing a sequel.

Phagocyte

Phagocytes are <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cell</a>s that protect the body by ingesting harmful foreign particles, bacteria, and dead or <a href="Apoptosis">dying</a> cells. Their name comes from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "phagein", "to eat" or "devour", and "-cyte", the suffix in biology denoting "cell", from the Greek "kutos", "hollow vessel". They are essential for fighting infections and for subsequent <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a>. Phagocytes are important throughout the animal kingdom and are highly developed within vertebrates. One <a href="litre">litre</a> of human blood contains about six billion phagocytes. They were discovered in 1882 by <a href="Ilya%20Ilyich%20Mechnikov">Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov</a> while he was studying <a href="starfish">starfish</a> <a href="larva">larva</a>e. Mechnikov was awarded the 1908 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for his discovery. Phagocytes occur in many species; some <a href="amoeboid">amoebae</a> behave like macrophage phagocytes, which suggests that phagocytes appeared early in the evolution of life.

Phagocytes of humans and other animals are called "professional" or "non-professional" depending on how effective they are at <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a>. The professional phagocytes include many types of <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>s (such as <a href="neutrophil">neutrophil</a>s, <a href="monocyte">monocyte</a>s, <a href="macrophage">macrophage</a>s, <a href="mast%20cell">mast cell</a>s, and <a href="dendritic%20cell">dendritic cell</a>s). The main difference between professional and non-professional phagocytes is that the professional phagocytes have molecules called <a href="receptor%20%28biochemistry%29">receptors</a> on their surfaces that can detect harmful objects, such as bacteria, that are not normally found in the body. Phagocytes are crucial in fighting infections, as well as in maintaining healthy tissues by removing dead and dying cells that have reached the end of their lifespan.

During an infection, chemical signals attract phagocytes to places where the pathogen has invaded the body. These chemicals may come from bacteria or from other phagocytes already present. The phagocytes move by a method called <a href="chemotaxis">chemotaxis</a>. When phagocytes come into contact with bacteria, the receptors on the phagocyte's surface will bind to them. This binding will lead to the engulfing of the bacteria by the phagocyte. Some phagocytes kill the ingested pathogen with <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">oxidants</a> and <a href="nitric%20oxide">nitric oxide</a>. After phagocytosis, macrophages and dendritic cells can also participate in <a href="antigen%20presentation">antigen presentation</a>, a process in which a phagocyte moves parts of the ingested material back to its surface. This material is then displayed to other cells of the immune system. Some phagocytes then travel to the body's <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>s and display the material to white blood cells called <a href="lymphocytes">lymphocytes</a>. This process is important in building immunity, and many pathogens have evolved methods to evade attacks by phagocytes.

The Russian zoologist <a href="Ilya%20Ilyich%20Mechnikov">Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov</a> (1845–1916) first recognized that specialized cells were involved in defense against microbial infections. In 1882, he studied <a href="motility">motile</a> (freely moving) cells in the <a href="larva">larva</a>e of <a href="Sea%20star">starfishes</a>, believing they were important to the animals' immune defenses. To test his idea, he inserted small thorns from a <a href="tangerine">tangerine</a> tree into the larvae. After a few hours he noticed that the motile cells had surrounded the thorns. Mechnikov traveled to <a href="Vienna">Vienna</a> and shared his ideas with <a href="Carl%20Friedrich%20Wilhelm%20Claus">Carl Friedrich Claus</a> who suggested the name ‘‘phagocyte’’ (from the Greek words "phagein", meaning "to eat or devour", and "kutos", meaning "hollow vessel") for the cells that Mechnikov had observed.

A year later, Mechnikov studied a fresh water <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a> called "<a href="Daphnia">Daphnia</a>", a tiny transparent animal that can be examined directly under a microscope. He discovered that fungal spores that attacked the animal were destroyed by phagocytes. He went on to extend his observations to the white blood cells of mammals and discovered that the <a href="Bacteria">bacterium</a> "<a href="Bacillus%20anthracis">Bacillus anthracis</a>" could be engulfed and killed by phagocytes, a process that he called <a href="phagocytosis">phagocytosis</a>. Mechnikov proposed that phagocytes were a primary defense against invading organisms.

In 1903, <a href="Almroth%20Wright">Almroth Wright</a> discovered that phagocytosis was reinforced by specific <a href="antibody">antibodies</a> that he called <a href="opsonin">opsonin</a>s, from the Greek "<a href="opson">opson</a>", "a dressing or relish". Mechnikov was awarded (jointly with <a href="Paul%20Ehrlich">Paul Ehrlich</a>) the 1908 <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Physiology%20or%20Medicine">Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine</a> for his work on phagocytes and phagocytosis.

Although the importance of these discoveries slowly gained acceptance during the early twentieth century, the intricate relationships between phagocytes and all the other components of the immune system were not known until the 1980s.

Phagocytosis is the process of taking in particles such as bacteria, parasites, <a href="apoptosis">dead host cells</a>, and cellular and foreign debris by a cell. It involves a chain of molecular processes. Phagocytosis occurs after the foreign body, a bacterial cell, for example, has bound to molecules called "receptors" that are on the surface of the phagocyte. The phagocyte then stretches itself around the bacterium and engulfs it. Phagocytosis of bacteria by human neutrophils takes on average nine minutes. Once inside this phagocyte, the bacterium is trapped in a compartment called a <a href="phagosome">phagosome</a>. Within one minute the phagosome merges with either a <a href="lysosome">lysosome</a> or a <a href="Granule%20%28cell%20biology%29">granule</a> to form a <a href="phagolysosome">phagolysosome</a>. The bacterium is then subjected to an overwhelming array of killing mechanisms and is dead a few minutes later. Dendritic cells and macrophages are not so fast, and phagocytosis can take many hours in these cells. Macrophages are slow and untidy eaters; they engulf huge quantities of material and frequently release some undigested back into the tissues. This debris serves as a signal to recruit more phagocytes from the blood. Phagocytes have voracious appetites; scientists have even fed macrophages with <a href="iron%20filings">iron filings</a> and then used a small magnet to separate them from other cells.

A phagocyte has many types of receptors on its surface that are used to bind material. They include <a href="opsonin">opsonin</a> receptors, <a href="scavenger%20receptor%20%28immunology%29">scavenger receptor</a>s, and <a href="Toll-like%20receptors">Toll-like receptors</a>. Opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of bacteria that have been coated with <a href="immunoglobulin%20G">immunoglobulin G</a> (IgG) <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a> or with <a href="complement%20system">complement</a>. "Complement" is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction. Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells, and Toll-like receptors—so called because of their similarity to well-studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the <a href="Toll%20%28gene%29">Toll gene</a>—bind to more specific molecules. Binding to Toll-like receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the phagocyte to release a group of hormones that cause <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a>.

The killing of microbes is a critical function of phagocytes that is performed either within the phagocyte (<a href="intracellular">intracellular</a> killing) or outside of the phagocyte (<a href="extracellular">extracellular</a> killing).

When a phagocyte ingests bacteria (or any material), its oxygen consumption increases. The increase in oxygen consumption, called a <a href="respiratory%20burst">respiratory burst</a>, produces reactive oxygen-containing molecules that are anti-microbial. The oxygen compounds are toxic to both the invader and the cell itself, so they are kept in compartments inside the cell. This method of killing invading microbes by using the reactive oxygen-containing molecules is referred to as oxygen-dependent intracellular killing, of which there are two types.

The first type is the oxygen-dependent production of a <a href="superoxide">superoxide</a>, which is an oxygen-rich bacteria-killing substance. The superoxide is converted to <a href="hydrogen%20peroxide">hydrogen peroxide</a> and <a href="singlet%20oxygen">singlet oxygen</a> by an enzyme called <a href="superoxide%20dismutase">superoxide dismutase</a>. Superoxides also react with the hydrogen peroxide to produce <a href="hydroxyl%20radicals">hydroxyl radicals</a>, which assist in killing the invading microbe.

The second type involves the use of the enzyme <a href="myeloperoxidase">myeloperoxidase</a> from neutrophil granules. When granules fuse with a phagosome, myeloperoxidase is released into the phagolysosome, and this enzyme uses hydrogen peroxide and <a href="chlorine">chlorine</a> to create <a href="hypochlorite">hypochlorite</a>, a substance used in domestic <a href="bleach">bleach</a>. Hypochlorite is extremely toxic to bacteria. Myeloperoxidase contains a <a href="heme">heme</a> pigment, which accounts for the green color of secretions rich in neutrophils, such as <a href="pus">pus</a> and infected <a href="sputum">sputum</a>.

Phagocytes can also kill microbes by oxygen-independent methods, but these are not as effective as the oxygen-dependent ones. There are four main types. The first uses electrically charged proteins that damage the bacterium's <a href="cell%20membrane">membrane</a>. The second type uses lysozymes; these enzymes break down the bacterial <a href="cell%20wall">cell wall</a>. The third type uses <a href="lactoferrin">lactoferrin</a>s, which are present in neutrophil granules and remove essential iron from bacteria. The fourth type uses <a href="proteases">proteases</a> and <a href="hydrolytic%20enzymes">hydrolytic enzymes</a>; these enzymes are used to digest the proteins of destroyed bacteria.

<a href="Interferon-gamma">Interferon-gamma</a>—which was once called macrophage activating factor—stimulates macrophages to produce <a href="nitric%20oxide">nitric oxide</a>. The source of interferon-gamma can be <a href="CD4%2B%20T%20cells">CD4 T cells</a>, <a href="CD8%2B%20T%20cells">CD8 T cells</a>, <a href="NK%20cell">natural killer cells</a>, <a href="B%20cells">B cells</a>, <a href="NKT%20cell">natural killer T cells</a>, monocytes, macrophages, or dendritic cells. Nitric oxide is then released from the macrophage and, because of its toxicity, kills microbes near the macrophage. Activated macrophages produce and secrete <a href="tumor%20necrosis%20factors">tumor necrosis factor</a>. This <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>—a class of signaling molecule—kills cancer cells and cells infected by viruses, and helps to activate the other cells of the immune system.

In some diseases, e.g., the rare <a href="chronic%20granulomatous%20disease">chronic granulomatous disease</a>, the efficiency of phagocytes is impaired, and recurrent bacterial infections are a problem. In this disease there is an abnormality affecting different elements of oxygen-dependent killing. Other rare congenital abnormalities, such as <a href="Ch%C3%A9diak%E2%80%93Higashi%20syndrome">Chédiak–Higashi syndrome</a>, are also associated with defective killing of ingested microbes.

<a href="Virus">Virus</a>es can reproduce only inside cells, and they gain entry by using many of the receptors involved in immunity. Once inside the cell, viruses use the cell's biological machinery to their own advantage, forcing the cell to make hundreds of identical copies of themselves. Although phagocytes and other components of the innate immune system can, to a limited extent, control viruses, once a virus is inside a cell the adaptive immune responses, particularly the lymphocytes, are more important for defense. At the sites of viral infections, lymphocytes often vastly outnumber all the other cells of the immune system; this is common in viral <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a>. Virus-infected cells that have been killed by lymphocytes are cleared from the body by phagocytes.

In an animal, cells are constantly dying. A balance between <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a> and cell death keeps the number of cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by <a href="necrosis">necrosis</a> or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or <a href="programmed%20cell%20death">programmed cell death</a>—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes play a crucial role in this process.

Dying cells that undergo the final stages of <a href="apoptosis">apoptosis</a> display molecules, such as <a href="phosphatidylserine">phosphatidylserine</a>, on their cell surface to attract phagocytes. Phosphatidylserine is normally found on the <a href="cytoplasm">cytosolic</a> surface of the plasma membrane, but is redistributed during apoptosis to the extracellular surface by a hypothetical protein known as <a href="scramblase">scramblase</a>. These molecules mark the cell for phagocytosis by cells that possess the appropriate receptors, such as macrophages. The removal of dying cells by phagocytes occurs in an orderly manner without eliciting an <a href="inflammatory%20response">inflammatory response</a> and is an important function of phagocytes.

Phagocytes are usually not bound to any particular <a href="organ%20%28anatomy%29">organ</a> but move through the body interacting with the other phagocytic and non-phagocytic cells of the immune system. They can communicate with other cells by producing chemicals called <a href="cytokines">cytokines</a>, which recruit other phagocytes to the site of infections or stimulate dormant <a href="lymphocyte">lymphocyte</a>s. Phagocytes form part of the <a href="innate%20immune%20system">innate immune system</a>, which animals, including humans, are born with. Innate immunity is very effective but non-specific in that it does not discriminate between different sorts of invaders. On the other hand, the <a href="adaptive%20immune%20system">adaptive immune system</a> of jawed vertebrates—the basis of acquired immunity—is highly specialized and can protect against almost any type of invader. The adaptive immune system is not dependent on phagocytes but lymphocytes, which produce protective proteins called <a href="antibody">antibodies</a>, which tag invaders for destruction and prevent <a href="virus">virus</a>es from infecting cells. Phagocytes, in particular dendritic cells and macrophages, stimulate lymphocytes to produce antibodies by an important process called <a href="antigen">antigen</a> presentation.

Antigen presentation is a process in which some phagocytes move parts of engulfed materials back to the surface of their cells and "present" them to other cells of the immune system. There are two "professional" antigen-presenting cells: macrophages and dendritic cells. After engulfment, foreign proteins (the <a href="antigen">antigen</a>s) are broken down into <a href="peptide">peptide</a>s inside dendritic cells and macrophages. These peptides are then bound to the cell's <a href="major%20histocompatibility%20complex">major histocompatibility complex</a> (MHC) glycoproteins, which carry the peptides back to the phagocyte's surface where they can be "presented" to lymphocytes. Mature macrophages do not travel far from the site of infection, but dendritic cells can reach the body's <a href="lymph%20node">lymph node</a>s, where there are millions of lymphocytes. This enhances immunity because the lymphocytes respond to the antigens presented by the dendritic cells just as they would at the site of the original infection. But dendritic cells can also destroy or pacify lymphocytes if they recognize components of the host body; this is necessary to prevent autoimmune reactions. This process is called tolerance.

Dendritic cells also promote immunological tolerance, which stops the body from attacking itself. The first type of tolerance is <a href="central%20tolerance">central tolerance</a>, that occurs in the thymus. <a href="T%20cell">T cell</a>s that bind (via their T cell receptor) to self antigen (presented by dendritic cells on MHC molecules) too strongly are induced to die. The second type of immunological tolerance is <a href="peripheral%20tolerance">peripheral tolerance</a>. 
Some self reactive T cells escape the thymus for a number of reasons, mainly due to the lack of expression of some self antigens in the thymus. Another type of T cell; T regulatory cells can down regulate self reactive T cells in the periphery. When immunological tolerance fails, <a href="autoimmune%20disease">autoimmune disease</a>s can follow.

Phagocytes of humans and other jawed vertebrates are divided into "professional" and "non-professional" groups based on the efficiency with which they participate in phagocytosis. The professional phagocytes are the <a href="monocytes">monocytes</a>, <a href="macrophages">macrophages</a>, <a href="neutrophils">neutrophils</a>, tissue <a href="dendritic%20cell">dendritic cell</a>s and <a href="mast%20cell">mast cell</a>s. One <a href="litre">litre</a> of human blood contains about six billion phagocytes.

All phagocytes, and especially macrophages, exist in degrees of readiness. Macrophages are usually relatively dormant in the tissues and proliferate slowly. In this semi-resting state, they clear away dead host cells and other non-infectious debris and rarely take part in antigen presentation. But, during an infection, they receive chemical signals—usually <a href="interferon%20gamma">interferon gamma</a>—which increases their production of <a href="MHC%20class%20II">MHC II</a> molecules and which prepares them for presenting antigens. In this state, macrophages are good antigen presenters and killers. However, if they receive a signal directly from an invader, they become "hyperactivated", stop proliferating, and concentrate on killing. Their size and rate of phagocytosis increases—some become large enough to engulf invading <a href="protozoa">protozoa</a>.

In the blood, neutrophils are inactive but are swept along at high speed. When they receive signals from macrophages at the sites of inflammation, they slow down and leave the blood. In the tissues, they are activated by cytokines and arrive at the battle scene ready to kill.

When an infection occurs, a chemical "SOS" signal is given off to attract phagocytes to the site. These chemical signals may include proteins from invading <a href="bacteria">bacteria</a>, clotting system <a href="peptides">peptides</a>, <a href="Complement%20system">complement</a> products, and cytokines that have been given off by macrophages located in the tissue near the infection site. Another group of chemical attractants are <a href="cytokines">cytokines</a> that recruit neutrophils and monocytes from the blood.

To reach the site of infection, phagocytes leave the bloodstream and enter the affected tissues. Signals from the infection cause the <a href="endothelial">endothelial</a> cells that line the blood vessels to make a protein called <a href="selectin">selectin</a>, which neutrophils stick to on passing by. Other signals called <a href="vasodilator">vasodilator</a>s loosen the junctions connecting endothelial cells, allowing the phagocytes to pass through the wall. <a href="Chemotaxis">Chemotaxis</a> is the process by which phagocytes follow the cytokine "scent" to the infected spot. Neutrophils travel across <a href="epithelial">epithelial</a> cell-lined organs to sites of infection, and although this is an important component of fighting infection, the migration itself can result in disease-like symptoms. During an infection, millions of neutrophils are recruited from the blood, but they die after a few days.

Monocytes develop in the bone marrow and reach maturity in the blood. Mature monocytes have large, smooth, lobed nuclei and abundant <a href="cytoplasm">cytoplasm</a> that contains granules. Monocytes ingest foreign or dangerous substances and present <a href="antigens">antigens</a> to other cells of the immune system. Monocytes form two groups: a circulating group and a marginal group that remain in other tissues (approximately 70% are in the marginal group). Most monocytes leave the blood stream after 20–40 hours to travel to tissues and organs and in doing so transform into macrophages or dendritic cells depending on the signals they receive. There are about 500 million monocytes in one litre of human blood.

Mature macrophages do not travel far but stand guard over those areas of the body that are exposed to the outside world. There they act as garbage collectors, antigen presenting cells, or ferocious killers, depending on the signals they receive. They derive from monocytes, <a href="granulocyte">granulocyte</a> stem cells, or the <a href="cell%20division">cell division</a> of pre-existing macrophages. Human macrophages are about 21 micrometers in diameter.

This type of phagocyte does not have granules but contains many <a href="lysosome">lysosome</a>s. Macrophages are found throughout the body in almost all tissues and organs (e.g., <a href="microglial%20cell">microglial cell</a>s in the <a href="brain">brain</a> and <a href="pulmonary%20alveolus">alveolar</a> macrophages in the <a href="lungs">lungs</a>), where they silently lie in wait. A macrophage's location can determine its size and appearance. Macrophages cause inflammation through the production of <a href="interleukin-1">interleukin-1</a>, <a href="interleukin-6">interleukin-6</a>, and <a href="Tumor%20necrosis%20factor-alpha">TNF-alpha</a>. Macrophages are usually only found in tissue and are rarely seen in blood circulation. The life-span of tissue macrophages has been estimated to range from four to fifteen days.

Macrophages can be activated to perform functions that a resting monocyte cannot. <a href="T%20helper%20cell">T helper cell</a>s (also known as effector T cells or T cells), a sub-group of lymphocytes, are responsible for the activation of macrophages. T1 cells activate macrophages by signaling with <a href="IFN-gamma">IFN-gamma</a> and displaying the protein <a href="CD40%20ligand">CD40 ligand</a>. Other signals include TNF-alpha and <a href="lipopolysaccharides">lipopolysaccharides</a> from bacteria. T1 cells can recruit other phagocytes to the site of the infection in several ways. They secrete cytokines that act on the <a href="bone%20marrow">bone marrow</a> to stimulate the production of monocytes and neutrophils, and they secrete some of the <a href="cytokine">cytokine</a>s that are responsible for the migration of monocytes and neutrophils out of the bloodstream. T1 cells come from the <a href="cellular%20differentiation">differentiation</a> of CD4 T cells once they have responded to antigen in the <a href="lymphatic%20system">secondary lymphoid tissues</a>. Activated macrophages play a potent role in <a href="tumor">tumor</a> destruction by producing TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, nitric oxide, reactive oxygen compounds, <a href="cation">cation</a>ic proteins, and hydrolytic enzymes.

Neutrophils are normally found in the <a href="circulatory%20system">bloodstream</a> and are the most abundant type of phagocyte, constituting 50% to 60% of the total circulating white blood cells. One litre of human blood contains about five billion neutrophils, which are about 10 <a href="micrometer">micrometer</a>s in diameter and live for only about five days. Once they have received the appropriate signals, it takes them about thirty minutes to leave the blood and reach the site of an infection. They are ferocious eaters and rapidly engulf invaders coated with <a href="antibody">antibodies</a> and <a href="complement%20system">complement</a>, and damaged cells or cellular debris. Neutrophils do not return to the blood; they turn into <a href="pus">pus</a> cells and die. Mature neutrophils are smaller than monocytes and have a segmented <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nucleus</a> with several sections; each section is connected by <a href="chromatin">chromatin</a> filaments—neutrophils can have 2–5 segments. Neutrophils do not normally exit the bone marrow until maturity but during an infection neutrophil precursors called <a href="myelocyte">myelocyte</a>s and <a href="promyelocyte">promyelocyte</a>s are released.

The intra-cellular granules of the human neutrophil have long been recognized for their protein-destroying and bactericidal properties. Neutrophils can secrete products that stimulate monocytes and macrophages. Neutrophil secretions increase phagocytosis and the formation of reactive oxygen compounds involved in intracellular killing. Secretions from the <a href="azurophilic%20granules">primary granules</a> of neutrophils stimulate the phagocytosis of <a href="IgG">IgG</a>-antibody-coated bacteria.

Dendritic cells are specialized antigen-presenting cells that have long outgrowths called dendrites, that help to engulf microbes and other invaders. Dendritic cells are present in the tissues that are in contact with the external environment, mainly the skin, the inner lining of the nose, the lungs, the stomach, and the intestines. Once activated, they mature and migrate to the lymphoid tissues where they interact with <a href="T%20cells">T cells</a> and <a href="B%20cells">B cells</a> to initiate and orchestrate the adaptive immune response.
Mature dendritic cells activate <a href="T%20helper%20cell">T helper cell</a>s and <a href="cytotoxic%20T%20cell">cytotoxic T cell</a>s. The activated helper T cells interact with macrophages and B cells to activate them in turn. In addition, dendritic cells can influence the type of immune response produced; when they travel to the lymphoid areas where T cells are held they can activate T cells, which then differentiate into cytotoxic T cells or helper T cells.

Mast cells have <a href="Toll-like%20receptor">Toll-like receptor</a>s and interact with dendritic cells, B cells, and T cells to help mediate adaptive immune functions. Mast cells express <a href="MHC%20class%20II">MHC class II</a> molecules and can participate in antigen presentation; however, the mast cell's role in antigen presentation is not very well understood. Mast cells can consume and kill <a href="gram-negative%20bacteria">gram-negative bacteria</a> (e.g., <a href="salmonella">salmonella</a>), and process their antigens. They specialize in processing the <a href="fimbria%20%28bacteriology%29">fimbrial proteins</a> on the surface of bacteria, which are involved in adhesion to tissues. In addition to these functions, mast cells produce cytokines that induce an inflammatory response. This is a vital part of the destruction of microbes because the cytokines attract more phagocytes to the site of infection.

Dying cells and foreign organisms are consumed by cells other than the "professional" phagocytes. These cells include <a href="epithelial%20cell">epithelial cell</a>s, <a href="endothelial%20cell">endothelial cell</a>s, <a href="fibroblast">fibroblast</a>s, and mesenchymal cells. They are called non-professional phagocytes, to emphasize that, in contrast to professional phagocytes, phagocytosis is not their principal function. Fibroblasts, for example, which can phagocytose collagen in the process of remolding scars, will also make some attempt to ingest foreign particles.

Non-professional phagocytes are more limited than professional phagocytes in the type of particles they can take up. This is due to their lack of efficient phagocytic receptors, in particular <a href="opsonin">opsonin</a>s—which are antibodies and complement attached to invaders by the immune system. Additionally, most nonprofessional phagocytes do not produce reactive oxygen-containing molecules in response to phagocytosis.

A pathogen is only successful in infecting an organism if it can get past its defenses. Pathogenic bacteria and protozoa have developed a variety of methods to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually survive and replicate within phagocytic cells.

There are several ways bacteria avoid contact with phagocytes. First, they can grow in sites that phagocytes are not capable of traveling to (e.g., the surface of unbroken skin). Second, bacteria can suppress the <a href="inflammatory%20response">inflammatory response</a>; without this response to infection phagocytes cannot respond adequately. Third, some species of bacteria can inhibit the ability of phagocytes to travel to the site of infection by interfering with chemotaxis. Fourth, some bacteria can avoid contact with phagocytes by tricking the immune system into "thinking" that the bacteria are "self". "<a href="Treponema%20pallidum">Treponema pallidum</a>"—the bacterium that causes <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>—hides from phagocytes by coating its surface with <a href="fibronectin">fibronectin</a>, which is produced naturally by the body and plays a crucial role in <a href="wound%20healing">wound healing</a>.

Bacteria often produce proteins or sugars that coat their cells and interfere with phagocytosis; these are called <a href="bacterial%20capsule">capsules</a>. Some examples are the K5 capsule and O75 <a href="O%20antigen">O antigen</a> found on the surface of "<a href="Escherichia%20coli">Escherichia coli</a>", and the <a href="exopolysaccharide">exopolysaccharide</a> capsules of "<a href="Staphylococcus%20epidermidis">Staphylococcus epidermidis</a>". "<a href="Streptococcus%20pneumoniae">Streptococcus pneumoniae</a>" produces several types of capsule that provide different levels of protection, and <a href="group%20A%20streptococci">group A streptococci</a> produce proteins such as <a href="M%20protein%20%28Streptococcus%29">M protein</a> and <a href="fimbria%20%28bacteriology%29">fimbrial proteins</a> to block engulfment. Some proteins hinder opsonin-related ingestion; "<a href="Staphylococcus%20aureus">Staphylococcus aureus</a>" produces <a href="Protein%20A">Protein A</a> to block antibody receptors, which decreases the effectiveness of opsonins. Enteropathogenic species of the genus <a href="Yersinia">Yersinia</a> bind with the use of the virulence factor <a href="YopH">YopH</a> to receptors of phagocytes from which they influence the cells capability to exert phagocytosis.

Bacteria have developed ways to survive inside phagocytes, where they continue to evade the immune system. To get safely inside the phagocyte they express proteins called <a href="invasin">invasin</a>s. When inside the cell they remain in the cytoplasm and avoid toxic chemicals contained in the phagolysosomes. Some bacteria prevent the fusion of a phagosome and lysosome, to form the phagolysosome. Other pathogens, such as "<a href="Leishmania">Leishmania</a>", create a highly modified <a href="vacuole">vacuole</a> inside the phagocyte, which helps them persist and replicate. Some bacteria are capable of living inside of the phagolysosome. "Staphylococcus aureus", for example, produces the enzymes <a href="catalase">catalase</a> and <a href="superoxide%20dismutase">superoxide dismutase</a>, which break down chemicals—such as hydrogen peroxide—produced by phagocytes to kill bacteria. Bacteria may escape from the phagosome before the formation of the phagolysosome: "<a href="Listeria%20monocytogenes">Listeria monocytogenes</a>" can make a hole in the phagosome wall using enzymes called <a href="hemolysin">listeriolysin O</a> and <a href="phospholipase">phospholipase C</a>.

Bacteria have developed several ways of killing phagocytes. These include <a href="cytolysin">cytolysin</a>s, which form pores in the phagocyte's cell membranes, <a href="streptolysins">streptolysins</a> and <a href="leukocidin">leukocidin</a>s, which cause neutrophils' granules to rupture and release toxic substances, and <a href="exotoxins">exotoxins</a> that reduce the supply of a phagocyte's <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>, needed for phagocytosis. After a bacterium is ingested, it may kill the phagocyte by releasing toxins that travel through the phagosome or phagolysosome membrane to target other parts of the cell.

Some survival strategies often involve disrupting cytokines and other methods of <a href="cell%20signaling">cell signaling</a> to prevent the phagocyte's responding to invasion. The protozoan parasites "<a href="Toxoplasma%20gondii">Toxoplasma gondii</a>", "<a href="Trypanosoma%20cruzi">Trypanosoma cruzi</a>", and "<a href="Leishmania">Leishmania</a>" infect macrophages, and each has a unique way of taming them. Some species of "Leishmania" alter the infected macrophage's signalling, repress the production of cytokines and microbicidal molecules—nitric oxide and reactive oxygen species—and compromise antigen presentation.

Macrophages and neutrophils, in particular, play a central role in the inflammatory process by releasing proteins and small-molecule inflammatory mediators that control infection but can damage host tissue. In general, phagocytes aim to destroy pathogens by engulfing them and subjecting them to a battery of toxic chemicals inside a <a href="phagolysosome">phagolysosome</a>. If a phagocyte fails to engulf its target, these toxic agents can be released into the environment (an action referred to as "frustrated phagocytosis"). As these agents are also toxic to host cells, they can cause extensive damage to healthy cells and tissues.

When neutrophils release their granule contents in the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>, the contents of the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the <a href="extracellular%20matrix">extracellular matrix</a> of host cells and can cause damage to <a href="glomerular">glomerular</a> cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, <a href="phospholipase">phospholipase</a> products (e.g., <a href="leukotrienes">leukotrienes</a>) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils to the site of infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause <a href="renal%20failure">renal failure</a>.

Neutrophils also play a key role in the development of most forms of <a href="acute%20lung%20injury">acute lung injury</a>. Here, activated neutrophils release the contents of their toxic granules into the lung environment. Experiments have shown that a reduction in the number of neutrophils lessens the effects of acute lung injury, but treatment by inhibiting neutrophils is not clinically realistic, as it would leave the host vulnerable to infection. In the <a href="liver">liver</a>, damage by neutrophils can contribute to dysfunction and injury in response to the release of <a href="endotoxin">endotoxin</a>s produced by bacteria, <a href="sepsis">sepsis</a>, trauma, <a href="alcoholic%20hepatitis">alcoholic hepatitis</a>, <a href="ischemia">ischemia</a>, and <a href="hypovolemic%20shock">hypovolemic shock</a> resulting from acute <a href="hemorrhage">hemorrhage</a>.

Chemicals released by macrophages can also damage host tissue. <a href="Tumor%20necrosis%20factor-alpha">TNF-α</a> is an important chemical that is released by macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a bacterial infection spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause <a href="vasodilation">vasodilation</a> and a decrease in <a href="blood%20plasma">plasma</a> volume; these in turn can be followed by <a href="septic%20shock">septic shock</a>. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.

Phagocytosis is common and probably appeared early in <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, evolving first in unicellular eukaryotes. <a href="Amoeba">Amoeba</a>e are unicellular <a href="protists">protists</a> that separated from the tree leading to <a href="metazoa">metazoa</a> shortly after the divergence of plants, and they share many specific functions with mammalian phagocytic cells. "<a href="Dictyostelium%20discoideum">Dictyostelium discoideum</a>", for example, is an amoeba that lives in the soil and feeds on bacteria. Like animal phagocytes, it engulfs bacteria by phagocytosis mainly through Toll-like receptors, and it has other biological functions in common with macrophages. "Dictyostelium discoideum" is social; it aggregates when starved to form a migrating <a href="Dictyostelid">pseudoplasmodium or slug</a>. This multicellular organism eventually will produce a <a href="fruiting%20body">fruiting body</a> with <a href="spores">spores</a> that are resistant to environmental dangers. Before the formation of fruiting bodies, the cells will migrate as a slug-like organism for several days. During this time, exposure to toxins or bacterial pathogens has the potential to compromise survival of the species by limiting spore production. Some of the amoebae engulf bacteria and absorb toxins while circulating within the slug, and these amoebae eventually die. They are genetically identical to the other amoebae in the slug; their self-sacrifice to protect the other amoebae from bacteria is similar to the self-sacrifice of phagocytes seen in the immune system of higher vertebrates. This ancient immune function in social amoebae suggests an evolutionarily conserved cellular foraging mechanism that might have been adapted to defense functions well before the diversification of amoebae into higher forms. However, a common ancestry with mammalian phagocytes has not been proven. Phagocytes occur throughout the animal kingdom, from marine sponges to insects and lower and higher vertebrates. The ability of amoebae to distinguish between self and non-self is a pivotal one, and is the root of the immune system of many species of amoeba.

Gottlob Berger

Gottlob Christian Berger (16 July 1896 – 5 January 1975) was a senior <a href="Nazi%20Germany">German</a> <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi</a> official who held the rank of "<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS</a>" (lieutenant general), and was the chief of the <a href="SS%20Main%20Office">SS Main Office</a> responsible for "<a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a>" (SS) recruiting during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. Following the war, he was convicted as a <a href="war%20criminal">war criminal</a>, spending a total of six-and-a-half years in prison. Serving in the <a href="German%20Army%20%28German%20Empire%29">German Army</a> during <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, he was wounded four times and awarded the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> First Class. Immediately after the war, he was a leader of the "<a href="Militia%23Germany">Einwohnerwehr</a>" militia in his native <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">North Württemberg</a>. He joined the Nazi Party in 1922, but lost interest in right-wing politics during the 1920s, training and working as a physical education teacher.

In the late 1920s, he rejoined the Nazi Party and became a member of the paramilitary "<a href="Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a>" (SA) in 1931. He clashed with other leaders of the SA, and joined the "<a href="Allgemeine-SS">Allgemeine-SS</a>" in 1936. Initially responsible for physical education in an SS region, he was soon transferred to the staff of "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> as head of the sports office. In 1938, he was appointed as head of the recruiting office of the SS Main Office (SS-HA), taking over as chief of the SS-HA the following year. To a significant extent, Berger was the "father" of the "<a href="Waffen-SS">Waffen-SS</a>", as he not only implemented recruiting structures and policies that assisted the "Waffen-SS" to circumvent <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> controls over conscription, but also extended "Waffen-SS" recruiting first to "Germanic" volunteers from <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a> and western Europe, then "<a href="Volksdeutsche">Volksdeutsche</a>" (ethnic Germans) outside the Reich, and finally to peoples who in no way reflected Himmler's ideas of "racial purity". He consistently advocated greater ideological training for the "Waffen-SS", but did not view SS ideology as a replacement for religion. He also sponsored and protected his friend <a href="Oskar%20Dirlewanger">Oskar Dirlewanger</a>, whom he placed in command of a unit of convicted criminals; the SS-"<a href="Sonderkommando%20Dirlewanger">Sonderkommando Dirlewanger</a>" subsequently committed many war crimes. Berger often clashed with senior officers of the Wehrmacht and even with senior "Waffen-SS" officers over his recruiting methods, but he took advantage of opportunities as they presented themselves in order to grow the "Waffen-SS" to a total of 38 <a href="division%20%28military%29">divisions</a> by war's end.

Berger undertook several other roles in the latter stages of the war, while continuing as chief of the SS-HA. He had a key role in the <a href="Reich%20Ministry%20for%20the%20Occupied%20Eastern%20Territories">Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories</a> from mid-1942, allowing the SS to direct much of the economic activity in the east. In this role he proposed a plan to kidnap and enslave 50,000 Eastern European children between the ages of 10 and 14, under the codename "<a href="Heuaktion">Heuaktion</a>", a plan that was subsequently carried out. In response to the <a href="Slovak%20National%20Uprising">Slovak National Uprising</a> in August 1944, Berger was appointed as Military Commander in <a href="Slovak%20Republic%20%281939%E2%80%9345%29">Slovakia</a>, and was in charge during the initial failure to suppress the revolt. The following month he was appointed as one of the two chiefs of staff of the "<a href="Volkssturm">Volkssturm</a>" militia, and as chief of the <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoner of war</a> camps. In the final months of the war he commanded German forces in the <a href="Bavarian%20Alps">Bavarian Alps</a>, which included remnants of several of the "Waffen-SS" units he had helped recruit. He surrendered to U.S. troops near <a href="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a>, and was promptly arrested. He was tried and convicted in the <a href="Ministries%20Trial">Ministries Trial</a> of the U.S. <a href="Subsequent%20Nuremberg%20trials">Nuremberg Military Tribunals</a> for <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>s, and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment. His sentence was soon reduced to 10 years, and he was released after serving six-and-a-half years. After release he advocated for the rehabilitation of the "Waffen-SS" and worked in several manufacturing businesses. He died in his hometown in 1975.

Described as blustery, cynical, and "one of Himmler's most competent and trusted war-time lieutenants", Berger was also an ardent <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semite</a> and a skilled and unscrupulous bureaucratic manipulator. Due to his organisational and recruiting skills, Berger was kept as the chief of the SS-HA throughout the war.

Berger was born on 16 July 1896 at <a href="Gerstetten">Gerstetten</a> in the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20W%C3%BCrttemberg">Kingdom of Württemberg</a>, the son of saw-mill owners Johannes and Christine (), and was one of eight children. He attended "<a href="Volksschule">Volksschule</a>" (elementary school) and "<a href="Realschule">Realschule</a>" (junior high school) and then teacher training in <a href="N%C3%BCrtingen">Nürtingen</a>. He volunteered for military service at the beginning of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and rose to the rank of "<a href="Leutnant">Leutnant</a>" in the infantry by the time of his discharge in 1919. Wounded four times, he was awarded the <a href="Iron%20Cross">Iron Cross</a> First Class, and was considered 70 per cent disabled at the time of his discharge. During the war, all three of his brothers died, two killed in action and the other executed as a spy in the United States. Berger's combative temperament and very conservative politics fitted him for a leadership role with the North Württemberg "<a href="Militia%23Germany">Einwohnerwehr</a>" militia in 1918–19. He married Maria () in 1921. After joining the <a href="Nazi%20Party">Nazi Party</a> in 1922, he was arrested and briefly held in custody after <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>'s <a href="Munich">Munich</a> <a href="Beer%20Hall%20Putsch">Beer Hall Putsch</a> in November 1923. He trained and worked as a physical education teacher, despite his injuries, and lost interest in politics for some years, before rejoining the Nazi Party in 1929, and the paramilitary "<a href="Sturmabteilung">Sturmabteilung</a>" (SA) in January 1931.

Berger's SA career was limited by his soldierly ideas of politics and leadership, but after the <a href="Nazi%20Seizure%20of%20Power">Nazi seizure of power</a> in January 1933, he was found to be very suitable to lead "<a href="Protective%20custody%23Nazi%20Germany">Schutzhaft</a>" operations, which involved the rounding up of <a href="Jews">Jews</a> and "political undesirables". In April 1933, his clashes with younger leaders meant his SA career had met a dead-end. His SA peers criticised Berger's ambitious nature, outspokenness and lack of self-reflection. Beginning in July 1934, Berger worked with the SA training chief " SA-Obergruppenführer" <a href="Friedrich-Wilhelm%20Kr%C3%BCger">Friedrich-Wilhelm Krüger</a>. Between 1933 and 1935, he was a school inspector in <a href="Esslingen%20am%20Neckar">Esslingen am Neckar</a> near <a href="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, and in 1935 was a senior official in the <a href="Administrative%20divisions%20of%20Nazi%20Germany">Gau Württemberg – Hohenzollern</a> Ministry of Culture. He was recruited into the "<a href="Allgemeine-SS">Allgemeine-SS</a>" by "<a href="Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">Reichsführer-SS</a>" <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> in 1936, on Krüger's recommendation. Initially appointed to oversee sports and physical training for "<a href="Units%20and%20commands%20of%20the%20Schutzstaffel%23Allgemeine-SS%20commands">SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest</a>" (SS Regional Headquarters Southwest), he then moved to Himmler's <a href="Pers%C3%B6nlicher%20Stab%20Reichsf%C3%BChrer-SS">personal staff</a> as head of the sports office.

Berger interceded on behalf of his World War I comrade <a href="Oskar%20Dirlewanger">Oskar Dirlewanger</a>, who had been imprisoned for two years in 1935 for offences against a minor. On his release from prison, Berger used his influence to ensure Dirlewanger could join the <a href="Condor%20Legion">Condor Legion</a> and fight in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>.

On 1 July 1938, Himmler appointed Berger as chief of the recruiting department of the "<a href="SS-Hauptamt">SS-Hauptamt</a>" (SS Main Office, or SS-HA), which he quickly developed into a powerful tool for Himmler's ambitions. According to Berger, the German Army was initially dismissive of the idea of SS combat troops. He quoted the <a href="Oberkommando%20des%20Heeres">Commander-in-Chief of the Army</a>, "<a href="Generaloberst">Generaloberst</a>" <a href="Werner%20von%20Fritsch">Werner von Fritsch</a> as saying, "If the Reich Transport Minister has his militarily-trained Railway Police, why shouldn't Himmler also play at soldiers?"

Berger later claimed that he had come up with the idea of SS combat troops wearing camouflage jackets from his own hunting days, and had suggested it to "SS-Obergruppenführer" <a href="Sepp%20Dietrich">Sepp Dietrich</a>, commander of the <a href="1st%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Leibstandarte%20SS%20Adolf%20Hitler">Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler Regiment</a> (LSSAH). From 1938, various forms of "<a href="Flecktarn">Flecktarn</a>" camouflage were issued. The author <a href="Adrian%20Weale">Adrian Weale</a> doubts Berger's account.

Berger had achieved the rank of "<a href="Major">Major der Reserve</a>" in the <a href="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a> by 1938, but his initial rank upon joining the "Allgemeine-SS" was "SS-<a href="Standartenf%C3%BChrer">Standartenführer</a>", based upon his SA service. Berger played a key role in directing the <a href="fifth%20column">fifth column</a> "<a href="Sudetendeutsches%20Freikorps">Sudetendeutsches Freikorps</a>" during the <a href="Sudetenland%23Sudeten%20Crisis">Sudeten Crisis</a> in <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a> in 1938, and the organisational skills he displayed there marked him as highly suitable for the SS recruiting role.

Prior to the outbreak of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, the SS-HA had been responsible for organising an erstwhile "civilian" political organisation, the "Allgemeine-SS". After the war began, it was clear that those departments of the SS-HA looking after the "<a href="SS-Verf%C3%BCgungstruppe">SS-Verfügungstruppe</a>" (SS dispositional troops or SS-VT) had performed poorly. During the <a href="invasion%20of%20Poland">invasion of Poland</a>, deficiencies in organisation, equipment and training had become obvious. The SS-HA, and specifically its chief, "SS-<a href="Obergruppenf%C3%BChrer">Obergruppenführer</a>" <a href="August%20Heissmeyer">August Heissmeyer</a>, were held responsible, and Heissmeyer soon made way for Berger. As head of recruiting, Berger had already unified the recruiting system for the three main SS organisations, the "Allgemeine-SS", SS-VT and police, and in August 1938 he negotiated a recruiting agreement between Himmler and the "<a href="Reichsjugendf%C3%BChrer">Reichsjugendführer</a>" (Reich Youth Leader) <a href="Baldur%20von%20Schirach">Baldur von Schirach</a> which created a strong recruiting pathway for the young men of the <a href="Hitler%20Youth">Hitler Youth</a> into the SS.

Following the Polish campaign, Hitler approved the expansion of the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up to the strength of a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned <a href="Battle%20of%20France">invasion of France and the Low Countries</a>, Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel. To do this, he circumvented the recruiting primacy of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler's control, the "<a href="SS-Totenkopfverb%C3%A4nde">SS-Totenkopfverbände</a>" (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the "<a href="Ordnungspolizei">Ordnungspolizei</a>" (Order Police or Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the "<a href="2nd%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Das%20Reich">SS-Verfügungs-Division</a>" (later given the name "Reich" and then "Das Reich") commanded by the Inspector of the SS-VT, "SS-Gruppenführer" <a href="Paul%20Hausser">Paul Hausser</a>; the "<a href="3rd%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Totenkopf">SS-Division-Totenkopf</a>" commanded by the Inspector of Concentration Camps, "SS-Gruppenführer" <a href="Theodor%20Eicke">Theodor Eicke</a>; and the "<a href="4th%20SS%20Polizei%20Panzergrenadier%20Division">Polizei-Division</a>", commanded by "SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei" <a href="Karl%20Pfeffer-Wildenbruch">Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch</a>. This rapid transformation was theoretical to a significant extent, as Eicke and the SS-TV continued to resist exchanges of personnel with the SS-VT.

The fact that Berger was able to expand the SS combat troops so quickly was a tribute to his improvisational skills. On 1 December 1939, Himmler promoted Berger to chief of the SS-HA. To a significant extent, Berger was the "father" of the <a href="Waffen-SS">"Waffen"-SS</a> (or Armed SS), a term he coined in an agreement dated 2 March 1940. He used the new term to smooth over friction between the SS-VT and SS-TV, as they were combined in new formations. Berger's new-found authority for SS recruiting matters irritated the chiefs of the "Allgemeine-SS" districts, who had previously been responsible for this function. This came to a head when the chief of "SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest", "SS-Gruppenführer" <a href="Kurt%20Kaul">Kurt Kaul</a> refused to recognise Berger's delegate in his district, referring to Berger as a "low-ranking empire builder". Kaul's series of letters to Berlin came to nothing, as the power and influence of the "Allgemeine-SS" had waned with the outbreak of war and the conscription of many of its members into the Wehrmacht, "Waffen-SS" and police. Ultimately, when Kaul threatened to arrest Berger's delegate in "SS-Oberabschnitt Südwest", Himmler intervened personally in February 1940, stating that "the most unpleasant consequences" would befall Kaul if he did not throw his support behind Berger and his recruiting organisation. Kaul acquiesced, and Berger's supremacy as SS recruiting supremo was firmly established.

Despite this success, Berger still had to negotiate with the Wehrmacht, which opposed his attempts to expand the "Waffen-SS" at almost every turn. In early 1940, Himmler and Berger were outmaneuvered by "Generaloberst" <a href="Wilhelm%20Keitel">Wilhelm Keitel</a>, Chief of "<a href="Oberkommando%20der%20Wehrmacht">Oberkommando der Wehrmacht</a>" (Wehrmacht High Command or OKW) on a number of issues around "Waffen-SS" recruiting, reflecting the strong influence the Wehrmacht still had with Hitler. On 20 April 1940, Berger was promoted to "SS-<a href="Brigadef%C3%BChrer">Brigadeführer</a>". According to Berger, Himmler never intended that the "Waffen-SS" would supplant the Army, and after the war he intended that it would be reduced to seven active and five reserve divisions. Berger created a recruiting structure throughout the Reich, mirroring that of the Army, but while the Wehrmacht, which controlled the draft, was willing to allow Berger enough recruits to maintain the three divisions and the LSSAH, it did not want to see any further expansion. To get around this, Berger had to look outside the Reich.

By this time, the "Waffen-SS" numbered just under 125,000, of whom more than 40,000 originated from <a href="Austria%20in%20the%20time%20of%20National%20Socialism">post-Anschluss Austria</a> and other areas outside the pre-1933 borders of Germany. In April 1940, the Germans had <a href="Operation%20Weser%C3%BCbung">invaded</a> and occupied Denmark and Norway, opening up a source of "Nordic" or "Germanic" recruits, which Berger was quick to exploit. After the invasion of France and the Low Countries, the resulting regiment, "SS-Nordland", was joined by a Dutch-Belgian-Flemish regiment, "SS-Westland". At the same time as they were recruiting for these "Germanic" regiments, Berger's delegates were also focusing on gaining ethnic German volunteers from outside the Reich, men not subject to the Wehrmacht-controlled draft. In May, more than 1,000 <a href="Germans%20of%20Romania">Romanian "Volksdeutsche"</a> had been recruited, with the help of Andreas Schmidt, Berger's son-in-law and the political leader of the Romanian "Volksdeutsche". Three weeks after the invasion of Belgium, Berger was appointed as the president of the German-sponsored pro-Nazi Belgian political party, "<a href="Devlag">DeVlag</a>". Berger also worked to bring the <a href="Germans%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche"</a> under the influence of the SS, which he was able to achieve six months prior to the invasion of that country by the Axis in April 1941. Berger's recruiting work with the Flemish and Croatian communities was facilitated by his chairmanship of both the "Deutsche-Flämischen Studiengruppe" (German-Flemish Studies Group) and the "Deutsche-Kroatischen Gesellschaft" (German-Croatian Society).

By the end of May 1940, Berger had filled the authorised quota of new recruits, but his recruiters kept signing up young men to create a reserve that could replace the many older "Allgemeine-SS" reservists in the three field divisions. To supplement this pool, Berger also continued recruiting for the SS-TV and police regiments, which were not under Wehrmacht control, and were still below the strengths approved by Hitler. This continued to create friction between the Wehrmacht and SS, as potential Wehrmacht recruits were siphoned off to forces under Himmler's control. By a range of methods, Berger diverted manpower from the younger age groups, and also targeted areas outside the Reich that were not subject to Wehrmacht recruiting controls.

Berger's evasion of Wehrmacht-imposed recruiting restrictions came to a head in June, when the Chief of the OKW Operations Staff, "<a href="Generalmajor">Generalmajor</a>" <a href="Alfred%20Jodl">Alfred Jodl</a> initiated an investigation of SS recruiting operations within the Reich. The result was that around 15,000 SS inductions were held up by various Wehrmacht military district headquarters. Berger became aware of Jodl's inquiry and advised Himmler that even their inquiries had underestimated his success, giving the example that the Wehrmacht believed he had exceeded the June quota for "SS-Division-Totenkopf" by 900 men, when in fact the true figure was 1,164. He boasted to Himmler that during the whole recruiting campaign, he had signed up 15,000 men for "SS-Division-Totenkopf", when Hitler had only authorised the recruiting of 4,000 for the division in the same period. To justify his actions, Berger pointed to the fact that, just before the French surrender, Hitler had ordered the release of over-age SS reservists. In the "SS-Division-Totenkopf", this meant 13,246 of the 20,000-strong formation.

Berger had been remarkably successful, despite the obstacles placed in his path by the Wehrmacht, having recruited nearly 60,000 men for the "Waffen-SS" between mid-January and the end of June. These fresh troops were more than sufficient to replace those released when Himmler demobilised several categories of SS reservists in late July. But Himmler knew that the future of the "Waffen-SS" was assured; Hitler was already considering invading the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>.

In August 1940, Berger reorganised the SS-HA to focus better on its main role of recruiting for the "Waffen-SS", creating separate sections to deal with recruiting inside and outside the Reich. The section targeting recruits from outside of the Reich developed out of a briefing he received from the Chief of the "<a href="SS%20F%C3%BChrungshauptamt">SS-Führungshauptamt</a>" (SS Command Main Office, or SS-FHA) "SS-Brigadeführer" <a href="Hans%20J%C3%BCttner">Hans Jüttner</a> on Hitler's expectations of the "Waffen-SS" for the upcoming <a href="Operation%20Barbarossa">invasion of the Soviet Union</a>, which included the raising of a fourth division and the expansion of the LSSAH to a motorised brigade. Berger realised that the Wehrmacht quotas for the "Waffen-SS" would fall short of its manpower needs by at least 6,000 per year.

Berger's SS-HA had a problematic relationship with the SS-FHA, which was responsible for organising, training and equipping the "Waffen-SS". The SS-FHA wanted the "Waffen-SS" to be a small elite corps, but Berger and Himmler knew that Hitler needed as many divisions as possible, even if that meant some "Waffen-SS" formations would be of lesser quality. Jüttner's initial efforts at integrating the recruits from western Europe and Scandinavia were inadequate, with insufficient emphasis on training and appointing officers and non-commissioned officers from the ranks of the new recruits. The SS-FHA had also paid scant attention to retention of ranks for former members of national armed forces, liaison with home territories, and even mail. Berger's well-researched report to Himmler on these failures was damning, and the "Reichsführer-SS" soon issued detailed instructions on the handling of these new recruits, from the moment they joined the "Waffen-SS". Berger's criticisms of Jüttner must be seen in the light of the advantages Berger considered he would achieve if Jüttner's position with Himmler was weakened. 

One of the obvious sources for "Waffen-SS" manpower was the nearly 40,000 troops of the SS-TV regiments, which consisted of youths below conscription age for the Wehrmacht, as well as older "Allgemeine-SS" reservists. These regiments were under Himmler's control, and were deployed across German-occupied Europe as political police, but the security functions they carried out were clearly within the capabilities of the Orpo. In late 1940, in order to ensure that Himmler's instructions were carried out, Berger established a special camp at <a href="Cernay%2C%20Haut-Rhin">Sennheim</a> in occupied <a href="Alsace">Alsace</a>, where non-Reich German recruits could be brought up to physical standards and ideologically indoctrinated prior to "Waffen-SS" training. This was an attempt to address the concerns of some commanders about the quality of these recruits, and their ability to be integrated into units composed mostly of Reich Germans. Recruits sent to this camp included "<a href="Volksdeutsche">Volksdeutsche</a>" (ethnic Germans from outside the Reich), <a href="Danes">Danes</a>, <a href="Norwegians">Norwegians</a>, <a href="Dutch%20people">Dutch</a> and <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemings</a>. Berger also created a network of offices throughout German-occupied Europe to ensure the welfare of the families of such recruits, influence the local communities to support "Waffen-SS" recruiting, and prepare potential recruits for indoctrination. This network and its activities was strongly resisted by the <a href="Hauptamt%20Volksdeutsche%20Mittelstelle">Main Welfare Office for Ethnic Germans</a> ( or VoMi) the Nazi Party arm responsible for guiding the ethnic German communities outside the Reich. Himmler, unhappy with the work of VoMi in supporting SS recruiting, did not abolish VoMi, he just authorised Berger to circumvent it.

By the end of 1940, "SS-Nordland" and "SS-Westland" had become the basis for the formation of the fourth division, "SS-Division Wiking". Casting about for another source of recruits, Berger struck upon the idea of enlisting convicted criminals, who were concentrated in the "<a href="36th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS">Sonderkommando Dirlewanger</a>", commanded by Berger's friend, Dirlewanger. Dirlewanger had returned from Spain and been reinstated as a "SS-Standartenfuhrer der Reserve" in the "Allgemeine-SS" at Berger's instigation. In September 1940, Dirlewanger's unit had been deployed to the area of <a href="General%20Government">occupied Poland</a>, where they established defensive positions and provided guards for a Jewish labour camp.

In March 1941, Berger founded the <a href="Germanische%20Leitstelle">German Guidance Office</a> which was responsible for the recruitment of "Germanic" men for the "Waffen-SS". The German Guidance Office encompassed the camp at Sennheim, as well as the network of recruiting offices already established throughout occupied Europe, and became a separate department of the SS-HA, with separate sections for leadership, recruiting and education, and six regional sub-sections.

After the <a href="Balkan%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Balkan Campaign</a> of April 1941, the LSSAH was expanded to divisional strength, and following the commencement of the invasion of the Soviet Union, a sixth "Waffen-SS" division, <a href="6th%20SS%20Mountain%20Division%20Nord">"SS-Division Nord"</a> was formed from four of the former "SS-Totenkopf" regiments, all of which had been re-designated "SS Infantry" regiments. These new divisions had an initial strength only two-thirds of that of the original divisions. The "Polizei-Division" was also renamed the "SS-Polizei-Division". The expectations on Berger's recruiting network continued to increase, just as casualties began to mount in earnest.

In early April 1941, Hitler had agreed to the creation of the "SS-Freiwilligenstandarte Nordwest" (SS Volunteer Regiment Northwest), with an authorised strength of 2,500 men recruited from Flanders and the Netherlands. This formation capitalised on the push for an autonomous <a href="Greater%20Netherlands">Flemish-Dutch region</a> within the Reich. Significant proponents of such a union were <a href="Anton%20Mussert">Anton Mussert</a> of the <a href="National%20Socialist%20Movement%20in%20the%20Netherlands">National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands</a> and <a href="Staf%20De%20Clercq">Staf De Clercq</a> of the <a href="Vlaams%20Nationaal%20Verbond">Flemish National League</a>. In this, Berger was exploiting Mussert and De Clerq, because he was actually working towards Hitler's idea of incorporating Flanders and Wallonia into the Reich as two "Gaue", not a unified autonomous entity.

At the end of April, Himmler ordered Berger to obtain 20,000 new recruits for the "Waffen-SS" by the end of May. With Hitler's authorisation, the recruitment quotas were lifted by the Wehrmacht, allowing Berger an essentially free hand for a limited time. He did not disappoint, misleading the new recruits as to the length of their service obligation, and signing up 22,361 new troops by 29 May, many of whom were only 18 years old. To meet Himmler's target, Berger had also called up eligible members of the "Allgemeine-SS" and intensified efforts to recruit western Europeans. The latter initiative proved disappointing, with only 2,000 of the total coming from that source. A total of 400 Finnish combat veterans also volunteered to join the "Waffen-SS" in this period, and they were sent to join the "SS-Division-Wiking".

In June 1941, just after the commencement of Operation Barbarossa, Hitler decreed that the "Waffen-SS" could recruit foreigners for service on the <a href="Eastern%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Eastern Front</a>. He wanted a legion to be raised from each of the occupied countries of Western Europe, but Himmler was only interested in recruiting "Germanic" people into the "Waffen-SS". Himmler decided that there were large numbers of potential pro-German but nationalistic recruits available from the "Germanic" races in occupied countries, and directed Berger to explore this manpower source. As a result of Himmler's decision, the Wehrmacht was permitted to recruit Frenchmen, Spaniards and Croats, while Dutch, Flemish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish men were Berger's domain. The "national legions" each numbered 1,000, except the Netherlands Legion, which had a maximum strength of 2,000. In November 1941, the Netherlands Legion and Flemish Legion had completed light infantry training and were sent to join the <a href="2nd%20SS%20Infantry%20Brigade">2nd SS Infantry Brigade</a> on the <a href="Leningrad%20Front">Leningrad Front</a>. While they swore a personal oath to Hitler and were subject to SS rules and regulations, they were not members of the SS, and wore national symbols in place of the <a href="Runic%20insignia%20of%20the%20Schutzstaffel">sig rune</a>s. Berger even went so far as to recommend to Himmler that Flemings no longer be treated as foreigners, but be given full citizenship rights as Germans.

The idea of having "national legions" was poorly managed, with some recruits being tricked into enlisting, and many of the new recruits being badly treated by their German instructors. Once news of this reached their home territories, the limited flow of pro-German volunteers dried up. Once recruited, the SS-FHA failed to carry through the commitments made to the men of the "national legions" when they enlisted, and combined with mistreatment and abuse from their German <a href="en%20cadre">cadre</a> staff and instructors, this had a negative impact on morale and the willingness of more men to volunteer. This was something from which the "national legions" never fully recovered, despite Himmler's intervention at Berger's behest. However, due to the expansion of SS recruiting rights in areas outside the Reich and the failure of the Wehrmacht to capitalise on recruiting opportunities afforded them, several of the "national legions" recruited by the Wehrmacht were eventually transferred to the "Waffen-SS".

Encouraged by the success he had achieved in Romania in 1940 with the help of his son-in-law, Berger had proposed to Himmler that the next recruiting sphere be the "Volksdeutsche" communities of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Romania">Romania</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hungary">Hungary</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a>, which together contained about 1.5 million ethnic Germans. Little could be done to further this proposal until mid-1941, by which time <a href="invasion%20of%20Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia had been overrun</a> by the <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis</a>, and Romania and Hungary had joined the pact. Immediately after the lightning-quick defeat of Yugoslavia in April 1941, Hausser was being pressed to accept Yugoslav "Volksdeutsche" into his renamed "SS-Division-Reich", even before it was withdrawn to prepare for Operation Barbarossa. On his way back to Germany from Yugoslavia, Hausser had transited through Romania and gathered another 600 ethnic German volunteers who he smuggled out of the country.

Not content with this fairly minor and surreptitious recruiting effort, Berger proposed to raise a seventh "Waffen-SS" division from the ethnic Germans of Yugoslavia. By the end of 1941, faced with the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Partisan</a>-led uprising in Yugoslavia, Hitler authorised the raising of the "<a href="7th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Mountain%20Division%20Prinz%20Eugen">SS-Freiwilligen-Division Prinz Eugen</a>". It was to be the first of the many "foreign" divisions that would dramatically change the composition of the "Waffen-SS" during the remainder of the war. The division was formed around an existing SS-controlled "Selbstschutz" (militia) drawn from ethnic Germans in the <a href="Banat%20%281941%E2%80%9344%29">Banat</a>, but Berger had misread the willingness of the local ethnic German population to volunteer for service outside their homeland. His recruiters initially struggled to attract volunteers, so coercion was applied, and ultimately, the Banat was declared to be under German sovereignty, and Himmler approved conscription on the basis of an archaic law, the "Tiroler Landsturmordnung" (<a href="County%20of%20Tyrol">Tyrolean</a> General Levy Act) of 1872.

On 29 January 1942, Himmler issued an order which re-titled Dirlewanger's unit as "SS-Sonderkommando Dirlewanger", and formally incorporated it into the "Waffen-SS". Later that year, when an SS judge issued an arrest warrant for Dirlewanger in response to his unit's anti-partisan operations, the SS-HA chief intervened with Himmler saying, "Better to shoot two Poles too many than one too few. A savage country cannot be governed in a decent manner."

Within a few weeks of the invasion of the Soviet Union, Berger's teams had begun recruiting Baltic volunteers for SS police units, forming several security battalions of Latvian and Estonian volunteers. The Wehrmacht also recruited eight Estonian battalions. This split approach to recruiting in the Baltic region continued into 1942, with some units being decimated in front line fighting. In May of that year, Berger decided to exploit the nationalists within the Baltic states in order to gain access to recruits for the "Waffen-SS". Himmler was lukewarm on his initial proposal, but as casualties started to mount in 1942, he changed his mind, and approved the formation of a "Waffen-SS" <a href="Estonian%20Legion">Estonian Legion</a>. Despite initial misgivings, Berger also proposed the formation of a <a href="Latvian%20Legion">Latvian Legion</a>, which was approved at the end of 1942.

In the meantime, the "Waffen-SS" had suffered over 43,000 casualties up to February 1942, particularly in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moscow">Battle of Moscow</a>, and Berger had to replace them. Berger next turned his attention to the Hungarian "Volksdeutsche". Through an agreement with the <a href="Royal%20Hungarian%20Army">Royal Hungarian Army</a>, his recruiters enlisted more than 16,500 ethnic German recruits from Hungary between March and May 1942. While this campaign was ongoing, on 20 April 1942 Berger was promoted to "SS-<a href="Gruppenf%C3%BChrer">Gruppenführer</a>". At this point, he saw a significant difference between SS ideological leadership and the martial indoctrination conducted by the German Army. In September 1942, the SS-FHA complained bitterly about Berger's recruiters, stating that many of the recruits were medically unsuitable, had been coerced or duped into enlisting, or were in fact ethnic Hungarians. Late in 1942, more "Volksdeutsche" from the Banat and Romania were combined with the <a href="SS%20Cavalry%20Brigade">SS Cavalry Brigade</a> to form the <a href="8th%20SS%20Cavalry%20Division%20Florian%20Geyer">"SS-Kavallerie-Division"</a>. On 24 November 1942, the Chief of the <a href="Gestapo">Gestapo</a>, <a href="Heinrich%20M%C3%BCller%20%28Gestapo%29">Heinrich Müller</a> advised Himmler of a proposal he had received from Berger that a Hungarian SS division could be financed by selling emigration permits to <a href="History%20of%20the%20Jews%20in%20Slovakia">Slovak Jews</a>.

The "national legions" were attached to the "Waffen-SS", and fought on the Eastern Front in 1942 and early 1943. Unable to replace their losses, most of the survivors were incorporated into <a href="11th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20Nordland">"SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland"</a>, authorised by Hitler at the end of 1942. The three regiments of the new division were formed using survivors of the <a href="Free%20Corps%20Denmark">"Freikorps Danemark"</a>, Legion "Niederlande" and <a href="Norwegian%20Legion">Legion "Norwegen"</a>, supplemented by transfers from "SS-Division Wiking", new recruits from the occupied West European countries, and Reich Germans. Legion "Flandern" was broken up and used as replacements in a number of "Waffen-SS" formations. While Weale states that they were mainly motivated by anti-communism, the historian George C. Stein observes that few of the "national legion" recruits were motivated by "political or ideological idealism", but were instead motivated by such factors as a desire for adventure, better food, the prestige of the uniform, and personal circumstances. According to Stein, Berger had no illusions about the motives of his West European recruits, but paid mere lip service to the idea that they joined the "anti-communist" cause out of idealism. Around 25,000 Dutch, 5,000 Danish and 3,900 Norwegian men served in the "Waffen-SS". However, by mid-1942 onwards, the "Waffen-SS" faced increasing difficulties with these "Germanic" recruits, especially due to the policy of integrating them into "pan-Germanic" formations such as "SS-Division Wiking". For example, Norwegian recruits began requesting their release from duty, and at the beginning of 1943, nearly the entire Finnish battalion of that division asked to be released from their service obligations.

In November 1942, orders were issued for the conversion of LSSAH, "Das Reich" and "Totenkopf" into <a href="panzergrenadier">panzergrenadier</a> divisions, and the following month, Hitler ordered the formation of two more panzergrenadier divisions, the first new "Waffen-SS" divisions to be raised from Reich Germans since 1940. These were named <a href="9th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hohenstaufen">"Hohenstaufen"</a> and <a href="10th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Frundsberg">"Frundsberg"</a>.

From the time that he had taken over as chief of the SS-HA, Berger had made considerable efforts to increase the amount of ideological training received by "Waffen-SS" personnel. In February 1943, in the wake of the German losses at <a href="Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a>, Berger again told Himmler that the SS needed stronger ideological training. As a result, the SS-HA issued a series of pamphlets on racial ideology, including "Der Untermensch" (The Sub-Human), which described certain peoples as spiritually and mentally lower than animals. Himmler and Berger also hosted representatives from the Wehrmacht who were keen to learn from SS expertise in ideological indoctrination. On 13 February, following an approach from "Reichsjugendführer" (German Youth Leader) <a href="Artur%20Axmann">Artur Axmann</a> for a "Waffen-SS" division to be raised from the Hitler Youth, Berger and Axmann were told the idea had been approved by Hitler and that they could commence planning. Berger implored Himmler to appoint him as the commander of this new division, but the "Reichsfuhrer" demurred, telling Berger not to be impatient. Also in February, Berger complained to Himmler that the dispersal of "Germanic" volunteers throughout the "Waffen-SS" was having significant negative effects on the recruiting of replacements in the occupied countries. In March 1943, "Wiking" was also upgraded to a panzergrenadier division.

In April, losses at <a href="Battle%20of%20Stalingrad">Stalingrad</a> and in <a href="Tunisia%20Campaign">Tunisia</a> allowed Berger to recruit from foreign workers in the Reich, over the objections of "Reichsminister" <a href="Albert%20Speer">Albert Speer</a>, the Minister for Armaments and War Production. By August, he had recruited 8,105 of these labourers, and 3,154 had already completed selection for the "Waffen-SS". In June, Berger was promoted to "SS-Obergruppenführer und General der Waffen-SS", and later the same month the new division, <a href="12th%20SS%20Panzer%20Division%20Hitlerjugend">12th SS Panzergrenadier Division "Hitlerjugend"</a> was officially activated.

On 5 July 1943, Berger was awarded the <a href="German%20Cross">German Cross</a> in silver. By the end of 1942, the "Germanic" SS had been integrated into the wider "Allgemeine-SS", and Berger drew up a badge to reward sporting prowess, skills highly prized among SS members. The result was the <a href="Germanic%20Proficiency%20Runes">Germanic Proficiency Runes</a>, which Himmler approved on 1 August 1943, although it is believed less than 200 were actually awarded.

In November 1943, when German-installed Latvian authorities threatened to resign over conscription, Berger suggested they be sent to a concentration camp. By the end of 1943, the former "national legions" had been significantly expanded. The Dutch regiment of "SS-Panzergrenadierdivision Nordland" was used to form an independent <a href="23rd%20SS%20Volunteer%20Panzer%20Grenadier%20Division%20Nederland">"SS-Panzergrenadierbrigade Nederland"</a>, and a revamped Flemish contingent was assembled into the <a href="27th%20SS%20Volunteer%20Division%20Langemarck">"SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Langemarck"</a>. The Wehrmacht also gave up its French volunteer regiment and the Wallonian Legion, which became the <a href="33rd%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Charlemagne%20%281st%20French%29">"SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade France"</a> and <a href="Walloon%20Legion">"SS-Freiwilligen-Sturmbrigade Wallonien"</a>. By the end of the war, all of these formations had been given divisional status in the "Waffen-SS", despite the fact that they never grew to more than brigade strength. In relation to these recruits, Berger cynically observed, "For every foreign-born soldier who dies, no German mother weeps". By August 1943, the crisis in the "Germanic" project was obvious, with Berger observing that "we have come to the end of our tether in the Germanic countries". 

The complaints from the SS-FHA about the quality of "Volksdeutsche" recruits had no effect on Berger's approach. He concluded further agreements with Hungary and Romania, and imposed on the <a href="Puppet%20state">puppet regimes</a> of the <a href="Independent%20State%20of%20Croatia">Independent State of Croatia</a> and the <a href="Slovak%20Republic%20%281939%E2%80%931945%29">Slovak State</a>, to effectively authorise the unrestricted conscription of ethnic Germans in those territories. In the <a href="Territory%20of%20the%20Military%20Commander%20in%20Serbia">German-occupied territory of Serbia</a>, the General Government (annexed Poland) and parts of the Soviet Union, ethnic Germans were conscripted into the "Waffen-SS" in the same arbitrary manner Reich Germans were conscripted by the Wehrmacht. By the end of 1943, a quarter of the strength of the "Waffen-SS" was made up of "Volksdeutsche".

Before either Baltic legion could complete training, these developments were overtaken by heavy casualties suffered by the West European legions on the Eastern Front, and like the West European legions, it was decided to combine the Baltic legions into larger formations. This resulted in the "Estnische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade", consisting of the Estonian Legion and elements of the 1st SS Infantry Brigade, and the "Lettische SS-Freiwilligen Brigade", formed around the Latvian Legion and parts of the 2nd SS Infantry Brigade. The origins of many of the men of the two SS infantry brigades was Reich German or "Volksdeutsche", so these two formations were never purely Baltic. Not long after the two new volunteer brigades had been formed and committed to battle, they were upgraded to divisional status, and a third Baltic division was authorised, using the manpower of the Latvian security battalions. To man and maintain these three new divisions, Himmler ordered the conscription of Estonian and Latvian men, and made all former Estonian Army officers and non-commissioned officers liable for service. By 1944, the "Waffen-SS" included the three divisions, namely; the <a href="15th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20%281st%20Latvian%29">15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Latvian)</a>, the <a href="19th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20%282nd%20Latvian%29">19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian)</a>, and the <a href="20th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20%281st%20Estonian%29">20th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Estonian)</a>. The two Latvian divisions were later combined into the <a href="VI%20SS%20Army%20Corps%20%28Latvian%29">VI SS Army Corps (Latvian)</a>, and all three divisions fought the Soviet <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> in defence of their homelands during 1944, and were encircled there or destroyed in subsequent fighting elsewhere.

By February 1943, Himmler's ideals of "Waffen-SS" racial purity had been significantly diluted. The first division to be raised by Berger's recruiters that was clearly outside the "Waffen-SS" racial and ethnic strictures used manpower from the <a href="Bosniaks">Muslim</a> community of <a href="Bosnia%20%28region%29">Bosnia</a>. The <a href="13th%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Handschar%20%281st%20Croatian%29">13th "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Handschar" (1st Croatian)</a> first went into action in February 1944, and was of limited value, especially outside of its area of operations in eastern Bosnia. While it achieved successes and proved itself competent in counter-insurgency operations against the Partisans in eastern Bosnia, the division earned a reputation for brutality and savagery, not only during combat operations, but also through atrocities committed against Serb and Jewish civilians in the security zone. Its reprisal attacks in northern and eastern Bosnia left many hundreds and possibly as many as several thousand Serb civilians dead by the spring and summer of 1944.

During 1944, two more Muslim divisions were raised, the <a href="21st%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Skanderbeg">21st "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Skanderbeg" (1st Albanian)</a> made up <a href="Kosovo%20Albanians">Kosovar Albanians</a>, and the <a href="23rd%20Waffen%20Mountain%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Kama%20%282nd%20Croatian%29">23rd "Waffen" Mountain Division of the SS "Kama" (2nd Croatian)</a>, also made up of Bosnian Muslims. Neither of these divisions were of significant combat value, and all three Muslim divisions were dissolved before the end of 1944.

At the same time as the Balkan Muslim experiment, divisions were raised from Ukrainian, Russian and Hungarian men, demonstrating that racial exclusivity was no longer an entry requirement for the "Waffen-SS". In April 1943, a recruiting campaign began among Ukrainians living in that part of General Government (Polish) territory that had been in <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Galicia%20and%20Lodomeria">Austrian Galicia</a> prior to 1919. These Ukrainian nationalists had been referred to by Himmler as "sub-human" only a matter of months before. The resulting division was the <a href="14th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20%281st%20Galician%29">14th "Waffen" Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Galician)</a>. After a brief period of desperate fighting in mid-1944 during the Soviet <a href="Lvov%E2%80%93Sandomierz%20Offensive">Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive</a>, only 3,000 escaped encirclement and destruction from an original strength of 14,000. Less than outstanding in combat, the division never saw action again.

In early 1944, the SS directed the governments of Hungary and the Slovak State to transfer to the "Waffen-SS" all the "Volksdeutsche" serving in their armed forces. This amounted to another 50,000 troops. During 1944, Berger gave a speech in which he advocated a "Germanic Reich" that included all the countries that had Germanic or Nordic populations. He said, "Since the "Schutzstaffel" was taken over by the "Reichsführer-SS" in 1929, its long-term goal has been the Germanic Reich. This long-term goal inevitably forms part of the SS claim to be a formation of Nordic men. It cannot be stopped by artificially drawn boundaries". He was also concerned that the SS was losing its previous dominance in ideological matters, as the Wehrmacht had largely adopted the ideological maxims of the SS. This narrowing of the ideological gap between the "Waffen-SS" and the Army was of considerable concern to SS leaders such as Berger, as it undermined the legitimacy of the SS as the leaders of the Nazi project.

The Galician approach was repeated in mid-1944 in the face of mounting casualties from Soviet offensives. Security units manned by Russians and Ukrainians were combined to form two more divisions, the <a href="29th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20RONA%20%281st%20Russian%29">29th "Waffen" Grenadier Division of the SS (1st Russian)</a> and <a href="30th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS">30th "Waffen" Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Russian)</a>. Neither reached more than regimental size. The first division was handed over to the <a href="Russian%20Liberation%20Army">Russian Liberation Army</a> of <a href="Andrey%20Vlasov">Andrey Vlasov</a> before it saw combat, and the second saw action on the Western Front in late 1944 before being reconstituted as a "<a href="White%20Ruthenia">White Ruthenian</a>" brigade in March 1945. It too saw no further action.

In the period from late 1944, more Eastern European formations were hurriedly raised by Berger's recruiters or converted from existing smaller units. These included the <a href="25th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20Hunyadi%20%281st%20Hungarian%29">25th "Waffen" Grenadier Division of the SS "Hunyadi" (1st Hungarian)</a>, <a href="26th%20Waffen%20Grenadier%20Division%20of%20the%20SS%20%282nd%20Hungarian%29">26th "Waffen" Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Hungarian)</a>, <a href="31st%20SS%20Volunteer%20Grenadier%20Division">31st SS Volunteer Grenadier Division</a>, and a number of smaller formations of brigade and regimental size. Several <a href="Cossacks">Cossack</a> units were also transferred from the Wehrmacht. Even the "Sonderkommando Dirlewanger" was increased in size, taking on Russian <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> to boost its numbers.

In July 1942, Berger was appointed as Himmler's liaison officer with the <a href="Reich%20Ministry%20for%20the%20Occupied%20Eastern%20Territories">Reichsminister for the Occupied Eastern Territories</a>, <a href="Alfred%20Rosenberg">Alfred Rosenberg</a>. To bolster his position with Himmler, Rosenberg was even willing to appoint Berger as his second state secretary, but Hitler would not allow it. On 10 August 1943, Berger convinced Rosenberg to appoint him as the Chief of Political Operations in the Occupied Eastern Territories. Himmler had long wanted such responsibilities to be placed in SS hands, and this appointment meant that Berger could sabotage any resistance to SS domination of the economy and population of the subjugated east. The appointment took effect on 10 August 1943, and lasted until January 1945. In this role, Berger proposed a plan to kidnap and enslave 50,000 Eastern European children between the ages of 10 and 14, under the codename "<a href="Heuaktion">Heuaktion</a>". On 14 June 1944, Rosenberg issued orders implementing Berger's idea.

On 20 July 1944, the responsibility for administration of German prisoner of war (POW) camps was transferred to Berger. This followed the <a href="20%20July%20plot">failed attempt on Hitler's life</a> earlier that month, when the "Führer" turned to his "faithful Heinrich" to head the <a href="Replacement%20Army">Replacement Army</a>, and the SS chief quickly delegated the responsibility to Berger. By September, the responsibility had been formally transferred to Himmler, but Berger did not act to integrate his new responsibilities into the SS bureaucracy. Instead, he allowed the camps to continue as they were, with the same staff and procedures.

After the war, Berger claimed that he had been reluctant to take on this new responsibility, and had told Hitler, resulting in a <a href="dressing%20down">dressing down</a>. He also claimed that Hitler had told him to destroy stored <a href="International%20Red%20Cross%20and%20Red%20Crescent%20Movement">Red Cross</a> supplies, stop Red Cross inspections, and block the arrival of further Red Cross supplies to the camps. Further, he asserted that Hitler had wanted more shootings of POWs and harsher punishments. According to Berger, he had quietly avoided carrying out these orders, and even countered a plan by the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" to establish POW centres in major cities, using the POWs as <a href="human%20shield">human shield</a>s against air raids. Authors <a href="John%20Nichol%20%28RAF%20officer%29">John Nichol</a> and Tony Rennell observed that none of these claims have ever been independently verified, but some testimony has refuted Berger's claims. They concluded that most, if not all, of Berger's claims about his actions to assist POWs are "unbelievable", and noted that he did not raise any of these claims during his trial at <a href="Nuremberg">Nuremberg</a> after the war, or even in his autobiography. One of the few claims that has been verified to some extent is his work to protect the "Prominente", a group of high-ranking or otherwise important POWs that had been held at <a href="Oflag%20IV-C">Colditz Castle</a> until 13 April 1945. There were a total of 21 "Prominente", including <a href="George%20Lascelles%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Harewood">Viscount Lascelles</a> and <a href="John%20Elphinstone%2C%2017th%20Lord%20Elphinstone">the Master of Elphinstone</a>, both nephews of <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a>, and <a href="Giles%20Romilly">Giles Romilly</a>, a nephew of the British <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Berger arranged for them to be evacuated from Colditz and transported south and handed over to advancing U.S. Army troops.

On 23 August 1944, an <a href="Slovak%20National%20Uprising">uprising</a> broke out against the German puppet government in the Slovak State. The revolt was centred on <a href="Bansk%C3%A1%20Bystrica">Banská Bystrica</a> high in the <a href="Low%20Tatras">Low Tatra</a> mountains. The rebellion was led by several former members of the Government, and included elements of the Slovak Army and some British-trained parachutists. The uprising was relying on a rapid advance of the Red Army into the Slovak State. Despite the fact that the Soviet armies were just over away at the time the revolt began, they did not reach the rebels in time. On 31 August, Berger was appointed Military Commander in Slovakia, and held sway for the next three weeks. His tasks were to disarm the Slovak Army, ensure lines of communication to the Eastern Front and restore order. He was also to work with the right-wing <a href="Hlinka%20Guard">Hlinka Guard</a> to establish a new armed force in the puppet state. A new Slovak government was established under the leadership of <a href="%C5%A0tefan%20Tiso">Štefan Tiso</a>. Berger's initial force consisted of several <a href="ad%20hoc">ad hoc</a> "<a href="Kampfgruppe">kampfgruppen</a>" (combat groups) totalling 10,000 men, against a rebel army of some 47,000. On 9 September, Himmler advised Berger that he had been awarded the Iron Cross Second Class for his work in Slovakia. By mid-September, the uprising had yet to be quelled, and the only regions that had been pacified were western Slovakia and the <a href="V%C3%A1h">Váh</a> valley, although the rebels had been encircled. Due to Berger's lack of success, Himmler replaced him with a HSSPF, <a href="Hermann%20H%C3%B6fle%20%28SS%20general%29">Hermann Höfle</a>, and Berger relinquished the role of Military Commander in Slovakia on 19 September. Höfle then bloodily suppressed the revolt with the assistance of additional troops that arrived in late October. Berger was then appointed to organise the "<a href="Volkssturm">Volkssturm</a>" (Home Guard) in Germany.

As Germany's situation deteriorated, Hitler decided to form the "Volkssturm", a Nazi Party local militia to defend communities within the Reich. On 24 September 1944, Hitler appointed his private secretary and head of the Reich Chancellery, "<a href="Reichsleiter">Reichsleiter</a>" <a href="Martin%20Bormann">Martin Bormann</a> to form the "Volkssturm". Himmler was given responsibility for the military organisation and equipment of the new militia, which he delegated to Berger, who became one of two chiefs of staff for the organisation. Bormann resisted Berger's attempts to take over the "Volkssturm", and it remained largely under Bormann's control, with local recruiting conducted by the "<a href="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a>s".

In the last few months of the war, the Western Allies became concerned that Hitler would concentrate his remaining forces in a <a href="redoubt">redoubt</a> in the Alps. While this idea was more along the lines of a potential refuge from the Russians rather than a fortress, fears of the existence of an "<a href="Alpine%20Fortress">Alpine Fortress</a>" resulted in the diversion of strong forces towards the southern parts of the Reich to forestall such a plan. In fact, at a surrender ceremony on 5 May, German "<a href="General%20der%20Infanterie">General der Infanterie</a>" <a href="Hermann%20Foertsch">Hermann Foertsch</a> astonished General <a href="Jacob%20L.%20Devers">Jacob L. Devers</a>, commander of the <a href="Sixth%20United%20States%20Army%20Group">Sixth United States Army Group</a>, when he told him that as many as 350,000 German troops were still cut off in the Alps. Berger commanded a "Kampfgruppe" of remnants of the <a href="XIII%20SS%20Army%20Corps">XIII SS Army Corps</a>, including fragments of the <a href="17th%20SS%20Panzergrenadier%20Division%20G%C3%B6tz%20von%20Berlichingen">17th SS Panzergrenadier Division "Götz von Berlichingen"</a>, <a href="35th%20SS%20and%20Police%20Grenadier%20Division">35th SS and Police Grenadier Division</a>, and the <a href="2nd%20Mountain%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">2nd Mountain Division</a>. Berger intended to surrender separately to American forces, and after two days delay, managed to locate a regimental commander of the <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division">101st Airborne Division</a> near <a href="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a> south of <a href="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>. On the following day, Berger was arrested.

Berger has been described as "blustery", cynical, and "one of Himmler's most competent and ruthless war-time lieutenants". An ardent <a href="Antisemitism">anti-Semite</a>, he was also a proponent of the <a href="Final%20Solution">Final Solution</a>. The historian Gerhard Rempel described him as a skilled bureaucratic manipulator, who was "unscrupulous, blunt, and inelegant in manner and expression, yet also full of genial loquacity and racy humour". Despite his own unassailable position at the head of the SS, Himmler was often distracted by Berger's gossip and subterfuge against other leaders within the SS.

Within the SS, Berger was known as one of Himmler's "Twelve Apostles", and was nicknamed ""der Allmächtige Gottlob"" ("the Almighty Gottlob", a play on "The Almighty God", as "Gott" is the German word for "God"). He was also referred to by the phrase "Praise God" and another nickname was "The Duke of Swabia", reflecting his <a href="Swabia">Swabia</a>n origins.

Ultimately, Berger was responsible for the large numbers of non-Reich foreign recruits that joined the "Waffen-SS" between 1940 and 1945. Despite the fact that Berger would have preferred a field command, he was one of Himmler's few trusted senior lieutenants, and his recruiting and organisational skills meant he was kept as chief of the SS-HA throughout the war. The only exception was the short period as military commander in the Slovak State in the autumn of 1944 during the uprising. In September 1939, the number of non-Germans in what soon became the "Waffen-SS" was minimal. By May 1945, the force included 38 divisions, and the majority were non-Germans. None of the 38 divisions were exclusively manned by Reich Germans, and half were mostly made up of personnel from outside the Reich.

After his arrest in May 1945, Berger remained in Allied custody pending a trial before a US military tribunal for various war crimes. He was initially to be a defendant in the proposed "Prisoners of War" Trial, but was eventually included in what became known as the <a href="Ministries%20Trial">Ministries Trial</a> of the <a href="subsequent%20Nuremberg%20trials">subsequent Nuremberg trials</a>. The final indictment against Berger and his co-defendants was lodged on 18 November 1947; the trial commenced on 6 January 1948, before Judges Christianson (presiding), Maguire and Powers, and ended on 13 April 1949.

There were eight counts that formed the indictment against Berger:

During his trial, Berger claimed that he had not been aware of the Final Solution until after the war, but the prosecution produced evidence that he had been present at the first of Himmler's infamous 1943 <a href="Posen%20speeches">Posen speeches</a> in which the "Reichsfuhrer-SS" had explicitly spoken of the extermination of Jews. Berger's defence counsel claimed that his client did not believe the word "extermination" had been used by Himmler with regard to Jews during the speech. Berger's lawyer went on in an attempt to mitigate Berger's actions by claiming that the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> bore strong parallels to the Nazi fight against "Jews and Bolsheviks", and the possibility that the US would also have to fight the Soviet Union in the near future. During the war, Berger wrote in an article, "We the National Socialists believe the Fuhrer when he says that the annihilation of Jewry in Europe stands at the end of the fight instigated by the Jewish World Parasite against us as his strongest enemy." Berger and others also claimed that the unit commanded by Dirlewanger was not part of the SS, although when the text of Himmler's second Posen speech was uncovered in 1953, it "cast dubious light" on Berger's claim. He displayed no remorse for his actions.

The majority of the tribunal declared that "it seems impossible to believe Berger's testimony that he knew nothing of the plans to destroy the Jews or that he never heard of the "final solution" until after the war." However, the court accepted his claim that he saved the lives of Allied POWs whose safety was gravely imperiled by Hitler's orders that they be shot or held as hostages. The court determined that Berger had disobeyed orders and placed himself in danger in order to intervene on behalf of the POWs in question. In contrast, Berger was found guilty of transporting Hungarian Jews to concentration camps and recruiting concentration camp guards. Berger also stated in his evidence that he considered Himmler "an unassimilated half-breed and unfit for the SS".

Berger was acquitted under counts one, and two, and some parts of counts three, and five, and was also acquitted under count six. He was convicted under that part of count three relating to the murder of Mesny, and under those parts of count five relating to his involvement with the SS-"Sonderkommando Dirlewanger", for being a conscious participant in the concentration camp program, and the conscription of nationals of other countries. He was also convicted under that part of count seven relating to the children and youth slave labour program, including the "Heuaktion", and was also convicted under count eight. Judge Powers handed down a dissenting opinion, stating that he was of the view that Berger was not responsible for the murder of Mesny.

On the counts under which he was convicted, Berger was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment, but received credit for the nearly four years during which he had been in custody awaiting trial. Peter Maguire observes that given the status of the defendants and the body of evidence against them, the sentences given to all those indicted in the Ministries Trial were light.

The sentences were reviewed by an Advisory Board for Clemency for War Criminals, which was responsible for providing advice to the U.S. High Commissioner for Germany <a href="John%20J.%20McCloy">John J. McCloy</a>. On 31 January 1951, McCloy determined to reduce Berger's sentence to 10 years imprisonment, stating that he appeared to have been unjustly convicted for the murder of Mesny, and that McCloy had given greater weight to Berger's active interventions "to save the lives of Allied officers and men who under Hitler orders were held for liquidation or as hostages". McCloy did not explain why Berger could not be held responsible for the murder of Mesny, despite the majority finding of the tribunal that Berger bore "command responsibility" for the murder. Berger was released from <a href="Landsberg%20prison">Landsberg prison</a> in December 1951, having spent a total of six and a half years in custody.

After his release from prison in 1951, Berger worked in Stuttgart and <a href="B%C3%B6blingen">Böblingen</a> in his native Baden-Württemberg, and managed a curtain rail factory. He also contributed articles to the monthly right-wing journal "<a href="Nation%20Europa">Nation Europa</a>" published in <a href="Coburg">Coburg</a>, and occasionally wrote articles encouraging the <a href="North%20Atlantic%20Treaty%20Organisation">North Atlantic Treaty Organisation</a> to give greater consideration to former members of the "Waffen-SS". He and his wife Christine had four children: Krista, Wolf, Helgart and Folkart. He died on 5 January 1975 in Gerstetten.

Berger received the following awards and medals during his life:
