Tim Duncan

Timothy Theodore Duncan (born April 25, 1976) is an American former professional <a href="basketball">basketball</a> player. He played his entire 19-year career from 1997 to 2016 with the <a href="San%20Antonio%20Spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a> of the <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> (NBA). Widely regarded as the greatest <a href="Power%20forward%20%28basketball%29">power forward</a> of all time as well as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, he is a five-time <a href="NBA%20champion">NBA champion</a>, two-time <a href="NBA%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NBA MVP</a>, three-time <a href="Bill%20Russell%20NBA%20Finals%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NBA Finals MVP</a>, and an <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">NBA All-Star Game MVP</a>. He is also a 15-time <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Game">NBA All-Star</a> and the only player to be selected to both the <a href="All-NBA%20Team">All-NBA</a> and <a href="NBA%20All-Defensive%20Team">All-Defensive Teams</a> for 13 consecutive seasons.

Duncan started out as a swimmer and only began playing basketball in ninth grade after <a href="Hurricane%20Hugo">Hurricane Hugo</a> destroyed the only Olympic-sized pool on his home of <a href="Saint%20Croix">Saint Croix</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a>. He played for <a href="St.%20Dunstan%27s%20Episcopal%20High%20School">St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School</a>, and had a college career with the <a href="Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20men%27s%20basketball">Wake Forest Demon Deacons</a>, winning the <a href="Naismith%20College%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Naismith College Player of the Year</a>, <a href="USBWA%20College%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">USBWA College Player of the Year</a>, and <a href="John%20Wooden%20Award">John Wooden</a> awards in his senior year. After graduating, Duncan earned <a href="NBA%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year">NBA Rookie of the Year</a> honors after being selected by San Antonio with the <a href="List%20of%20first%20overall%20NBA%20draft%20picks">first overall pick</a> in the <a href="1997%20NBA%20draft">1997 NBA draft</a>.

Off the court, Duncan is known for his quiet and unassuming nature and his active philanthropy. He holds a degree in psychology and created the Tim Duncan Foundation to raise general health awareness and fund education and youth sports in various parts of the United States.

Tim Duncan is the son of Ione, a midwife, and William Duncan, a mason. He has two older sisters, Cheryl and <a href="Tricia%20Duncan">Tricia</a>, and one older brother, Scott, a director and cinematographer. He was born and raised on <a href="Saint%20Croix%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">Saint Croix</a>, one of the main islands composing the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">U.S. Virgin Islands</a>. In school, Duncan was a bright pupil and dreamt of becoming an Olympic-level swimmer like his sister Tricia. His parents were very supportive and Duncan excelled at swimming, becoming a teenage standout in the 50, 100 and 400 meters <a href="freestyle%20swimming">freestyle</a> and aiming to make the <a href="1992%20Summer%20Olympics">1992 Olympic Games</a> as a member of the United States Team.

When <a href="Hurricane%20Hugo">Hurricane Hugo</a> destroyed the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan was forced to swim in the ocean and he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of his fear of sharks. Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother was diagnosed with <a href="breast%20cancer">breast cancer</a> and died one day before his 14th birthday. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.

Duncan initially had difficulties adapting to the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: "[Duncan] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time." He overcame this to become a standout for the <a href="St.%20Dunstan%27s%20Episcopal%20High%20School">St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School</a>, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play attracted the attention of several universities, despite having only picked up the game in ninth grade. <a href="Wake%20Forest%20University">Wake Forest University</a> basketball coach <a href="Dave%20Odom">Dave Odom</a> in particular grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star <a href="Alonzo%20Mourning">Alonzo Mourning</a> to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game. Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket. Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared blankly at Odom for most of the conversation. However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a quick learner. Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the <a href="University%20of%20Hartford">University of Hartford</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Delaware">University of Delaware</a> and <a href="Providence%20College">Providence College</a>, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.

In the <a href="1992%E2%80%9393%20Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">year before</a> Duncan's arrival at <a href="Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20men%27s%20basketball">Wake Forest University</a>, the Demon Deacons reached the <a href="NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Championship">Sweet 16</a>, but then lost main scorer <a href="Rodney%20Rogers">Rodney Rogers</a>, who entered the <a href="1993%20NBA%20draft">1993 NBA draft</a>. In the <a href="1993%20in%20basketball">1993–94 NCAA season</a>, Coach <a href="Dave%20Odom">Dave Odom</a> was considering <a href="redshirt%20%28college%20sports%29">redshirting</a> Duncan, but was forced to play him after fellow freshman big man <a href="Makhtar%20N%27Diaye%20%28basketball%29">Makhtar N'Diaye</a> was ruled out due to <a href="National%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">NCAA</a> rules violations and eventually transferred to <a href="Michigan%20Wolverines%20men%27s%20basketball">Michigan</a>. Duncan struggled with early transition problems and was even held scoreless in his first college game, but as the year progressed, he and teammate <a href="Randolph%20Childress">Randolph Childress</a> led the Deacons to a 20–11 win-loss record. Duncan's style of play was simple but effective, combining an array of <a href="Low%20post">low-post</a> moves, mid-range <a href="Basketball%20moves%23Bank%20shot">bank shots</a> and tough defense. He was chosen to represent the U.S. in the 1994 <a href="Goodwill%20Games">Goodwill Games</a>. Meanwhile, Duncan worked towards a degree in psychology and also took classes in <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a> and Chinese literature. Despite focusing heavily on basketball, Wake Forest psychology department chairperson Deborah Best was quoted: "Tim [...] was one of my more intellectual students. [...] Other than his height, I couldn't tell him from any other student at Wake Forest." Duncan also established his reputation as a stoic player, to the extent that opposing fans taunted him as "<a href="Spock">Mr. Spock</a>", the prototypical logical, detached character from "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>".

In the <a href="1994%20in%20basketball">1994–95 NCAA season</a>, the sophomore was soon called one of the best eligible NBA prospects, along with his peers <a href="Joe%20Smith%20%28basketball%29">Joe Smith</a>, <a href="Rasheed%20Wallace">Rasheed Wallace</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Stackhouse">Jerry Stackhouse</a>. <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> general manager <a href="Jerry%20West">Jerry West</a> suggested that Duncan might become the top pick in the <a href="1995%20NBA%20draft">1995 NBA draft</a> if he went early, but Duncan assured everyone he had no intention of <a href="professional%20sports">going pro</a> until he graduated, even though the NBA was planning to add a rookie <a href="salary%20cap">salary cap</a> in 1996. He was giving up a lot of money, but was determined to stay in school. In that season, he led the <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Demon Deacons</a> into the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> (ACC) <a href="ACC%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Tournament">championship</a> game against a Rasheed Wallace-led <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20North%20Carolina%20Tar%20Heels%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">North Carolina Tar Heels</a>. During that game, Duncan neutralized the threat of Wallace, while Childress sealed the win with a <a href="Jump%20shot%20%28basketball%29">jump shot</a> with four seconds left in <a href="overtime%20%28sports%29">overtime</a>. In the <a href="1995%20NCAA%20Men%27s%20Division%20I%20Basketball%20Tournament">NCAA Tournament</a>, the Demon Deacons reached the Sweet 16, and playing against <a href="1994%E2%80%9395%20Oklahoma%20State%20Cowboys%20basketball%20team">Oklahoma State</a>, Duncan scored 12 points to go with 22 rebounds and eight blocks, outplaying <a href="Bryant%20Reeves">Bryant Reeves</a>, but his team lost 71–66. Still, Duncan ended the year averaging 16.8 <a href="point%20%28basketball%29">points</a> and 12.5 <a href="rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebounds</a> per game, was named Defensive Player of the Year and became the third-best <a href="block%20%28basketball%29">shot-blocker</a> in NCAA history with 3.98 blocks per game. He was also voted All-ACC First Team, a feat he would repeat in each of his two remaining years at Wake Forest.

In the following <a href="1995%20in%20basketball">1995–96 NCAA season</a>, Wake Forest had to deal with the loss of Childress, who graduated the previous season and entered the NBA. This provided an opportunity for Duncan to show his leadership qualities, and his inexperienced team lost only four games in the entire ACC season. The Demon Deacons won the ACC Finals again, but in the Sweet 16, Duncan came down with the flu, and his team missed the <a href="Final%20Four">Final Four</a> by one win. He completed another remarkable season with averages of 19.1 points and 12.3 rebounds per game, and was again voted ACC Defensive Player of the Year and won his first <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference%20Men%27s%20Basketball%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">ACC Player of the Year</a> award. At the season's end the Wake Forest star was rumored to enter the <a href="1996%20NBA%20draft">1996 NBA draft</a>, but in the end, he stayed in college.

In the <a href="1996%20in%20basketball">1996–97 NCAA season</a>, Duncan was helped by the addition of future NBA player <a href="Loren%20Woods">Loren Woods</a>, a 7'1" player who eased the pressure on Duncan close to the basket. The <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20Wake%20Forest%20Demon%20Deacons%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">Demon Deacons</a> won their first 13 games, but then got into a slump and failed to win a third ACC title. The NCAA campaign was just as frustrating, as <a href="Stanford%20Cardinal%20men%27s%20basketball">Stanford University</a>, led by future NBA <a href="point%20guard">point guard</a> <a href="Brevin%20Knight">Brevin Knight</a>, eliminated Duncan's team with a 72–66 win. Duncan finished with an individually impressive season though, averaging 20.8 points, 14.7 rebounds and 3.2 <a href="assist%20%28basketball%29">assists</a> per game while shooting .606 from the <a href="field%20goal%20percentage">field</a> and winning the Defensive Player of the Year for a third straight season. He earned first-team <a href="All-America">All-America</a> honors for the second time, and was a unanimous pick for both <a href="Oscar%20Robertson%20Trophy">USBWA</a> and <a href="Naismith%20College%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Naismith College Player of the Year</a>. Duncan led the 1996–97 NCAA Division I in rebounding, was 10th in blocked shots (3.3 bpg) and 28th in scoring (20.8 ppg). He was voted ACC Player of the Year again and won the 1997 <a href="John%20R.%20Wooden%20Award">John Wooden Award</a> as the NCAA's best overall male player based on the votes of sportscasters and newswriters.

In contrast to contemporary <a href="NBA%20high%20school%20draftees">prep-to-pro</a> players like <a href="Kevin%20Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a>, <a href="Jermaine%20O%27Neal">Jermaine O'Neal</a>, <a href="Tracy%20McGrady">Tracy McGrady</a> or <a href="Kobe%20Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, Duncan stayed at college for a full four years. During that period, he was a two-time ACC Player of the Year, and a three-time <a href="NABC%20Defensive%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">NABC Defensive Player of the Year</a>. The center also made the All-ACC Tournament between 1995 and 1997, the All-ACC First Team between 1995 and 1997, and was named <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> of the 1996 ACC Tournament. Further, 1996 was the year where he led the conference in scoring, rebounding, field goal percentage and blocked shots, becoming the first player in conference history to lead all four of those categories. Overall, Duncan led his team to a 97–31 win–loss record and finished his college career as the <a href="List%20of%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20basketball%20career%20rebounding%20leaders%23Post-1973%20era">all-time leading rebounder</a> in NCAA history in the post-1973 era (later surpassed by <a href="Kenneth%20Faried">Kenneth Faried</a>). He remains one of only ten players with more than 2,000 career points and 1,500 career rebounds. He was also the first player in NCAA history to reach 1,500 points, 1,000 rebounds, 400 blocked shots and 200 assists. He left college as the all-time leading shot-blocker in ACC history with 481 blocks—<a href="List%20of%20NCAA%20Division%20I%20men%27s%20basketball%20career%20blocks%20leaders">at the time second in NCAA annals</a> behind <a href="Colgate%20Raiders%20men%27s%20basketball">Colgate's</a> <a href="Adonal%20Foyle">Adonal Foyle</a> and third on the ACC career rebounding list with 1,570 rebounds. After earning his college degree, Duncan became automatically eligible for the <a href="1997%20NBA%20draft">1997 NBA draft</a>.

In the 1997 NBA draft, the <a href="San%20Antonio%20Spurs">San Antonio Spurs</a> drafted Duncan with the first draft pick. The Spurs were coming off an injury-riddled <a href="1996%E2%80%9397%20NBA%20season">1996–97 season</a>; their best player, <a href="David%20Robinson%20%28basketball%29">David Robinson</a>—himself a number one draft pick <a href="1987%20NBA%20draft">in 1987</a>—was sidelined for most of the year, and they had finished with a 20–62 win–loss record. However, as the <a href="1997%E2%80%9398%20NBA%20season">1997–98 season</a> approached, the Spurs were considered a notable threat in the NBA. With an experienced <a href="center%20%28basketball%29">center</a> in Robinson and the number one pick in Duncan, the Spurs featured one of the best <a href="frontcourt">frontcourt</a>s in the league. Duncan and Robinson became known as the "Twin Towers", having earned a reputation for their exceptional defense close to the basket, forcing opponents to take lower percentage shots from outside. From the beginning, Duncan established himself as a quality player: in his second road game, he grabbed 22 rebounds against opposing <a href="Chicago%20Bulls">Chicago Bulls</a> <a href="List%20of%20players%20in%20the%20Naismith%20Memorial%20Basketball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> power forward <a href="Dennis%20Rodman">Dennis Rodman</a>, a multiple rebounding champion and <a href="NBA%20Defensive%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">NBA Defensive Player of the Year</a>. Duncan was voted to the <a href="1998%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">1998 NBA All-Star Game</a> by coaches. Later, when Duncan played against opposing <a href="Houston%20Rockets">Houston Rockets</a> Hall of Fame power forward <a href="Charles%20Barkley">Charles Barkley</a>, Barkley was so impressed he said: "I have seen the future and he wears number 21." In his rookie season, Duncan lived up to expectations of being the number one draft pick, starting in all 82 regular-season games, averaging 21.1 points, 11.9 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, and earning All-NBA First Team honors. His defensive contributions ensured that he was elected to the <a href="NBA%20All-Defensive%20Second%20Team">NBA All-Defensive Second Team</a> and was also named <a href="NBA%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year">NBA Rookie of the Year</a>, having won the NBA Rookie of the Month award every single month that season. Spurs coach <a href="Gregg%20Popovich">Gregg Popovich</a> lauded Duncan's mental toughness, stating his rookie's "demeanor was singularly remarkable", Duncan always "put things into perspective" and never got "too upbeat or too depressed." Center Robinson was equally impressed with Duncan: "He's the real thing. I'm proud of his attitude and effort. He gives all the extra effort and work and wants to become a better player."

The Spurs qualified for the <a href="1998%20NBA%20Playoffs">1998 NBA Playoffs</a> as the fifth <a href="Seed%20%28sports%29">seed</a>, but Duncan had a bad first half in his first playoff game against the <a href="Phoenix%20Suns">Phoenix Suns</a>, causing Suns coach <a href="Danny%20Ainge">Danny Ainge</a> to play Duncan with less defensive pressure. The rookie capitalized on this by finishing Game 1 with 32 points and 10 rebounds and replicating the performance in Game 2, contributing to a 3–1 victory over the Suns. However, the Spurs lost in the second round to the eventual Western Conference Champions <a href="Utah%20Jazz">Utah Jazz</a>. In this series, Duncan was pitted against Hall-of-Fame power forward <a href="Karl%20Malone">Karl Malone</a>. Duncan outscored Malone in the first two games which the Spurs lost, but as the series progressed, the more experienced Malone shut Duncan down on defense and dominated on offense, outscoring the young power forward in Games 3 to 5 18–10, 34–22 and 24–14 respectively.
During the <a href="lockout%20%28industry%29">lockout</a>-shortened <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NBA%20season">1998–99 season</a>, the Spurs started with a lackluster 6–8 record and Popovich came under fire from the press. However, Duncan and Robinson stood behind their coach, and finished the season with a 31–5 run. The sophomore averaged 21.7 points, 11.4 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 2.5 blocks in the regular season, making both the <a href="All-NBA">All-NBA</a> and All-Defense First Teams. In the <a href="1999%20NBA%20Playoffs">1999 NBA Playoffs</a>, the Spurs defeated the <a href="Minnesota%20Timberwolves">Minnesota Timberwolves</a> 3–1, swept the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> and the <a href="Portland%20Trail%20Blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a> 4–0, and defeated the <a href="Cinderella%20%28sports%29">Cinderella story</a> <a href="New%20York%20Knicks">New York Knicks</a> 4–1 in the <a href="1999%20NBA%20Finals">Finals</a>. In this series, a large contingent of Virgin Islanders flew over to support their local hero, and were not disappointed. In the first two games, the "<a href="Twin%20Towers%20%28San%20Antonio%20Spurs%29">Twin Towers</a>" outscored their Knicks counterparts <a href="Chris%20Dudley">Chris Dudley</a>/<a href="Larry%20Johnson%20%28basketball%2C%20born%201969%29">Larry Johnson</a> with 41 points, 26 rebounds, and nine blocks versus five points, 12 rebounds, and zero blocks. After a Game 3 loss in which Duncan was held scoreless in the third quarter and committed three <a href="turnover%20%28basketball%29">turnovers</a> in the last quarter, Duncan bounced back with 28 points and 18 rebounds in a Game 4 win, and in Game 5, the Spurs protected a 78–77 lead seconds from the end with the ball in the Knicks' possession. <a href="Double%20team">Double team</a>ed by Duncan and Robinson, Knicks <a href="swingman">swingman</a> <a href="Latrell%20Sprewell">Latrell Sprewell</a> missed a last-second desperation shot, and after closing out the series with a strong 31-point and 9-rebound showing in Game 5, Duncan was named <a href="NBA%20Finals%20MVP">Finals MVP</a>, bringing San Antonio their first-ever NBA championship. The accolades for the Spurs soon arrived, with "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" reporting that the San Antonio "monkey has been shed", and that the Spurs were no longer known as the "San Antonio softies". The magazine praised Finals MVP Duncan, who was later quoted: "This is incredible. We kept our focus and we pulled it out." "Sports Illustrated" journalist and retired NBA player <a href="Alex%20English">Alex English</a> added: "Duncan came up big each time they went to him with that sweet turnaround jumper off the glass. He was the man tonight [in Game 5]." And Popovich later said to losing coach <a href="Jeff%20Van%20Gundy">Jeff Van Gundy</a>: "I've got Tim [Duncan] and you don't. That's the difference."

In the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000%20NBA%20season">1999–2000 season</a>, Duncan further cemented his reputation. He averaged 23.2 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.2 blocks per game, earned another pair of All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-ups, and was co-MVP with <a href="Shaquille%20O%27Neal">Shaquille O'Neal</a> of the NBA All-Star Game. However, the Spurs had a disappointing post-season. Duncan injured his <a href="Meniscus%20%28anatomy%29">meniscus</a> shortly before the end of the regular season and was unable to play in even one post-season game. Consequently, the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the <a href="2000%20NBA%20Playoffs">2000 NBA Playoffs</a>, losing 3–1 to the Phoenix Suns. Nonetheless, Duncan rebounded in the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301%20NBA%20season">next season</a>, and with strong regular-season averages of 22.2 points, 12.2 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 2.3 blocks, earned himself yet another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups. In the <a href="2001%20NBA%20Playoffs">2001 NBA Playoffs</a>, the Spurs eliminated the Timberwolves 3–1, defeated the <a href="Dallas%20Mavericks">Dallas Mavericks</a> 4–1, but then bowed out against the Lakers led by superstars Shaquille O'Neal and <a href="Kobe%20Bryant">Kobe Bryant</a>, losing in four straight games. "Sports Illustrated" described the series as a "[m]erciless mismatch", and Duncan was criticized as "silent when the Spurs need him most".

On the back of two consecutive playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the <a href="2001%E2%80%9302%20NBA%20season">2001–02 season</a>. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs. Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the <a href="NBA%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">league's Most Valuable Player</a>, joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor. On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled with the fact that the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward <a href="Malik%20Rose">Malik Rose</a> had to step in more often. In the <a href="2002%20NBA%20Playoffs">2002 NBA Playoffs</a>, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions. Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: "I thought we really had a chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes." Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as "phenomenal" and criticized his supporting cast, stating Duncan "made 11-of-23 shots and 12-of-14 free throws, adding four assists and two blocks [a]nd once again, he did not have enough help." Also, Robinson said "Tim [Duncan] was like Superman out there", and conceded that the Lakers were simply better, just like in the last playoffs campaign.
The <a href="2002%E2%80%9303%20NBA%20season">2002–03 season</a> saw Duncan enjoy another standout season in which he averaged 23.3 points, a career-high 12.9 rebounds, 3.9 assists and 2.9 blocks per game, and yet another dual All-NBA and All-Defense First Team call-up, resulting in his second NBA Most Valuable Player Award. At age 37, Robinson announced that year as his last season, and his playing time was cut by coach Popovich to save his energy for the playoffs. The Spurs qualified easily for <a href="2003%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a>, concluding the regular season as the Conference number one seed with a 60–22 record. Although San Antonio now had new offensive threats in <a href="Tony%20Parker">Tony Parker</a> and <a href="Manu%20Gin%C3%B3bili">Manu Ginóbili</a>, during the playoffs, it was Duncan's performance in the semi-finals against the Los Angeles Lakers which was singled out for praise by Popovich, who stated: "I thought in Game 5 and Game 6, he [Duncan] was astounding in his focus. He pulled everyone along these last two games." In the series, Duncan was matched up against forward <a href="Robert%20Horry">Robert Horry</a>, and was able to dominate him the entire series and closed out the series in style; Duncan finished Game 6 with 37 points and 16 rebounds, allowing Spurs coach Popovich to call <a href="sport%20time-out">timeout</a> with 2:26 left to instruct his team not to celebrate excessively. The Spurs made it to the <a href="2003%20NBA%20Finals">finals</a>, and defeated the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Nets">New Jersey Nets</a> 88–77 in Game 6 to win another NBA championship. Helped by an inspired Robinson, Duncan almost recorded a <a href="quadruple%20double">quadruple double</a> in the final game, and was named the NBA Finals MVP. Duncan said of the victory: "We were all confident that something would happen, that we would turn the game to our favor, and it did", but felt sad that Robinson retired after winning his second championship ring. Following this successful Spurs campaign, Robinson and Duncan were named "Sports Illustrated"s 2003 "<a href="Sportsman%20of%20the%20Year">Sportsmen of the Year</a>".

Before the <a href="2003%E2%80%9304%20NBA%20season">2003–04 season</a> began, the Spurs lost their perennial captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included <a href="Slovenia">Slovenia</a>n center <a href="Rasho%20Nesterovi%C4%8D">Rasho Nesterovič</a>, defensive stalwart <a href="Bruce%20Bowen">Bruce Bowen</a>, Argentinian <a href="shooting%20guard">shooting guard</a> Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming off the bench were clutch shooting power forward <a href="Robert%20Horry">Robert Horry</a>, versatile <a href="Hedo%20T%C3%BCrko%C4%9Flu">Hedo Türkoğlu</a> and veterans Malik Rose and <a href="Kevin%20Willis">Kevin Willis</a>. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant to step into the void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the <a href="2004%20NBA%20Playoffs">Western Conference Semifinals</a>. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard <a href="Derek%20Fisher">Derek Fisher</a> hit a <a href="buzzer%20beater">buzzer beater</a> for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as one of the reasons for the loss.

Duncan and his Spurs looked to re-assert themselves in the next <a href="2004%E2%80%9305%20NBA%20season">2004–05 season</a>. Despite their new captain's slight statistical slump (20.3 points, 11.1 rebounds, 2.7 assists, 2.6 blocks per game), the Spurs won the second seed for the <a href="2005%20NBA%20Playoffs">2005 NBA Playoffs</a> by winning 59 games. In the first round, the Spurs eliminated the <a href="Denver%20Nuggets">Denver Nuggets</a> four games to one, and met the <a href="Seattle%20SuperSonics">Seattle SuperSonics</a> in the semi-finals. After splitting the first four games, Duncan led his team to two decisive victories, setting up a meeting with the <a href="Phoenix%20Suns">Phoenix Suns</a>, known for their up-tempo basketball. The Spurs managed to beat the Suns at their own game, defeating them 4–1 and earning a spot in the <a href="2005%20NBA%20Finals">2005 NBA Finals</a> against the <a href="Detroit%20Pistons">Detroit Pistons</a>. In the Finals, Duncan was pitted against Detroit's defensively strong frontcourt anchored by multiple <a href="NBA%20Defensive%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">NBA Defensive Player of the Year</a> <a href="Ben%20Wallace">Ben Wallace</a>. After two convincing Game 1 and 2 wins for the Spurs, the Pistons <a href="double%20team">double team</a>ed Duncan and forced him to play further from the basket. Detroit won the next two games and the series was eventually tied at 3–3, but Duncan was instrumental in Game 7, recording 25 points and 11 rebounds as the Spurs defeated the Pistons. NBA.com reported that "with his unique multidimensional talent, Duncan depleted and dissected the Pistons... He was the fulcrum of virtually every key play down the stretch", and coach Popovich added: "[Duncan's] complete game is so sound, so fundamental, so unnoticed at times, because if he didn't score, people think, 'Well, he didn't do anything'. But he was incredible and he was the force that got it done for us." Pistons center Ben Wallace remarked: "He put his team on his shoulders and carried them to a championship [...t]hat's what the great players do." Duncan won his third NBA Finals MVP Award, joining <a href="Michael%20Jordan">Michael Jordan</a>, Shaquille O'Neal, and <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a> as the only players in NBA history to win it three times.
During the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306%20NBA%20season">2005–06 season</a>, Duncan suffered from <a href="plantar%20fasciitis">plantar fasciitis</a> for most of the season, which was at least partly responsible for his sinking output (18.6 points, 11.0 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 2.0 blocks per game), and also for his failure to make the All-NBA First Team after eight consecutive appearances. The big man came back strong in the <a href="2006%20NBA%20Playoffs">2006 NBA Playoffs</a> against the Dallas Mavericks, where he outscored rival power forward <a href="Dirk%20Nowitzki">Dirk Nowitzki</a> 32.2 to 27.1 points, with neither Nowitzki nor Mavericks center <a href="Erick%20Dampier">Erick Dampier</a> able to stop Duncan with their man-to-man defense. But after splitting the first six games, Duncan became the tragic hero of his team in Game 7. Despite scoring 39 points in regulation time and fouling out both Dampier and <a href="Keith%20Van%20Horn">Keith Van Horn</a>, Duncan only made one of seven field goal attempts in overtime against Mavericks reserve center <a href="DeSagana%20Diop">DeSagana Diop</a>, and the Spurs lost Game 7.

The <a href="2006%E2%80%9307%20NBA%20season">following season</a>, however, was another championship year for Duncan and the Spurs. Duncan averaged 20.0 points, 10.6 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.4 blocks per game in the regular season, and was selected as a Western Conference starter for the <a href="2007%20NBA%20All-Star%20Game">2007 NBA All-Star Game</a>, his ninth appearance in the event. In <a href="2007%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a>, he led the Spurs to a 4–1 series win over the Denver Nuggets in the opening round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs, a 4–2 win over the Phoenix Suns in the second round, and a 4–1 win against the <a href="Utah%20Jazz">Utah Jazz</a> in the Western Conference Finals, setting up a meeting with the <a href="Cleveland%20Cavaliers">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> in <a href="2007%20NBA%20Finals">the Finals</a>. There, the Spurs swept the Cavaliers 4–0, earning Duncan his and San Antonio's fourth ever championship. Duncan proclaimed that that championship was "the best" of his four championships; however, he also acknowledged he played "sub-par" and thus received only one vote for NBA Finals MVP from a panel of ten. His colleagues were more appreciative of Duncan; among others, ex-teammate David Robinson referred to the Spurs titles as the "Tim Duncan era", and lauded his leadership. Coach Popovich also praised Duncan: "Tim is the common denominator. He's [had] a different cast around him [in] '99, '03 and '05. He's welcomed them all. [...] But he is that easy to play with, and his skills are so fundamentally sound that other people can fit in." Then-NBA commissioner <a href="David%20Stern">David Stern</a> added: "[Duncan] is a player for the ages. I'm a tennis fan, and <a href="Pete%20Sampras">Pete Sampras</a> is one of the greats. OK, he wasn't <a href="Andre%20Agassi">Andre Agassi</a> or <a href="John%20McEnroe">John McEnroe</a>. He just happens to be one of the greatest players of all time. You take great players as you find them."

During the <a href="2008%20NBA%20All-Star%20Weekend">2008 NBA All-Star Weekend</a>, Duncan was a member of the San Antonio team that won the <a href="NBA%20All-Star%20Weekend%20Shooting%20Stars%20Competition">Shooting Stars Competition</a>. For the season, he played 78 games and posted his typical 20/10 numbers, San Antonio concluded the <a href="2007%E2%80%9308%20NBA%20season">2007–08</a> regular season with a 56–26 record, finishing behind the Lakers and <a href="New%20Orleans%20Hornets">New Orleans Hornets</a> in the Western Conference and setting up themselves for a first-round contest against the Suns. The Suns—defeated by the Spurs in three of the past four seasons of playoffs—were out for revenge and featured a new player in four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal. In Game 1, Duncan set the tone with a 40-point game and a rare <a href="three-pointer">three-pointer</a> that sent the game into double overtime. The trio of Duncan, Ginóbili and Parker continued playing to form for the remainder of the series, and the Spurs eliminated the Suns in five games. In the first game of the next round against the <a href="Chris%20Paul">Chris Paul</a>-led Hornets, San Antonio was badly defeated 101–82 as Duncan played one of the worst playoff games in his career, recording only 5 points and 3 rebounds. The Spurs dropped the next game as well, but recovered in Games 3 and 4, with Duncan putting up a team-high 22 point/15 rebound/4 block performance in the game that tied the series. Duncan then recorded 20 points and 15 rebounds in Game 6, and the Spurs relied on their experience to seal the series in Game 7. However, arch-rivals <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> defeated San Antonio in five games in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to capture back-to-back NBA championships.
Duncan started the <a href="2008%E2%80%9309%20NBA%20season">2008–09 season</a> with strong showings in points and rebounds per game. However, by mid-season, his performance declined and he was subsequently diagnosed with chronic knee <a href="tendinosis">tendinosis</a>. Despite Duncan having problems with his knee and the team losing the services of shooting guard Ginóbili for most of the season, San Antonio qualified for <a href="2009%20NBA%20Playoffs">the playoffs</a> as the third seed with a 54–28 record. Coupled with an aging supporting cast (Bowen, <a href="Michael%20Finley">Michael Finley</a> and <a href="Kurt%20Thomas%20%28basketball%29">Kurt Thomas</a> were all in their late 30s), however, the Spurs were only considered fringe contenders for the championship. As it turned out, Duncan and Parker were not enough to help the Spurs avoid a 4–1 defeat by Dallas, and the Spurs were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 2000.

With the Spurs looking to provide a more solid supporting cast in the <a href="2009%E2%80%9310%20NBA%20season">2009–10 season</a>, they acquired <a href="Richard%20Jefferson">Richard Jefferson</a>, <a href="Theo%20Ratliff">Theo Ratliff</a>, <a href="Antonio%20McDyess">Antonio McDyess</a>, <a href="DeJuan%20Blair">DeJuan Blair</a>, and <a href="Keith%20Bogans">Keith Bogans</a>. The team got off to a 5–6 start, but a series of double double performances by Duncan gave them a 9–6 record by the end of November. Duncan was subsequently named the Western Conference Player of the Week for the last week of November. Even at 34 years of age, he remained a constant 20–10 threat, being only one of three players in the league at the mid-season to average at least 20 points and 10 rebounds a game. On January 21, 2010, Duncan was named as the starting forward for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game. After securing yet another 50-win season, the Spurs qualified for the <a href="2010%20NBA%20Playoffs">playoffs</a> as the seventh seed, and defeated Dallas 4–2 in the first round, only to lose 4–0 to Phoenix in the next round.

Eleven games into the <a href="2010%E2%80%9311%20NBA%20season">2010–11 season</a>, Duncan became the Spurs' all-time leader in points scored and games played. Along the way, the Spurs compiled a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. On November 30, 2010, Duncan recorded his third career <a href="triple-double">triple-double</a> against the <a href="Golden%20State%20Warriors">Golden State Warriors</a>. 12 days later, in a game against the <a href="Portland%20Trail%20Blazers">Portland Trail Blazers</a>, Duncan became the <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20career%20games%20played%20leaders">94th player in NBA history to play 1,000 games</a>. Through his 1,000th game, the Spurs have been 707–293; only <a href="Scottie%20Pippen">Scottie Pippen</a> (715–285) had a better record with his team through his first 1,000 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Although Duncan produced career-lows in points and rebounds per game, the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the <a href="2011%20NBA%20Playoffs">2011 NBA Playoffs</a>, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded <a href="Memphis%20Grizzlies">Memphis Grizzlies</a>.

The Spurs again finished the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312%20NBA%20season">2011–12 season</a> as the number one seed in the West—it was a lockout-shortened 66-game season—tying with the Chicago Bulls for a league-best 50–16 record. Prior to a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on March 24, 2012, head coach Gregg Popovich decided to give Duncan a night off by listing him on the official scorecard as "DNP-OLD", poking fun at his 36-year-old body. Overall, Duncan's numbers remained at par with the previous season. The triumvirate of Duncan-Parker-Ginóbili entered the <a href="2012%20NBA%20Playoffs">2012 NBA Playoffs</a> well-rested and healthy, and the Spurs swept the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers 4–0 in the first two rounds. On May 31, 2012, in the third game of the Western Conference Finals against the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%20Thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a>, Duncan set the record for most career blocks in playoffs history, surpassing <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>. The Spurs' playoff run came to an end when the Thunder defeated them 4–2.

On July 11, 2012, Duncan agreed to re-sign with the Spurs. Helped by a supporting cast comprising <a href="Danny%20Green%20%28basketball%29">Danny Green</a>, <a href="Tiago%20Splitter">Tiago Splitter</a>, <a href="Gary%20Neal">Gary Neal</a> and <a href="Kawhi%20Leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> that had been maturing steadily over the last two seasons, Duncan and the Spurs would again make the <a href="2013%20NBA%20Playoffs">playoffs</a> with a 58–24 regular season record. Duncan also returned to the All-Star line-up and was named to the All-NBA First Team. He finished the regular season with 23,785 career points, which broke <a href="George%20Gervin">George Gervin</a>'s record for most points in a Spurs uniform (23,602). In the playoffs, the Spurs swept the Los Angeles Lakers, beat Golden State in six games and defeated the Memphis Grizzlies in the Western Conference Finals in a 4–0 sweep to reach the NBA Finals. In game 2 of the Western Conference Finals, Duncan recorded his 500th playoff block, becoming the first player in NBA history to reach that milestone, although the NBA did not track blocks prior to the 1973–74 season. The Spurs met defending NBA champions <a href="Miami%20Heat">Miami Heat</a> in the <a href="2013%20NBA%20Finals">NBA Finals</a> in a tightly contested series. Miami had home court advantage, but San Antonio took the first game and headed into game 6 with a 3–2 lead. In that game, Duncan scored 25 points in the first half, his biggest haul in a half of an NBA Finals game. However, the Spurs lost the game in overtime, and then lost the deciding seventh game.

On December 2, 2013, Duncan became the oldest player to record a 20–20 game in NBA history, finishing with 23 points, 21 rebounds and the game-winning jump shot against the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20Atlanta%20Hawks%20season">Atlanta Hawks</a>. The Spurs went on to conclude the <a href="2013%E2%80%9314%20NBA%20season">2013–14 regular season</a> with a league-best 62 wins. The Spurs defeated Dallas in seven games in the first round of the <a href="2014%20NBA%20Playoffs">playoffs</a>, Portland in five games in the conference semifinals, and Oklahoma City in six games, where game 6 went into overtime, as the Spurs won, 112–107. They set up a Finals rematch against the Miami Heat, which they won, 4–1, setting a record margin for a win in the NBA Finals, for games 3 and 4. Along the way, the Duncan-Ginóbili-Parker trio broke the record for most wins in NBA Playoffs history. After winning the Finals in five games, Duncan joined <a href="John%20Salley">John Salley</a> as the only players to win a championship in three different decades.

On June 23, 2014, Duncan exercised his $10.3 million player option for the 2014–15 season. On November 14, 2014, Duncan scored his 25,000th point in the first half of the Spurs' 93–80 win over the Los Angeles Lakers, becoming the 19th player in NBA history to reach the milestone. On February 19, 2015, he passed <a href="Alex%20English">Alex English</a> to move into 16th place on the <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20career%20scoring%20leaders">NBA's all-time scoring list</a> with 30 points against the Los Angeles Clippers. On March 4, he recorded six rebounds against the Sacramento Kings, breaking his tie with <a href="Nate%20Thurmond">Nate Thurmond</a> for ninth in career rebounding. Two days later, he recorded three blocks against the Denver Nuggets to surpass <a href="Patrick%20Ewing">Patrick Ewing</a> for sixth overall in career blocks. On April 12, he played his 1,330th career game against the Phoenix Suns, which passed <a href="Moses%20Malone">Moses Malone</a> for 11th all-time. He also scored 22 points and passed <a href="Kevin%20Garnett">Kevin Garnett</a> to move into 14th place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. The Spurs finished sixth in the Western Conference after 82 games and faced the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round of the playoffs. Their quest for back-to-back championships was ended May 2 as they lost to the Clippers in seven games. Duncan was later named to the All-Defensive second team on May 20 for the seventh time in his career.

On July 9, 2015, Duncan re-signed with the Spurs to a two-year deal. On November 2, 2015, in a win over the New York Knicks, Duncan recorded 16 points, 10 rebounds and six assists in his NBA-record 954th victory with one team, surpassing John Stockton's 953 wins with the Utah Jazz. On November 11, he pulled down rebound number 14,716 for his career against the Portland Trail Blazers to pass <a href="Robert%20Parish">Robert Parish</a> for seventh place on the <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20career%20rebounding%20leaders">NBA's all-time rebounding list</a>. On November 14, in a win over the Philadelphia 76ers, Duncan had five blocked shots to become the Spurs' franchise leader with 2,955 blocks, surpassing former teammate David Robinson's career total of 2,954. Duncan also moved into <a href="List%20of%20National%20Basketball%20Association%20career%20blocks%20leaders">fifth all-time on the NBA's blocks list</a>. After missing the Spurs' last three games of December due to rest and right knee soreness, Duncan returned to action on January 2, 2016, against the Houston Rockets. In his return game, Duncan was held scoreless for the first time in his 19-year career; giving him the most consecutive games with at least one point, at 1,359. Four days later, Duncan scored a then season-high 18 points in a 123–98 win over the Utah Jazz, helping the Spurs extend its franchise-record home winning streak to 30 straight regular-season games dating to 2014–15. On February 10, he returned to the starting lineup after missing eight games with a sore knee. On February 27, in a win over the Houston Rockets, he became the fifth player in NBA history to reach 3,000 blocks. In addition, with six rebounds in the game, Duncan reached 14,971 for his career, passing Karl Malone (14,968) for sixth place in league history. On March 10, Duncan became the sixth player in league history with 15,000 rebounds, completing the feat midway through the first quarter of the Spurs' 109–101 win over the Chicago Bulls. On March 19, he came off the bench for only the third time in his career to counter the smaller lineup of the Golden State Warriors. With a win over the Warriors, the Spurs recorded their 35th straight home win of the season and their 44th straight at home dating to 2014–15, tied for the second-longest streak in NBA history with the 1995–96 Chicago Bulls. On April 5, in a win over the Utah Jazz, he became the third player with 1,000 victories in the regular season, following <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> and <a href="Robert%20Parish">Robert Parish</a>. Duncan extended his mark as the NBA's career leader in victories with one team. On April 8, he scored a season-high 21 points in a losing effort to the Denver Nuggets. Having already locked up second seed in the West with a franchise best record (65–13 prior to Nuggets game), all four of Duncan's starting teammates were rested. The Spurs went on to lose to the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round of the playoffs.

On June 28, 2016, Duncan opted into his $5.6 million contract for the 2016–17 season. However, on July 11, 2016, he announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons with San Antonio. In September 2016, coach <a href="Gregg%20Popovich">Gregg Popovich</a> indicated that Duncan would have a coaching role with the team in the 2016–17 season.

On December 18, 2016, the Spurs retired Duncan's No. 21 jersey in a postgame ceremony.

In 1998, Duncan was selected as one of the last two players for the <a href="United%20States%20men%27s%20national%20basketball%20team">United States national team</a> for the <a href="World%20Basketball%20Championship">World Basketball Championship</a>. However, this team was later replaced with <a href="Continental%20Basketball%20Association">CBA</a> and college players because of the <a href="1998%E2%80%9399%20NBA%20lockout">NBA lockout</a>. Duncan's first chance at playing for the national team came in 1999 when he was called up to the Olympic Qualifying Team. He averaged 12.7 ppg, 9.1 rpg and 2.4 bpg and led the team to a 10–0 finish en route to a qualifying berth for the <a href="2000%20Sydney%20Olympics">2000 Sydney Olympics</a>, but a knee injury forced him to stay out of the <a href="Olympic%20Games">Olympic Games</a> themselves.

In 2003, Duncan was also a member of the USA team that recorded ten wins and qualified for the <a href="2004%20Summer%20Olympics">2004 Summer Olympics</a>. He started all the games he played in and averaged team bests of 15.6 ppg, 8.0 rpg, 1.56 bpg, while shooting 60.7 percent from the field. At the Olympics itself, the team lost three games on its way to a bronze medal. The record represented more losses in a single year than in the 68 previous years combined. It was also the first time since NBA players became eligible that the U.S. men's basketball team returned home without gold medals at the Olympics. After the tournament, Duncan commented, "I am about 95 percent sure my <a href="International%20Basketball%20Federation">FIBA</a> career is over. I'll try not to share my experiences with anyone." In total, Duncan was a member of five USA Basketball teams and played in 40 games.

Standing at 6 feet 11 inches tall (2.11 m) and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg), Duncan was a <a href="power%20forward%20%28basketball%29">power forward</a> who could also play <a href="center%20%28basketball%29">center</a>. With a <a href="double-double">double-double</a> career average in points and rebounds, he was considered one of the most consistent players in the NBA throughout his career. Regarded as one of the league's best interior defenders, Duncan also ranked consistently as one of the top <a href="point%20%28basketball%29">scorers</a>, <a href="rebound%20%28basketball%29">rebounders</a> and <a href="block%20%28basketball%29">shot-blockers</a> in the league. At the end of his final season in 2015–16, he was ranked first in regular season point-rebound double-doubles among active players, while he led the charts in post-season point-rebound double-doubles (158 as of 2013–14). His main weakness for much of his career was his <a href="free%20throw">free throw</a> shooting, with a career average of less than 70%.

Apart from his impressive statistics, Duncan has gained a reputation as a good clutch player, as evidenced by his three NBA Finals MVP awards and his playoff career averages being higher than his regular season statistics. Eleven-time NBA champion <a href="Bill%20Russell">Bill Russell</a> further compliments Duncan on his passing ability, and rates him as one of the most efficient players of his generation, a view shared by 19-time NBA All-Star <a href="Kareem%20Abdul-Jabbar">Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a>. Because of his versatility and success, basketball experts widely consider Duncan to be the greatest power forward in NBA history, while coach Popovich and teammates Parker and Ginóbili have also credited much of San Antonio's success to him. Duncan's detractors, however, label him as "boring" because of his simple but effective style of play (thus earning him the nickname "The Big Fundamental"). Following his first championship ring in 1999, "<a href="Sports%20Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a>" described him as a "quiet, boring MVP", a characterization which persists today.

Duncan himself commented on his "boring" image, stating: "If you show excitement, then you also may show disappointment or frustration. If your opponent picks up on this frustration, you are at a disadvantage." Sports journalist Kevin Kernan commented on his ability to relax and stay focused, stating that having a degree in psychology, Duncan often not only outplays, but out-psychs his opponents. Duncan has also stated that he especially likes his <a href="Bank%20shot%20%28basketball%29">bank shot</a>, saying: "It is just easy for me. It just feels good." Additionally, Duncan's close and longstanding relationship with Spurs coach <a href="Gregg%20Popovich">Gregg Popovich</a> has been described as "the greatest love story in sports".

In his basketball career, Duncan collected a number of individual and team honors, including being a two-time MVP (2002, 2003), five-time NBA champion (1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2014) and three-time NBA Finals MVP (1999, 2003, 2005). As a college player, he was honored by the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">House of Representatives</a>, named the ACC Male Athlete of the Year, won the <a href="John%20R.%20Wooden%20Award">John R. Wooden Award</a> and <a href="Adolph%20Rupp%20Trophy">Adolph Rupp Trophy</a>, and was selected as the <a href="Naismith%20College%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">Naismith College Player of the Year</a> in addition to player of the year honors from the <a href="Oscar%20Robertson%20Trophy">United States Basketball Writers Association</a> (USBWA), <a href="NABC%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">National Association of Basketball Coaches</a> (NABC) and <a href="Sporting%20News%20Men%27s%20College%20Basketball%20Player%20of%20the%20Year">"Sporting News"</a> (all 1997). In 2002, Duncan was named to the <a href="ACC%2050th%20Anniversary%20men%27s%20basketball%20team">ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team</a> honoring the 50 greatest players in ACC history. In his debut year in the NBA (1998), he was voted Rookie of the Year and elected into the <a href="NBA%20All-Rookie%20Team">All-Rookie Team</a>. He has been named to 15 NBA All-Star Teams (1997–98; 1999–2000 to 2010–11; 2012–13 and 2014–15), 15 All-NBA Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10, 2012–13, 2014–15; ten First Team nominations), and 15 All-Defensive Teams (1997–98 to 2009–10; 2012–13, 2014–15; eight First Team nominations). With these impressive performances, Duncan is one of only four players to receive All-NBA First Team honors in each of his first eight seasons (1998–2005), along with Hall of Famers <a href="Bob%20Pettit">Bob Pettit</a> (ten seasons), <a href="Larry%20Bird">Larry Bird</a> (nine seasons), and <a href="Oscar%20Robertson">Oscar Robertson</a> (nine seasons), and is the only player in NBA history to receive All-NBA and All-Defensive honors in his first 13 seasons (1997–98 to 2009–10).

Duncan was also named by the Association for Professional Basketball Research as one of "100 Greatest Professional Basketball Players of The 20th Century", the youngest player on that list. In the 2001–02 season, he won the <a href="IBM">IBM</a> Player Award and "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>" (TSN) MVP Award, becoming the third player to ever win the NBA MVP, IBM Player and TSN Player Awards in the same season. On February 18, 2006, he was named one of the "Next 10 Greatest Players" on the tenth anniversary of the release of the <a href="NBA%27s%2050th%20Anniversary%20All-Time%20Team">NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team</a> by the <a href="Turner%20Network%20Television">TNT</a> broadcasting crew. In 2009, Duncan was ranked 8th by "<a href="Slam%20Magazine">Slam Magazine</a>" in their list of the Top 50 NBA players of All Time, while "Sports Illustrated" named him its <a href="List%20of%202009%20all-decade%20Sports%20Illustrated%20awards%20and%20honors%23National%20Basketball%20Association">NBA Player of the Decade</a>.

In 2013, Duncan opened BlackJack Speed Shop in <a href="San%20Antonio%2C%20Texas">San Antonio, Texas</a>, located near the San Antonio Spurs practice facility. 

A press release noted that BlackJack is “a car and truck customization shop featuring a 4,000 square foot showroom and an 8,000 square foot shop with 10 bays. The business is a one-stop shop that provides everything from wheels and tires to performance upgrades to lift kits to complete rebuilds." The shop has reportedly worked on the vehicles of many Spurs players and employees. A second location was opened north of San Antonio, in <a href="Schertz%2C%20Texas">Schertz, Texas</a>.

In August 2017, BlackJack Speed Shop, in partnership with The Tim Duncan Foundation, organized urgently needed supplies for victims of <a href="Hurricane%20Harvey">Hurricane Harvey</a>.

Duncan has two older sisters, Cheryl and <a href="Tricia%20Duncan">Tricia</a>, and one older brother, Scott. Like their younger brother, they were talented athletes: Cheryl was a champion swimmer before she became a nurse, and Tricia swam <a href="Virgin%20Islands%20at%20the%201988%20Summer%20Olympics">for the U.S. Virgin Islands</a> at the <a href="1988%20Summer%20Olympics">1988 Summer Olympics</a> in <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a>.

In college, Duncan co-authored a chapter in the social psychology book "Aversive Interpersonal Behaviors".

Duncan married Amy Sherrill in July 2001 and the couple had their first child, daughter Sydney, in the summer of 2005. They had a second child, son Draven, in the summer of 2007. It was reported that the Duncans were divorcing in May 2013, but the divorce was not finalized until November 23, 2013. In 2017, Duncan and longtime girlfriend Vanessa Macias welcomed a child, Quill Duncan.

The Tim Duncan Foundation was established to serve the areas of health awareness and research, education, and youth sports and recreation in San Antonio, <a href="Winston-Salem">Winston-Salem</a>, and the United States Virgin Islands. The foundation's major events have included the Tim Duncan Bowling for Dollar$ Charity Bowl-A-Thon and the Slam Duncan Charity Golf Classic. Between 2001 and 2002, the foundation raised more than $350,000 for breast and <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> research. In those two years, Duncan was named by "<a href="Sporting%20News">Sporting News</a>" as one of the "Good Guys" in sports. The Spurs captain also supports the Children's Bereavement Center, the Children's Center of San Antonio and the Cancer Therapy and Research Center.

Duncan cites his late mother as his main inspiration. Among other things, she taught him and his sisters the nursery rhyme "Good, Better, Best. Never let it rest / Until your Good is Better, and your Better is your Best," which he adopted as his personal motto. On and off the court, he believes that the three most important values are dedication, teamwork and camaraderie. The Spurs captain has also stated that he chose #21 for his jersey because that was his brother-in-law's college number, since he was Duncan's main basketball inspiration, and cites Hall-of-Fame <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Lakers">Los Angeles Lakers</a> point guard <a href="Magic%20Johnson">Magic Johnson</a> as his childhood idol.

Duncan was honored with the Virgin Islands Medal of Honor, the highest award bestowed by the Virgin Islands territorial government, and has been celebrated in several "Tim Duncan Day" ceremonies. In 2000, <a href="Legislature%20of%20the%20Virgin%20Islands">Legislature of the Virgin Islands</a> President <a href="Vargrave%20Richards">Vargrave Richards</a> said, "He is a quiet giant. His laid-back attitude is the embodiment of the people of St. Croix, doing things without fanfare and hoopla."

Duncan enjoys <a href="Renaissance%20fair">Renaissance fair</a>s and the fantasy <a href="role%20playing%20game">role playing game</a> "<a href="Dungeons%20%26amp%3B%20Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a>". An avid <a href="video%20game">video game</a> player, he acknowledges a certain joy of playing "himself" in basketball video games. 

In 2015, Duncan sued his former investment advisor, claiming over $20 million in losses. In September 2016, a federal grand jury indicted the adviser on two counts of wire fraud related to the case. In April 2017, the adviser pled guilty to wire fraud in the case; in June 2018, he reached a settlement and received $7.5 million.

Las Meninas

Las Meninas (; <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a> for "The Ladies-in-waiting") is a 1656 painting in the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a> in <a href="Madrid">Madrid</a>, by <a href="Diego%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">Diego Velázquez</a>, the leading artist of the <a href="Spanish%20Golden%20Age">Spanish Golden Age</a>. Its complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, "Las Meninas" has been one of the most widely analyzed works in <a href="Western%20painting">Western painting</a>.

The painting shows a large room in the <a href="Royal%20Alcazar%20of%20Madrid">Royal Alcazar of Madrid</a> during the reign of King <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV of Spain</a>, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a <a href="snapshot%20%28photography%29">snapshot</a>. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young <a href="Margaret%20Theresa%20of%20Spain">Infanta Margaret Theresa</a> is surrounded by her entourage of <a href="Maid%20of%20honour">maids of honour</a>, <a href="Chaperone%20%28social%29">chaperone</a>, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.

"Las Meninas" has long been recognised as one of the most important paintings in <a href="Western%20art%20history">Western art history</a>. The <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> painter <a href="Luca%20Giordano">Luca Giordano</a> said that it represents the "theology of painting" and in 1827 the president of the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> <a href="Thomas%20Lawrence">Sir Thomas Lawrence</a> described the work in a letter to his successor <a href="David%20Wilkie%20%28artist%29">David Wilkie</a> as "the true philosophy of the art". More recently, it has been described as "Velázquez's supreme achievement, a highly self-conscious, calculated demonstration of what painting could achieve, and perhaps the most searching comment ever made on the possibilities of the easel painting".

In 17th-century Spain, painters rarely enjoyed high social status. Painting was regarded as a craft, not an art such as poetry or music. Nonetheless, Velázquez worked his way up through the ranks of the court of <a href="Philip%20IV%20of%20Spain">Philip IV</a>, and in February 1651 was appointed <a href="Chamberlain%20%28office%29">palace chamberlain</a> ("aposentador mayor del palacio"). The post brought him status and material reward, but its duties made heavy demands on his time. During the remaining eight years of his life, he painted only a few works, mostly portraits of the royal family. When he painted "Las Meninas", he had been with the royal household for 33 years.

Philip IV's first wife, <a href="Elisabeth%20of%20France%20%281602%E2%80%931644%29">Elizabeth of France</a>, died in 1644; and their only son, <a href="Balthasar%20Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Asturias">Balthasar Charles</a>, died two years later. Lacking an heir, Philip married <a href="Mariana%20of%20Austria">Mariana of Austria</a> in 1649, and Margaret Theresa (1651–1673) was their first child, and their only one at the time of the painting. Subsequently, she had a short-lived brother <a href="Philip%20Prospero%2C%20Prince%20of%20Asturias">Philip Prospero</a> (1657–1661), and then <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20Spain">Charles</a> (1661–1700) arrived, who succeeded to the throne as Charles II at the age of three. Velázquez painted portraits of Mariana and her children, and although Philip himself resisted being portrayed in his old age he did allow Velázquez to include him in "Las Meninas". In the early 1650s he gave Velázquez the Pieza Principal ("main room") of the late Balthasar Charles's living quarters, by then serving as the palace museum, to use as his studio. It is here that "Las Meninas" is set. Philip had his own chair in the studio and would often sit and watch Velázquez at work. Although constrained by rigid etiquette, the art-loving king seems to have had a close relationship with the painter. After Velázquez's death, Philip wrote "I am crushed" in the margin of a memorandum on the choice of his successor.

During the 1640s and 1650s, Velázquez served as both court painter and <a href="curator">curator</a> of Philip IV's expanding collection of European art. He seems to have been given an unusual degree of freedom in the role. He supervised the decoration and interior design of the rooms holding the most valued paintings, adding mirrors, statues and tapestries. He was also responsible for the sourcing, attribution, hanging and inventory of many of the Spanish king's paintings. By the early 1650s, Velázquez was widely respected in Spain as a connoisseur. Much of the collection of the Prado today—including works by <a href="Titian">Titian</a>, <a href="Raphael">Raphael</a>, and <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Rubens</a>—were acquired and assembled under Velázquez's curatorship.

The painting was referred to in the earliest inventories as "La Familia" ("The Family"). A detailed description of "Las Meninas", which provides the identification of several of the figures, was published by <a href="Antonio%20Palomino">Antonio Palomino</a> ("the <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Giorgio Vasari</a> of the Spanish Golden Age") in 1724. Examination under <a href="Infrared%23Art%20history">infrared</a> light reveals minor <a href="pentimento">pentimenti</a>, that is, there are traces of earlier working that the artist himself later altered. For example, at first Velázquez's own head inclined to his right rather than his left.

The painting has been cut down on both the left and right sides. It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter <a href="Juan%20Garc%C3%ADa%20de%20Miranda">Juan García de Miranda</a> (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as <a href="Maria%20Theresa%20of%20Spain">Maria Theresa</a>, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, "The Family of Philip IV", which was repeated in the records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as "Las Meninas".

In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the "meninas" have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the American conservator John Brealey, to remove a "yellow veil" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century. The cleaning provoked, according to the art historian <a href="Federico%20Zeri">Federico Zeri</a>, "furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different". However, in the opinion of López-Rey, the "restoration was impeccable". Due to its size, importance, and value, the painting is not lent out for exhibition.

A thorough technical investigation including a pigment analysis of "Las Meninas" was conducted around 1981 in Museo Prado. The analysis revealed the usual pigments of the baroque period frequently used by Velázquez in his other paintings. The main pigments used for this painting were <a href="lead%20white">lead white</a>, <a href="azurite">azurite</a> (for the skirt of the kneeling menina), <a href="vermilion">vermilion</a> and red lake, <a href="ochres">ochres</a> and carbon blacks.

"Las Meninas" is set in Velázquez's studio in Philip IV's <a href="Alc%C3%A1zar">Alcázar palace</a> in Madrid. The high-ceilinged room is presented, in the words of Silvio Gaggi, as "a simple box that could be divided into a perspective grid with a single vanishing point". In the centre of the foreground stands the <a href="Margaret%20Theresa%20of%20Spain">Infanta Margaret Theresa</a> (1). The five-year-old infanta, who later married <a href="Leopold%20I%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I</a>, was at this point Philip and Mariana's only surviving child. She is attended by two <a href="lady-in-waiting">ladies-in-waiting</a>, or "meninas": doña Isabel de Velasco (2), who is poised to curtsy to the princess, and doña <a href="Mar%C3%ADa%20Agustina%20Sarmiento%20de%20Sotomayor">María Agustina Sarmiento de Sotomayor</a> (3), who kneels before Margaret Theresa, offering her a drink from a red cup, or "búcaro", that she holds on a golden tray. To the right of the Infanta are two dwarfs: the <a href="achondroplasia">achondroplastic</a> German, Maribarbola (4) (<a href="Maria%20Barbola">Maria Barbola</a>), and the Italian, Nicolas Pertusato (5), who playfully tries to rouse a sleepy <a href="Spanish%20Mastiff">mastiff</a> with his foot. The dog is thought to be descended from two mastiffs from Lyme Hall in Cheshire, given to Phillip III in 1604 by James I of England. Behind them stands doña Marcela de Ulloa (6), the princess's chaperone, dressed in mourning and talking to an unidentified bodyguard (or "guardadamas") (7).
To the rear and at right stands Don <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Nieto%20Vel%C3%A1zquez">José Nieto Velázquez</a> (8)—the queen's chamberlain during the 1650s, and head of the royal <a href="tapestry">tapestry</a> works—who may have been a relative of the artist. Nieto is shown pausing, with his right knee bent and his feet on different steps. As the art critic Harriet Stone observes, it is uncertain whether he is "coming or going". He is rendered in silhouette and appears to hold open a curtain on a short flight of stairs, with an unclear wall or space behind. Both this backlight and the open doorway reveal space behind: in the words of the art historian <a href="Analisa%20Leppanen">Analisa Leppanen</a>, they lure "our eyes inescapably into the depths". The royal couple's reflection pushes in the opposite direction, forward into the picture space. The <a href="vanishing%20point">vanishing point</a> of the <a href="perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a> is in the doorway, as can be shown by extending the line of the meeting of wall and ceiling on the right. Nieto is seen only by the king and queen, who share the viewer's point of view, and not by the figures in the foreground. In the footnotes of Joel Snyder's article, the author recognizes that Nieto is the queen's attendant and was required to be at hand to open and close doors for her. Snyder suggests that Nieto appears in the doorway so that the king and queen might depart. In the context of the painting, Snyder argues that the scene is the end of the royal couple's sitting for Velázquez and they are preparing to exit, explaining that is "why the menina to the right of the Infanta begins to curtsy".

Velázquez himself (9) is pictured to the left of the scene, looking outward past a large canvas supported by an <a href="easel">easel</a>. On his chest is the red cross of the <a href="Order%20of%20Santiago">Order of Santiago</a>, which he did not receive until 1659, three years after the painting was completed. According to Palomino, Philip ordered this to be added after Velázquez's death, "and some say that his Majesty himself painted it". From the painter's belt hang the symbolic keys of his court offices.

A mirror on the back wall reflects the upper bodies and heads of two figures identified from other paintings, and by Palomino, as King Philip IV (10) and Queen Mariana (11). The most common assumption is that the reflection shows the couple in the pose they are holding for Velázquez as he paints them, while their daughter watches; and that the painting therefore shows their view of the scene.

Of the nine figures depicted, five are looking directly out at the royal couple or the viewer. Their glances, along with the king and queen's reflection, affirm the royal couple's presence outside the painted space. Alternatively, art historians <a href="H.%20W.%20Janson">H. W. Janson</a> and Joel Snyder suggest that the image of the king and queen is a reflection from Velázquez's canvas, the front of which is obscured from the viewer. Other writers say the canvas Velázquez is painting is unusually large for a portrait by Velázquez, and is about the same size as "Las Meninas". "Las Meninas" contains the only known double portrait of the royal couple painted by Velázquez.

The point of view of the picture is approximately that of the royal couple, though this has been widely debated. Many critics suppose that the scene is viewed by the king and queen as they pose for a double portrait, while the Infanta and her companions are present only to make the process more enjoyable. <a href="Ernst%20Gombrich">Ernst Gombrich</a> suggested that the picture might have been the sitters' idea:

The back wall of the room, which is in shadow, is hung with rows of paintings, including one of a series of scenes from <a href="Ovid">Ovid</a>'s "<a href="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a>" by <a href="Peter%20Paul%20Rubens">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, and copies, by Velázquez's son-in-law and principal assistant <a href="Juan%20Bautista%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20del%20Mazo">Juan del Mazo</a>, of works by <a href="Jacob%20Jordaens">Jacob Jordaens</a>. The paintings are shown in the exact positions recorded in an inventory taken around this time. The wall to the right is hung with a grid of eight smaller paintings, visible mainly as frames owing to their angle from the viewer. They can be identified from the inventory as more Mazo copies of paintings from the Rubens Ovid series, though only two of the subjects can be seen.

The paintings on the back wall are recognized as representing Minerva Punishing Arachne and Apollo's Victory Over Marsyas. Both stories involve Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom and patron of the arts. These two legends are both stories of mortals challenging gods and the dreadful consequences. One scholar points out that the legend dealing with two women, Minerva and Arachne, is on the same side of the mirror as the queen's reflection while the male legend is on the side of the king.

The painted surface is divided into quarters horizontally and sevenths vertically; this grid is used to organise the elaborate grouping of characters, and was a common device at the time. Velázquez presents nine figures—eleven if the king and queen's reflected images are included—yet they occupy only the lower half of the canvas.

According to López-Rey, the painting has three focal points: the Infanta Margaret Theresa, the self-portrait and the half-length reflected images of King Philip IV and Queen Mariana. In 1960, the art historian <a href="Kenneth%20Clark">Kenneth Clark</a> made the point that the success of the composition is a result first and foremost of the accurate handling of light and shade:
However, the focal point of the painting is widely debated. Leo Steinberg argues that the orthogonals in the work are intentionally disguised so that the picture's focal center shifts. Similar to Lopez-Rey, he describes three foci. The man in the doorway, however, is the vanishing point. More specifically, the crook of his arm is where the orthogonals of the windows and lights of the ceiling meet.

Depth and dimension are rendered by the use of linear perspective, by the overlapping of the layers of shapes, and in particular, as stated by Clark, through the use of tone. This compositional element operates within the picture in a number of ways. First, there is the appearance of natural light within the painted room and beyond it. The pictorial space in the midground and foreground is lit from two sources: by thin shafts of light from the open door, and by broad streams coming through the window to the right. The 20th-century <a href="French%20philosophy">French philosopher</a> and cultural critic <a href="Michel%20Foucault">Michel Foucault</a> observed that the light from the window illuminates both the studio foreground and the unrepresented area in front of it, in which the king, the queen, and the viewer are presumed to be situated. For <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ortega%20y%20Gasset">José Ortega y Gasset</a>, light divides the scene into three distinct parts, with foreground and background planes strongly illuminated, between which a darkened intermediate space includes silhouetted figures.

Velázquez uses this light not only to add volume and definition to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality does not make it a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from everything else in the picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.

Velázquez further emphasises the Infanta by his positioning and lighting of her maids of honour, whom he sets opposing one another: to left and right, before and behind the Infanta. The maid to the left faces the light, her brightly lit profile and sleeve creating a diagonal. Her opposite number creates a broader but less defined reflection of her attention, making a diagonal space between them, in which their charge stands protected.

A further internal diagonal passes through the space occupied by the Infanta. There is a similar connection between the female dwarf and the figure of Velázquez himself, both of whom look towards the viewer from similar angles, creating a visual tension. The face of Velázquez is dimly lit by light that is reflected, rather than direct. For this reason his features, though not as sharply defined, are more visible than those of the dwarf who is much nearer the light source. This appearance of a total face, full-on to the viewer, draws the attention, and its importance is marked, tonally, by the contrasting frame of dark hair, the light on the hand and brush, and the skilfully placed triangle of light on the artist's sleeve, pointing directly to the face.

From the figure of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the pictorial space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong tonal contrast right at the rear of the pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.

The mirror is a perfectly defined unbroken pale rectangle within a broad black rectangle. A clear geometric shape, like a lit face, draws the attention of the viewer more than a broken geometric shape such as the door, or a shadowed or oblique face such as that of the dwarf in the foreground or that of the man in the background. The viewer cannot distinguish the features of the king and queen, but in the opalescent sheen of the mirror's surface, the glowing ovals are plainly turned directly to the viewer. <a href="Jonathan%20Miller">Jonathan Miller</a> points out that apart from "adding suggestive gleams at the bevelled edges, the most important way the mirror betrays its identity is by disclosing imagery whose brightness is so inconsistent with the dimness of the surrounding wall that it can only have been borrowed, by reflection, from the strongly illuminated figures of the King and Queen".

As the maids of honour are reflected in each other, so too do the king and queen have their doubles within the painting, in the dimly lit forms of the chaperone and guard, the two who serve and care for their daughter. The positioning of these figures sets up a pattern, one man, a couple, one man, a couple, and while the outer figures are nearer the viewer than the others, they all occupy the same horizontal band on the picture's surface.

Adding to the inner complexities of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of the figure in the background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him forward of the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.

Despite certain spatial ambiguities this is the painter's most thoroughly rendered architectural space, and the only one in which a ceiling is shown. According to López-Rey, in no other composition did Velázquez so dramatically lead the eye to areas beyond the viewer's sight: both the canvas he is seen painting, and the space beyond the frame where the king and queen stand can only be imagined. The bareness of the dark ceiling, the back of Velázquez's canvas, and the strict geometry of framed paintings contrast with the animated, brilliantly lit and sumptuously painted foreground entourage. Stone writes:
According to Kahr, the composition could have been influenced by the traditional Dutch Gallery Pictures such as those by <a href="Frans%20Francken%20the%20Younger">Frans Francken the Younger</a>, <a href="Willem%20van%20Haecht">Willem van Haecht</a>, or <a href="David%20Teniers%20the%20Younger">David Teniers the Younger</a>. Teniers' work was owned by Philip IV and would have been known by Velázquez. Like "Las Meninas", they often depict formal visits by important collectors or rulers, a common occurrence, and "show a room with a series of windows dominating one side wall and paintings hung between the windows as well as on the other walls". Gallery Portraits were also used to glorify the artist as well as royalty or members of the higher classes, as may have been Velázquez's intention with this work.

The spatial structure and positioning of the mirror's reflection are such that Philip IV and Mariana appear to be standing on the viewer's side of the pictorial space, facing the Infanta and her entourage. According to Janson, not only is the gathering of figures in the foreground for Philip and Mariana's benefit, but the painter's attention is concentrated on the couple, as he appears to be working on their portrait. Although they can only be seen in the mirror reflection, their distant image occupies a central position in the canvas, in terms of social hierarchy as well as composition. As spectators, our position in relation to the painting is uncertain. It has been debated whether the ruling couple are standing beside the viewer or have replaced the viewer, who sees the scene through their eyes. Lending weight to the latter idea are the gazes of three of the figures—Velázquez, the Infanta, and Maribarbola—who appear to be looking directly at the viewer.

The mirror on the back wall indicates what is not there: the king and queen, and in the words of Harriet Stone, "the generations of spectators who assume the couple's place before the painting". Writing in 1980, the critics Snyder and Cohn observed:

In "Las Meninas", the king and queen are supposedly "outside" the painting, yet their reflection in the back wall mirror also places them "inside" the pictorial space.

Snyder proposes it is "a mirror of majesty" or an allusion to the <a href="mirror%20for%20princes">mirror for princes</a>. While it is a literal reflection of the king and queen, Snyder writes "it is the image of exemplary monarchs, a reflection of ideal character" Later he focuses his attention on the princess, writing that Velázquez's portrait is "the painted equivalent of a manual for the education of the princess—a mirror of the princess" 

The painting is likely to have been influenced by <a href="Jan%20van%20Eyck">Jan van Eyck</a>'s "<a href="Arnolfini%20Portrait">Arnolfini Portrait</a>", of 1434. At the time, van Eyck's painting hung in Philip's palace, and would have been familiar to Velázquez. The "Arnolfini Portrait" also has a mirror positioned at the back of the pictorial space, reflecting two figures who would have the same angle of vision as does the viewer of Velázquez's painting; they are too small to identify, but it has been speculated that one may be intended as the artist himself, though he is not shown in the act of painting. According to Lucien Dällenbach:

Jonathan Miller asks: "What are we to make of the blurred features of the royal couple? It is unlikely that it has anything to do with the optical imperfection of the mirror, which would, in reality, have displayed a focused image of the King and Queen". He notes that "in addition to the "represented" mirror, he teasingly implies an unrepresented one, without which it is difficult to imagine how he could have shown himself painting the picture we now see".

The elusiveness of "Las Meninas", according to Dawson Carr, "suggests that art, and life, are an illusion". The relationship between illusion and reality were central concerns in Spanish culture during the 17th century, figuring largely in "<a href="Don%20Quixote">Don Quixote</a>", the best-known work of <a href="Spanish%20Baroque%20literature">Spanish Baroque literature</a>. In this respect, <a href="Pedro%20Calder%C3%B3n%20de%20la%20Barca">Calderón de la Barca's</a> play "Life is a Dream" is commonly seen as the literary equivalent of Velázquez's painting:

Jon Manchip White notes that the painting can be seen as a résumé of the whole of Velázquez's life and career, as well as a summary of his art to that point. He placed his only confirmed <a href="self-portrait">self-portrait</a> in a room in the royal palace surrounded by an assembly of royalty, <a href="courtier">courtier</a>s, and fine objects that represent his life at <a href="court%20%28royal%29">court</a>. The art historian <a href="Svetlana%20Alpers">Svetlana Alpers</a> suggests that, by portraying the artist at work in the company of royalty and nobility, Velázquez was claiming high status for both the artist and his art, and in particular to propose that painting is a <a href="liberal%20arts">liberal</a> rather than a mechanical art. This distinction was a point of controversy at the time. It would have been significant to Velázquez, since the rules of the Order of Santiago excluded those whose occupations were mechanical. Kahr asserts that this was the best way for Velázquez to show that he was "neither a craftsman or a tradesman, but an official of the court". Furthermore, this was a way to prove himself worthy of acceptance by the royal family.

Michel Foucault devoted the opening chapter of "<a href="The%20Order%20of%20Things">The Order of Things</a>" (1966) to an analysis of "Las Meninas". Foucault describes the painting in meticulous detail, but in a language that is "neither prescribed by, nor filtered through the various texts of art-historical investigation". Foucault viewed the painting without regard to the subject matter, nor to the artist's biography, technical ability, sources and influences, social context, or relationship with his patrons. Instead he analyses its conscious artifice, highlighting the complex network of visual relationships between painter, subject-model, and viewer:

For Foucault, "Las Meninas" illustrates the first signs of a new "<a href="episteme">episteme</a>", or way of thinking. It represents a midpoint between what he sees as the two "great discontinuities" in European thought, the classical and the modern: "Perhaps there exists, in this painting by Velázquez, the representation as it were of Classical representation, and the definition of the space it opens up to us ... representation, freed finally from the relation that was impeding it, can offer itself as representation in its pure form."

In the conclusion of "<a href="The%20Order%20of%20Things">The Order of Things</a>" Foucault explained why he undertook such a forensic analysis of "Las Meninas":

Foucault's analysis of "Las Meninas", although on one level a contribution to art history, is more about <a href="epistemology">epistemology</a>, specifically the 'cognitive status of the modern human sciences', based on the possibility, suggested by <a href="Ludwig%20Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>, that "a picture is a model of reality".

Many aspects of "Las Meninas" relate to earlier works by Velázquez in which he plays with conventions of representation. In the "<a href="Rokeby%20Venus">Rokeby Venus</a>"—his only surviving nude—the face of the subject is visible, blurred beyond any realism, in a mirror. The angle of the mirror is such that although "often described as looking at herself, [she] is more disconcertingly looking at us". In the early "<a href="Christ%20in%20the%20House%20of%20Martha%20and%20Mary%20%28Vel%C3%A1zquez%29">Christ in the House of Martha and Mary</a>" of 1618, Christ and his companions are seen only through a serving hatch to a room behind, according to the <a href="National%20Gallery">National Gallery</a> (London), who are clear that this is the intention, although before restoration many art historians regarded this scene as either a painting hanging on the wall in the main scene, or a reflection in a mirror, and the debate has continued. The dress worn in the two scenes also differs: the main scene is in contemporary dress, while the scene with Christ uses conventional iconographic biblical dress. This is also a feature of "<a href="The%20Triumph%20of%20Bacchus">Los Borrachos</a>" of 1629, where contemporary peasants consort with the god <a href="Dionysus">Bacchus</a> and his companions, who have the conventional undress of mythology. In this, as in some of his early "<a href="Bodeg%C3%B3n">bodegones</a>", the figures look directly at the viewer as if seeking a reaction.

In "<a href="Las%20Hilanderas%20%28Vel%C3%A1zquez%29">Las Hilanderas</a>", probably painted the year after "Las Meninas", two different scenes from Ovid are shown: one in contemporary dress in the foreground, and the other partly in antique dress, played before a tapestry on the back wall of a room behind the first. According to the critic Sira Dambe, "aspects of representation and power are addressed in this painting in ways closely connected with their treatment in "Las Meninas"". In a series of portraits of the late 1630s and 1640s—all now in the Prado—Velázquez painted clowns and other members of the royal household posing as gods, heroes, and philosophers; the intention is certainly partly comic, at least for those in the know, but in a highly ambiguous way.

Velázquez's portraits of the royal family themselves had until then been straightforward, if often unflatteringly direct and highly complex in expression. On the other hand, his royal portraits, designed to be seen across vast palace rooms, feature more strongly than his other works the bravura handling for which he is famous: "Velázquez's handling of paint is exceptionally free, and as one approaches "Las Meninas" there is a point at which the figures suddenly dissolve into smears and blobs of paint. The long-handled brushes he used enabled him to stand back and judge the total effect."

In 1692, the <a href="Naples">Neapolitan</a> painter <a href="Luca%20Giordano">Luca Giordano</a> became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by "Las Meninas". Giordano described the work as the "theology of painting", and was inspired to paint "A Homage to Velázquez" (<a href="National%20Gallery%2C%20London">National Gallery, London</a>). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of <a href="Italian%20art">Italian art</a> was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as "Las Meninas".

An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in "Las Meninas", which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of "The Family of the Artist" also shows a composition similar to that of "Las Meninas".

<a href="Francisco%20Goya">Francisco Goya</a> <a href="etching">etched</a> a <a href="old%20master%20print">print</a> of "Las Meninas" in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his "<a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20Spain%20and%20His%20Family">Charles IV of Spain and His Family</a>". As in "Las Meninas", the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of "Las Meninas" with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of "imminent suffocation". Goya's royal family is presented on a "stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim smile, points and says: 'Look at them and judge for yourself!' "
The 19th-century British art collector <a href="William%20John%20Bankes">William John Bankes</a> travelled to Spain during the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> (1808–1814) and acquired a copy of "Las Meninas" painted by Mazo, which he believed to be an original preparatory <a href="oil%20sketch">oil sketch</a> by Velázquez—although Velázquez did not usually paint studies. Bankes described his purchase as "the glory of my collection", noting that he had been "a long while in treaty for it and was obliged to pay a high price". The copy was admired throughout the 19th century in Britain, and is now in <a href="Kingston%20Lacy">Kingston Lacy</a>. Recently there have been suggestions that it might be by Velázquez after all (see below).

A new appreciation for Velázquez's less Italianate paintings developed after 1819, when <a href="Ferdinand%20VII%20of%20Spain">Ferdinand VII</a> opened the royal collection to the public. In 1879 <a href="John%20Singer%20Sargent">John Singer Sargent</a> painted a small-scale copy of "Las Meninas", and in 1882 painted a homage to the painting in his "<a href="The%20Daughters%20of%20Edward%20Darley%20Boit">The Daughters of Edward Darley Boit</a>", while the Irish artist <a href="John%20Lavery">Sir John Lavery</a> chose Velázquez's masterpiece as the basis for his portrait "The Royal Family at Buckingham Palace, 1913". <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George V</a> visited Lavery's studio during the execution of the painting, and, perhaps remembering the legend that Philip IV had daubed the cross of the Knights of Santiago on the figure of Velázquez, asked Lavery if he could contribute to the portrait with his own hand. According to Lavery, "Thinking that royal blue might be an appropriate colour, I mixed it on the palette, and taking a brush he [George V] applied it to the Garter ribbon."
Between August and December 1957, <a href="Pablo%20Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> painted a series of 58 interpretations of "Las Meninas", and figures from it, which currently fill the "<a href="Las%20Meninas%20%28Picasso%29">Las Meninas</a>" room of the <a href="Museu%20Picasso">Museu Picasso</a> in Barcelona, Spain. Picasso did not vary the characters within the series, but largely retained the naturalness of the scene; according to the museum, his works constitute an "exhaustive study of form, rhythm, colour and movement". A print of 1973 by <a href="Richard%20Hamilton%20%28artist%29">Richard Hamilton</a> called "Picasso's Meninas" draws on both Velázquez and Picasso. Photographer <a href="Joel-Peter%20Witkin">Joel-Peter Witkin</a> was commissioned by the <a href="Ministry%20of%20Culture%20%28Spain%29">Spanish Ministry of Culture</a> to create a work titled "Las Meninas, New Mexico" (1987) which references Velázquez's painting as well as other works by Spanish artists.

In 2004, the video artist <a href="Eve%20Sussman">Eve Sussman</a> filmed "89 Seconds at <a href="Alc%C3%A1zar">Alcázar</a>", a high-definition video tableau inspired by "Las Meninas". The work is a recreation of the moments leading up to and directly following the approximately 89 seconds when the royal family and their courtiers would have come together in the exact configuration of Velázquez's painting. Sussman had assembled a team of 35, including an architect, a set designer, a choreographer, a costume designer, actors, actresses, and a film crew.

A 2008 exhibition at the Museu Picasso called "Forgetting Velázquez: "Las Meninas"" included art responding to Velázquez's painting by
, <a href="Avigdor%20Arikha">Avigdor Arikha</a>, <a href="Claudio%20Bravo%20%28artist%29">Claudio Bravo</a>, <a href="Juan%20Carre%C3%B1o%20de%20Miranda">Juan Carreño de Miranda</a>,
<a href="Michael%20Craig-Martin">Michael Craig-Martin</a>, <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>, <a href="Juan%20Downey">Juan Downey</a>, Goya, Hamilton, Mazo, <a href="Vik%20Muniz">Vik Muniz</a>, <a href="Jorge%20Oteiza">Jorge Oteiza</a>, Picasso, <a href="Antonio%20Saura">Antonio Saura</a>, <a href="Franz%20von%20Stuck">Franz von Stuck</a>, Sussman, <a href="Manolo%20Vald%C3%A9s">Manolo Valdés</a>, and Witkin, among others. In 2009 the Museo del Prado launched a project facilitating access to "Las Meninas" in mega high resolution through the Internet.

In 2010 and 2011 <a href="Felix%20de%20la%20Concha">Felix de la Concha</a> created "Las Meninas Under An Artificial Light". It is a meticulous copy made in <a href="Iowa%20City">Iowa City</a>, painted in oil on 140 panels, which together reconstruct the actual size of the painting of 318 x 276 cm. To this 30 cm on its left side were added to reflect the loss to the original from the fire at the Alcazar in 1734. This provides a new reading to the composition. His work also highlights, with its fragmentation, the artificiality of reproduction as a way of seeing works of art today. "Las Meninas under an artificial light" has been on public display since 2018 at the NH Hotel in <a href="Zamora%2C%20Spain">Zamora, Spain</a>.

Bankes' smaller version of the painting is now in the country house of Kingston Lacy in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a>. Several experts, including the former Curator of the Department of Renaissance and Baroque Painting in the <a href="Museo%20del%20Prado">Museo del Prado</a> and current Director of the Moll Institute of Studies of Flemish Paintings, in Madrid, Professor Matías Díaz Padrón, suggest that this "could be a model" painted by <a href="Vel%C3%A1zquez">Velázquez</a> before the completed work which hangs in the Museo del Prado, perhaps to be approved by the king. Conflicting with this is the fact that the Kingston Lacy version represents the final state of "Las Meninas", not the earlier state of the painting revealed by radiographs, suggesting that it was painted after the completed work, not before it.

The usual attribution since the 19th century has been that the Kingston Lacy painting is a copy by <a href="Juan%20Bautista%20Mart%C3%ADnez%20del%20Mazo">Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo</a> (c. 1612-1667), son-in-law and close follower of Velázquez. The version is missing some of the final work's details and nuances such as the royal couple's reflection in the mirror. Its composition is almost identical to the original. Although its colours are lighter, the light is less strong. Pencil lines outlining the Infanta's face, eyes, and hair are also visible.

The Kingston Lacy painting was previously owned by <a href="Gaspar%20Melchor%20de%20Jovellanos">Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos</a> and then by <a href="Juan%20Agust%C3%ADn%20Ce%C3%A1n%20Berm%C3%BAdez">Ceán Bermúdez</a>, who were both friends of <a href="Goya">Goya</a> whose portraits he painted. Bermúdez's writings on the painting were published posthumously in 1885.

Emperor penguin

The emperor penguin ("Aptenodytes forsteri") is the tallest and heaviest of all living <a href="penguin">penguin</a> species and is <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. The male and female are similar in <a href="plumage">plumage</a> and size, reaching in height and weighing from . The dorsal side and head are black and sharply delineated from the white belly, pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches. Like all penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine <a href="habitat">habitat</a>.

The emperor's diet consists primarily of small <a href="fish">fish</a>, but also includes <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, such as <a href="krill">krill</a>, and <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, such as <a href="squid">squid</a>. While hunting, the species can remain submerged up to 18 minutes, diving to a depth of . It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an unusually structured <a href="Hemoglobin">haemoglobin</a> to allow it to function at low oxygen levels, solid bones to reduce <a href="barotrauma">barotrauma</a>, and the ability to reduce its <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a> and shut down non-essential organ functions.

The only penguin species that breeds during the Antarctic winter, emperor penguins trek over the ice to <a href="seabird%20colony">breeding colonies</a> which generally range from a few hundred to several thousand individuals. The female lays a single egg, which then is incubated for just over two months by the male while the female returns to the sea to feed; parents subsequently take turns foraging at sea and caring for their chick in the colony. The entire process is repeated annually. The typical lifespan of the emperor penguin is around 20 years in the wild, although observations suggest that some individuals may live considerably longer, up to 50 years of age.

Emperor penguins were first described in 1844 by English zoologist <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a>, who created the <a href="Genus">generic name</a> from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> word elements, ἀ-πτηνο-δύτης [a-ptēno-dytēs], "without-wings-diver". Its <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> is in honour of the German naturalist <a href="Johann%20Reinhold%20Forster">Johann Reinhold Forster</a>, who accompanied Captain <a href="James%20Cook">James Cook</a> on his <a href="Second%20voyage%20of%20James%20Cook">second voyage</a> and officially named five other penguin species. Forster may have been the first person to see the penguins in 1773–74, when he recorded a sighting of what he believed was the similar "A. patagonicus", or <a href="King%20penguin">King penguin</a>, but given the location, may very well have been "A. forsteri".

Together with the similarly coloured but smaller <a href="king%20penguin">king penguin</a> ("A. patagonicus"), the emperor penguin is one of two extant species in the genus "<a href="Aptenodytes">Aptenodytes</a>". <a href="Fossil">Fossil</a> evidence of a third species—<a href="Ridgen%27s%20penguin">Ridgen's penguin</a> ("A. ridgeni")—has been found in fossil records from the late <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a>, about three million years ago, in New Zealand. Studies of penguin behaviour and genetics have proposed that the genus "Aptenodytes" is <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a>; in other words, that it split off from a branch which led to all other living penguin species. <a href="Mitochondria">Mitochondria</a>l and <a href="Cell%20nucleus">nuclear</a> <a href="DNA">DNA</a> evidence suggests this split occurred around 40 million years ago.

Adult emperor penguins stand up to tall. The weight ranges from and varies by sex, with males <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">weighing more than</a> females. It is the fifth heaviest living bird species, after only the larger varieties of <a href="ratite">ratite</a>. The weight also varies by season, as both male and female penguins lose substantial mass while raising hatchlings and <a href="avian%20incubation">incubating</a> their egg. A male emperor penguin must withstand the extreme Antarctic winter cold for more than two months while protecting his egg. He consumes nothing during this entire time, except for occasionally water in the form of snow. Most male emperors will lose around while they wait for their eggs to hatch. The mean weight of males at the start of the breeding season is and that of females is . After the breeding season this drops to for both sexes.

Like all penguin species, emperor penguins have streamlined bodies to minimize drag while swimming, and wings that are more like stiff, flat flippers. The tongue is equipped with rear-facing barbs to prevent prey from escaping when caught. Males and females are similar in size and colouration. The adult has deep black <a href="Dorsum%20%28biology%29">dorsal</a> feathers, covering the head, chin, throat, back, dorsal part of the flippers, and tail. The black plumage is sharply delineated from the light-coloured plumage elsewhere. The underparts of the wings and belly are white, becoming pale yellow in the upper breast, while the ear patches are bright yellow. The upper mandible of the long bill is black, and the lower mandible can be pink, orange or lilac. In juveniles, the <a href="Ear">auricular</a> patches, chin and throat are white, while its bill is black. Emperor penguin chicks are typically covered with silver-grey <a href="down%20feather">down</a> and have black heads and white masks. A chick with all-white plumage was seen in 2001, but was not considered to be an <a href="Albinism%20in%20biology">albino</a> as it did not have pink eyes. Chicks weigh around after hatching, and <a href="fledge">fledge</a> when they reach about 50% of adult weight.

The emperor penguin's dark plumage fades to brown from November until February (the Antarctic summer), before the yearly <a href="moult">moult</a> in January and February. Moulting is rapid in this species compared with other birds, taking only around 34 days. Emperor penguin feathers emerge from the skin after they have grown to a third of their total length, and before old feathers are lost, to help reduce heat loss. New feathers then push out the old ones before finishing their growth.

The average yearly survival rate of an adult emperor penguin has been measured at 95.1%, with an average life expectancy of 19.9 years. The same researchers estimated that 1% of emperor penguins hatched could feasibly reach an age of around 50 years. In sharp contrast, only 19% of chicks survive their first year of life. Therefore, 80% of the emperor penguin population comprises adults five years and older.

As the species has no fixed nest sites that individuals can use to locate their own partner or chick, emperor penguins must rely on vocal calls alone for identification. They use a complex set of calls that are critical to individual recognition between parents, offspring and mates, displaying the widest variation in individual calls of all penguins. Vocalizing emperor penguins use two <a href="frequency%20band">frequency band</a>s simultaneously. Chicks use a frequency-modulated whistle to beg for food and to contact parents.

The emperor penguin breeds in the coldest environment of any bird species on earth; air temperatures may reach , and wind speeds may reach . Water temperature is a frigid , which is much lower than the emperor penguin's average body temperature of . The species has adapted in several ways to counteract heat loss. Dense feathers provide 80–90% of its insulation and it has a layer of sub-<a href="dermal">dermal</a> fat which may be up to thick before breeding. This resultant blubber layer impedes the mobility of emperor penguins on land compared to their less fat-insulated relatives, the <a href="King%20penguin">King penguin</a>s. While the density of contour feathers is approximately 9 per square centimetre (58 per square inch), a combination of dense afterfeathers and <a href="down%20feather">down feather</a>s (plumules) likely play a critical role for insulation. Muscles allow the feathers to be held erect on land, reducing heat loss by trapping a layer of air next to the skin. Conversely, the plumage is flattened in water, thus waterproofing the skin and the downy underlayer. Preening is vital in facilitating insulation and in keeping the plumage oily and water-repellent.

The emperor penguin is able to <a href="Thermoregulation">thermoregulate</a> (maintain its core body temperature) without altering its metabolism, over a wide range of temperatures. Known as the thermoneutral range, this extends from . Below this temperature range, its metabolic rate increases significantly, although an individual can maintain its <a href="core%20temperature">core temperature</a> from down to . Movement by swimming, walking, and shivering are three mechanisms for increasing metabolism; a fourth process involves an increase in the breakdown of fats by enzymes, which is induced by the hormone <a href="glucagon">glucagon</a>. At temperatures above , an emperor penguin may become agitated as its body temperature and metabolic rate rise to increase heat loss. Raising and flapping its wings (flippers) and exposing the undersides increases the exposure of its body surface to the air by 16%, facilitating further heat loss.

In addition to the cold, the emperor penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives—markedly increased pressure of up to 40 times that of the surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause <a href="barotrauma">barotrauma</a>. The bones of the penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma.

While diving, the emperor penguin's oxygen use is markedly reduced, as its heart rate is reduced to as low as 15–20 beats per minute and non-essential organs are shut down, thus facilitating longer dives. Its <a href="haemoglobin">haemoglobin</a> and <a href="myoglobin">myoglobin</a> are able to bind and transport oxygen at low blood concentrations; this allows the bird to function with very low oxygen levels that would otherwise result in loss of consciousness.

The emperor penguin has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic almost exclusively between the <a href="66th%20parallel%20south">66°</a> and <a href="77th%20parallel%20south">77°</a> south latitudes. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to offshore. Breeding colonies are usually in areas where ice cliffs and icebergs provide some protection from the wind. Three land colonies have been reported: one (now disappeared) on a shingle spit at the <a href="Dion%20Islands">Dion Islands</a> on the <a href="Antarctic%20Peninsula">Antarctic Peninsula</a>, one on a headland at <a href="Taylor%20Glacier">Taylor Glacier</a> in <a href="Victoria%20Land">Victoria Land</a>, and most recently one at <a href="Amundsen%20Bay">Amundsen Bay</a>. Since 2009, a number of colonies have been reported on <a href="shelf%20ice">shelf ice</a> rather than sea ice, in some cases moving to the shelf in years when sea ice forms late.

The northernmost breeding population is on <a href="Snow%20Island%20%28South%20Shetland%20Islands%29">Snow Island</a>, near the northern tip of the Peninsula. Individual vagrants have been seen on <a href="Heard%20Island%20and%20McDonald%20Islands">Heard Island</a>, <a href="South%20Georgia%20and%20the%20South%20Sandwich%20Islands">South Georgia</a>, and occasionally in New Zealand.

The total population was estimated in 2009 to be at around 595,000 adult birds, in 46 known colonies spread around the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic; around 35% of the known population lives north of the <a href="Antarctic%20Circle">Antarctic Circle</a>. Major breeding colonies were located at <a href="Cape%20Washington">Cape Washington</a>, <a href="Coulman%20Island">Coulman Island</a> in <a href="Victoria%20Land">Victoria Land</a>, <a href="Halley%20Research%20Station">Halley</a>, <a href="Cape%20Colbeck">Cape Colbeck</a>, and <a href="Dibble%20Glacier">Dibble Glacier</a>. Colonies are known to fluctuate over time, often breaking into "suburbs" which move apart from the parent group, and some have been known to disappear entirely. The <a href="Cape%20Crozier">Cape Crozier</a> colony on the <a href="Ross%20Sea">Ross Sea</a> shrank drastically between the first visits by the <a href="Discovery%20Expedition">"Discovery" Expedition</a> in 1902–03 and the later visits by the <a href="Terra%20Nova%20Expedition">"Terra Nova" Expedition</a> in 1910–11; it was reduced to a few hundred birds, and may have come close to extinction due to changes in the position of the ice shelf. By the 1960s it had rebounded dramatically, but by 2009 was again reduced to a small population of around 300.

In 2012 the emperor penguin was uplisted from a species of <a href="least%20concern">least concern</a> to <a href="near%20threatened">near threatened</a> by the <a href="World%20Conservation%20Union">IUCN</a>. Along with nine other species of penguin, it is currently under consideration for inclusion under the US <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. The primary causes for an increased risk of species endangerment are declining food availability, due to the <a href="effects%20of%20global%20warming">effects of climate change</a> and industrial fisheries on the crustacean and fish populations. Other reasons for the species's placement on the Endangered Species Act's list include disease, <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>, and disturbance at breeding colonies by humans. Of particular concern is the impact of tourism. One study concluded that emperor penguin chicks in a crèche become more apprehensive following a helicopter approach to .

Population declines of 50% in the <a href="Ad%C3%A9lie%20Land">Terre Adélie</a> region have been observed due to an increased death rate among adult birds, especially males, during an abnormally prolonged warm period in the late 1970s, which resulted in reduced sea-ice coverage. On the other hand, egg hatching success rates declined when the sea-ice extent increased; chick deaths also increased; The species is therefore considered to be highly sensitive to climatic changes. In 2009, the Dion Islands colony, which had been extensively studied since 1948, was reported to have completely disappeared at some point over the previous decade, the fate of the birds unknown. This was the first confirmed loss of an entire colony.

A <a href="Woods%20Hole%20Oceanographic%20Institution">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a> study in January 2009 found that emperor penguins could be pushed to the brink of extinction by the year 2100 due to global climate change. The study constructed a mathematical model to predict how the loss of sea ice from climate warming would affect a big colony of emperor penguins at <a href="Terre%20Ad%C3%A9lie">Terre Adélie</a>, <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. The study forecasted an 87% decline in the colony's population, from three thousand breeding pairs in 2009 to four hundred breeding pairs in 2100.

In June 2014 a study by the <a href="Woods%20Hole%20Oceanographic%20Institution">Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution</a> concluded that emperor penguins are at risk from global warming, which is melting the sea ice. This study predicted that by 2100 all 45 colonies of emperor penguins will be declining in numbers, mostly due to loss of habitat. Loss of ice reduces the supply of <a href="krill">krill</a>, which is a primary food for emperor penguins.

The emperor penguin is a <a href="social%20animal">social animal</a> in its nesting and its foraging behaviour; birds hunting together may coordinate their diving and surfacing. Individuals may be active day or night. A mature adult travels throughout most of the year between the breeding colony and ocean foraging areas; the species disperses into the oceans from January to March.

The American <a href="physiology">physiologist</a> Gerry Kooyman revolutionized the study of penguin foraging behaviour in 1971 when he published his results from attaching automatic dive-recording devices to emperor penguins. He found that the species reaches depths of , with dive periods of up to 18 minutes. Later research revealed a small female had dived to a depth of near <a href="McMurdo%20Sound">McMurdo Sound</a>. It is possible that emperor penguins can dive even deeper, as the accuracy of the recording devices is diminished at greater depths. Further study of one bird's diving behaviour revealed regular dives to in water around deep, and shallow dives of less than , interspersed with deep dives of more than in depths of . This was suggestive of feeding near or at the sea bottom.

Both male and female emperor penguins forage for food up to from colonies while collecting food to feed chicks, covering per individual per trip. A male returning to the sea after incubation heads directly out to areas of permanent open water, known as <a href="polynya">polynya</a>s, around from the colony.

An efficient swimmer, the emperor penguin exerts pressure with both its upward and downward strokes while swimming. The upward stroke works against buoyancy and helps maintain depth. Its average swimming speed is . On land, the emperor penguin alternates between walking with a wobbling gait and tobogganing—sliding over the ice on its belly, propelled by its feet and wing-like flippers. Like all penguins, it is flightless. The emperor penguin is a very powerful bird. In one case, a crew of six men, trying to capture a single male penguin for a zoo collection, were repeatedly tossed around and knocked over before all of the men had to collectively tackle the bird, which weighs about half as much as a man.

As a defence against the cold, a colony of emperor penguins forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) ranging in size from ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the <a href="wind%20chill">wind chill</a> is the least severe in the center of the colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.

The emperor penguin's predators include birds and aquatic mammals. <a href="Southern%20giant%20petrel">Southern giant petrel</a>s ("Macronectes giganteus") are the predominant land predator of chicks, responsible for over one-third of chick deaths in some colonies though they often scavenge dead penguins as well. The <a href="south%20polar%20skua">south polar skua</a> ("Stercorarius maccormicki") mainly scavenges for dead chicks, as the live chicks are usually too large to be attacked by the time of its annual arrival in the colony. Occasionally, a parent may attempt to defend its chick from attack, although it may be more passive if the chick is weak or sickly.

The only known predators thought to attack healthy adults, and who attack emperor penguins in the water, are both mammals. The first is the <a href="leopard%20seal">leopard seal</a> ("Hydrurga leptonyx"), which takes adult birds and fledglings soon after they enter the water. <a href="Orca">Orca</a>s ("Orcinus orca"), mostly take adult birds, although they will attack penguins of any age in or near water.

Although Emperor penguins can breed at around three years of age, they usually begin courtship and breeding at around five to six years. The yearly reproductive cycle begins at the start of the Antarctic winter, in March and April, when all mature emperor penguins travel to colonial nesting areas, often walking inland from the edge of the pack ice. The start of travel appears to be triggered by decreasing day lengths; emperor penguins in captivity have been induced successfully into breeding by using artificial lighting systems mimicking seasonal Antarctic day lengths.
The penguins start <a href="courtship">courtship</a> in March or April, when the temperature can be as low as . A lone male gives an ecstatic display, where it stands still and places its head on its chest before inhaling and giving a courtship call for 1–2 seconds; it then moves around the colony and repeats the call. A male and female then stand face to face, with one extending its head and neck up and the other mirroring it; they both hold this posture for several minutes. Once in pairs, couples waddle around the colony together, with the female usually following the male. Before <a href="animal%20sexual%20behavior">copulation</a>, one bird bows deeply to its mate, its bill pointed close to the ground, and its mate then does the same.

Contrary to popular belief, emperor penguins do not mate for life. They are <a href="serial%20monogamy">serially monogamous</a>, having only one mate each year, and remain faithful to that mate. However, fidelity between years is only around 15%. The narrow window of opportunity available for mating appears to be an influence, as there is a priority to mate and breed which usually precludes waiting for the previous year's partner to arrive at the colony.
The female penguin lays one <a href="egg">egg</a> in May or early June; it is vaguely pear-shaped, pale greenish-white, and measures around . It represents just 2.3% of its mother's body weight, making it one of the smallest eggs relative to the maternal weight in any bird species. 15.7% of the weight of an emperor penguin egg is shell; like those of other penguin species, the shell is relatively thick, which helps minimize risk of breakage.

After laying, the mother's food reserves are exhausted and she very carefully transfers the egg to the male, and then immediately returns to the sea for two months to feed. The transfer of the egg can be awkward and difficult, especially for first-time parents, and many couples drop or crack the egg in the process. When this happens, the chick inside is quickly lost, as the egg cannot withstand the freezing temperatures on the icy ground for more than one to two minutes. The male spends the dark, stormy winter <a href="avian%20incubation">incubating</a> the egg in his brood pouch, balancing it on the tops of his feet, for around 65-75 consecutive days until hatching. The emperor penguin is the only species where this behaviour is observed; in all other penguin species both parents take shifts incubating. By the time the egg hatches, the male will have fasted for around 120 days since arriving at the colony. To survive the cold and winds of up to , the males huddle together, taking turns in the middle of the huddle. They have also been observed with their backs to the wind to conserve body heat. In the four months of travel, courtship, and incubation, the male may lose as much as , from a total mass of .

Hatching may take as long as two or three days to complete, as the shell of the egg is thick. Newly hatched chicks are <a href="altricial">semi-altricial</a>, covered with only a thin layer of down and entirely dependent on their parents for food and warmth. The chick usually hatches before the mother's return, and the father feeds it a curd-like substance composed of 59% <a href="protein">protein</a> and 28% <a href="lipid">lipid</a>, which is produced by a gland in his <a href="oesophagus">oesophagus</a>. This ability to produce a sort of "milk" in birds is only found in pigeons, flamingos and male Emperor penguins. The young chick is <a href="offspring">brooded</a> in what is called the "guard phase", spending time balanced on its parent's feet and sheltered in the brood pouch.
The female penguin returns at any time from hatching to around ten days afterwards, from mid-July to early August. She finds her mate among the hundreds of fathers by his vocal call and takes over caring for the chick, feeding it by regurgitating the food that she has stored in her stomach. The male is often reluctant to surrender the chick he has been caring for to its mother, but he soon leaves to take his turn at sea, spending 3 to 4 weeks feeding there before returning. The parents then take turns, one <a href="offspring">brooding</a> while the other forages at sea. If either parent is delayed or fails to return to the colony, the lone parent will return to the sea to feed, leaving the chick to die. Abandoned eggs do not hatch and orphaned chicks never survive.

Female emperors who failed to find a mate to breed with, or have lost their own chick may attempt to steal the chick of another female. The mother of the chick and neighboring females will fight to protect the chick or reclaim it, if it has been successfully stolen. These scuffles involving several birds often result in the chick being smothered or trampled to death. Adopted chicks are quickly abandoned once again, as the female is unable to feed and care for the chick alone. The orphans wander around the colony attempting to seek food and protection from other adults. They will even try to seek shelter in an adult bird's brood pouch already occupied by their own chick. The orphaned chicks are brusquely driven away and will rapidly die of starvation, or freeze to death.
Many chicks are crushed or trampled by adult birds while amassed in the huddle during storms.

About 45–50 days after hatching, the chicks form a <a href="cr%C3%A8che%20%28zoology%29">crèche</a>, huddling together for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically to feed their chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand chicks densely packed together and is essential for surviving the fierce winds and low Antarctic temperatures.

From early November, chicks begin moulting into juvenile plumage, which takes up to two months and is often not completed when they leave the colony; adults cease feeding them during this time. All birds make the considerably shorter trek to the sea in December or January and spend the rest of the summer feeding there.

The emperor penguin's diet consists mainly of fish, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, although its composition varies from population to population. Fish are usually the most important food source, and the <a href="Antarctic%20silverfish">Antarctic silverfish</a> ("Pleuragramma antarcticum") makes up the bulk of the bird's diet. Other prey commonly recorded include other fish of the family <a href="Nototheniidae">Nototheniidae</a>, the <a href="glacial%20squid">glacial squid</a> ("Psychroteuthis glacialis"), and the <a href="hooked%20squid">hooked squid</a> species "<a href="Kondakovia%20longimana">Kondakovia longimana</a>", as well as <a href="Antarctic%20krill">Antarctic krill</a> ("Euphausia superba"). The emperor penguin searches for prey in the open water of the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>, in either ice-free areas of open water or tidal cracks in pack ice. One of its feeding strategies is to dive to around , where it can easily spot <a href="sympagic">sympagic</a> fish like the <a href="bald%20notothen">bald notothen</a> ("Pagothenia borchgrevinki") swimming against the bottom surface of the sea-ice; it swims up to the bottom of the ice and catches the fish. It then dives again and repeats the sequence about half a dozen times before surfacing to <a href="breath">breath</a>e.

Since the 1930s, there have been several attempts at keeping emperor penguins in captivity, but until the 1960s these attempts were unsuccessful, as knowledge of penguin keeping in general was limited and acquired by trial and error. The first to achieve a level of success was <a href="Aalborg%20Zoo">Aalborg Zoo</a> where a chilled house was built especially for this Antarctic species. One individual lived for 20 years at the zoo and a chick was hatched there, but died shortly after.

Today, the species is kept at just a few zoos and public aquariums in North America and Asia. Emperor penguins were first successfully bred at <a href="SeaWorld%20San%20Diego">SeaWorld San Diego</a>; more than 20 birds have hatched there since 1980. Considered a <a href="flagship%20species">flagship species</a>, 55 individuals were counted in captivity in North American zoos and aquaria in 1999. In China, the emperor penguin was first bred at <a href="Nanjing%20Underwater%20World">Nanjing Underwater World</a> in 2009, followed by Laohutan Ocean Park in <a href="Dalian">Dalian</a> in 2010. Since then it has been kept and bred at a few other facilities in China, and the only confirmed twin emperor penguins (the species normally lays just one egg) hatched at Sun Asia Ocean World in Dalian in 2017. In Japan, the species is housed at <a href="Port%20of%20Nagoya%20Public%20Aquarium">Port of Nagoya Public Aquarium</a> and Wakayama Adventure World, with successful hatching at Wakayama.

In June 2011, a juvenile emperor penguin was found on the beach at <a href="Peka%20Peka">Peka Peka</a>, north of <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a> in New Zealand. He had consumed of sand, which he had apparently mistaken for snow, as well as sticks and stones, and had to undergo a number of operations to remove these to save his life. Following recovery, on 4 September, the juvenile, named "Happy Feet" (after the <a href="Happy%20Feet">2006 film</a>), was fitted with a tracking device and released into the Southern Ocean north of <a href="Campbell%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Campbell Island</a>. However, 8 days later scientists lost contact with the bird, suggesting that the transmitter had fallen off (considered likely) or that he had been eaten by a predator (considered less likely).

The species' unique life cycle in such a harsh environment has been described in print and visual media. <a href="Apsley%20Cherry-Garrard">Apsley Cherry-Garrard</a>, the Antarctic explorer, wrote in 1922: "Take it all in all, I do not believe anybody on Earth has a worse time than an emperor penguin". Widely distributed in cinemas in 2005, the French documentary "La Marche de l'empereur", which was also released with the English title "<a href="March%20of%20the%20Penguins">March of the Penguins</a>", told the story of the penguins' reproductive cycle. The subject has been covered for the small screen five times by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and presenter <a href="David%20Attenborough">David Attenborough</a>: first in episode five of the 1993 series on the Antarctic "<a href="Life%20in%20the%20Freezer">Life in the Freezer</a>", again in the 2001 series "<a href="The%20Blue%20Planet">The Blue Planet</a>", once again in the 2006 series "<a href="Planet%20Earth%20%282006%20TV%20series%29">Planet Earth</a>", in "<a href="Frozen%20Planet">Frozen Planet</a>" in 2011 and a one-hour programme dedicated to the species in the 2018 series <a href="Dynasties%20%282018%20TV%20series%29">Dynasties</a>.

The computer-animated movie "<a href="Happy%20Feet">Happy Feet</a>" (2006) features emperor penguins as its primary characters, with one in particular that loves to dance; although a comedy, it too depicts their life cycle and promotes an underlying serious environmental message of threats from global warming and depletion of food sources by overfishing. The computer-animated movie "<a href="Surf%27s%20Up%20%28film%29">Surf's Up</a>" (2007) features a surfing emperor penguin named Zeke "Big-Z" Topanga. More than 30 countries have depicted the bird on their stamps – Australia, Great Britain, Chile and France have each issued several. It has also been depicted on a 1962 10 <a href="Belgian%20franc">franc</a> stamp as part of an Antarctic expedition series. Canadian band <a href="The%20Tragically%20Hip">The Tragically Hip</a> composed the song "Emperor Penguin" for their 1998 album "<a href="Phantom%20Power%20%28The%20Tragically%20Hip%20album%29">Phantom Power</a>".

George Mason

George Mason IV (October 7, 1792) was an American planter, politician and delegate to the <a href="U.S.%20Constitutional%20Convention">U.S. Constitutional Convention</a> of 1787, one of three delegates who refused to sign the <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States">Constitution</a>. His writings, including substantial portions of the <a href="Fairfax%20Resolves">Fairfax Resolves</a> of 1774, the <a href="Virginia%20Declaration%20of%20Rights">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a> of 1776, and his "Objections to this Constitution of Government" (1787) in opposition to ratification, have exercised a significant influence on American political thought and events. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, which Mason principally authored, served as a basis for the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">United States Bill of Rights</a>, of which he has been deemed the father.

Mason was born in 1725, most likely in what is now <a href="Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax County, Virginia</a>. <a href="George%20Mason%20III">His father</a> died when he was young, and his mother managed the family estates until he came of age. He married in 1750, built <a href="Gunston%20Hall">Gunston Hall</a>, and lived the life of a <a href="Squire%23Village%20leader">country squire</a>, supervising his lands, family, and <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20colonial%20United%20States">slaves</a>. He briefly served in the <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> and involved himself in community affairs, sometimes serving with his neighbor <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>. As tensions grew between <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">Britain</a> and the American colonies, Mason came to support the colonial side, and used his knowledge and experience to help the revolutionary cause, finding ways to work around the <a href="Stamp%20Act%201765">Stamp Act</a> of 1765 and serving in the pro-independence <a href="Fourth%20Virginia%20Convention">Fourth Virginia Convention</a> in 1775 and the <a href="Fifth%20Virginia%20Convention">Fifth Virginia Convention</a> in 1776.

Mason prepared the first draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776, and his words formed much of the text adopted by the final Revolutionary Virginia Convention. He also wrote a constitution for the state; <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> and others sought to have the convention adopt their ideas, but they found that Mason's version could not be stopped. During the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, Mason was a member of the powerful <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">House of Delegates</a> of the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> but, to the irritation of Washington and others, he refused to serve in the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a> in Philadelphia, citing health and family commitments.

Mason was in 1787 named one of his state's delegates to the Constitutional Convention and traveled to Philadelphia, his only lengthy trip outside Virginia. Many clauses in the Constitution bear his stamp, as he was active in the convention for months before deciding that he could not sign it. He cited the lack of a bill of rights most prominently in his "Objections", but also wanted an immediate end to the slave trade and a <a href="supermajority">supermajority</a> for <a href="navigation%20acts">navigation acts</a>, which might force exporters of tobacco to use more expensive American ships. He failed to attain these objectives there, and again at the <a href="Virginia%20Ratifying%20Convention">Virginia Ratifying Convention</a> of 1788, but his prominent fight for a bill of rights led fellow Virginian <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a> to introduce one during the <a href="1st%20United%20States%20Congress">First Congress</a> in 1789; these amendments were ratified in 1791, a year before Mason died. Obscure after his death, Mason has come to be recognized in the 20th and 21st centuries for his contributions both to the early United States and to Virginia.

George Mason's great-grandfather, <a href="George%20Mason%20I">George Mason I</a>, had been a <a href="Cavalier">Cavalier</a>: militarily defeated in the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, some of them came to America in the 1640s and 1650s. He had been born in 1629 at <a href="Pershore">Pershore</a>, in the English county of <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a>. The immigrant George Mason settled in what is now <a href="Stafford%20County%2C%20Virginia">Stafford County, Virginia</a>, having <a href="Headright">obtained land as a reward for bringing his party to the colony</a> as 50 acres were awarded for each person transported into the Colony of Virginia. His son, <a href="George%20Mason%20II">George Mason II</a> (1660–1716), was the first to move to what in 1742 became <a href="Fairfax%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fairfax County</a>, then at the <a href="Frontier%23Colonial%20North%20America">frontier</a> between English and Native American areas. <a href="George%20Mason%20III">George Mason III</a> (1690–1735) served in the <a href="House%20of%20Burgesses">House of Burgesses</a> and, like his father, was <a href="Virginia%20militia%2317th%20century">county lieutenant</a>. George Mason IV's mother, Ann Thomson Mason, was the daughter of a former <a href="List%20of%20Attorneys%20General%20of%20Virginia">Attorney General of Virginia</a> who had immigrated from London and was of a <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a> family.

The Masons lived in a colonial Virginia that had few roads, as most commerce was carried on <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> or along the waters of its tributaries, such as the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac</a> and <a href="Rappahannock%20River">Rappahannock</a> rivers. Most settlement took place near the rivers, through which planters could trade with the world. Thus, colonial Virginia initially developed few towns, since estates were largely self-sufficient, and could get what they needed without the need to purchase locally. Even the capital, <a href="Williamsburg%2C%20Virginia">Williamsburg</a>, saw little activity when the legislature was not in session. Local politics was dominated by large landowners like the Masons. The Virginia economy rose and fell with tobacco, the main crop, which was raised mostly for export to Britain.

Into this world was born George Mason, fourth of that name, on December 11, 1725. He may have been born at his father's plantation on Dogue's Neck (later <a href="Mason%20Neck%2C%20Virginia">Mason Neck</a>), but this is uncertain as his parents also lived on their lands across the Potomac in Maryland.

On March 5, 1735, George Mason III died when his boat capsized while crossing the Potomac. His widow Ann raised their son George (then 9) and two younger siblings as co-guardian with lawyer <a href="John%20Mercer%20%28colonial%20lawyer%29">John Mercer</a>, who was their uncle by marriage, having wed George Mason III's sister Catherine. Ann Mason selected property at Chopawamsic Creek (today in <a href="Prince%20William%20County%2C%20Virginia">Prince William County, Virginia</a>) as her <a href="dower%20house">dower house</a> and there lived with her children and administered the lands that her elder son would control upon reaching his 21st birthday.

In 1736, George began his education with a Mr. Williams, hired to teach him for the price of of tobacco per annum. George's studies began at his mother's house, but the following year, he was boarded out to a Mrs. Simpson in Maryland, with Williams continuing as teacher through 1739. By 1740, George Mason was again at Chopawamsic, under the tutelage of a Dr. Bridges. Mason's biographers have speculated that this was <a href="Charles%20Bridges%20%28painter%29">Charles Bridges</a>, who helped develop the schools run in Britain by the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Promotion%20of%20Christian%20Knowledge">Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge</a>, and who came to America in 1731. In addition, Mason and <a href="Thomson%20Mason">his brother Thomson</a> doubtlessly had the run of Mercer's library, one of the largest in Virginia, and the conversations of Mercer and the book-lovers who gathered around him were likely an education in themselves.

Mercer was a brilliant man of strong opinions, who expressed his views in ways that sometimes gave offense; Mason proved similar in brilliance of mind and ability to anger. George Mason attained his majority in 1746, and continued to reside at <a href="Chopawamsic%20%28plantation%29">Chopawamsic</a> with his siblings and mother.

The obligations and offices that came with being one of the largest local landowners descended on Mason as they had on his father and grandfather. In 1747, he was named to the Fairfax County Court. Mason was elected as a <a href="vestryman">vestryman</a> for Truro Parish, serving 1749–1785. He took a position among the officers of the county militia, eventually rising to the rank of colonel. In 1748, he sought a seat in the House of Burgesses; the process was controlled by more senior members of the court and he was not then successful, but he would win in 1758.

The county court not only heard civil and criminal cases, but decided matters such as local taxes. Membership fell to most major landowners. Mason was a justice for much of the rest of his life, though he was excluded because of nonattendance at court from 1752 to 1764, and resigned in 1789 when continued service meant swearing to uphold <a href="Constitution%20of%20the%20United%20States">a constitution</a> he could not support. Even while a member, he often did not attend. Joseph Horrell, in a journal article on Mason's court service, noted that he was often in poor health, and lived the furthest of any of the major estateholders from the Fairfax County courthouse, whether at its original site near today's <a href="Tyson%27s%20Corner%2C%20Virginia">Tyson's Corner</a> or later in newly founded <a href="Alexandria%2C%20Virginia">Alexandria</a>. Robert Rutland, editor of Mason's papers, considered court service a major influence on Mason's later thinking and writing, but Horrell denied it, "if the Fairfax court provided a course for Mason's early training, he chiefly distinguished himself by skipping classes."

Alexandria was one of the towns founded or given corporate status in the mid-18th century in which Mason had interests; he purchased three of the original lots along King and Royal Streets and became a municipal trustee in 1754. He also served as a trustee of <a href="Dumfries%2C%20Virginia">Dumfries</a>, in Prince William County, and had business interests there and in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20District%20of%20Columbia">Georgetown</a>, on the Maryland side of the Potomac (today in the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a>).

On April 4, 1750, Mason married Ann Eilbeck, only child of William and Sarah Eilbeck of <a href="Charles%20County%2C%20Maryland">Charles County, Maryland</a>. The Masons and Eilbecks had adjacent lands in Maryland, and had joined together in real estate transactions; by his death in 1764, William Eilbeck was one of the wealthiest men in Charles County. At the time of his marriage, Mason was living at Dogue's Neck, possibly at Sycamore Point. George and Ann Mason would have nine children who survived to adulthood. Ann Mason died in 1773; their marriage, judging by surviving accounts, was a happy one.

George Mason began to build his home, <a href="Gunston%20Hall">Gunston Hall</a>, likely beginning in 1755. The exterior, typical of local buildings of that time, was probably based on architectural books sent from Britain to America for the use of local builders; one of these craftsmen, perhaps William Waite or James Wren, constructed Gunston Hall. Mason was proud of the gardens which still surround the house. There were outbuildings, including slave quarters, a schoolhouse, and kitchens, and beyond them four large plantations, forests, and the shops and other facilities that made Gunston Hall mostly self-sufficient.

Mason avoided overdependence on tobacco as a source of income by leasing much of his land holdings to tenant farmers, and diversified his crops to grow wheat for export to the <a href="British%20West%20Indies">British West Indies</a> as Virginia's economy sank because of tobacco overproduction in the 1760s and 1770s. Mason was a pioneer in the Virginia wine industry, subscribing along with other Virginians such as <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> to <a href="Philip%20Mazzei">Philip Mazzei</a>'s scheme for growing wine grapes in America.

Mason sought to expand his land and wealth. He greatly expanded the boundaries of Gunston Hall estate, so that it occupied all of Dogue's Neck, which became known as Mason's Neck. One project that Mason was involved in for most of his adult life was the <a href="Ohio%20Company">Ohio Company</a>, in which he invested in 1749 and became treasurer in 1752—an office he held forty years until his death in 1792. The Ohio Company had secured a royal grant for to be surveyed near the forks of the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> (today the site of <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>). <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">War</a>, <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">revolution</a>, and competing claims from Pennsylvania eventually defeated the Ohio Company's plans. Although the company failed, Mason acquired considerable Western lands independently. His defense against the Pennsylvania claims, "Selections from the Virginia Charters" (1772), originally intended to promote the Ohio Company's claims, was widely applauded as a defense of the rights of Americans against royal decrees. Involvement with the Ohio Company also brought Mason into contact with many prominent Virginians, including his Fairfax County neighbor, <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>.

Mason and Washington were friends for many years until they finally broke over their differences regarding the federal constitution. Peter R. Henriques, in his journal article on their relationship, suggested that Mason cultivated the friendship more than Washington did, as Mason sent many more letters and gifts, and stayed more often at Washington's plantation, though the last can be explained in part as <a href="Mount%20Vernon">Mount Vernon</a> lay on the road from Gunston Hall to Alexandria. Henriques suggested that as Mason was older, intellectually superior, and the owner of a flourishing plantation as Washington struggled to establish Mount Vernon, it would not have been in the future president's character to be close to Mason. Washington had a deep respect for Mason's intellectual abilities, several times asking for his advice, and writing in 1777 when learning that Mason had taken charge of an issue before the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a>, "I know of no person better qualified ... than Colonel Mason, and shall be very happy to hear he has taken it in hand".

Despite his involvement in western real estate schemes, Mason saw that land was being cleared and planted with tobacco faster than the market for it could expand, meaning that its price would drop even as more and more capital was tied up in land and slaves. Thus, although a major slaveholder, he opposed the slave system in Virginia. He believed that slave importation, together with the natural population increase, would result in a huge future slave population in Virginia; a system of leased lands, though not as profitable as slave labor, would have "little Trouble & Risque [risk]".

Little is known of Mason's political views prior to the 1760s, when he came to oppose British colonial policies. In 1758, Mason successfully ran for the House of Burgesses when <a href="George%20William%20Fairfax">George William Fairfax</a>, holder of one of Fairfax County's two seats, chose not to seek re-election. Also elected were Mason's brother Thomson (for Stafford County), George Washington (for <a href="Frederick%20County%2C%20Virginia">Frederick County</a> where he was stationed as commander of Virginia's militia as the <a href="French%20and%20Indian%20War">French and Indian War</a> continued) and <a href="Richard%20Henry%20Lee">Richard Henry Lee</a>, who would work closely with Mason through their careers.
When the house assembled, George Mason was initially appointed to a committee concerned with raising additional militia during that time of war. In 1759, he was appointed to the powerful Committee on Privileges and Elections. He was also placed during the latter year on the Committee on Propositions and Grievances, which mostly considered local matters. Mason dealt with several local concerns, presenting a petition of Fairfax County planters against being assessed for a tobacco wharf at Alexandria, funds they felt should be raised through wharfage fees. He also played a major role as the Burgesses deliberated how to divide Prince William County as settlement expanded; in March 1759, <a href="Fauquier%20County%2C%20Virginia">Fauquier County</a> was created by legislative act. In this, Mason opposed the interest of the family of <a href="Thomas%20Fairfax%2C%206th%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron">Thomas, Lord Fairfax</a>, who wanted existing counties expanded instead, including Fairfax. This difference may have contributed to Mason's decision not to seek re-election in 1761. Mason biographer Jeff Broadwater noted that Mason's committee assignments reflected the esteem his colleagues held him in, or at least the potential they saw. Broadwater did not find it surprising that Mason did not seek re-election, as he did not attend the sessions between 1759 and 1761.

Although the British were victorious over the French in the war, <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>'s government felt that the North American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The <a href="Sugar%20Act">Sugar Act</a> of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The <a href="Stamp%20Act">Stamp Act</a> the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required <a href="revenue%20stamp">revenue stamp</a>s to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the <a href="Virginia%20Resolves">Virginia Resolves</a>, asserting that Virginians had the same rights as if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for <a href="Louisa%20County%2C%20Virginia">Louisa County</a>, <a href="Patrick%20Henry">Patrick Henry</a>.

Mason slowly moved from being a peripheral figure towards the center of Virginia politics, but his published response to the Stamp Act, which he opposed, is most notable for the inclusion of his anti-slavery views. George Washington or George William Fairfax, the burgesses for Fairfax County, may have asked Mason's advice as to what steps to take in the crisis. Mason drafted an act to allow for one of the most common court actions, <a href="replevin">replevin</a>, to take place without the use of stamped paper, and sent it to George Washington, by then one of Fairfax County's burgesses, to gain passage. This action contributed to a boycott of the stamps. With the courts and trade paralyzed, the <a href="Parliament%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British Parliament</a> repealed the Stamp Act in 1766, but continued to assert the right to tax the colonies.

Following the repeal, a committee of London merchants issued a public letter to Americans, warning them not to declare victory. Mason published a response in June 1766, satirizing the British position, "We have, with infinite Difficulty & Fatigue got you excused this one Time; do what your Papa and Mamma bid, & hasten to return your most grateful Acknowledgements for condescending to let you keep what is your own." The <a href="Townshend%20Acts">Townshend Acts</a> of 1767 were Britain's next attempt to tax the colonies, placing duties on substances including lead and glass, and provoking calls from the northern colonies for a boycott of British goods. Virginia, more dependent on goods imported from Britain, was less enthusiastic, and, as local planters tended to receive goods at their river landings, a boycott would be difficult to enforce. In April 1769, Washington sent a copy of a Philadelphia resolution to Mason, asking his advice on what action Virginia should take. It is unknown who adapted that text for use in Virginia (Broadwater concluded it was Mason) but Mason sent Washington a corrected draft on April 23, 1769. Washington took it to Williamsburg, but the governor, <a href="Norborne%20Berkeley%2C%204th%20Baron%20Botetourt">Lord Botetourt</a>, dissolved the legislature because of the radical resolutions it was passing. The Burgesses adjourned to a nearby tavern, and there passed a non-importation agreement based on Mason's.

Although the resolution was not as strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. The repeal of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.

In May 1774, Mason was in Williamsburg on real estate business. Word had just arrived of the passage of the <a href="Intolerable%20Acts">Intolerable Acts</a>, as Americans dubbed the legislative response to the <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">Boston Tea Party</a>, and a group of lawmakers including Lee, Henry, and Jefferson asked Mason to join them in formulating a course of action. The Burgesses passed a resolution for a day of fasting and prayer to obtain divine intervention against "destruction of our Civil Rights", but the governor, <a href="John%20Murray%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Dunmore">Lord Dunmore</a>, dissolved the legislature rather than accept it. Mason may have helped write the resolution, and likely joined the members after the dissolution when they met at the <a href="Raleigh%20Tavern">Raleigh Tavern</a>.

New elections had to be held for burgess and for delegate to the convention which had been called by the rump of the dissolved House of Burgesses, and Fairfax County's were set for July 5, 1774. Washington planned to run for one seat, and tried to get Mason or <a href="Bryan%20Fairfax%2C%208th%20Lord%20Fairfax%20of%20Cameron">Bryan Fairfax</a> to seek the other, but both men declined. Although the poll was postponed to the 14th due to poor weather, Washington met that day with other local leaders (including, likely, Mason) in Alexandria and selected a committee to draft a set of resolutions, which Washington hoped would "define our Constitutional Rights". The resulting <a href="Fairfax%20Resolves">Fairfax Resolves</a> were largely drafted by Mason. He met with the newly elected Washington on July 17 at Mount Vernon, and stayed the night; the two men rode together to Alexandria the following day. The 24 propositions that made up the Resolves protested loyalty to the British Crown, but denied the right of Parliament to legislate for colonies that had been settled at private expense and which had received charters from the monarch. The Resolves called for a continental congress. If Americans did not receive redress by November 1, exports, including that of tobacco, would be cut off. The freeholders of Fairfax County approved the Resolves, appointing Mason and Washington to a special committee in the emergency. According to early Virginia historian Hugh Grigsby, at Alexandria, Mason "made his first great movement on the theatre of the Revolution".

Washington took the Resolves to the <a href="First%20Virginia%20Convention">Virginia Convention</a> in Williamsburg, and although delegates made some changes, the adopted resolution closely tracks both the Fairfax Resolves, and the scheme for non-exportation of tobacco Mason had proposed some years earlier. The convention elected delegates to the <a href="First%20Continental%20Congress">First Continental Congress</a> in Philadelphia, including Lee, Washington, and Henry, and in October 1774, Congress adopted a similar embargo.

Much of Mason's efforts in 1774 and 1775 was in organizing a militia independent of the royal government. Washington by January 1775 was drilling a small force, and he and Mason purchased gunpowder for the company. Mason wrote in favor of annual election of militia officers in words that would later echo in the Virginia Declaration of Rights, "We came equal into this world, and equals shall we go out of it. All men are by nature born equally free and independent."

Washington's election as a delegate to the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> created a vacancy in Fairfax County's delegation to the third Virginia Convention, and he wrote from Philadelphia in May 1775, urging that it be filled. By this time, blood had been shed between colonial and Briton at the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a>. Mason attempted to avoid election on the grounds of poor health and that he was needed to parent his motherless children. Nevertheless, he was elected and journeyed to <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>, which, being further inland than Williamsburg, was deemed better protected from possible British attack.

When the Richmond convention began in July 1775, Mason was assigned to crucial committees, including one attempting to raise an army to protect the colony. According to Robert A. Rutland, "Sick or healthy, Mason was needed for his ability." Mason sponsored a non-exportation measure; it was passed by a large majority, though it had to be repealed later in the session to coordinate with one passed by Maryland. Despite pressure from many delegates, Mason refused to consider election as a delegate to the Continental Congress in place of Washington when the latter became commanding general of the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a>, but could not avoid election to the <a href="Committee%20of%20Safety%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Committee of Safety</a>, a powerful group that took over many functions in the governmental vacuum. When Mason proffered his resignation from this committee, it was refused.

Illness forced Mason to absent himself from the Committee of Safety for several weeks in 1775, and he did not attend the fourth convention, held in December 1775 and January 1776. With independence from Britain widely accepted as necessary among prominent Virginians, the fifth convention, to meet in May 1776 at Williamsburg, would need to decide how Virginia would be administered henceforth, as the royal government was dead in all but name. Accordingly, the convention was seen as so important that Richard Henry Lee arranged for his temporary recall from Congress to be a part of the convention, and Jefferson tried but failed to arrange to leave Congress as well. Other notables elected to the convention were Henry, <a href="George%20Wythe">George Wythe</a>, and a young delegate from <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20Virginia">Orange County</a>, <a href="James%20Madison">James Madison</a>. Mason was elected for Fairfax County, though with great difficulty.
That convention, in May 1776, unanimously instructed Jefferson and other Virginia delegates to Congress to seek "a clear and full Declaration of Independency". At the same time, the convention resolved to pass a declaration of rights. Due to ill health, Mason did not arrive until May 18, 1776, after the vote, but was appointed to a committee led by <a href="Archibald%20Cary">Archibald Cary</a>, which was to compose a declaration of rights and constitution. Mason was skeptical that the thirty-person Cary Committee could collectively compose anything worthwhile, but was surprised at how quickly it moved—though his membership had a role in that speed. On May 24, convention president <a href="Edmund%20Pendleton">Edmund Pendleton</a> wrote to Jefferson about the committee's deliberations, "as Colo.[nel] Mason seems to have the ascendancy in the great work, I have Sanguine hopes it will be framed so as to Answer it's end, Prosperity to the Community and Security to Individuals".

Mason, working in a room at the Raleigh Tavern, drafted a declaration of rights and plan of government, likely to prevent frivolous plans with no chance of adoption from being put forward. <a href="Edmund%20Randolph">Edmund Randolph</a> later recalled that Mason's draft "swallowed up all the rest". The <a href="Virginia%20Declaration%20of%20Rights">Virginia Declaration of Rights</a> and the 1776 <a href="Constitution%20of%20Virginia">Constitution of Virginia</a> were joint works, but Mason was the main author. Mason likely worked closely with <a href="Thomas%20Ludwell%20Lee">Thomas Ludwell Lee</a>; the earliest surviving draft shows the first ten articles in Mason's handwriting, with the other two written by Lee. The draft for the Declaration of Rights drew on <a href="Magna%20Carta">Magna Carta</a>, the English <a href="Petition%20of%20Right">Petition of Right</a> of 1628, and that nation's 1689 <a href="English%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a>. Mason's first article would be paraphrased by Jefferson soon after in drafting the <a href="American%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">American Declaration of Independence</a>.

From the first article, cataloguing the rights of man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear that the role of government is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the people have a right to amend or abolish it. Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives. If accused, a person had the right to a speedy and local trial, based on an accusation made known to him, with the right to call for evidence and witnesses in his favor.

When the convention began to debate the declaration, it quickly bogged down on the first sentence of Article 1, which conservatives feared would imply that slaves were their masters' equals. This was resolved by the convention adding the words "when they enter into a state of society", thus excluding slaves. Mason spoke repeatedly in the five days of debate, using oratory one hearer described as "neither flowing nor smooth, but his language was strong, his manner most impressive, and strengthened by a bit of biting cynicism when provocation made it seasonable". The Declaration of Rights was passed by the convention on June 12, 1776.
In later years, there was a flurry of contradictory statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing with religious freedom), was written by Madison. Mason had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious liberty, and Mason supported Madison's amendment once made.

The committee draft, likely for the most part written by Mason, received wide publicity (the final version much less so) and Mason's words "all men are born equally free and independent" were later reproduced in state constitutions from Pennsylvania to Montana; Jefferson tweaked the prose and included the sentiments in the Declaration of Independence. In 1778, Mason wrote that the Declaration of Rights "was closely imitated by the other United States". This was true, as seven of the original states, and Vermont, joined Virginia in promulgating a bill of rights. Four in addition specified rights that were protected, within the body of their constitutions. Feelings were so strong in Massachusetts that voters there in 1778 rejected a constitution drafted by a convention, insisting that a bill of rights had to come first.

Even before the convention approved the Declaration of Rights, Mason was busy at work on a constitution for Virginia. He was not the only one occupying himself so; Jefferson sent several versions from Philadelphia, one of which supplied the eventual constitution's <a href="preamble">preamble</a>. <a href="Essex%20County%2C%20Virginia">Essex County</a>'s <a href="Meriwether%20Smith">Meriwether Smith</a> may have prepared a draft, but the text is unknown. As an original writing in Mason's hand is not known, the extent to which the final draft was written by him is uncertain. Nevertheless, <a href="William%20Fleming%20%28governor%29">William Fleming</a> on June 22, 1776, sent Jefferson a copy of the draft before the Cary Committee, telling him "the inclosed printed plan was drawn by Colo. G. Mason and by him laid before the committee".

Mason had submitted his plan sometime between June 8 and 10, 1776. It named the new state the "Commonwealth of Virginia", a name chosen pointedly by Mason to indicate that power stemmed from the people. The constitution provided for a popularly elected <a href="Virginia%20House%20of%20Delegates">House of Delegates</a>, chosen annually by men who owned or leased property, or who had fathered three or more Virginians. Most governmental power resided in the House of Delegates—the governor could not even veto a bill, and could only act as head of the state <a href="militia">militia</a> on the advice of his Council of State, whose members were elected by the legislature. The draft was considered by the committee, and it issued a report on June 24, at which time Jefferson's preamble and several amendments authored by him were included—George Wythe, who advocated for Jefferson's draft before the committee, found discussion far enough advanced that members were only willing to yield to Jefferson on a few points. The entire convention considered the document between June 26 and 28, and it was signed on the 29th. Richard Henry Lee wrote the day prior to the constitution's passage by unanimous vote, "I have had the pleasure to see our new plan of Government go on well. This day will put a finishing hand to it. 'Tis very much of the democratic kind."

When the convention chose Patrick Henry as Virginia's first post-independence governor, Mason led the committee of notables sent to inform Henry of his election. There was criticism of the constitution—Edmund Randolph later wrote that the document's faults indicated that even such a great mind as Mason's was not immune from "oversights and negligences": it did not have an amending process, and granted two delegates to each county regardless of population. The 1776 constitution remained in force until 1830, when another convention replaced it. According to Henry C. Riely in his journal article on Mason, "The Virginia Constitution of 1776, whatever may have been the question raised long afterwards as to the contribution of other great leaders, stands, on the authority of Jefferson, Madison, and Randolph—to mention only the highest authority—as his creation."

Mason devoted much effort during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> to safeguarding Fairfax County and the rivers of Virginia, since the British several times raided areas along the Potomac. Control of the rivers and of <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a> was urgent as Virginians tried to obtain hard currency by trading tobacco to the French and other European nations. The export of tobacco, generally via the West Indies, allowed Mason and others to obtain, via France and Holland, British-made items such as cloth, clothing patterns, medicines, and hardware.

Mason served as a member of the House of Delegates from 1776 to 1781, his longest continuous political service outside Fairfax County, which he represented in Richmond. The other Fairfax County seat turned over several times—Washington's stepson <a href="John%20Parke%20Custis">Jackie Custis</a> was elected late in the war—but Mason remained the county's choice throughout. Nevertheless, Mason's health often caused him to miss meetings of the legislature, or to arrive days or weeks late. Mason in 1777 was assigned to a committee to revise Virginia's laws, with the expectation that he would take on the criminal code and land law. Mason served a few months on the committee before resigning on the ground he was not a lawyer; most of the work fell to Jefferson (returned from Philadelphia), Pendleton, and Wythe. Due to illness caused by a botched smallpox inoculation, Mason was forced to miss part of the legislature's spring 1777 session; in his absence delegates on May 22 elected him to the Continental Congress. Mason, who may have been angry that Lee had not been chosen, refused on the ground that he was needed at home, and did not feel he could resign from the General Assembly without permission from his constituents. Lee was elected in his place.

This did not end the desire of Virginians to send Mason to the Continental Congress. In 1779, Lee resigned from Congress, expressing the hope that Mason, Wythe, or Jefferson would replace him in Philadelphia. General Washington was frustrated at the reluctance of many talented men to serve in Congress, writing to <a href="Benjamin%20Harrison%20V">Benjamin Harrison</a> that the states "should compel their ablest men to attend Congress ... Where is Mason, Wythe, Jefferson, Nicholas, Pendleton, Nelson?" The general wrote to Mason directly,

In spite of Washington's pleas, Mason remained in Virginia, plagued by illness and heavily occupied, both on the Committee of Safety and elsewhere in defending the Fairfax County area. Most of the legislation Mason introduced in the House of Delegates was war related, often aimed at raising the men or money needed by Congress for Washington's Continental Army. The new federal and state governments, short on cash, issued paper money. By 1777, the value of Virginia's paper money had dropped precipitously, and Mason developed a plan to redeem the notes with a tax on real estate. Due to illness, Mason was three weeks late in arriving at Richmond, to the frustration of Washington, who had faith in Mason's knowledge of financial affairs. The general wrote to Custis, "It is much to be wished that a remedy could be applied to the depreciation of our Currency ... I know of no person better qualified to do this than Colonel Mason".

Mason retained his interest in western affairs, hoping in vain to salvage the Ohio Company's land grant. He and Jefferson were among the few delegates to be told of <a href="George%20Rogers%20Clark">George Rogers Clark</a>'s expedition to secure control of the lands north of the Ohio River. Mason and Jefferson secured legislation authorizing Governor Henry to defend against unspecified western enemies. The expedition was generally successful, and Mason received a report directly from Clark. Mason sought to remove differences between Virginia and other states, and although he felt the 1780 settlement of the boundary dispute with Pennsylvania, the <a href="Mason-Dixon%20line">Mason-Dixon line</a> (not named for George Mason) was unfavorable to Virginia, he voted for it enthusiastically. Also in 1780, Mason remarried, to Sarah Brent, from a nearby plantation, who had never been married and was 52 years old. It was a marriage of convenience, with the new bride able to take some of the burden of parenting Mason's many children off his hands.

By the signing of the 1783 <a href="Treaty%20of%20Paris%20%281783%29">Treaty of Paris</a>, life along the Potomac had returned to normal. Among the visits between the elite that returned with peace was one by Madison to Gunston Hall in December 1783, while returning from Congress in Philadelphia. The 1781 <a href="Articles%20of%20Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> had tied the states in a loose bond, and Madison sought a sounder federal structure, seeking the proper balance between federal and state rights. He found Mason willing to consider a federal tax; Madison had feared the subject might offend his host, and wrote to Jefferson of the evening's conversation. The same month, Mason spent Christmas at Mount Vernon (the only larger estate than his in Fairfax County). A fellow houseguest described Mason as "slight in figure, but not tall, and has a grand head and clear gray eyes". Mason retained his political influence in Virginia, writing Patrick Henry, who had been elected to the House of Delegates, a letter filled with advice as that body's 1783 session opened.

Mason scuttled efforts to elect him to the House of Delegates in 1784, writing that sending him to Richmond would be "an oppressive and unjust invasion of my personal liberty". His refusal disappointed Jefferson, who had hoped that the likelihood that the legislature would consider land legislation would attract Mason to Richmond. The legislature nevertheless appointed Mason a commissioner to negotiate with Maryland over navigation of the Potomac. Mason spent much time on this issue, and reached agreement with Maryland delegates at the meeting in March 1785 known as the <a href="Mount%20Vernon%20Conference">Mount Vernon Conference</a>. Although the meeting at Washington's home came later to be seen as a first step towards the 1787 Constitutional Convention, Mason saw it simply as efforts by two states to resolve differences between them. Mason was appointed to the <a href="Annapolis%20Convention%20%281786%29">Annapolis Convention</a> of 1786, at which representatives of all the states were welcome, but like most delegates did not attend. The sparsely attended Annapolis meeting called for a conference to consider amendments to the Articles of Confederation.

To deter smuggling, Madison proposed a bill to make Norfolk the state's only legal <a href="port%20of%20entry">port of entry</a>. Five other ports, including Alexandria, were eventually added, but the Port Act proved unpopular despite the support of Washington. Mason, an opponent of the act, accepted election to the House of Delegates in 1786, and many believed that his influence would prove decisive for the repeal effort. Due to illness, Mason did not come to Richmond during the initial session, though he sent a petition, as a private citizen, to the legislature. The Port Act survived, though additional harbors were added as legal entry points.

Although the Annapolis Convention saw only about a dozen delegates attend, representing only five states, it called for a meeting to be held in Philadelphia in May 1787, to devise amendments to the Articles of Confederation which would result in a more durable constitutional arrangement. Accordingly, in December 1786, the Virginia General Assembly elected seven men as the commonwealth's delegation: Washington, Mason, Henry, Randolph, Madison, Wythe, and <a href="John%20Blair%20Jr.">John Blair</a>. Henry declined appointment, and his place was given to Dr. <a href="James%20McClurg">James McClurg</a>. Randolph, who had just been elected governor, sent three notifications of election to Mason, who accepted without any quibbles. The roads were difficult because of spring flooding, and Mason was the last Virginia delegate to arrive, on May 17, three days after the convention's scheduled opening. But it was not until May 25 that the convention formally opened, with the arrival of at least one delegate from ten of the twelve states which sent representatives (Rhode Island sent no one).
The journey to Philadelphia was Mason's first beyond Virginia and Maryland. According to Josephine T. Pacheco in her article about Mason's role at Philadelphia, "since Virginia's leaders regarded [Mason] as a wise, trustworthy man, it is not surprising that they chose him as a member of the Virginia delegation, though they must have been surprised when he accepted". Broadwater suggested that Mason went to Philadelphia because he knew the federal congress needed additional power, and because he felt that body could act as a check on the powers of state legislatures. As the Virginians waited for the other delegates to arrive, they met each day and formulated what became known as the <a href="Virginia%20Plan">Virginia Plan</a>. They also did some sightseeing, and were presented to Pennsylvania's president, <a href="Benjamin%20Franklin">Benjamin Franklin</a>. Within a week of arrival, Mason was bored with the social events to which the delegates were invited, "I begin to grow tired of the etiquette and nonsense so fashionable in this city".

Going into the convention, Mason wanted to see a more powerful central government than under the Articles, but not one that would threaten local interests. He feared that the more numerous Northern states would dominate the union, and would impose restrictions on trade that would harm Virginia, so he sought a supermajority requirement for <a href="Navigation%20Acts">navigation acts</a>. As was his constant objective, he sought to preserve the liberty he and other free white males enjoyed in Virginia, guarding against the tyranny he and others had decried under British rule. He also sought a balance of powers, seeking thereby to make a durable government; according to historian Brent Tarter, "Mason designed his home [Gunston Hall] so that no misplaced window or missing support might spoil the effect or threaten to bring down the roof; he tried to design institutions of government in the same way, so that wicked or unprincipled men could not knock loose any safeguards of liberty".

Mason had hope, coming into the convention, that it would yield a result that he felt would strengthen the United States. Impressed by the quality of the delegates, Mason expected sound thinking from them, something he did not think he had often encountered in his political career. Still, he felt that the "hopes of all the Union centre in this Convention", and wrote to <a href="George%20Mason%20V">his son George</a>, "the revolt from Great Britain & the Formations of our new Government at that time, were nothing compared with the great Business now before us."
Mason knew few of the delegates who were not from Virginia or Maryland, but his reputation preceded him. Once delegates representing sufficient states had arrived in Philadelphia by late May, the convention held closed sessions at the Pennsylvania State House (today, <a href="Independence%20Hall">Independence Hall</a>). Washington was elected the convention's president by unanimous vote, and his tremendous personal prestige as the victorious war general helped legitimize the convention, but also caused him to abstain from debate. Mason had no such need to remain silent, and only four or five delegates spoke as frequently as he did. Though he ended up not signing the constitution, according to Broadwater, Mason won as many convention debates as he lost. 

In the early days of the convention, Mason supported much of the Virginia Plan, which was introduced by Randolph on May 29. This plan would have a popularly elected lower house which would choose the members of the upper house from lists provided by the states. Most of the delegates had found the weak government under the Articles insufficient, and Randolph proposed that the new federal government should be supreme over the states. Mason agreed that the federal government should be more powerful than the states.

The Virginia Plan, if implemented, would base representation in both houses of the federal legislature on population. This was unsatisfactory to the smaller states. Delaware's delegates had been instructed to seek an equal vote for each state, and this became the <a href="New%20Jersey%20Plan">New Jersey Plan</a>, introduced by that state's governor, <a href="William%20Paterson%20%28judge%29">William Paterson</a>. The divisions in the convention became apparent in late June, when by a narrow vote, the convention voted that representation in the lower house be based on population, but the motion of Connecticut's <a href="Oliver%20Ellsworth">Oliver Ellsworth</a> for each state to have an equal vote in the upper house failed on a tie. With the convention deadlocked, on July 2, 1787, a <a href="Grand%20Committee">Grand Committee</a> was formed, with one member from each state, to seek a way out. Mason had not taken as strong a position on the legislature as had Madison, and he was appointed to the committee; Mason and Benjamin Franklin were the most prominent members. The committee met over the convention's July 4 recess, and proposed what became known as the <a href="Connecticut%20Compromise">Great Compromise</a>: a House of Representatives based on population, in which money bills must originate, and a Senate with equal representation for each state. Records do not survive of Mason's participation in that committee, but the clause requiring money bills to start in the House most likely came from him or was the price of his support, as he had inserted such a clause in the Virginia Constitution, and he defended that clause once convention debate resumed. According to Madison's notes, Mason urged the convention to adopt the compromise:

By mid-July, as delegates began to move past the stalemate to a framework built upon the Great Compromise, Mason had considerable influence in the convention. North Carolina's <a href="William%20Blount">William Blount</a> was unhappy that those from his state "were in Sentiment with Virginia who seemed to take the lead. Madison at their Head tho Randolph and Mason also great". Mason had failed to carry his proposals that senators must own property and not be in debt to the United States, but successfully argued that the minimum age for service in Congress should be 25, telling the convention that men younger than that were too immature. Mason was the first to propose that the national seat of government not be in a state capital lest the local legislature be too influential, voted against proposals to base representation on a state's wealth or taxes paid, and supported regular <a href="Apportionment%20%28politics%29%23United%20States">reapportionment</a> of the House of Representatives.

On August 6, 1787, the convention received a tentative draft written by a Committee of Detail chaired by South Carolina's <a href="John%20Rutledge">John Rutledge</a>; Randolph had represented Virginia. The draft was acceptable to Mason as a basis for discussion, containing such points important to him as the requirement that money bills originate in the House and not be amendable in the Senate. Nevertheless, Mason felt the upper house was too powerful, as it had the powers to make treaties, appoint Supreme Court justices, and adjudicate territorial disputes between the states. The draft lacked provision for a <a href="council%20of%20revision">council of revision</a>, something Mason and others considered a serious lack.

The convention spent several weeks in August in debating the powers of Congress. Although Mason was successful in some of his proposals, such as placing the state militias under federal regulation, and a ban on Congress passing an export tax, he lost on some that he deemed crucial. These losses included the convention deciding to allow importation of slaves to continue to at least 1800 (later amended to 1808) and to allow a simple majority to pass navigation acts that might require Virginians to export their tobacco in American-flagged ships, when it might be cheaper to use foreign-flagged vessels. The convention also weakened the requirement that money bills begin in the House and not be subject to amendment in the Senate, eventually striking the latter clause after debate that stretched fitfully over weeks. Despite these defeats, Mason continued to work constructively to build a constitution, serving on another grand committee that considered customs duties and ports.

On August 31, 1787, Massachusetts' <a href="Elbridge%20Gerry">Elbridge Gerry</a> spoke against the document as a whole, as did <a href="Luther%20Martin">Luther Martin</a> of Maryland. When Gerry moved to postpone consideration of the final document, Mason seconded him, stating, according to Madison, that "he would sooner chop off his right hand than put it to the Constitution as it now stands". Still, Mason did not rule out signing it, saying that he wanted to see how certain matters still before the convention were settled before deciding a final position, whether to sign or ask for a second convention. As the final touches were made to the constitution, Mason and Gerry held meetings in the evening to discuss strategy, bringing in delegates representing states from Connecticut to Georgia.
Mason's misgivings about the constitution were increased on September 12, when Gerry proposed and Mason seconded that there be a committee appointed to write a bill of rights, to be part of the text of the constitution. Connecticut's <a href="Roger%20Sherman">Roger Sherman</a> noted that the state bills of rights would remain in force, to which Mason responded, "the Laws of the United States are to be paramount [supreme] to State Bills of Rights." Although Massachusetts abstained in deference to Gerry, the Virginians showed no desire to conciliate Mason in their votes, as the motion failed with no states in favor and ten opposed. Also on September 12, the Committee on Style, charged with making a polished final draft of the document, reported, and Mason began to list objections on his copy. On the 15th, as the convention continued a clause-by-clause consideration of the draft, Mason, Randolph and Gerry stated they would not sign the constitution.

On the 17th, members of the twelve delegations then present in Philadelphia signed the constitution, except for the three men who had stated they would not. As the document was sent to the Articles of Confederation's Congress in New York, Mason sent a copy of his objections to Richard Henry Lee, a member of the Congress.

Broadwater noted, "given the difficulty of the task he had set for himself, his stubborn independence, and his lack, by 1787, of any concern for his own political future, it is not surprising that he left Philadelphia at odds with the great majority of his fellow delegates". Madison recorded that Mason, believing that the convention had given his proposals short shrift in a hurry to complete its work, began his journey back to Virginia "in an exceeding ill humor". Mason biographer Helen Hill Miller noted that before Mason returned to Gunston Hall, he was injured in body as well as spirit, due to an accident on the road. Word of Mason's opposition stance had reached Fairfax County even before the convention ended; most local sentiment was in favor of the document. Washington made a statement urging ratification, but otherwise remained silent, knowing he would almost certainly be the first president. Mason sent Washington a copy of his objections, but the general believed that the only choice was ratification or disaster.

The constitution was to be ratified by state conventions, with nine approvals necessary for it to come into force. In practice, opposition by large states such as New York or Virginia would make it hard for the new government to function. Mason remained a member of the House of Delegates, and in late October 1787, the legislature called a convention for June 1788; in language crafted by <a href="John%20Marshall">John Marshall</a>, it decreed that the <a href="Virginia%20Ratifying%20Convention">Virginia Ratifying Convention</a> would be allowed "free and ample discussion". Mason was less influential in his final session in the House of Delegates because of his strong opposition to ratification, and his age (61) may also have caused him to be less effective.

As smaller states ratified the constitution in late 1787 and early 1788, there was an immense quantity of pamphlets and other written matter for and against approval. Most prominent in support were the pamphlets later collected as "<a href="The%20Federalist">The Federalist</a>", <a href="James%20Madison%23The%20Federalist%20Papers%20and%20ratification%20debates">written by Madison</a> and two New Yorkers, <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> and <a href="John%20Jay">John Jay</a>; Mason's objections were widely cited by opponents. Mason had begun his "Objections to this Constitution of Government" in Philadelphia; in October 1787, it was published, though without his permission. Madison complained that Mason had gone beyond the reasons for opposing he had stated in convention, but Broadwater suggested the major difference was one of tone, since the written work dismissed as useless the constitution and the proposed federal government. Nevertheless, both Lee and Mason believed that if proper amendments were made, the constitution would be a fine instrument of governance. The "Objections" were widely cited in opposition to ratification, and Mason was criticized for placing his own name on it, at a time when political tracts were signed, if at all, with pen names such as <a href="Junius">Junius</a>, so that the author's reputation would not influence the debate. Despite this, Mason's "Objections" were among the most influential <a href="Anti-Federalist">Anti-Federalist</a> works, and its opening line, "There is no Declaration of Rights", likely their most effective slogan.

Virginians were reluctant to believe that greatly respected figures such as Washington and Franklin would be complicit in setting up a tyrannical system. There were broad attacks on Mason; the <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Connecticut">New Haven</a> "Gazette" suggested that he had not done much for his country during the war, in marked contrast to Washington. Oliver Ellsworth blamed the Virginia opposition on the <a href="Lee%20family">Lee family</a>, who had long had tensions with the Washington family, and on "the madness of Mason". Tarter, in his "<a href="American%20National%20Biography">American National Biography</a>" article on Mason, wrote that "the rigidity of [Mason's] views and his increasingly belligerent personality produced an intolerance and intemperance in his behavior that surprised and angered Madison, with whom he had worked closely at the beginning of the convention, and Washington, who privately condemned Mason's actions during the ratification struggle."

Mason faced difficulties in being elected to the ratifying convention from Fairfax County, since most freeholders there were Federalist, and he was at odds with many in Alexandria over local politics. The statute governing elections to the convention in Richmond allowed him to seek election elsewhere, and he campaigned for a seat from Stafford County, assuring electors that he did not seek disunion, but rather reform. He spoke against the unamended constitution in strong terms; <a href="George%20Nicholas">George Nicholas</a>, a Federalist friend of Mason, believed that Mason felt he could lead Virginia to gain concessions from the other states, and that he was embittered by the continuing attacks on him. On March 10, 1788, Mason finished first in the polls in Stafford County, winning one of its two seats; he apparently was the only person elected for a constituency in which he did not live. Voter turnout was low, as many in remote areas without newspapers knew little about the constitution. The Federalists were believed to have a slight advantage in elected delegates; Mason thought that the convention would be unlikely to ratify the document without demanding amendments.

By the time the Richmond convention opened, Randolph had abandoned the Anti-Federalist cause, which damaged efforts by Mason and Henry to co-ordinate with their counterparts in New York. Mason moved that the convention consider the document clause by clause, which may have played into the hands of the Federalists, who feared what the outcome of an immediate vote might be, and who had more able leadership in Richmond, including Marshall and Madison. Nevertheless, Broadwater suggested that as most delegates had declared their views before the election, Mason's motion made little difference. Henry, far more a foe of a strong federal government than was Mason, took the lead for his side in the debate. Mason spoke several times in the discussion, on topics ranging from the pardon power (which he predicted the president would use corruptly) to the federal judiciary, which he warned would lead to suits in the federal courts by citizens against states where they did not live. John Marshall, a future <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20the%20United%20States">Chief Justice of the United States</a>, downplayed the concern regarding the judiciary, but Mason would later be proved correct in the case of "<a href="Chisholm%20v.%20Georgia">Chisholm v. Georgia</a>" (1793), which led to the passage of the <a href="Eleventh%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Eleventh Amendment</a>.

The federalists initially did not have a majority, with the balance held by undeclared delegates, mainly from western Virginia (today's Kentucky). The Anti-Federalists suffered repeated blows during the convention due to the defection of Randolph and as news came other states had ratified. Mason led a group of Anti-Federalists which drafted amendments: even the Federalists were open to supporting them, though the constitution's supporters wanted the document drafted in Philadelphia ratified first. 

After some of the Kentuckians had declared for ratification, the convention considered a resolution to withhold ratification pending the approval of a declaration of rights. Supported by Mason but <a href="James%20Madison%23The%20Federalist%20Papers%20and%20ratification%20debates">opposed by Madison</a>, <a href="Henry%20Lee%20III">Light-Horse Harry Lee</a>, Marshall, Nicholas, Randolph and <a href="Bushrod%20Washington">Bushrod Washington</a>, the resolution failed, 88–80. Mason then voted in the minority as Virginia ratified the constitution on June 25, 1788 by a vote of 89–79. Following the ratification vote, Mason served on a committee chaired by <a href="George%20Wythe">George Wythe</a>, charged with compiling a final list of recommended amendments, and Mason's draft was adopted, but for a few editorial changes. Unreconciled to the result, Mason prepared a fiery written argument, but some felt the tone too harsh and Mason agreed not to publish it.

Defeated at Richmond, Mason returned to Gunston Hall, where he devoted himself to family and local affairs, though still keeping up a vigorous correspondence with political leaders. He resigned from the Fairfax County Court after an act passed by the new Congress required officeholders to take an oath to support the constitution, and in 1790 declined a seat in the Senate which had been left vacant by <a href="William%20Grayson">William Grayson</a>'s death, stating that his health would not permit him to serve, even if he had no other objection. The seat went to <a href="James%20Monroe">James Monroe</a>, who had supported Mason's Anti-Federalist stance, and who had, in 1789, lost to Madison for a seat in the House of Representatives. Judging by his correspondence, Mason softened his stance towards the new federal government, telling Monroe that the constitution "wisely & Properly directs" that ambassadors be confirmed by the Senate. Although Mason predicted that the amendments to be proposed to the states by the <a href="1st%20United%20States%20Congress">First Congress</a> would be "Milk & Water Propositions", he displayed "much Satisfaction" at what became the <a href="United%20States%20Bill%20of%20Rights">Bill of Rights</a> (ratified in 1791) and wrote that if his concerns about the federal courts and other matters were addressed, "I could cheerfully put my Hand & Heart to the new Government".
Washington, who was in 1789 elected the first president, resented Mason's strong stances against the ratification of the constitution, and these differences destroyed their friendship. Although some sources accept that Mason dined at Mount Vernon on November 2, 1788, Peter R. Henriques noted that Washington's diary states that Mr. George Mason was the guest, and as Washington, elsewhere in his diary, always referred to his former colleague at Philadelphia as Colonel Mason, the visitor was likely <a href="George%20Mason%20V">George Mason V</a>, the son. Mason always wrote positively of Washington, and the president said nothing publicly, but in a letter referred to Mason as a "<a href="wikt%3Aquondam">quondam</a> friend" who would not recant his position on the constitution because "pride on the one hand, and want of manly candour on the other, will not I am certain let him acknowledge error in his opinions respecting it [the federal government] though conviction should flash on his mind as strongly as a ray of light". Rutland suggested that the two men were alike in their intolerance of opponents and suspicion of their motives.

Mason had long battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly dominated the county court, if only because they could more easily get to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse to the center of the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and <a href="Historic%20Fairfax%20County%20Courthouse">the courthouse</a> opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to <a href="gout">gout</a>, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.

Although Mason's death attracted little notice, aside from a few mentions in local newspapers, Jefferson mourned "a great loss". Another future president, Monroe, stated that Mason's "patriotic virtues thro[ugh] the revolution will ever be remembered by the citizens of this country".

Mason owned many slaves. In Fairfax County, only George Washington owned more, and Mason is not known to have freed any even in his will, in which his slaves were divided among his children. The childless Washington, in his will, ordered his slaves be freed after his wife's death, and Jefferson <a href="manumission">manumitted</a> a few slaves, mostly of the <a href="Jefferson%E2%80%93Hemings%20controversy">Hemings family</a>, likely including his own children by <a href="Sally%20Hemings">Sally Hemings</a>. According to Broadwater, "In all likelihood, Mason believed, or convinced himself, that he had no options. Mason would have done nothing that might have compromised the financial futures of his nine children." Peter Wallenstein, in his article about how writers have interpreted Mason, argued that he could have freed some slaves without harming his children's future, if he had wanted to.
Mason's biographers and interpreters have long differed about how to present his views on slavery-related issues. A two-volume biography (1892) by Kate Mason Rowland, who Broadwater noted was "a sympathetic white southerner writing during the heyday of <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a>" denied that Mason (her ancestor) was "an "abolitionist" in the modern sense of the term". She noted that Mason "regretted" that there was slavery and was against the slave trade, but wanted slavery protected in the constitution. In 1919, Robert C. Mason published a biography of his prominent ancestor and asserted that George Mason "agreed to free his own slaves and was the first known abolitionist", refusing to sign the constitution, among other reasons because "as it stood then it did not abolish slavery or make preparation for its gradual extinction". Rutland, writing in 1961, asserted that in Mason's final days, "only the coalition [between New England and the Deep South at the Constitutional Convention] in Philadelphia that had bargained away any hope of eliminating slavery left a residue of disgust." <a href="Catherine%20Drinker%20Bowen">Catherine Drinker Bowen</a>, in her widely read 1966 account of the Constitutional Convention, "<a href="Miracle%20at%20Philadelphia">Miracle at Philadelphia</a>", contended that Mason believed slaves to be citizens and was "a fervent abolitionist before the word was coined".

Others took a more nuanced view. Copland and MacMaster deemed Mason's views similar to other Virginians of his class: "Mason's experience with slave labor made him hate slavery but his heavy investment in slave property made it difficult for him to divest himself of a system that he despised". According to Wallenstein, "whatever his occasional rhetoric, George Mason was—if one must choose—proslavery, not antislavery. He acted in behalf of Virginia slaveholders, not Virginia slaves". Broadwater noted, "Mason consistently voiced his disapproval of slavery. His 1787 attack on slavery echoes a similar speech to the Virginia Convention of 1776. His conduct was another matter."

According to Wallenstein, historians and other writers "have had great difficulty coming to grips with Mason in his historical context, and they have jumbled the story in related ways, misleading each other and following each other's errors". Some of this is due to conflation of Mason's views on slavery with that of his desire to ban the African slave trade, which he unquestionably opposed and fought against. His record otherwise is mixed: Virginia banned the importation of slaves from abroad in 1778, while Mason was in the House of Delegates. In 1782, after he had returned to Gunston Hall, it enacted legislation that allowed manumission of adult slaves young enough to support themselves (not older than 45), but a proposal, supported by Mason, to require freed slaves to leave Virginia within a year or be sold at auction, was defeated. Broadwater asserted, "Mason must have shared the fears of Jefferson and countless other whites that whites and free blacks could not live together".

The contradiction between wanting protection for slave property, while opposing the slave trade, was pointed out by delegates to the Richmond convention such as George Nicholas, a supporter of ratification. Mason stated of slavery, "it is far from being a desirable property. But it will involve us in great difficulties and infelicity to be now deprived of them."

There are sites remembering George Mason in Fairfax County. Gunston Hall, donated to the Commonwealth of Virginia by its last private owner, is now "dedicated to the study of George Mason, his home and garden, and life in 18th-century Virginia". <a href="George%20Mason%20University">George Mason University</a>, with its main campus adjacent to the <a href="Fairfax%2C%20Virginia">city of Fairfax</a>, was formerly George Mason College of the <a href="University%20of%20Virginia">University of Virginia</a> from 1959 until it received its present name in 1972. A major landmark on the Fairfax campus is a statue of George Mason by Wendy M. Ross, depicted as he presents his first draft of the Virginia Declaration of Rights.

The <a href="George%20Mason%20Memorial%20Bridge">George Mason Memorial Bridge</a>, part of the <a href="14th%20Street%20Bridge%20%28Potomac%20River%29">14th Street Bridge</a>, connects <a href="Northern%20Virginia">Northern Virginia</a> to Washington, D.C. The <a href="George%20Mason%20Memorial">George Mason Memorial</a> in <a href="West%20Potomac%20Park">West Potomac Park</a> in Washington, also with a statue by Ross, was dedicated on April 9, 2002.

Mason was honored in 1981 by the <a href="United%20States%20Postal%20Service">United States Postal Service</a> with an 18-cent <a href="Great%20Americans%20series">Great Americans series</a> <a href="postage%20stamp">postage stamp</a>. A <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a> of Mason appears in the Chamber of the <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> as one of 23 honoring great lawmakers. Mason's image is located above and to the right of the Speaker's chair; he and Jefferson are the only Americans recognized.

According to Miller, "The succession of New World constitutions of which Virginia's, with Mason as its chief architect, was the first, declared the source of political authority to be the people ... in addition to making clear what a government was entitled to do, most of them were prefaced by a list of individual rights of the citizens ... rights whose maintenance was government's primary reason for being. Mason wrote the first of these lists." Diane D. Pikcunas, in her article prepared for the bicentennial of the U.S. Bill of Rights, wrote that Mason "made the declaration of rights as his personal crusade". Tarter deemed Mason "celebrated as a champion of constitutional order and one of the fathers of the Bill of Rights". Justice <a href="Sandra%20Day%20O%27Connor">Sandra Day O'Connor</a> agreed, "George Mason's greatest contribution to present day Constitutional law was his influence on our Bill of Rights".

Mason's legacy extended overseas, doing so even in his lifetime, and though he never visited Europe, his ideals did. <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20Marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Lafayette</a>'s
"<a href="Declaration%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Man%20and%20of%20the%20Citizen">Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</a>" was written in the early days of the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> under the influence of Jefferson, the U.S. Minister to France. According to historian R.R. Palmer, "there was in fact a remarkable parallel between the French Declaration and the Virginia Declaration of 1776". Another scholar, Richard Morris, concurred, deeming the resemblance between the two texts "too close to be coincidental": "the Virginia statesman George Mason might well have instituted an action of plagiarism".

Donald J. Senese, in the conclusion to the collection of essays on Mason published in 1989, noted that several factors contributed to Mason's obscurity in the century after his death. Older than many who served at Philadelphia and came into prominence with the new federal government, Mason died soon after the constitution came into force and displayed no ambition for federal office, declining a seat in the Senate. Mason left no extensive paper trail, no autobiography <a href="Autobiography%20of%20Benjamin%20Franklin">like Franklin</a>, no diary like Washington or <a href="John%20Adams">John Adams</a>. Washington left papers collected into 100 volumes; for Mason, with many documents lost to fire, there are only three. Mason fought on the side that failed, both at Philadelphia and Richmond, leaving him a loser in a history written by winners—even his speeches to the Constitutional Convention descend through the pen of Madison, a supporter of ratification. After the Richmond convention, he was, according to Senese, "a prophet without honor in his own country".

The increased scrutiny of Mason which has accompanied his rise from obscurity has meant, according to Tarter, that "his role in the creation of some of the most important texts of American liberty is not as clear as it seems". Rutland suggested that Mason showed only "belated concern over the personal rights of citizens". Focusing on Mason's dissent from the constitution, Miller pointed to the intersectional bargain struck over navigation acts and the slave trade, "Mason lost on both counts, and the double defeat was reflected in his attitude thereafter." Wallenstein concluded, "the personal and economic interests of Mason's home state took precedence over a bill of rights".

Whatever his motivations, Mason proved a forceful advocate for a bill of rights whose "Objections" helped accomplish his aims. Rutland noted that "from the opening phrase of his "Objections" to the Bill of Rights that James Madison offered in Congress two years later, the line is so direct that we can say that Mason forced Madison's hand. Federalist supporters of the Constitution could not overcome the protest caused by Mason's phrase 'There is no declaration of rights'." O'Connor wrote that "Mason lost his battle against ratification ... [but] his ideals and political activities have significantly influenced our constitutional jurisprudence." Wallenstein felt that there is much to be learned from Mason:

The procellariids are the most numerous family of tubenoses, and the most diverse. They range in size from the <a href="giant%20petrel">giant petrel</a>s, which are almost as large as the albatrosses, to the prions, which are as small as the larger storm petrels. They feed on <a href="fish">fish</a>, <a href="squid">squid</a> and <a href="crustacea">crustacea</a>, with many also taking <a href="Discards">fisheries discards</a> and <a href="carrion">carrion</a>. All species are accomplished long-distance foragers, and many undertake long <a href="equator">trans-equatorial</a> <a href="bird%20migration">migrations</a>. They are <a href="seabird%20colony">colonial breeders</a>, exhibiting long-term <a href="Monogamy">mate fidelity</a> and <a href="philopatry">site philopatry</a>. In all species, each pair lays a single <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">egg</a> per breeding season. Their incubation times and chick-rearing periods are exceptionally long compared to other birds.

Many procellariids have breeding populations of over several million pairs; others number fewer than 200 birds. Humans have traditionally exploited several species of <a href="fulmar">fulmar</a> and shearwater (known as muttonbirds) for food, fuel, and bait, a practice that continues in a controlled fashion today. Several species are threatened by <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> attacking adults and chicks in breeding colonies and by <a href="long-line%20fishing">long-line fisheries</a>.

The <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> Procellariidae was introduced by the English zoologist <a href="William%20Elford%20Leach">William Elford Leach</a> in a guide to the contents of the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> published in 1820.

According to the famous <a href="DNA%20hybridization">DNA hybridization</a> study into <a href="bird">avian</a> <a href="phylogenetic%20relationship">phylogenetic relationship</a>s by <a href="Sibley-Ahlquist%20taxonomy">Sibley and Ahlquist</a>, the split of the <a href="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a> into the four families occurred around 30 million years ago; a <a href="fossil">fossil</a> bone often attributed to the order, described as the genus "<a href="Tytthostonyx">Tytthostonyx</a>", has been found in rocks dating around the <a href="Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene%20boundary">Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary</a> (70-60 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">mya</a>), but the remains are too incomplete for placement within the Procellariiformes to be certain.
The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock, and the albatrosses next, with the procellariids and diving petrels splitting most recently. Many taxonomists used to retain the <a href="diving%20petrel">diving petrel</a>s in this family also, but today their distinctiveness is considered well supported.

However, modern procellariid genera began to appear possibly just as early as the proposed splitting of the family, with a <a href="Rupelian">Rupelian</a> (Early <a href="Oligocene">Oligocene</a>) fossil from <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a> tentatively attributed to the shearwater genus "Puffinus",
and most modern genera were established by the <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a>. Thus, a basal radiation of the Procellariiformes in the <a href="Eocene">Eocene</a> at least (as with many modern orders of birds) seems likely, especially given that significant anomalies in molecular evolution rates and patterns have been discovered in the entire family ("see also" <a href="Leach%27s%20storm%20petrel">Leach's storm petrel</a>), and molecular dates must be considered extremely tentative. Some genera ("<a href="Argyrodyptes">Argyrodyptes</a>", "<a href="Pterodromoides">Pterodromoides</a>") are only known from fossils. "<a href="Eopuffinus">Eopuffinus</a>" from the <a href="Late%20Paleocene">Late Paleocene</a> is sometimes placed in the Procellariidae, but even its placement in the Procellariiformes is quite doubtful.

Sibley and Ahlquist's taxonomy has included all the members of the Procellariiformes inside the Procellariidae and that family in an enlarged <a href="Ciconiiformes">Ciconiiformes</a>, but this change has not been widely accepted.

The more traditional taxonomy of the family, particularly the split into four groups, has been challenged by recent research. A 1998 study by Gary Nunn and Scott Stanley showed that the fulmarine petrels were indeed a discrete group within the family, as were the gadfly petrels in the genus "Pterodroma".
However the two petrels in the genus "Bulweria" are no longer considered close to the gadfly petrels, instead being moved closer to the shearwaters in the genus "Procellaria". Two genera, "<a href="Pseudobulweria">Pseudobulweria</a>" and "<a href="Lugensa">Lugensa</a>", have been split from the gadfly petrel genus "Pterodroma", with "Pseudobulweria" being phylogenetically closer to the "Puffinus" shearwaters than the "Pterodroma" gadfly petrels,
and "Aphrodroma" (the <a href="Kerguelen%20petrel">Kerguelen petrel</a>) possibly being closely related to the shearwaters or the fulmars. The prions, according to Nunn and Stanley, were among the larger shearwater group. The "Calonectris" shearwaters were placed close to the two "Puffinus" clades (closer to the Puffinus, or small, clade) and both were distant to the "Procellaria" shearwaters. The relationships between the genera and within the genera are still the subject of debate, with researchers <a href="Lumpers%20and%20splitters">lumping and splitting</a> the species and genera within the family and arguing about the position of the genera within the family. Many of the confusing species are among the least known of all seabirds; some of them (like the <a href="Fiji%20petrel">Fiji petrel</a>) have not been seen more than 10 times since their discovery by science, and others' breeding grounds are unknown (like the <a href="Heinroth%27s%20shearwater">Heinroth's shearwater</a>).

There are around 80 <a href="species">species</a> of procellariid in 14 <a href="genus">genera</a>. For a complete list, and notes on different taxonomies, see "<a href="List%20of%20Procellariidae">List of Procellariidae</a>".

The procellariids are small- to medium-sized seabirds. The largest, the <a href="giant%20petrel">giant petrel</a>s with a wingspan of , are almost as large as <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es; the smallest, such as the <a href="fairy%20prion">fairy prion</a> have a wingspan of , are slightly bigger than the <a href="diving%20petrel">diving petrel</a>s. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although females tend to be slighter. Like all Procellariiformes, the procellariids have a characteristic tubular nasal passage used for olfaction. This ability to smell helps to locate patchily distributed prey at sea and may also help locate <a href="seabird%20colony">nesting colonies</a>. The <a href="plumage">plumage</a> of the procellariids is usually dull, with greys, blues, blacks and browns being the usual colours, although some species have striking patterns (such as the <a href="Cape%20petrel">Cape petrel</a>).
The technique of <a href="bird%20flight">flight</a> among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared to an average bird, all procellariids have a high <a href="aspect%20ratio">aspect ratio</a> (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy <a href="wing%20loading">wing loading</a>. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed in order to remain in the air. Most procellariids use two techniques to do this, namely, <a href="dynamic%20soaring">dynamic soaring</a> and <a href="slope%20soaring">slope soaring</a>. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical <a href="wind%20gradient">wind gradient</a> and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.
The giant petrels share with the albatrosses an adaptation known as a shoulder-lock: a sheet of <a href="tendon">tendon</a> that locks the wing when fully extended, allowing the wing to be kept up and out without any muscle effort. Gadfly petrels often feed on the wing, snapping prey without landing on the water. The flight of the smaller prions is similar to that of the <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>s, being highly erratic and involving weaving and even looping the loop. The wings of all species are long and stiff. In some species of shearwater the wings are also used to power the birds underwater while diving for prey. Their heavier wing loadings, in comparison with surface-feeding procellariids, allow these shearwaters to achieve considerable depths (below in the case of the <a href="short-tailed%20shearwater">short-tailed shearwater</a>).

Procellariids generally have weak legs that are set back, and many species move around on land by resting on the breast and pushing themselves forward, often with the help of their wings. The exception to this is the two species of giant petrel, which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below). The feet of shearwaters are set far back on the body for swimming and are of little use when on the ground.

The procellariids are present in all the world's oceans and most of the seas. They are absent from the <a href="Bay%20of%20Bengal">Bay of Bengal</a> and <a href="Hudson%20Bay">Hudson Bay</a>, but are present year round or seasonally in the rest. The seas north of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> are the centre of procellariid <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>, with the most species. Among the four groups, the <a href="fulmarine%20petrel">fulmarine petrel</a>s have a mostly <a href="Polar%20region">polar</a> distribution, with most species living around <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> and one, the <a href="fulmar">northern fulmar</a> ranging in the Northern <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Pacific">Pacific</a> Oceans. The <a href="prion%20%28bird%29">prion</a>s are restricted to the <a href="Southern%20Ocean">Southern Ocean</a>, and the <a href="gadfly%20petrel">gadfly petrel</a>s are found mostly in the tropics with some temperate species. The <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s are the most widespread group and breed in most temperate and tropical seas, although by a <a href="biogeography">biogeographical</a> quirk are absent as breeders from the North Pacific.
Many procellariids undertake long annual <a href="bird%20migration">migrations</a> in the non-breeding season. Southern species of shearwater such as the <a href="sooty%20shearwater">sooty shearwater</a> and <a href="short-tailed%20shearwater">short-tailed shearwater</a>, breeding on islands off <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, New Zealand and <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, undertake transequatorial migrations of millions of birds up to the waters off <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a> and back each year during the austral winter. <a href="Manx%20shearwater">Manx shearwater</a>s from the North Atlantic also undertake transequatorial migrations from Western Europe and North America to the waters off Brazil in the South Atlantic. The mechanisms of <a href="navigation">navigation</a> are poorly understood, but displacement experiments where individuals were removed from colonies and flown to far-flung release sites have shown that they are able to home in on their colonies with remarkable precision. A Manx shearwater released in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a> returned to its colony in <a href="Skomer">Skomer</a>, <a href="Wales">Wales</a> within 13 days, a distance of 5,150 kilometres (3,200 mi).

The diet of the procellariids is the most diverse of all the Procellariiformes, as are the methods employed to obtain it. With the exception of the <a href="giant%20petrel">giant petrel</a>s, all procellariids are exclusively <a href="ocean">marine</a>, and the diet of all species is dominated by either <a href="fish">fish</a>, <a href="squid">squid</a>, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and <a href="carrion">carrion</a>, or some combination thereof.

The majority of species are surface feeders, obtaining food that has been pushed to the surface by other predators or currents, or have floated in death. Among the surface feeders some, principally the <a href="gadfly%20petrel">gadfly petrel</a>s, can obtain food by dipping from flight, while most of the rest feed while sitting on the water. These surface feeders are dependent on their prey being close to the surface, and for this reason procellariids are often found in association with other predators or oceanic convergences. Studies have shown strong associations between many different kinds of <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s, including <a href="wedge-tailed%20shearwater">wedge-tailed shearwater</a>s, and <a href="dolphin">dolphin</a>s and <a href="tuna">tuna</a>, which push shoaling fish up towards the surface.

The <a href="fulmarine%20petrel">fulmarine petrel</a>s are generalists, which for the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and <a href="pinniped">seals</a>. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies according to <a href="sex">sex</a>, with the females taking more <a href="krill">krill</a> and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion in range of the northern fulmar in the <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a>.
Three of the six <a href="prion%20%28bird%29">prion</a> species have bills filled with <a href="Lamellae%20%28zoology%29">lamellae</a>, which act as filters to sift <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a> from the water. Water is forced through the lamellae and small prey items are collected. This technique is often used in conjunction with a method known as hydroplaning where the bird dips its bill beneath the surface and propels itself forward with wings and feet as if walking on the water.

Many of the <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s in the genus "<a href="Puffinus">Puffinus</a>" and "<a href="Ardenna">Ardenna</a>" are proficient divers. While it has long been known that they regularly dive from the surface to pursue prey, using both their wings and feet for propulsion, the depth that they are able to dive to was not appreciated (or anticipated) until scientists began to deploy maximum-depth recorders on foraging birds. Studies of both long-distance migrants such as the <a href="sooty%20shearwater">sooty shearwater</a> and more sedentary species such as the <a href="black-vented%20shearwater">black-vented shearwater</a> have shown maximum diving depths of and . Tropical shearwaters, such as the wedge-tailed shearwater and the <a href="Audubon%27s%20shearwater">Audubon's shearwater</a>, also dive in order to hunt, making the shearwaters the only tropical seabirds capable of exploiting that ecological niche (all other tropical seabirds feed close to the surface). Many other species of procellariid, from <a href="white-chinned%20petrel">white-chinned petrel</a>s to <a href="slender-billed%20prion">slender-billed prion</a>s, dive to a couple of metres below the surface, though not as proficiently or as frequently as the shearwaters.

The procellariids are <a href="seabird%20colony">colonial</a>, nesting for the most part on islands. These colonies vary in size from over a million birds to just a few pairs, and can be densely concentrated or widely spaced. At one extreme the <a href="greater%20shearwater">greater shearwater</a> nests in concentrations of 1 pair per square metre in three colonies of more than 1 million pairs, whereas the giant petrels nest in clumped but widely spaced territories that barely qualify as colonial. Colonies are usually located near the coast, but some species nest far inland and even at high altitudes (such as the <a href="Barau%27s%20petrel">Barau's petrel</a>).

Most <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s are colonial, and the reasons for colonial behaviour are assumed to be similar, if incompletely understood by scientists. Procellariids for the most part have weak legs and are unable to easily take off, making them highly vulnerable to <a href="mammal">mammal</a>ian predators. Most procellariid colonies are located on islands that have historically been free of mammals; for this reason some species cannot help but be colonial as they are limited to a few locations to breed. Even species that breed on continental <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, such as the <a href="Antarctic%20petrel">Antarctic petrel</a>, are forced by habitat preference (snow-free north-facing rock) to breed in just a few locations.

Most procellariids' nests are in burrows or on the surface on open ground, with a smaller number nesting under the cover of vegetation (such as in a forest). All the fulmarine petrels bar the <a href="snow%20petrel">snow petrel</a> nest in the open, the snow petrel instead nesting inside natural crevices. Of the rest of the procellariids the majority nest in burrows or crevices, with a few tropical species nesting in the open. There are several reasons for these differences. The fulmarine petrels are probably precluded from burrowing by their large size (the crevice-nesting snow petrel is the smallest fulmarine petrel) and the high latitudes they breed in, where frozen ground is difficult to burrow into. The smaller size of the other species, and their lack of agility on land, mean that even on islands free from mammal predators they are still vulnerable to <a href="skua">skua</a>s, <a href="gull">gull</a>s and other avian predators, something the aggressive <a href="stomach%20oil">oil</a>-spitting <a href="fulmar">fulmar</a>s are not. The chicks of all species are vulnerable to predation, but the chicks of fulmarine petrels can defend themselves in a similar fashion to their parents. In the higher latitudes there are thermal advantages to burrow nesting, as the temperature is more stable than on the surface, and there is no <a href="wind-chill">wind-chill</a> to contend with. The absence of skuas, gulls and other predatory birds on <a href="tropical">tropical</a> islands is why some <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s and two species of <a href="gadfly%20petrel">gadfly petrel</a> can nest in the open. This has the advantages of reducing competition with burrow nesters from other species and allowing open-ground nesters to nest on <a href="coral">coral</a>line islets without soil for burrowing. Procellariids that burrow in order to avoid predation almost always attend their colonies <a href="nocturnal%20animal">nocturnally</a> in order to reduce predation as well. Of the ground-nesting species the majority attend their colonies during the day, the exception being the <a href="herald%20petrel">herald petrel</a>, which is thought to be vulnerable to the diurnal <a href="white-bellied%20sea%20eagle">white-bellied sea eagle</a>.
Procellariids display high levels of <a href="philopatry">philopatry</a>, exhibiting both natal philopatry and site fidelity. Natal philopatry, the tendency of a bird to breed close to where it hatched, is strong among all the Procellariiformes. The evidence for natal philopatry comes from several sources, not the least of which is the existence of several procellariid species that are endemic to a single island. The study of <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> also provides evidence of restricted <a href="gene%20flow">gene flow</a> between different colonies, and has been used to show philopatry in <a href="fairy%20prion">fairy prion</a>s. <a href="Bird%20ringing">Bird ringing</a> also provides compelling evidence of philopatry; a study of <a href="Cory%27s%20shearwater">Cory's shearwater</a>s nesting near <a href="Corsica">Corsica</a> found that of nine out of 61 male chicks that returned to breed at their natal colony actually bred in the burrow they were raised in. This tendency towards philopatry is stronger in some species than others, and several species readily prospect potential new colony sites and colonise them. It is hypothesised that there is a cost to dispersing to a new site, the chance of not finding a mate of the same species, that selects against it for rarer species, whereas there is probably an advantage to dispersal for species that have colony sites that change dramatically during periods of <a href="Glacial%20motion">glacial advance or retreat</a>. There are also differences in the tendency to disperse based on sex, with females being more likely to breed away from the natal site.

Procellariids, as well as having strong natal philopatry, exhibit strong site fidelity, returning to the same nesting site, burrow or territory in sequential years. The figure varies for different species but is high for most species, an estimated 91% for <a href="Bulwer%27s%20petrel">Bulwer's petrel</a>s. The strength of this fidelity can also vary with sex; almost 85% of male <a href="Cory%27s%20shearwater">Cory's shearwater</a>s return to the same burrow to breed the year after a successful breeding attempt, while the figure for females is around 76%. This tendency towards using the same site from year to year is matched by strong <a href="Monogamy">mate fidelity</a>, with birds breeding with the same partner for many years; in fact it is suggested that the two are linked, site fidelity being a means by which partnered birds could meet at the beginning of the breeding season. One pair of <a href="northern%20fulmar">northern fulmar</a>s bred as a pair in the same site for 25 years. Like the <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es the procellariids take several years to reach sexual maturity, though due to the greater variety of sizes and lifestyles, the age of first breeding stretches from just three years in the smaller species to 12 years in the larger ones.
The procellariids lack the elaborate breeding dances of the albatrosses, in no small part due to the tendency of most of them to attend colonies at night and breed in burrows, where visual displays are useless. The <a href="fulmarine%20petrel">fulmarine petrel</a>s, which nest on the surface and attend their colonies diurnally, do use a repertoire of stereotyped <a href="ethology">behaviours</a> such as cackling, preening, head waving and nibbling, but for most species courtship interactions are limited to some billing (rubbing the two bills together) in the burrow and the vocalisations made by all species. The calls serve a number of functions: they are used territorially to protect burrows or territories and to call for mates. Each call type is unique to a particular species and indeed it is possible for procellariids to identify the sex of the bird calling as well. It may also be possible to assess the quality of potential mates; a study of <a href="blue%20petrel">blue petrel</a>s found a link between the <a href="rhythm">rhythm</a> and duration of calls and the body mass of the bird. The ability of an individual to recognise its mate has also been demonstrated in several species.

Like most seabirds, the majority of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the <a href="white-headed%20petrel">white-headed petrel</a>, will skip a breeding season after successfully <a href="fledge">fledging</a> a chick, and some of the smaller species, such as the <a href="Christmas%20shearwater">Christmas shearwater</a>s, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. <a href="Climate">Climate</a> and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher <a href="latitude">latitude</a>s always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the <a href="tropical">tropical</a> <a href="wedge-tailed%20shearwater">wedge-tailed shearwater</a>, breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among the species that exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.

Procellariids begin to attend their nesting colony around one month prior to laying. Males will arrive first and attend the colony more frequently than females, partly in order to protect a site or burrow from potential competitors. Prior to laying there is a period known as the pre-laying exodus in which both the male and female are away from the colony, building up reserves in order to lay and undertake the first incubation stint respectively. This pre-laying exodus can vary in length from 9 days (as in the <a href="Cape%20petrel">Cape petrel</a>) to around 50 days in <a href="Atlantic%20petrel">Atlantic petrel</a>s. All procellariids lay one <a href="egg%20%28biology%29">egg</a> per pair per breeding season, in common with the rest of the Procellariiformes. The egg is large compared to that of other birds, weighing 6–24% of the female's weight. Immediately after laying the female goes back to sea to feed while the male takes over incubation. Incubation duties are shared by both sexes in shifts that vary in length between species, individuals and even the stage of incubation. The longest recorded shift was 29 days by a <a href="Murphy%27s%20petrel">Murphy's petrel</a> from <a href="Henderson%20Island%20%28Pitcairn%20Islands%29">Henderson Island</a>; the typical length of a <a href="gadfly%20petrel">gadfly petrel</a> stint is between 13 and 19 days. <a href="Fulmarine%20petrel">Fulmarine petrel</a>s, <a href="shearwater">shearwater</a>s and <a href="prion%20%28bird%29">prions</a> tend to have shorter stints, averaging between 3 and 13 days. Incubation takes a long time, from 40 days for the smaller species (such as prions) to around 55 days for the larger species. The incubation period is longer if eggs are abandoned temporarily; procellariid eggs are resistant to chilling and can still hatch after being left unattended for a few days.

After hatching the chick is brooded by a parent until it is large enough to <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulate</a> efficiently, and in some cases defend itself from predation. This guard stage lasts a short while for burrow-nesting species (2–3 days) but longer for surface nesting <a href="fulmar">fulmar</a>s (around 16–20 days) and <a href="giant%20petrel">giant petrel</a>s (20–30 days). After the guard stage both parents feed the chick. In many species the parent's foraging strategy alternates between short trips lasting 1–3 days and longer trips of 5 days. The shorter trips, which are taken over the continental shelf, benefit the chick with faster growth, but longer trips to more productive <a href="pelagic%20zone">pelagic</a> feeding grounds are needed for the parents to maintain their own body condition. The meals are composed of both prey items and <a href="stomach%20oil">stomach oil</a>, an <a href="food%20energy">energy</a>-rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items. This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items, and gives procellariids and other Procellariifromes their distinctive musty smell. Chick development is quite slow for <a href="bird">bird</a>s, with <a href="fledge">fledging</a> taking place at around 2 months after hatching for the smaller species and 4 months for the largest species. The chicks of some species are abandoned by the parents; parents of other species continue to bring food to the nesting site after the chick has left. Chicks put on weight quickly and some can outweigh their parents; although, they will slim down before they leave the nest. All procellariid chicks fledge by themselves, and there is no further parental care after fledging. Life expectancy of Procellariidae is between 15 and 20 years; although, the oldest recorded member was a <a href="northern%20fulmar">northern fulmar</a> that was over 50 years.

Procellariids have been a seasonally abundant source of food for people wherever people have been able to reach their colonies. Early records of human exploitation of shearwaters (along with <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es and <a href="cormorant">cormorant</a>s) come from the remains of <a href="hunter-gatherer">hunter-gatherer</a> <a href="midden">midden</a>s in southern <a href="Chile">Chile</a>, where <a href="sooty%20shearwater">sooty shearwater</a>s were taken 5000 years ago. More recently procellariids have been hunted for food by Europeans, particularly the <a href="northern%20fulmar">northern fulmar</a> in Europe, and various species by <a href="Inuit">Inuit</a>, and sailors around the world. The hunting pressure on the <a href="Bermuda%20petrel">Bermuda petrel</a>, or cahow, was so intense that the species nearly became extinct and did go missing for 300 years. The name of one species, the <a href="providence%20petrel">providence petrel</a>, is derived from its (seemingly) miraculous arrival on <a href="Norfolk%20Island">Norfolk Island</a>, where it provided a windfall for starving European settlers; within ten years the providence petrel was extinct on Norfolk. Several species of procellariid <a href="Late%20Quaternary%20prehistoric%20birds%23Procellariiformes">have gone extinct</a> in the Pacific since the arrival of man, and their remains have been found in middens dated to that time. More sustainable shearwater harvesting industries developed in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> and <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, where the practice of harvesting what are known as <a href="shearwater">muttonbird</a>s continues today.

While some species of procellariid have populations that number in the millions, many species are much less common and several are threatened with <a href="extinction">extinction</a>. Human activities have caused dramatic declines in the numbers of some species, particularly species that were originally restricted to one island. According to the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered. Procellariids are threatened by <a href="introduced%20species">introduced species</a> on their <a href="seabird%20colony">breeding grounds</a>, marine <a href="fisheries">fisheries</a>, <a href="pollution">pollution</a>, exploitation and possibly by <a href="global%20warming">climate change</a>.

The most pressing threat for many species, particularly the smaller ones, comes from species introduced to their colonies. Procellariids overwhelmingly breed on islands away from land predators such as mammals, and for the most part have lost the defensive adaptations needed to deal with them (with the exception of the <a href="stomach%20oil">oil</a>-spitting <a href="fulmarine%20petrel">fulmarine petrel</a>s). The introduction of mammal predators such as <a href="feral%20cat">feral cat</a>s, <a href="rat">rat</a>s, <a href="mongoose">mongoose</a>s and even <a href="mice">mice</a> can have disastrous results for <a href="island%20tameness">ecologically naïve</a> <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s. These predators can either directly attack and kill breeding adults, or, more commonly, attack eggs and chicks. Burrowing species that leave their young unattended at a very early stage are particularly vulnerable to attack. Studies on <a href="grey-faced%20petrel">grey-faced petrel</a>s breeding on New Zealand's <a href="Whale%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Whale Island</a> (Moutohora) have shown that a population under heavy pressure from <a href="Norway%20rat">Norway rat</a>s will produce virtually no young during a breeding season, whereas if the rats are controlled (through the use of poison), breeding success is much higher. That study also highlighted the role that non-predatory introduced species can play in harming seabirds; introduced <a href="rabbit">rabbit</a>s on the island caused little damage to the petrels, other than damaging their burrows, but they also acted as a food source for the rats during the non-breeding season, which allowed rat numbers to be higher than they otherwise would be, resulting in more predators for the petrels to contend with. Interactions with introduced species can be quite complex. <a href="Gould%27s%20petrel">Gould's petrel</a>s breed only on two islands, <a href="Cabbage%20Tree%20Island">Cabbage Tree Island</a> and <a href="Boondelbah%20Island">Boondelbah Island</a> off <a href="Port%20Stephens%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Port Stephens (New South Wales)</a>. Introduced rabbits destroyed the forest understory on Cabbage Tree Island; this both increased the vulnerability of the petrels to natural predators and left them vulnerable to the sticky fruits of the birdlime tree ("<a href="Pisonia%20umbellifera">Pisonia umbellifera</a>"), a native plant. In the natural state these fruits lodge in the understory of the forest, but with the understory removed the fruits fall to the ground where the petrels move about, sticking to their feathers and making flight impossible.
Larger species of procellariid face similar problems to the <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es with <a href="long-line%20fishing">long-line fisheries</a>. These species readily take offal from fishing boats and will also steal bait from the long lines as they are being set, risking becoming snared on the hooks and drowning. In the case of the <a href="spectacled%20petrel">spectacled petrel</a> this has led to the species undergoing a large decline and its listing as critically endangered. Diving species, most especially the shearwaters, are also vulnerable to <a href="gillnet">gillnet</a> fisheries. Studies of gill-net fisheries show that shearwaters (sooty and short-tailed) compose 60% of the seabirds killed by gill-nets in Japanese waters and 40% in Monterey Bay, California in the 1980s, with the total number of shearwaters killed in Japan being between 65,000 and 125,000 per annum over the same study period (1978–1981).

Procellariids are vulnerable to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic <a href="flotsam">flotsam</a> is a problem for the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the <a href="Barau%27s%20petrel">Barau's petrel</a>, the <a href="Newell%27s%20shearwater">Newell's shearwater</a> or the <a href="Cory%27s%20shearwater">Cory's shearwater</a>, which nest high up on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are <a href="fledge">fledging</a> are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a>.

Conservationists are working with governments and fisheries in order to prevent further declines and increase populations of endangered procellariids. Progress has been made in protecting many colonies where most species are most vulnerable. On 20 June 2001, the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Albatrosses%20and%20Petrels">Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels</a> was signed by seven major fishing nations. The agreement lays out a plan to manage fisheries by-catch, protect breeding sites, promote conservation in the industry, and research threatened species. The developing field of <a href="island%20restoration">island restoration</a>, where introduced species are removed and native species and habitats restored, has been used in several procellariid recovery programmes. Invasive species such as rats, feral cats and pigs have been either removed or controlled in many remote islands in the tropical Pacific (such as the <a href="Northwestern%20Hawaiian%20Islands">Northwestern Hawaiian Islands</a>), around New Zealand (where island restoration was developed), and in the south <a href="Atlantic">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>s. The grey-faced petrels of Whale Island (mentioned above) have been achieving much higher fledging successes after the introduced Norway rats were finally completely removed. At sea, procellariids threatened by long-line fisheries can be protected using techniques such as setting long-line bait at night, dying the bait blue, setting the bait underwater, increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird by-catch. A further step towards conservation has been the signing of the 2001 <a href="treaty">treaty</a> the <a href="Agreement%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Albatrosses%20and%20Petrels">Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels</a>, which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by eight countries, <a href="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="Ecuador">Ecuador</a>, <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="France">France</a>, <a href="Peru">Peru</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce by-catch and pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands.

"Procellariidae" comes from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> word "procella", which means "a violent wind" or "a storm", and "idae", which is added to symbolize "family". Therefore, a violent wind or a storm refers to the fact that members of this <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> like stormy and windy weather.

Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan

Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">KBE</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Sylvester">KCSS</a> (, , 1933 – 2003) served as <a href="United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> from 1966 to 1977, during which he reoriented the agency's focus beyond Europe and prepared it for an explosion of complex refugee issues. He was also a proponent of greater collaboration between non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and UN agencies. The Prince's interest in ecological issues led him to establish the "Bellerive Foundation" in the late 1970s, and he was a knowledgeable and respected collector of <a href="Islamic%20art">Islamic art</a>.

Born in Paris, France, he was the son of <a href="Aga%20Khan%20III">Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan</a> and Princess Andrée Aga Khan. He married twice, but had no children of his own. Prince Sadruddin died of cancer at the age of 70, and was buried in Switzerland.

Born in <a href="Neuilly-sur-Seine">Neuilly-sur-Seine</a>, France, he was the only child of <a href="Aga%20Khan%20III">Sir Sultan Mahomed Shah Aga Khan III</a> and his French-born second wife, the former Andrée Joséphine Carron. He received his early education in <a href="Lausanne">Lausanne</a>, Switzerland, before graduating <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a> in 1954 from <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a>. At Harvard, he lived in Eliot House with <a href="Paul%20Matisse">Paul Matisse</a>, grandson of French artist <a href="Henri%20Matisse">Henri Matisse</a>, with future <a href="Paris%20Review">Paris Review</a> founders <a href="George%20Plimpton">George Plimpton</a> and <a href="John%20Train%20%28investment%20advisor%29">John Train</a>, and with <a href="Stephen%20James%20Joyce">Stephen Joyce</a>, grandson of Irish writer <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>. Along with Plimpton, he was an editor for the <a href="Harvard%20Lampoon">Harvard Lampoon</a>. After three years of post-graduate research at the Harvard Center for Middle Eastern Studies, Prince Sadruddin began a lifelong career of international service.

Although he was raised in Europe by his French mother, his father, who was the 48th hereditary <a href="Imam">Imam</a> of the <a href="Nizari">Nizari</a> <a href="Ismaili">Ismaili Muslims</a>, had a strong influence on him. He recalled that his father "insisted that I learnt the Koran and encouraged me to understand the basic traditions and beliefs of Islam but without imposing any particular views. He was an overwhelming personality but open-minded and liberal."

Together with his father Prince Sadruddin traveled widely in <a href="Muslim%20world%23Geography">Muslim countries</a>, coming into contact with his Islamic roots from a young age. He described Iran as the cradle of his family, though he never lived there. When he was a child, his paternal grandmother used to recite to him the great epic poems of Persian history. He held <a href="French%20nationality%20law">French</a>, <a href="Iranian%20nationality%20law">Iranian</a>, and <a href="Swiss%20nationality%20law">Swiss</a> <a href="citizenship">citizenship</a>, and was fluent in French, English, German and Italian, while also speaking some <a href="Persian%20language">Persian</a> and <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>.

Prince Sadruddin joined the <a href="United%20Nations%20Educational%2C%20Scientific%20and%20Cultural%20Organization">United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization</a> (UNESCO) in 1958, and became the Executive Secretary to its International Action Committee for the Preservation of <a href="Nubia">Nubia</a> in 1961. This initiative brought together archaeologists from Eastern Europe and the West at the height of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. The construction of the <a href="Aswan%20Dam">Aswan Dam</a> threatened <a href="ancient%20Egypt">ancient Egypt</a>ian treasures including <a href="Abu%20Simbel">Abu Simbel</a>, the temples of <a href="Philae">Philae</a> and Kalabsha, and the Christian churches of Nubia. He would later describe it as "one of UNESCO's great achievements" because of the challenging historical context in which it took place—in particular the ongoing tensions in the Middle East and the Cold War.

Prince Sadruddin began as a Special Envoy to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1959 with a focus on World Refugee Year (1959–1960). The initiative became known for its "Stamp Plan", a <a href="Philately">philatelic</a> programme that raised funds through United Nations member countries, as well as the support of the <a href="Universal%20Postal%20Union">Universal Postal Union</a>. At the time, the UNHCR's resources were primarily focused on supporting <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s crossing from Eastern Europe.

In January 1966, Prince Sadruddin was appointed United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees after serving for three years as Deputy High Commissioner. At the age of 33 he became the youngest person ever to lead the UNHCR. For the next twelve years he directed the UN refugee agency through one of its most difficult periods, coordinating the international response to the <a href="Bangladesh%20Liberation%20War">1971 Bangladesh crisis</a> that uprooted people, the <a href="Burundi%20genocide%20%281972%29">1972 exodus</a> of hundreds of thousands of <a href="Hutus">Hutus</a> from Burundi to Tanzania, and the <a href="Vietnamese%20boat%20people">Vietnamese boat people</a> tragedy of the mid-1970s. In 1972, Prince Sadruddin played a key role in finding new homes for tens of thousands of <a href="Expulsion%20of%20Asians%20in%20Uganda%20in%201972">South Asians expelled</a> from Uganda by <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a>.

Prince Sadruddin's determination not to discriminate between European and <a href="Third%20World">Third World</a> refugees helped prepare the UNHCR for a change in the landscape of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but had been replaced by millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.

Prince Sadruddin had, since 1978, been variously: Special Consultant and Chargé de Mission to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, <a href="Special%20Rapporteur%20%28UN%29">Special Rapporteur</a> of the <a href="UN%20Human%20Rights%20Commission">UN Human Rights Commission</a> and Convenor and Co-Chairman of the Independent Commission on International Humanitarian Issues and of the Independent Working Group on the UN Financial Emergency. He was later Coordinator for United Nations Humanitarian and Economic Assistance Programmes Relating to the People of Afghanistan and Executive Delegate of the Secretary-General for a United Nations Inter-Agency Humanitarian Programme, which dealt with problems of Iraq's border areas.

His appointment in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a> was deeply suspicious of the UN, and was loath to do anything that would benefit the country's <a href="Shia%20Muslims">Shia Muslims</a>. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister <a href="Tariq%20Aziz">Tariq Aziz</a> for the establishment of a UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.

Prince Sadruddin was nominated and passed over twice for the post of UN Secretary-General. Although he won the 1981 vote, the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> considered him too Western and vetoed his election. When he was nominated again in 1991, the United States and Britain expressed their disagreement with his belief in a policy of boosting aid to Iraq.

In 1977, Prince Sadruddin, together with <a href="Denis%20de%20Rougemont">Denis de Rougemont</a> and a few other friends, established a Geneva-based think-tank, "Groupe de Bellerive" (named after <a href="Collonge-Bellerive">Bellerive</a>, the municipality where he lived in Geneva), and a non-profit organisation, the "Bellerive Foundation". The foundation collaborated with international institutions, British and Scandinavian bilateral aid organizations, and other NGOs such as the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wide Fund for Nature</a> (WWF). It became a leading grassroots action group promoting <a href="Environmental%20movement">environmental protection</a>, <a href="Conservation%20movement">natural resource conservation</a> and the safeguarding of life in all its forms.

Initially, Bellerive worked with <a href="UNICEF">UNICEF</a> and the <a href="United%20Nations%20Children%27s%20Fund">United Nations Children's Fund</a> in the struggle against <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>. Prince Sadruddin was motivated in part by what he called "ecological refugees", who were forced to leave regions that could no longer sustain them due to <a href="desertification">desertification</a> and other environmental changes. The foundation worked with Swiss specialists to develop low-cost, energy-efficient cooking stoves that relied on <a href="renewable%20energy">renewable energy</a> sources such as <a href="methane">methane</a> and <a href="biogas">biogas</a>. It distributed these among needy rural populations, primarily in Africa. Other areas of concern for Bellerive included the proliferation of <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a>, and the protection of threatened species.

As a resident of Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin was concerned about the impact of insensitive tourist development and deforestation on the <a href="Alps">European Alps</a>. At the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a> in 1990, he launched "Alp Action" to protect the mountain ecosystem and preserve the Alps' cultural diversity and vitality. The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce the impact of outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the <a href="Canadian%20Rockies">Canadian Rockies</a>.

A long-standing trustee and former Vice-President of the World Wide Fund for Nature International, Prince Sadruddin led Bellerive's support for threatened species. Bellerive was also amongst the first organisations to warn of the potential human health hazards of modern intensive farming methods.

In May 2006, the activities of the Bellerive Foundation were merged into the Geneva-based <a href="Aga%20Khan%20Foundation">Aga Khan Foundation</a> (founded in 1967 by Prince Sadruddin's nephew <a href="Aga%20Khan%20IV">Karim Aga Khan IV</a>) to form the "Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan Fund for the Environment". The US$10 million fund is dedicated to finding practical solutions to environmental problems. The fund concentrates its activities in six areas that were important to Prince Sadruddin: environmental education; natural resource management in fragile zones; nature parks and wildlife reserves; environmentally and culturally appropriate tourism infrastructure; environmental health; and research.

Prince Sadruddin died of cancer in Boston, Massachusetts, on 2003, coincidentally, the same day as his elder half-brother <a href="Prince%20Aly%20Khan">Prince Aly Khan</a> had died 43 years earlier. His body was conveyed to Switzerland, where members of the diplomatic corps, government officials and close friends were invited to pay their last respects at the <a href="Bellerive%20Castle">Château de Bellerive</a>, and sign books of condolence at various locations around the world. <a href="Ruud%20Lubbers">Ruud Lubbers</a>, then UNHCR High Commissioner, expressed the sadness of the UNHCR and the entire humanitarian community, commenting that "he left an indelible print on UNHCR's history—leading the agency through some of the most challenging moments. Sadruddin's name became synonymous with UNHCR."

In accordance with his wishes, Prince Sadruddin's burial took place at a private ceremony attended by members of his family. Traditional Muslim ceremonies were led by Sheikh Ahmed Ahmed Ibrahim, who leads the prayers at the mausoleum of the Prince's father, Aga Khan III, in <a href="Aswan">Aswan</a>, Egypt. Last respects were paid beneath the arches of the Château de Bellerive, before the bier was carried to the local cemetery of Collonge-Bellerive. A tribute from the <a href="Canton%20of%20Geneva">Canton of Geneva</a> read: "The destiny of this family of high Persian nobility, descended from the Prophet Muhammad, is inextricably linked to that of this small European town and to an ambitious project to improve the human condition."

The United Nations community celebrated Prince Sadruddin's life at a memorial ceremony held in his honour at its headquarters in New York on 2003. He was remembered for representing the moral and compassionate side of the international community. Then United Nations Secretary-General <a href="Kofi%20Annan">Kofi Annan</a> commented that "he combined respect for humankind with concern for our environment. He worked on behalf of the poor and dispossessed, while celebrating humanity through culture and art." He concluded his tribute by praising Prince Sadruddin as "a role model to many of us ... his example will continue to inspire new world citizens for several generations to come."

He was survived by his wife of 31 years, Princess Catherine; his three stepsons Alexandre, Marc and Nicolas; as well as his nephews and niece Prince Karim, Prince Amyn and Princess Yasmin; and his cousin Mme. Francoise Carron. It was Prince Sadruddin's and Princess Catherine's wish that their remains be buried in Muslim soil in Egypt.

Prince Sadruddin's life was deeply influenced by his family roots and cultural heritage. Prince Sadruddin's grandmother was the granddaughter of the <a href="Qajar%20dynasty">Qajar</a> Emperor <a href="Fat%E2%80%B2h%20Ali%20Shah%20Qajar">Fath'Ali Shah</a>.

International service was a family tradition, and throughout his life Prince Sadruddin was surrounded by it. His father held influential roles in <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a>. He also served two terms as President of the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>. Prince Sadruddin's older half-brother, <a href="Prince%20Aly%20Khan">Prince Aly Khan</a>, was Pakistan's Ambassador to the United Nations. Prince Karim Aga Khan IV, the 49th Imam of the Ismaili Muslims and present <a href="Aga%20Khan">Aga Khan</a>, was a nephew to Prince Sadruddin, and is the founder and Chairman of the <a href="Aga%20Khan%20Development%20Network">Aga Khan Development Network</a>. His brother, Prince Amyn, had previously worked with the United Nations before joining the Aga Khan's secretariat. Meanwhile, Prince Sadruddin's niece <a href="Yasmin%20Aga%20Khan">Princess Yasmin</a>, has devoted herself to the fight against <a href="Alzheimer%27s%20disease">Alzheimer's disease</a>.

Prince Sadruddin had a taste for culture, including music, art and literature. He was a familiar figure at music festivals and other cultural events, both in Europe and overseas. His concern for the <a href="Natural%20environment">environment</a> was complemented by his enjoyment of the outdoors; he was a keen <a href="Skiing">skier</a> and an accomplished <a href="Sailing">sailor</a>. While still at Harvard in 1953, Prince Sadruddin became the founding publisher of the "<a href="Paris%20Review">Paris Review</a>", which was established with the aim of bringing original creative work to the fore. Every year the "Review" awards the <a href="Aga%20Khan%20Prize%20for%20Fiction">Aga Khan Prize for Fiction</a> (established by his father) for the best short story that it published in the past year.

On 27 August 1957, in <a href="Bellerive%2C%20Switzerland">Bellerive</a>, Switzerland, Prince Sadruddin married Nina Dyer (1930–1965). An <a href="Anglo-Indian">Anglo-Indian</a> fashion model, she was the former wife of <a href="Baron%20Hans%20Heinrich%20Thyssen-Bornemisza">Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza</a>. She converted to Islam, taking the name "Shirin" (lit. "sweetness"). They had no children and divorced in 1962. Dyer committed suicide in 1965.

His second marriage took place in November 1972, in the <a href="British%20West%20Indies">British West Indies</a>. He married Catherine Aleya Beriketti Sursock who was born in <a href="Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, Egypt in 1938. She was formerly the wife of Lebanese aristocrat Cyril <a href="Sursock%20family">Sursock</a> (son of <a href="Nicolas%20Sursock">Nicolas Sursock</a> and <a href="Don%20%28honorific%29">Donna</a> Vittoria <a href="Palazzo%20Serra%20di%20Cassano">Serra of the Dukes di Cassano</a>). She and Prince Sadruddin had no children, but from this marriage he gained three stepchildren : Alexandre Sursock (married to Thai Princess "<a href="Mom%20Rajawongse">Mom Rajawongse</a>" Charuvan Rangsit Prayurasakdi), Marc Sursock and Nicolas Sursock.

During his lifetime Prince Sadruddin assembled one of the finest private collections of <a href="Islamic%20art">Islamic art</a> in the world. He became a knowledgeable and respected collector, accumulating a priceless collection of paintings, drawings, <a href="manuscript">manuscript</a>s and <a href="Miniature%20%28illuminated%20manuscript%29">miniature</a>s over 50 years. He had also gathered a collection of primitive and <a href="African%20art">African art</a> which he sold sometime prior to 1985.

Prince Sadruddin's interest in Islamic art was sparked in his youth by his paternal grandmother's library of Persian books, <a href="Mysticism">mystical texts</a> and <a href="Astrology">astrological treatises</a>. While at Harvard in the 1950s, he would make purchases in New York, and eventually began to acquire from dealers in Paris, Geneva and London. He would bid regularly at <a href="Sotheby%27s">Sotheby's</a> and <a href="Christie%27s">Christie's</a> auctions in Europe and North America. For advice, he looked to his friend <a href="Stuart%20Cary%20Welch">Stuart Cary Welch</a>, a noted historian of Islamic art at Harvard University.

His collection is vast and diverse, and includes Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and Indian pieces dating from the 10th century. One example is a <a href="Quran">Quran</a>ic page of North African origin written with gold lettering in the <a href="Kufic">Kufic script</a> – it is more than 1,000 years old. Prince Sadruddin's Persian roots are well represented in <a href="Calligraphy">calligraphic</a> as well as pictoral specimens reflecting a range of periods and dynastic patrons. Also included are several examples of <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> callgraphies, manuscripts and paintings.

Over the years, parts of his collection were exhibited in New York, London, and <a href="Zurich">Zurich</a>, including a touring show, "Princes, Poets and Paladins", which was organized by the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> in 1998. The full collection has been housed at the new <a href="Aga%20Khan%20Museum">museum</a> established by Prince Sadruddin's nephew, the present Aga Khan, in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>.

Prince Sadruddin received several honorary doctorates and national decorations from states as diverse as Pakistan, Poland and the Vatican, as well as the <a href="United%20Nations%20Prize%20in%20the%20Field%20of%20Human%20Rights">United Nations Human Rights Award</a>. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the <a href="American%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a> in 1991. He was awarded the Bourgeois d'Honneur de Geneve, made a Commandeur of the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a> of France and a Knight Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20St.%20Sylvester">Order of St. Sylvester</a> (KCSS) of the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a>, and was a recipient of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Nile">Order of the Nile</a> of Egypt. Furthermore, he was made a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE), this for his services to humanitarian causes and the arts. He was an honorary citizen of <a href="Patmos">Patmos</a>, Greece, where he owned a house.

Jeremy Thorpe

John Jeremy Thorpe (29 April 1929 – 4 December 2014) was a British politician who served as Liberal <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28UK%29">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="North%20Devon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Devon</a> from 1959 to 1979, and as leader of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> between 1967 and 1976. In May 1979 he was tried at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a> on charges of conspiracy and incitement to murder, arising from an earlier relationship with <a href="Norman%20Josiffe">Norman Scott</a>, a former model. Thorpe was acquitted on all charges, but the case, and <a href="Thorpe%20affair">the furore surrounding it</a>, ended his political career.

Thorpe was the son and grandson of <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> MPs, but decided to align with the small and ailing Liberal Party. After reading law at <a href="Oxford%20University">Oxford University</a> he became one of the Liberals' brightest stars in the 1950s. He entered Parliament at the age of 30, rapidly made his mark, and was elected party leader in 1967. After an uncertain start during which the party lost ground, Thorpe capitalised on the growing unpopularity of the Conservative and <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> parties to lead the Liberals through a period of notable electoral success. This culminated in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20February%201974">general election of February 1974</a>, when the party won 6 million votes. Under the <a href="First-past-the-post%20voting">first-past-the-post</a> electoral system this gave them only 14 seats, but in a <a href="hung%20parliament">hung parliament</a>, no party having an overall majority, Thorpe was in a strong position. He was offered a cabinet post by the Conservative prime minister, <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a>, if he would bring the Liberals into a coalition. His price for such a deal, reform of the electoral system, was rejected by Heath, who resigned in favour of <a href="Labour%20Government%201974%E2%80%9379">a minority Labour government</a>.

The February 1974 election was the high-water mark of Thorpe's career. Thereafter his and his party's fortunes declined, particularly from late 1975 when rumours of his involvement in a plot to murder Norman Scott began to multiply. Thorpe resigned the leadership in May 1976, when his position became untenable. When the matter came to court three years later, Thorpe chose not to give evidence to avoid being cross-examined by counsel for the prosecution. This left many questions unanswered; despite his acquittal, Thorpe was discredited and did not return to public life. From the mid-1980s he was disabled by <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>. During his long retirement he gradually recovered the affections of his party, and by the time of his death was honoured by a later generation of leaders, who drew attention to his record as an internationalist, a supporter of human rights, and an opponent of <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>.

Thorpe was born in <a href="South%20Kensington">South Kensington</a>, London, on 29 April 1929. His father was <a href="John%20Henry%20Thorpe">John Henry Thorpe</a>, a lawyer and politician who was the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> for <a href="Manchester%20Rusholme%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Manchester Rusholme</a> between 1919 and 1923. His mother, Ursula, née Norton-Griffiths, was the daughter of another Conservative MP, <a href="Sir%20John%20Norton-Griffiths%2C%201st%20Baronet">Sir John Norton-Griffiths</a>, widely known as "Empire Jack" because of his passionate imperialism. The Thorpe family claimed kinship with distant forebears carrying the name, including <a href="Robert%20Thorpe%20%28Lord%20Chancellor%29">Sir Robert Thorpe</a>, who was briefly <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> in 1372, and <a href="Thomas%20Thorpe%20%28speaker%29">Thomas Thorpe</a>, who was <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Commons%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Speaker of the House of Commons</a> in 1453–54.
However, there is no direct evidence of any link between these figures and Jeremy Thorpe's own family.

The more recent Thorpe ancestors were Irish, stemming from the elder of two brothers, according to family tradition soldiers under Cromwell during the combat in Ireland. Both were rewarded with land, the younger branch – of <a href="County%20Carlow">County Carlow</a> – prospering in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> as <a href="Sheriff%20of%20Dublin%20City">High Sheriffs</a> and <a href="List%20of%20mayors%20of%20Dublin">Lord Mayors</a>, but the elder losing its land and becoming tenant farmers and tradesmen. Jeremy Thorpe's great-grandfather, William Thorpe, was a Dublin policeman who, having been a labourer and having joined the police as a constable, rose to the rank of superintendent. One of his many sons, <a href="John%20Thorpe%20%28priest%29">John Thorpe</a>, became an Anglican priest and served as <a href="Archdeacon%20of%20Macclesfield">Archdeacon of Macclesfield</a> from 1922 to 1932. The archdeacon's marriage in 1884 to a daughter of the prosperous <a href="Anglo-Irish">Anglo-Irish</a> Aylmer family brought considerable wealth to the Thorpes, as did his elder daughter Olive's marriage into the influential Christie-Miller family of Cheshire. Both John Henry and Jeremy Thorpe would benefit from this connection, as the Christie-Millers paid the costs of their education.

Jeremy was his parents' third child, following two sisters. His upbringing was privileged and protected, under the care of <a href="Nanny">nannies</a> and nursemaids until, in 1935, he began attending Wagner's day school in <a href="Queen%27s%20Gate">Queen's Gate</a>. He became a proficient violinist, and often performed at school concerts. Although John Henry Thorpe was no longer in parliament, he had maintained many of his political contacts and friendships, and leading politicians were regularly entertained at the Thorpe home. Among the strongest of these friendships was that with the <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">Lloyd George</a> family—Ursula Thorpe was a close friend of the former <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> prime minister's daughter, <a href="Megan%20Lloyd%20George">Megan</a>, who became Jeremy's godmother. The former prime minister <a href="David%20Lloyd%20George">David Lloyd George</a>, an occasional visitor, became Jeremy's political hero and role model, and helped form his ambitions for a political career in the Liberal Party.

In January 1938 Jeremy went to <a href="Cothill%20House">Cothill House</a>, a school in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a> that prepared boys for entry to <a href="Eton%20College">Eton</a>. By summer 1939 war looked likely, and the Thorpe family moved from London to the <a href="Surrey">Surrey</a> village of <a href="Limpsfield">Limpsfield</a> where Jeremy attended a local school. War began in September 1939; in June 1940, with invasion threatening, the Thorpe children were sent to live with their American aunt, Kay Norton-Griffiths, in <a href="Boston">Boston</a>. In September that year Jeremy began at <a href="The%20Rectory%20School">The Rectory School</a> in <a href="Pomfret%2C%20Connecticut">Pomfret, Connecticut</a>. He remained there for three generally happy years; his main extracurricular task, he later recalled, was looking after the school's pigs. In 1943 it was thought safe for the children to return to England, and John Henry used his political connections to secure for Jeremy a passage in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> cruiser <a href="HMS%20Phoebe%20%2843%29">HMS "Phoebe"</a>.

Thorpe started at Eton in September 1943. He proved an indifferent scholar, he lacked sporting aptitude, and although superficially a rebel against conformity, his frequent toadying to authority earned him the nickname "Oily Thorpe". He also annoyed his fellow-pupils by parading his acquaintance with a range of famous and important people. He offended the school's traditionalists by resigning from the school's cadet force, and shocked others by expressing his intention to marry <a href="Princess%20Margaret">Princess Margaret</a>, then second in line to the British throne. Thorpe revealed little about his Eton years, beyond his membership of the school orchestra and his winning a cup for his violin playing—he briefly considered the possibility of a career as a professional violinist. His time at Eton was marred by the death of his father in 1944, at the age of 57.

Having secured a place at <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Oxford">Trinity College, Oxford</a>, Thorpe left Eton in March 1947. In September he began 18 months' <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">National Service</a>, but within six weeks was discharged on medical grounds after collapsing while attempting an <a href="Assault%20course%23Military%20training">assault course</a>. As his place at Oxford was unavailable until the following year, Thorpe worked as a temporary preparatory school teacher before his admission to Trinity on 8 October 1948.

Thorpe was reading law, but his primary interests at Oxford were political and social. From his earliest undergraduate days he drew attention to himself by his flamboyant behaviour; according to Thorpe's biographer, <a href="Michael%20Bloch">Michael Bloch</a>, his "pallid appearance, dark hair and eyes and angular features, gave him a diabolonian air". He was quick to seek political office, initially in the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Liberal%20Democrats">Oxford University Liberal Club</a> (OULC) which, despite the doldrums affecting the Liberal Party nationally, was a thriving club with over 800 members. Thorpe was elected to the club's committee at the end of his first term; in November 1949 he became its president. Outside Oxford, Thorpe showed a genuine commitment to Liberalism in his enthusiastic contributions to the party's national election campaigns, and on reaching his 21st birthday in April 1950, applied to have his name added to the party's list of possible parliamentary candidates.

Beyond the OULC, Thorpe achieved the presidency of the Oxford University Law Society, although his principal objective was the presidency of the <a href="Oxford%20Union">Oxford Union</a>, an office frequently used as a stepping-stone to national prominence. Normally, would-be presidents first served in the Union's junior offices, as Secretary, Treasurer or Librarian, but Thorpe, having impressed as a confident and forceful debater, decided early in 1950 to try directly for the presidency. He was easily defeated by the future broadcaster <a href="Robin%20Day">Robin Day</a>. His single-minded pursuit of office, and the dubious strategies he sometimes employed, led to some acrimonious campaigns, but he gained many supporters, and later in 1950 beat two formidable contenders—the socialist <a href="Dick%20Taverne">Dick Taverne</a> and the Conservative <a href="William%20Rees-Mogg">William Rees-Mogg</a>—to secure the presidency for the <a href="Hilary%20term">Hilary term</a> of 1951.

Thorpe's term as president was marked by the range of distinguished guest speakers that he recruited, among them the future <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> <a href="Quintin%20Hogg%2C%20Baron%20Hailsham%20of%20St%20Marylebone">Lord Hailsham</a>, the barrister and former Liberal MP <a href="Norman%20Birkett">Norman Birkett</a>, and the humorist <a href="Stephen%20Potter">Stephen Potter</a>. The time-consuming nature of his various offices meant that Thorpe required a fourth year to complete his law studies, which ended in the summer of 1952 with a <a href="British%20undergraduate%20degree%20classification%23Degree%20classification">third-class honours degree</a>.

At Oxford Thorpe enjoyed numerous friendships with his contemporaries, many of whom later achieved distinction. These were almost exclusively with men; even so, he was not identified as a member of any of Oxford's homosexual sets. He confided to a friend that politics provided him with the necessary level of emotional excitement, thus making sexual relationships unnecessary. Thus, Bloch suggests, he was accepted by his fellow-students as "a basically asexual character, wrapped up in politics and his career".

Having been accepted as a potential Liberal parliamentary candidate, Thorpe looked for a constituency. The general elections of 1950 and 1951 had seen the party's MPs fall, first to nine, then six; some commentators saw little future except "further attrition and further losses to the two major parties". The journalist <a href="Julian%20Glover%20%28journalist%29">Julian Glover</a> writes that Thorpe's determination to stay with the party, despite its woes, showed a more principled commitment to Liberalism than many critics have acknowledged; his prospects of reaching parliament would have been considerably greater within either the Conservative or Labour parties.

Initially the young would-be candidate was offered the opportunity of succeeding the party leader, <a href="Clement%20Davies">Clement Davies</a>, in the Welsh seat of <a href="Montgomeryshire%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Montgomeryshire</a>, when Davies decided to retire. There being no immediate prospect of that, Thorpe looked elsewhere, in particular to Devon and Cornwall, where the party had long-standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951. In these elections Thorpe had assisted the Liberal candidate for <a href="North%20Cornwall%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Cornwall</a>, <a href="Dingle%20Foot">Dingle Foot</a>, whose agent recommended him to the neighbouring <a href="North%20Devon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Devon</a> constituency. The <a href="Torrington%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Torrington</a> local party was also anxious to adopt Thorpe as their candidate, while Foot saw him as a possible successor in North Cornwall. Thorpe chose to fight North Devon, a seat once held by the Liberals although, in 1951, the party had finished in third place behind Conservative and Labour, with less than 20% of the vote.

Thorpe was adopted as North Devon's Liberal candidate in April 1952. His political stance matched that of other young activists, who believed that the party should offer a radical non-socialist alternative to the Conservative government. He and others founded the <a href="Radical%20Reform%20Group">Radical Reform Group</a>, to drive the party in that direction. He spent much of his spare time cultivating the voters in North Devon; at rallies and on the doorstep he mixed local concerns with conspicuously liberal views on larger, international issues such as <a href="colonialism">colonialism</a> and <a href="apartheid">apartheid</a>. When <a href="Anthony%20Eden">Anthony Eden</a>, who had succeeded <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> as prime minister, called a snap general election in April 1955, Thorpe fought an energetic local campaign. He succeeded in halving the Conservative majority in the constituency, and restoring the Liberals to second place.

In need of a paid occupation Thorpe opted for the law, and in February 1954 was <a href="Call%20to%20the%20bar">called to the bar</a> in the <a href="Inner%20Temple">Inner Temple</a>. Initially he found it difficult to earn a living from his fees; he needed another source of income, and found it in television journalism. Thorpe was employed by <a href="Associated%20Rediffusion">Associated Rediffusion</a>, at first as chairman of a science discussion programme, "The Scientist Replies", and later as an interviewer on the station's major current affairs vehicle "<a href="This%20Week%20%28ITV%20TV%20series%29">This Week</a>" . Among various assignments for "This Week", he travelled to Ghana in 1957 to cover the country's independence celebrations, and in 1958 he reported from Jordan on a plot to assassinate <a href="Hussein%20of%20Jordan">King Hussein</a>. Thorpe was a skilled broadcaster, and in addition to his television work he became a regular guest on the BBC radio programme "<a href="Any%20Questions%3F">Any Questions?</a>" In 1959 he was offered the post of chief commentator by Associated Rediffusion, but as the condition was that he gave up his parliamentary candidature, he declined.

Through the later 1950s Thorpe juggled his legal and television work with his political duties in North Devon, where he worked tirelessly to build up support. From September 1956 the Liberal Party was led by <a href="Jo%20Grimond">Jo Grimond</a>, a more up-to-date figure than his elderly predecessor Davies, and more in tune with the ideas of Thorpe and the Radical Reform Group. After an uncertain beginning—the Liberals lost one of their six seats to Labour in a February 1957 by-election—Grimond's leadership began to produce results. The party polled well in a series of by-elections during 1957 and 1958, culminating in a victory at Torrington in March 1958—a seat which the party had not contested in the 1955 general election. Thorpe, who had figured prominently in the Torrington campaign, saw this victory in an adjoining Devon constituency as a harbinger of his own future success.

Thorpe's television and radio work had brought him a measure of celebrity, and his colourful and individualistic campaigning style was widely admired. The journalist <a href="Christopher%20Booker">Christopher Booker</a> recalled: "He had an extraordinary ability both to cheer up his followers and send up his opponents". However, throughout the 1950s Thorpe was leading a secret homosexual life, at a time when all such activity was illegal in the United Kingdom, and subject to heavy penalties; exposure would have ended his political prospects instantly. This sexual orientation, concealed from the wider public, was known and tolerated in North Devon, and was at least suspected by many in the wider Liberal Party.

Thorpe's efforts in North Devon came to fruition in the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201959">October 1959 general election</a>, when he won the seat with a majority of 362 over his Conservative opponent—the Liberal Party's solitary gain in what was generally an electoral triumph for <a href="Harold%20Macmillan">Harold Macmillan</a>'s Conservative government. On 10 November 1959 he made his <a href="maiden%20speech">maiden speech</a>, during a debate on the government's local employment bill. He highlighted poor communications as the principal reason for the lack of employment opportunities in North Devon, and called for urgent government action.

Thorpe was a diligent MP, active in promoting local issues—a new general hospital, and a <a href="link%20road">link road</a> to the <a href="M5%20motorway">Exeter-Taunton motorway</a>—and campaigned successfully to save the <a href="Tarka%20Line">Barnstaple-to-Exeter railway line</a> from the <a href="Beeching%20cuts">Beeching axe</a>. On broader questions he made no secret of his anti-hanging, pro-immigrant, pro-Europe opinions, largely not shared by his constituents. He championed freedom from colonial and minority rule, and was an outspoken opponent of regimes he considered oppressive such as those in South Africa and the short-lived <a href="Federation%20of%20Rhodesia%20and%20Nyasaland">Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland</a>. He was also noted for his verve and wit; when in 1962, after a series of by-election disasters, Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet, Thorpe's reported comment, an inversion of the biblical verse <a href="John%2015">John 15</a>:13, was "Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his friends for his life".

Within the Liberal Party, Thorpe helped to found an informal organisation known as "Winnable Seats", which directed energy and funding to selected target constituencies. This strategy led to some notable by-election performances during 1961–62, culminating in March 1962 with victory in <a href="Orpington%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Orpington</a>, where a 14,760 Conservative majority was turned into a Liberal majority of 7,855. These results were accompanied by substantial Liberal gains in municipal elections; national opinion polls briefly showed the party on equal terms with the Labour and Conservative parties. This advance was barely reflected in the results of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201964">October 1964 general election</a>; the party nearly doubled its share of the national vote, to 11.2%, but secured a net gain of only two seats. One of the new Liberals was <a href="Peter%20Bessell">Peter Bessell</a>, who won the Cornish seat of <a href="Bodmin%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Bodmin</a>. In North Devon, Thorpe increased his personal majority to over 5,000.

After the election, which Labour won with a small majority, Thorpe was seen by many as Grimond's natural successor; his speeches were generally the highlights of the party's annual assemblies, and he strengthened his position when, in 1965, he secured the important post of party treasurer. He proved to be an excellent fund-raiser, although his insistence on personal control of much of the party's funds aroused criticism and resentment. In July 1965, after the end of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Thorpe toured Central and East Africa, visiting both <a href="Zambia">Zambia</a> and Rhodesia. On his return he advised the prime minister, <a href="Harold%20Wilson">Harold Wilson</a>, that the all-white Rhodesian government under <a href="Ian%20Smith">Ian Smith</a> would make a <a href="Rhodesia%27s%20Unilateral%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">unilateral declaration of independence</a> (UDI) before the end of the year, unless deterred by the threat of armed intervention. Wilson would not countenance the use of troops; the UDI took place on 11 November. In a speech to the <a href="Liberal%20Assembly">Liberal Assembly</a> in September 1966, Thorpe condemned Wilson's handling of the Rhodesia issue ("misjudged and misplanned"), and called for the bombing by United Nations aircraft of the rail link through which the post-UDI Rhodesian government received its oil supplies. The speech delighted the more radical elements in the Liberal Party but outraged many Conservatives, who used the derisive nickname "Bomber Thorpe" for the rest of Thorpe's parliamentary career.

In March 1966 Wilson called an election, hoping to improve his tiny parliamentary majority. He did so, increasing it to almost 100. The Liberals, although their overall share of the vote fell to 8.5%, increased their number of MPs from nine to 12, an indication of success in selective campaigning under the "Winnable Seats" strategy. Thorpe suffered a personal disappointment in North Devon, where his majority dropped to 1,166.

After the 1966 election, Grimond confided to senior party officials that he wished soon to step down from the leadership. Thorpe was now the senior Liberal MP after Grimond, and the party's highest-profile member, although <a href="Timothy%20Beaumont">Timothy Beaumont</a>, chairman of the party's organising committee, noted in his diary: "I am pretty certain that he has little popularity within the Parliamentary Party". When Grimond finally resigned, on 17 January 1967, <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29%20leadership%20election%2C%201967">an election to replace him</a> was arranged to take place within 48 hours, leaving little time for manoeuvring. The 12 Liberal MPs formed the whole electorate; after the first ballot, Thorpe had secured six votes against three each for <a href="Eric%20Lubbock">Eric Lubbock</a>, the Orpington MP, and <a href="Emlyn%20Hooson">Emlyn Hooson</a> who had succeeded to the Montgomeryshire seat. On 18 January Lubbock and Hooson withdrew their candidacies, and Thorpe was declared the winner.

As Liberal leader, Thorpe provided a clear contrast with the pedestrian images of Wilson and <a href="Edward%20Heath">Edward Heath</a>, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself at odds with the <a href="National%20League%20of%20Young%20Liberals">Young Liberals</a>, who were advocating policies far to the left of the Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from <a href="NATO">NATO</a>, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. The beneficiaries were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.

Thorpe's marriage provided him with a period of emotional stability; a son, Rupert was born in April 1969. Shortly afterwards, Thorpe received a political boost when the Liberals unexpectedly won a by-election at <a href="Birmingham%20Ladywood%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Birmingham Ladywood</a>, in a previously safe Labour seat. This was a solitary success, and the party faced the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201970">general election of June 1970</a> with little confidence. The results justified their gloomy premonitions; the party's share of the vote fell to 7.5%, and seven of its thirteen seats, including Ladywood, were lost. Thorpe barely hung on in North Devon, his majority reduced to 369. Three of his colleagues had comparably small majorities; only Grimond and Hooson were relatively safe. Heath's Conservatives secured a 30-seat majority.

After the Liberals' poor election performance Thorpe came under fire, but such criticisms were stifled when, ten days after the election, Caroline Thorpe was killed in a car crash. For the rest of 1970 and for much of 1971, Thorpe was preoccupied with his loss and his plan for a permanent memorial to Caroline. Meanwhile, the party began to recover, chiefly through its adoption of "<a href="community%20politics">community politics</a>"—engagement with local rather than national issues—and achieved modest gains in the 1971 local elections.

By early 1972, with the monument to Caroline erected on <a href="Bishop%27s%20Tawton">Codden Hill</a>, Thorpe was fully re-engaged in political life. In February he assisted the passage through the House of Commons of Heath's <a href="European%20Communities%20Act%201972%20%28UK%29">European Communities Bill</a>, approving the United Kingdom's accession to the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a>. The bill was opposed by Labour and by some Conservatives. By aligning his party with the government, Thorpe ensured a majority of eight for the bill's <a href="second%20reading">second reading</a>, and it duly became law. By mid-1972 the Liberals' fortunes were rising significantly; the public was equally disenchanted with both major parties, and community politics were proving popular. Impressive local election results were followed by sensational by-election results. In October 1972 <a href="Rochdale%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Rochdale</a> was won from Labour, and in the next year four victories were achieved over the Conservatives: <a href="Sutton%20and%20Cheam%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Sutton</a>, <a href="Isle%20of%20Ely%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Isle of Ely</a>, <a href="Ripon%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Ripon</a> and <a href="Berwick-upon-Tweed%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Berwick-upon-Tweed</a>.

On 14 March 1973 Thorpe married <a href="Marion%20Stein">Marion Stein</a>, a concert pianist and the former wife of <a href="George%20Lascelles%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Harewood">George Lascelles, 7th Earl of Harewood</a>. The couple had been brought together a year earlier by a mutual acquaintance, the pianist <a href="Moura%20Lympany">Moura Lympany</a>. The year ended less happily for Thorpe, when the secondary banking firm of London & County Securities, of which he had been a director since May 1971, collapsed amid rumours of mismanagement and fraud, marking the start of the <a href="secondary%20banking%20crisis%20of%201973%E2%80%9375">secondary banking crisis of 1973–75</a>; the details were not revealed until 1976. In February 1974 Heath, whose government had been plagued by industrial unrest, called a general election on the issue of "Who governs Britain?". During the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20February%201974">election campaign</a> there was evidence of disaffection with both Heath and Wilson, and of a surge in Liberal support. Thorpe was confident that the party would make a significant breakthrough; on election day, 28 February, it secured its highest national vote to date, 6 million, and its highest share of the vote (19.3) since 1929. However, under the <a href="first-past-the-post%20voting">first-past-the-post voting</a> system, these figures translated into just 14 seats. Thorpe's majority in North Devon rose to 11,072.

The February 1974 general election produced a <a href="hung%20parliament">hung parliament</a>; neither Labour, with 301 seats, nor the Conservatives, with 297 seats, achieved an overall majority. As was his right as the sitting Prime Minister, Heath did not resign, hoping to persuade the Liberals into a Conservative-led coalition. He met Thorpe on 2 March to discuss possible bases for co-operation, Heath's preferred option being a formal coalition in which Thorpe would be given a cabinet post, and junior ministries would be allocated to other senior Liberals. As the combined Conservative-Liberal vote amounted to 57% of the electorate, such a government would, Heath thought, have some moral legitimacy. If Thorpe would not accept coalition, a less formal basis of inter-party co-operation might be agreed which would enable the Conservative government to retain office.

The next day, after discussions with senior colleagues, Thorpe advised Heath that a commitment to electoral reform would be a prerequisite to any arrangement between the two parties. Thorpe proposed that Heath establish a Speaker's Conference whose recommendations on electoral reform would, if acceptable to the Liberals, form the basis of subsequent legislation with full cabinet approval. After further consultations with their parties, the two leaders met again; Heath reported that while his party would not object to a Speaker's Conference, they could not commit themselves in advance to accepting its recommendations, which would be subject to a free House of Commons vote. This was unacceptable to Thorpe, who then made a separate proposal that an all-party "Government of national unity" be formed to tackle the urgent economic problems facing the country. This idea was rejected by Heath, who resigned on Monday 4 March.

Thorpe later admitted that a coalition agreement would have torn the party apart; the more radical elements, in particular the Young Liberals, would never have accepted it. Furthermore, Thorpe said that "even with our support Heath wouldn't have had a parliamentary majority"; without some arrangements with the <a href="Scottish%20National%20Party">Scottish Nationalists</a> or the <a href="Ulster%20Unionist%20Party">Ulster Unionists</a>, the coalition could have been brought down by the first vote on the <a href="Speech%20from%20the%20throne">Queen's Speech</a>. Following Heath's resignation, Wilson formed a minority Labour government.

As Harold Wilson did not have an overall majority after the February 1974 election, he was widely expected to call another election before too long; he did so in September 1974. Thorpe anticipated a turning point in the Liberals' fortunes and campaigned under the slogan "<a href="one%20more%20heave">one more heave</a>", aiming for a complete breakthrough with entering a coalition a last resort. The phrase is attributed to advertising agent and Liberal parliamentary candidate <a href="Adrian%20Slade">Adrian Slade</a>. Future Liberal Party leader <a href="David%20Steel">David Steel</a> called the whole campaign "a slightly less successful re-run of February." In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%20October%201974">October 1974 general election</a>, the Liberals received over 700,000 fewer votes and returned 13 MPs, down one, with Wilson achieving an overall majority of three.

Thorpe and the Liberals were deflated by the outcome of the October 1974 election. Wilson's majority, albeit slim, denied Thorpe the role of kingmaker, leaving the Liberals without a clear role; as Dutton observes, apart from being neither Conservative or Labour, the Liberals lacked a distinctive identity and their policies were largely unknown to the public. A further problem for the party was the divergence between its activists, who were radicals well to the left of the official party, and a large section of its recent supporters who were disgruntled Conservatives. Thorpe, whose personal majority in North Devon had fallen to under 7,000 in October, confided to an associate that, unless the party were soon to make a significant impact, his days as leader might be numbered.

During 1975 Thorpe campaigned for electoral reform, citing the "Great Vote Robbery" of the year before. He argued that electoral reform on a proportional basis would bring about a centrist stability to British politics that would favour British business. In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20European%20Communities%20membership%20referendum%2C%201975">June 1975 referendum on the UK's continuing membership of the EEC</a>, Thorpe campaigned for a "yes" vote alongside the pro-Europeans of both major parties, appearing with Heath (recently replaced as Conservative leader by <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Margaret Thatcher</a>) at the Oxford Union. The referendum resulted in a two-to-one approval of the UK's membership. However, Thorpe failed to stem the decline in his party's electoral fortunes. In the <a href="Woolwich%20West%20by-election%2C%201975">Woolwich West by-election</a> on 26 June 1975 the party lost more than two-thirds of its October 1974 vote, a "major humiliation" according to "The Guardian".

Thorpe's homosexual activities from time to time came to the attention of the authorities, and were investigated by the police; information was added to his MI5 file, but in no case was action taken against him. In 1971 he survived a party inquiry after a complaint against him by <a href="Thorpe%20affair%23Josiffe%2C%20later%20Scott">Norman Scott</a>, a riding instructor and would-be model. Scott maintained that in the early 1960s he had been in a sexual relationship with Thorpe, who had subsequently mistreated him. The inquiry dismissed the allegations. However, the danger represented by Scott continued to preoccupy Thorpe who, according to his confidant David Holmes, felt "he would never be safe with that man around". 

Scott (known then as Norman Josiffe) had first met Thorpe early in 1961 when the former was a 20-year-old groom working for one of Thorpe's wealthy friends. The initial meeting was brief, but nearly a year later Scott, by then in London and destitute, called at the House of Commons to ask the MP for help. Thorpe later acknowledged that a friendship had developed, but denied any physical relationship; Scott, on the other hand, claimed that he had been seduced by Thorpe on the night following the Commons meeting. Over the following years Thorpe made numerous attempts to help Scott find accommodation and work, but instead of repaying these favours with gratitude, Scott became increasingly resentful towards Thorpe, believing that he was the source of all his ills and threatening him with exposure.

In 1965 Thorpe asked his parliamentary colleague Peter Bessell to help him resolve the problem. Bessell met Scott and warned him that his threats against Thorpe might be considered as blackmail; he did, however, offer to help Scott obtain a new <a href="National%20Insurance">National Insurance</a> card, the lack of which had been a long-running source of aggravation. This quietened matters for a while, but within a year Scott was causing trouble again. With Thorpe's agreement, Bessell began paying Scott a "retainer" of £5 a week, supposedly as compensation for the welfare benefits that Scott had been unable to obtain because of his missing card. Bessell later stated that by 1968 Thorpe was considering ways in which Scott might be permanently silenced; he thought David Holmes might organise this. Holmes had been best man at Thorpe's wedding, and was completely loyal to him.

When Scott unexpectedly married in 1969, it appeared that the problem might be over, but by 1970 the marriage had ended; Scott convinced himself that Thorpe was to blame. Early in 1971 Scott moved to the village of <a href="Talybont%2C%20Ceredigion">Talybont</a>, in North Wales, where he befriended a widow, Gwen Parry-Jones, to whom he recounted his tale of ill-treatment at the hands of Thorpe. She passed the information to <a href="Emlyn%20Hooson">Emlyn Hooson</a>, who was MP for the adjoining Welsh constituency; Hooson precipitated the party enquiry which cleared Thorpe and left Scott feeling bitter and humiliated. After Parry-Jones's death the following year, Scott fell into a depression and for a while was quiescent. In time, however, he began to tell his story to anyone who would listen. By 1974 Thorpe, at the crest of the Liberal revival, was terrified of exposure that might lose him the Liberal leadership. As <a href="Dominic%20Sandbrook">Dominic Sandbrook</a> observes in his history of the times: "The stakes had never been higher; silencing Scott had never been more urgent".

Over the years Scott made several attempts to publicise his story, but no newspapers were interested. The satirical magazine "<a href="Private%20Eye">Private Eye</a>" decided in late 1972 that the story "was defamatory, unproveable, and above all was ten years old". From late 1974 Holmes took the lead in furthering plans to silence Scott; through various intermediaries he found <a href="Thorpe%20affair%23Alleged%20conspiracy">Andrew Newton</a>, an airline pilot, who said he would dispose of Scott for a fee of between £5,000 and £10,000. Meanwhile, Thorpe procured £20,000 from <a href="Sir%20Jack%20Hayward">Sir Jack Hayward</a>, the Bahamas-based millionaire businessman who had previously donated to the Liberal Party, stating that this was to cover election expenses incurred during 1974. Thorpe arranged for these funds to be secretly channelled to Holmes rather than into the party's coffers. He later denied that this money had been used to pay Newton, or anyone else, as part of a conspiracy.

In October 1975, <a href="Thorpe%20affair">Newton</a> made a bungled attempt to shoot Scott that resulted in the killing of the latter's <a href="Great%20Dane">Great Dane</a> dog Rinka. Newton was arrested on charges of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, yet the press remained muted, possibly awaiting the bigger story that they hoped would break. Their reticence ended in January 1976 when Scott, in court on a minor social security fraud charge, claimed he was being hounded because of his previous sexual relationship with Thorpe. This statement, made in court and thus protected from the <a href="libel">libel</a> laws, was widely reported.

On 29 January the <a href="Department%20of%20Trade%20and%20Industry%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Trade</a> published its report into the collapse of London & County Securities. The report criticised Thorpe's failure to investigate the true nature of the company before involving himself, "a cautionary tale for any leading politician". Thorpe received some relief when his former colleague <a href="Peter%20Bessell">Bessell</a>, who had resigned from parliament and relocated to California to escape from a string of business failures, re-emerged in early February after discovery by the "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>". Bessell gave muddled accounts of his involvement with Scott, but insisted that his former chief was innocent of any wrongdoing.

On 16 March 1976 Newton's trial began at <a href="Exeter">Exeter</a> <a href="Crown%20Court">Crown Court</a>, where Scott repeated his allegations against Thorpe despite the efforts of the prosecution's lawyers to silence him. Newton was found guilty and sentenced to two years' imprisonment, but did not incriminate Thorpe. The erosion of public support for the Liberal Party continued with several poor by-election results in March, which the former leader Grimond attributed to increasing lack of confidence in Thorpe. On 14 March, "The Sunday Times" printed Thorpe's answer to Scott's various allegations, under the heading "The Lies of Norman Scott". Nevertheless, many of the party's senior figures now felt that Thorpe should resign.

Thorpe's problems multiplied when Bessell, alarmed by his own position, confessed to the "Daily Mail" on 6 May that in his earlier statements he had lied to protect his former leader. Scott was threatening to publish personal letters from Thorpe who, to forestall him, arranged for the "Sunday Times" to print two letters from 1961. Although these did not conclusively indicate wrongdoing, their tone indicated that Thorpe had not been frank about the true nature of his friendship with Scott. On 10 May 1976, amid rising criticism, Thorpe resigned the party leadership, "convinced that a fixed determination to destroy the Leader could itself result in the destruction of the Party".

Thorpe's resignation brought him a period of temporary calm. The new Liberal leader, <a href="David%20Steel">David Steel</a>, made him party spokesman on foreign affairs, with responsibility for European issues. Wilson had by this time retired as prime minister, and been replaced by <a href="James%20Callaghan">James Callaghan</a>. Thorpe lobbied the government hard for legislation to introduce direct elections to the <a href="European%20Parliament">European Parliament</a>; at that time <a href="Member%20of%20the%20European%20Parliament">MEPs</a> were appointed by member nations' parliaments.

By-election losses eroded and finally removed Labour's small parliamentary majority, and in March 1977 Callaghan was in danger of losing a confidence vote that would have precipitated a general election. Opinion polls indicated that an election at that time would have been equally disastrous for the Labour and Liberal parties; to ensure mutual survival, a "<a href="Lib-Lab%20pact">Lib-Lab pact</a>" was agreed, whereby in return for certain policy concessions the Liberals would support the Government. Thorpe used his influence to insist that legislation for direct elections to the European Parliament was part of the pact, but was unable to secure his principal objective, a commitment to a <a href="Proportional%20representation">proportional basis</a> in these elections. In parliament, Thorpe spoke in favour of Scottish and Welsh devolution, arguing that there was no alternative to home rule except total separation. In the various debates related to the unresolved issue of Rhodesia, Thorpe pressed for the involvement of representatives from the African nationalists, in the form of the <a href="Patriotic%20Front%20%28Zimbabwe%29">Patriotic Front</a>, in negotiations for a peaceful settlement to the long-running <a href="Rhodesian%20Bush%20War">Rhodesian Bush War</a>.

Although the press was generally quiet after Thorpe's resignation, reporters were still investigating him. The most persistent of these were Barry Penrose and Roger Courtiour, collectively known as "Pencourt", who had begun by believing that Thorpe was a target of South African intelligence agencies, until their investigations led them to Bessell in California. Bessell, no longer covering for Thorpe, gave the reporters his version of the conspiracy to murder Scott, and Thorpe's role in it. Pencourt's progress was covered in "Private Eye", to Thorpe's extreme vexation; when the pair attempted to question him outside his Devon home early in 1977, he threatened them with prosecution.

Thorpe's relatively peaceful interlude ended in October 1977 when <a href="Thorpe%20affair">Newton</a>, released from prison, sold his story to the London "<a href="The%20Evening%20News%20%28London%20newspaper%29">Evening News</a>". Newton's claim that he had been paid "by a leading Liberal" to kill Scott caused a sensation, and led to a prolonged police investigation. Throughout this period Thorpe endeavoured to continue his public life, in and out of parliament. In the House of Commons on 1 August 1978, when it appeared certain he would face criminal charges, he asked the Attorney-General what sum of capital possessed by an applicant would prevent him from receiving legal aid. The next day he made his final speech in the House, during a debate on Rhodesia.

On 4 August, Thorpe, along with Holmes and two of Holmes's associates, was charged with conspiracy to murder Scott. Thorpe was additionally charged with incitement to murder, on the basis of his alleged 1968 discussions with Bessell and Holmes. After being released on bail, Thorpe declared his innocence and his determination to refute the charges. Although he remained North Devon's MP he withdrew almost completely from public view, except for a brief theatrical appearance at the Liberals' 1978 annual assembly on 14 September—to the annoyance of the party's leaders who had asked him to stay away.

In November 1978, Thorpe, Holmes and two of the latter's business acquaintances, John le Mesurier (a carpet salesman, not to be confused with the <a href="John%20Le%20Mesurier">actor of that name</a>) and George Deakin, appeared before magistrates at <a href="Minehead">Minehead</a>, Somerset, in a <a href="Committal%20procedure">committal hearing</a> to determine whether they should stand trial. The court heard evidence of a conspiracy from Scott, Newton and Bessell; it also learned that Bessell was being paid £50,000 by "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Telegraph">The Sunday Telegraph</a>" for his story. At the conclusion, the four defendants were committed for trial at the <a href="Old%20Bailey">Old Bailey</a>. This was set to begin on 30 April 1979, but when in March the government fell, and a general election was called for 3 May, the trial was postponed until 8 May.

Thorpe accepted the invitation of his local party to fight the North Devon seat, against the advice of friends who were certain he would lose. His campaign was largely ignored by the national party; of its leading figures only <a href="John%20Pardoe">John Pardoe</a>, the MP for <a href="North%20Cornwall%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">North Cornwall</a>, visited the constituency. Thorpe, supported by his wife, his mother and some loyal friends, fought hard, although much of his characteristic vigour was missing. He lost to his Conservative opponent by 8,500 votes. Overall, the Conservatives obtained a majority of 43 seats, and Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. Afterward, Thorpe told the "Daily Mail" that he had not "expected to get hammered. You never do". The Liberal Party's share of the national vote fell to 13.8%, and its total seats from 13 to 11. Dutton attributes much of the fall in the Liberal vote to the lengthy adverse publicity generated by the Thorpe affair.

The trial, which lasted for six weeks, began on 8 May 1979, before <a href="Joseph%20Cantley">Mr Justice Cantley</a>. Thorpe was defended by <a href="George%20Carman">George Carman</a>. Carman quickly undermined Bessell's credibility by revealing that he had a significant interest in Thorpe's conviction; in the event of an acquittal, Bessell would receive only half of his newspaper fee. During his cross-examination of Scott on 22 May, Carman asked: "You knew Thorpe to be a man of homosexual tendencies in 1961?" This oblique admission of his client's sexuality was a stratagem to prevent the prosecution from calling witnesses who would testify to Thorpe's sex life. Nevertheless, Carman insisted, there was no reliable evidence of any physical sexual relationship between Thorpe and Scott, whom Carman dismissed as "this inveterate liar, social climber and scrounger".

After weeks in which the court heard the prosecution's evidence from the committal hearings, the defence opened on 7 June. Deakin testified that although he introduced Newton to Holmes, he had thought that this was to help deal with a blackmailer—he knew nothing of a conspiracy to kill. Deakin was the only defendant to testify; Thorpe and the others chose to remain silent and call no witnesses, on the basis that the testimonies of Bessell, Scott and Newton had failed to make the prosecution's case.

On 18 June, after closing speeches from prosecution and defence counsel, the judge began his summing-up. While emphasising Thorpe's distinguished public record, he was scathing about the principal prosecution witnesses: Bessell was a "humbug", Scott a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but of course he could still be telling the truth." Newton was "determined to milk the case as hard as he can." On 20 June the jury retired; they returned two days later and acquitted the four defendants on all charges. In a brief public statement, Thorpe said that he considered the verdict "a complete vindication." Scott said he was "unsurprised" by the outcome, but was upset by the aspersions on his character made by the judge from the safety of the bench.

After his acquittal, Thorpe announced that he proposed to attend the 1979 Liberal assembly and the forthcoming <a href="Liberal%20International">Liberal International</a> Congress in Canada. However, his failure to explain himself under oath was widely criticised in the press, and the public perception was that he had been fortunate to have "got off". Reluctantly, Thorpe accepted that there was no future role for him within the Liberal Party, and informed the North Devon association that he would not seek to fight the seat again. Steel expressed the hope that Thorpe would, "after a suitable period of rest and recuperation ... find many avenues where his great talents may be used."

In his search for a new career Thorpe applied unsuccessfully for the posts of administrator of the <a href="Aldeburgh%20festival">Aldeburgh festival</a>, and race relations adviser to the <a href="Greater%20London%20Council">Greater London Council</a>. His attempts to restart a career in television also came to nothing. In February 1982, it was announced that he was to become director of the British section of <a href="Amnesty%20International">Amnesty International</a>, but the appointment was opposed by many of the organisation's membership, and he withdrew from the post after a month of controversy. He kept his position as chairman of the political committee of the <a href="United%20Nations%20Association">United Nations Association</a>, but in 1985 the progression of <a href="Parkinson%27s%20disease">Parkinson's disease</a>, which had first been diagnosed in 1979, led to the curtailment of most of his public activity. He continued to live in North Devon, and in 1987 accepted the honorary presidency of the North Devon <a href="Liberal%20Democrats%20%28UK%29">Liberal Democrat</a> association, formed after the Liberal–<a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28UK%29">SDP</a> merger. He thought he might return to parliament via a <a href="life%20peerage">life peerage</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, but although friends lobbied on his behalf, the merged party's leadership refused to recommend him. Within the party generally, feelings towards him warmed, and when he attended the 1997 annual conference he received a standing ovation.
In 1999 Thorpe published an anecdotal memoir, "In My Own Time", an anthology of his experiences in public life. In the book he repeated his denial of any sexual relationship with Scott, and maintained that the decision not to offer evidence was made to avoid prolonging the trial, since it was clear that the prosecution's case was "shot through with lies, inaccuracies and admissions". In the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%202005">2005 general election campaign</a> Thorpe appeared on television, attacking both the Conservative and Labour parties for supporting the <a href="Iraq%20War">Iraq War</a>. Three years later, in 2008, he gave interviews to "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" and to the "Journal of Liberal History". York Membery, the Liberal journal's interviewer, found Thorpe able to communicate only in a barely audible whisper, but with his brain power unimpaired. Thorpe asserted that he "still had steam in my pipes"; reviewing the current political situation, he considered the Labour prime minister <a href="Gordon%20Brown">Gordon Brown</a> "dour and unimpressive", and dubbed the Conservative leader <a href="David%20Cameron">David Cameron</a> "a phoney ... a Thatcherite trying to appear progressive". Some of Thorpe's <a href="pro-Europeanism">pro-Europeanism</a> had been eroded over the years; he now thought that the European Union had become too powerful, and insufficiently accountable.

Thorpe's last public appearance was in 2009, at the unveiling of a bust of himself in the Grimond Room at the House of Commons. Thereafter he was confined to his home, nursed by Marion until she became too infirm. She died on 6 March 2014; Thorpe survived her for nine months, dying on 4 December. His funeral was at <a href="St%20Margaret%27s%2C%20Westminster">St Margaret's, Westminster</a> on 17 December.

<a href="Andrew%20Rawnsley">Andrew Rawnsley</a> observed that the general election of 1970 left the Liberals with just six MPs:

Most assessments of Thorpe's career emphasise his downfall rather than his political achievements, "a fall unparalleled in British political history", according to the "Daily Telegraph" obituarist. While Thorpe hoped that acquittal would ensure he would be remembered primarily for his revival of Liberal fortunes in the 1960s and 1970s, the trial shattered his reputation irretrievably. The prosecuting counsel at the Old Bailey likened the case to "a tragedy of truly Greek or Shakespearian proportions—the slow but inevitable destruction of a man by the stamp of one defect."

After Thorpe's death, sympathetic commentators drew attention to his internationalism and social liberalism, highlighting his long involvement with the anti-apartheid movement, his denunciations of dictators, his opposition to the death penalty, and his rejection of racism. There is wide agreement that he was an outstanding political campaigner—persuasive, witty, and warm: "his astonishing memory for faces persuaded voters that they were intimate friends ... his resourceful mind afforded quips and stunts for every occasion." A different perspective on Thorpe, quoted by <a href="Michael%20Bloch">Michael Bloch</a>, was given by a former friend, the art expert <a href="David%20Carritt">David Carritt</a>, at the time of the trial: "Self-centred ..."Mildly" entertaining, slightly sinister. Said to be witty, but ... if one doesn't care for impersonations, he's really a bit of a bore".

In assessing Thorpe's 10 years as party leader, <a href="Nick%20Clegg">Nick Clegg</a> credited him with providing "the driving force that continued the Liberal revival that began under Jo Grimond", and <a href="Douglas%20Murray%20%28author%29">Douglas Murray</a>, writing for "<a href="The%20Spectator">The Spectator</a>", recognised his strategy of identifying and concentrating on winnable seats as the basis for the major Liberal Democrat breakthrough in the 1997 election. Dutton, in his party history, took a more qualified view, suggesting that in spite of Thorpe's bold style and charisma, "the party drifted without a sense of conviction and underlying purpose ... [and was] dominated by tactics rather than ideas". Thorpe positioned the Liberals in the "moderate centre", equidistant from Labour and Conservative, a strategy which was very successful in February 1974 when dissatisfaction with the two main parties was at its height, but which left the party's specific identity obscure, and its policies largely unknown.

Thorpe never discussed his sexuality publicly, although throughout his political career he led a double life — responsible politician by day while, according to Murray, "by night he was not only very gay but rather carefree about being so." The writer and broadcaster <a href="Jonathan%20Fryer">Jonathan Fryer</a>, who was a gay activist within the Liberal Party in the 1970s, maintained that in the repressive climate of the time Thorpe "couldn't have come out, even if he'd wanted to". However, his double standard irritated and alienated the gay Liberals: "He wanted the best of both worlds—his fun and a family."

In his review of Michael Bloch's biography, Murray writes: "Jeremy Thorpe had hoped to be remembered as a great political leader. I suppose they all do. And perhaps he will be remembered longer than many other politicians of his age or ours. But it will always be for the same thing. Jeremy, Jeremy, bang, bang, woof, woof."

In 2009, the BBC attempted to film a TV biopic of Thorpe's life, slated to star <a href="Rupert%20Everett">Rupert Everett</a> in the title role, but this was subsequently abandoned after legal threats from Thorpe. "<a href="A%20Very%20English%20Scandal">A Very English Scandal</a>", a <a href="true%20crime">true crime</a> <a href="non-fiction%20novel">non-fiction novel</a> covering the Thorpe/Scott affair, by <a href="John%20Preston%20%28author%2C%20born%201953%29">John Preston</a>, was published on 5 May <a href="2016%20in%20literature">2016</a> by <a href="Viking%20Press">Viking Press</a>. The book was described as "a political thriller, with urgent dialogue, well-staged scenes, escalating tension and plenty of cliffhangers, especially once the trial begins". A British three-part television series, also titled "<a href="A%20Very%20English%20Scandal%20%28TV%20series%29">"A Very English Scandal</a>", based on Preston's novel, aired on the BBC in May 2018, directed by <a href="Stephen%20Frears">Stephen Frears</a>, with actor <a href="Hugh%20Grant">Hugh Grant</a> starring as Thorpe and <a href="Ben%20Whishaw">Ben Whishaw</a> as Norman Scott.

Starfish

Starfish or sea stars are star-shaped <a href="echinoderm">echinoderm</a>s belonging to the <a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a> Asteroidea. Common usage frequently finds these names being also applied to <a href="Brittle%20stars">ophiuroids</a>, which are correctly referred to as <a href="brittle%20star">brittle star</a>s or basket stars. About 1,500 species of starfish occur on the seabed in all the world's oceans, from the tropics to frigid polar waters. They are found from the <a href="intertidal%20zone">intertidal zone</a> down to <a href="abyssal%20zone">abyssal</a> depths, below the surface.

Starfish are <a href="marine%20invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a>. They typically have a central disc and five arms, though some species have a larger number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have <a href="tube%20feet">tube feet</a> operated by a <a href="Water%20vascular%20system">hydraulic system</a> and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are <a href="opportunistic">opportunistic</a> feeders and are mostly <a href="Predation">predators</a> on <a href="benthic">benthic</a> invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and <a href="suspension%20feeding">suspension feeding</a>. They have complex <a href="Biological%20life%20cycle">life cycles</a> and can reproduce both sexually and <a href="Asexual%20reproduction%20in%20starfish">asexually</a>. Most can <a href="Regeneration%20%28biology%29">regenerate</a> damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant <a href="ecology">ecological</a> roles. Starfish, such as the <a href="ochre%20sea%20star">ochre sea star</a> ("Pisaster ochraceus") and the <a href="reef%20starfish">reef sea star</a> ("Stichaster australis"), have become widely known as examples of the <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a> concept in ecology. The tropical <a href="crown-of-thorns%20starfish">crown-of-thorns starfish</a> ("Acanthaster planci") is a voracious predator of <a href="coral">coral</a> throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the <a href="Asterias%20amurensis">northern Pacific sea star</a> is considered to be one of the <a href="list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20100%20worst%20invasive%20species">world's 100 worst invasive species</a>.

The <a href="fossil">fossil</a> record for starfish is ancient, dating back to the <a href="Ordovician">Ordovician</a> around 450 million years ago, but it is rather sparse, as starfish tend to disintegrate after death. Only the <a href="Ossicle%20%28echinoderm%29">ossicles</a> and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.

Most starfish have five arms that radiate from a central disc, but the number varies with the group. Some species have six or seven arms and others have 10–15 arms. The Antarctic "<a href="Labidiaster%20annulatus">Labidiaster annulatus</a>" can have over fifty. Having descended from bilateral organisms, starfish move in a bilateral fashion, with certain arms acting like the front of the animal.

The body wall consists of a thin cuticle, an <a href="Epidermis%20%28zoology%29">epidermis</a> consisting of a single layer of cells, a thick <a href="dermis">dermis</a> formed of <a href="connective%20tissue">connective tissue</a> and a thin <a href="coelom">coelom</a>ic <a href="Myoepithelial%20cell">myoepithelial</a> layer, which provides the longitudinal and circular musculature. The dermis contains an <a href="endoskeleton">endoskeleton</a> of <a href="calcium%20carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> components known as ossicles. These are honeycombed structures composed of <a href="calcite">calcite</a> microcrystals arranged in a lattice. They vary in form, with some bearing external granules, tubercles and spines, but most are tabular plates that fit neatly together in a <a href="Tessellation">tessellated</a> manner and form the main covering of the aboral surface. Some are specialised structures such as the <a href="madreporite">madreporite</a> (the entrance to the water vascular system), <a href="pedicellaria">pedicellaria</a>e and <a href="Paxilla%20%28ossicle%29">paxillae</a>. Pedicellariae are compound ossicles with forceps-like jaws. They remove debris from the body surface and wave around on flexible stalks in response to physical or chemical stimuli while continually making biting movements. They often form clusters surrounding spines. Paxillae are umbrella-like structures found on starfish that live buried in sediment. The edges of adjacent paxillae meet to form a false cuticle with a water cavity beneath in which the madreporite and delicate gill structures are protected. All the ossicles, including those projecting externally, are covered by the epidermal layer.

Several groups of starfish, including <a href="Valvatida">Valvatida</a> and <a href="Forcipulatida">Forcipulatida</a>, possess <a href="pedicellariae">pedicellariae</a>. In Forcipulatida, such as "<a href="Asterias">Asterias</a>" and "<a href="Pisaster">Pisaster</a>", they occur in <a href="pompom">pompom</a>-like tufts at the base of each spine, whereas in the <a href="Goniasteridae">Goniasteridae</a>, such as "<a href="Hippasteria%20phrygiana">Hippasteria phrygiana</a>", the pedicellariae are scattered over the body surface. Some are thought to assist in defence, while others aid in feeding or in the removal of organisms attempting to settle on the starfish's surface. Some species like "Labidiaster annulatus", "<a href="Rathbunaster%20californicus">Rathbunaster californicus</a>" and "<a href="Novodinia%20antillensis">Novodinia antillensis</a>" use their large pedicellariae to capture small fish and crustaceans.

There may also be <a href="papula">papula</a>e, thin-walled protrusions of the body cavity that reach through the body wall and extend into the surrounding water. These serve a <a href="aquatic%20respiration">respiratory</a> function. The structures are supported by collagen fibres set at right angles to each other and arranged in a three-dimensional web with the ossicles and papulae in the <a href="wikt%3Ainterstice">interstices</a>. This arrangement enables both easy flexion of the arms by the starfish and the rapid onset of stiffness and rigidity required for actions performed under stress.

The water vascular system of the starfish is a <a href="Hydraulics">hydraulic system</a> made up of a network of fluid-filled canals and is concerned with locomotion, adhesion, food manipulation and <a href="gas%20exchange">gas exchange</a>. Water enters the system through the <a href="madreporite">madreporite</a>, a porous, often conspicuous, sieve-like ossicle on the aboral surface. It is linked through a stone canal, often lined with calcareous material, to a ring canal around the mouth opening. A set of radial canals leads off this; one radial canal runs along the <a href="wikt%3Aambulacral">ambulacral</a> groove in each arm. There are short lateral canals branching off alternately to either side of the radial canal, each ending in an ampulla. These bulb-shaped organs are joined to tube feet (podia) on the exterior of the animal by short linking canals that pass through ossicles in the ambulacral groove. There are usually two rows of tube feet but in some species, the lateral canals are alternately long and short and there appear to be four rows. The interior of the whole canal system is lined with <a href="cilium">cilia</a>.

When longitudinal muscles in the ampullae contract, valves in the lateral canals close and water is forced into the tube feet. These extend to contact the <a href="Substrate%20%28biology%29">substrate</a>. Although the tube feet resemble suction cups in appearance, the gripping action is a function of adhesive chemicals rather than suction. Other chemicals and relaxation of the ampullae allow for release from the substrate. The tube feet latch on to surfaces and move in a wave, with one arm section attaching to the surface as another releases. Some starfish turn up the tips of their arms while moving which gives maximum exposure of the sensory tube feet and the eyespot to external stimuli.

In some situations, particularly when hunting or in danger, starfish may move in a bilateral fashion. When crawling, some arms act as the leading arms, while others trail behind. Most starfish cannot move quickly, a typical speed being that of the <a href="leather%20star">leather star</a> ("Dermasterias imbricata"), which can manage just in a minute. Some burrowing species from the genera "<a href="Astropecten">Astropecten</a>" and "<a href="Luidia">Luidia</a>" have points rather than suckers on their long tube feet and are capable of much more rapid motion, "gliding" across the ocean floor. The <a href="sand%20star">sand star</a> ("Luidia foliolata") can travel at a speed of per minute. When a starfish finds itself upside down, two adjacent arms are bent backwards to provide support, the opposite arm is used to stamp the ground while the two remaining arms are raised on either side; finally the stamping arm is released as the starfish turns itself over and recovers its normal stance.

Apart from their function in locomotion, the tube feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, and carbon dioxide to, the tube feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the <a href="Coelom%23Coelomic%20fluid">coelomic fluid</a>, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.

The gut of a starfish occupies most of the disc and extends into the arms. The mouth is located in the centre of the oral surface, where it is surrounded by a tough <a href="wikt%3Aperistomial">peristomial</a> membrane and closed with a <a href="sphincter">sphincter</a>. The mouth opens through a short <a href="oesophagus">oesophagus</a> into a <a href="stomach">stomach</a> divided by a constriction into a larger, <a href="wikt%3Aeversible">eversible</a> cardiac portion and a smaller pyloric portion. The cardiac stomach is glandular and pouched, and is supported by <a href="ligament">ligament</a>s attached to ossicles in the arms so it can be pulled back into position after it has been everted. The pyloric stomach has two extensions into each arm: the <a href="caecum">pyloric caeca</a>. These are elongated, branched hollow tubes that are lined by a series of glands, which secrete digestive <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a>s and absorb nutrients from the food. A short <a href="intestine">intestine</a> and <a href="rectum">rectum</a> run from the pyloric stomach to open at a small <a href="anus">anus</a> at the apex of the aboral surface of the disc.

Primitive starfish, such as "Astropecten" and "Luidia", swallow their <a href="Predation">prey</a> whole, and start to digest it in their cardiac stomachs. Shell valves and other inedible materials are ejected through their mouths. The semi-digested fluid is passed into their pyloric stomachs and caeca where digestion continues and absorption ensues. In more advanced species of starfish, the cardiac stomach can be everted from the organism's body to engulf and digest food. When the prey is a clam or other <a href="Bivalvia">bivalve</a>, the starfish pulls with its tube feet to separate the two valves slightly, and inserts a small section of its stomach, which releases enzymes to digest the prey. The stomach and the partially digested prey are later retracted into the disc. Here the food is passed on to the pyloric stomach, which always remains inside the disc. The retraction and contraction of the cardiac stomach is activated by a <a href="neuropeptide">neuropeptide</a> known as NGFFYamide.

Because of this ability to digest food outside the body, starfish can hunt prey much larger than their mouths. Their diets include clams and <a href="oyster">oyster</a>s, <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s, small <a href="fish">fish</a> and <a href="Gastropoda">gastropod molluscs</a>. Some starfish are not pure <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s, supplementing their diets with <a href="algae">algae</a> or organic detritus. Some of these species are <a href="Grazing">grazers</a>, but others trap food particles from the water in sticky <a href="mucus">mucus</a> strands that are swept towards the mouth along <a href="cilia">cilia</a>ted grooves.

The main nitrogenous waste product is <a href="ammonia">ammonia</a>. Starfish have no distinct excretory organs; waste ammonia is removed by diffusion through the tube feet and papulae. The body fluid contains <a href="phagocyte">phagocytic</a> cells, coelomocytes, which are also found within the hemal and water vascular systems. These cells engulf waste material, and eventually migrate to the tips of the papulae, where a portion of body wall is nipped off and ejected into the surrounding water. Some waste may also be excreted by the pyloric glands and voided with the <a href="faeces">faeces</a>.

Starfish do not appear to have any mechanisms for <a href="osmoregulation">osmoregulation</a>, and keep their body fluids at the same salt concentration as the surrounding water. Although some species can tolerate relatively low <a href="salinity">salinity</a>, the lack of an osmoregulation system probably explains why starfish are not found in fresh water or even in many <a href="estuarine">estuarine</a> environments.

Although starfish do not have many well-defined sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation and the status of the water around them. The tube feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. The tube feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple <a href="ocellus">ocelli</a>. These are composed of <a href="pigment">pigment</a>ed epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual <a href="photoreceptor%20cells">photoreceptor cells</a> in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.

While a starfish lacks a <a href="Central%20nervous%20system">centralized brain</a>, it has a complex <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> with a nerve ring around the mouth and a radial nerve running along the ambulacral region of each arm parallel to the radial canal. The peripheral nerve system consists of two nerve nets: a sensory system in the epidermis and a motor system in the lining of the coelomic cavity. Neurons passing through the dermis connect the two. The ring nerves and radial nerves have sensory and motor components and coordinate the starfish's balance and directional systems. The sensory component receives input from the sensory organs while the motor nerves control the tube feet and musculature. The starfish does not have the capacity to plan its actions. If one arm detects an attractive odour, it becomes dominant and temporarily over-rides the other arms to initiate movement towards the prey. The mechanism for this is not fully understood.

The body cavity contains the <a href="circulatory%20system">circulatory</a> or haemal system. The vessels form three rings: one around the mouth (the hyponeural haemal ring), another around the digestive system (the gastric ring) and the third near the aboral surface (the genital ring). The heart beats about six times a minute and is at the apex of a vertical channel (the axial vessel) that connects the three rings. At the base of each arm are paired <a href="gonad">gonad</a>s; a lateral vessel extends from the genital ring past the gonads to the tip of the arm. This vessel has a blind end and there is no continuous circulation of the fluid within it. This liquid does not contain a pigment and has little or no respiratory function but is probably used to transport nutrients around the body.

Starfish produce a large number of <a href="secondary%20metabolite">secondary metabolite</a>s in the form of <a href="lipid">lipid</a>s, including <a href="steroid">steroid</a>al derivatives of <a href="cholesterol">cholesterol</a>, and <a href="fatty%20acid">fatty acid</a> <a href="amide">amide</a>s of <a href="sphingosine">sphingosine</a>. The steroids are mostly <a href="saponin">saponin</a>s, known as asterosaponins, and their <a href="sulfation">sulphated</a> derivatives. They vary between species and are typically formed from up to six sugar molecules (usually <a href="glucose">glucose</a> and <a href="galactose">galactose</a>) connected by up to three <a href="glycosidic">glycosidic</a> chains. Long-chain fatty acid amides of sphingosine occur frequently and some of them have known <a href="pharmacological%20activity">pharmacological activity</a>. Various <a href="ceramide">ceramide</a>s are also known from starfish and a small number of <a href="alkaloid">alkaloid</a>s have also been identified. The functions of these chemicals in the starfish have not been fully investigated but most have roles in defence and communication. Some are feeding deterrents used by the starfish to discourage predation. Others are <a href="wikt%3Aantifouling">antifoulants</a> and supplement the pedicellariae to prevent other organisms from settling on the starfish's aboral surface. Some are alarm <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s and escape-eliciting chemicals, the release of which trigger responses in <a href="conspecific">conspecific</a> starfish but often produce escape responses in potential prey. Research into the efficacy of these compounds for possible pharmacological or industrial use occurs worldwide.

Most species of starfish are <a href="Gonochorism">gonochorous</a>, there being separate male and female individuals. These are usually not distinguishable externally as the gonads cannot be seen, but their sex is apparent when they <a href="Spawn%20%28biology%29">spawn</a>. Some species are <a href="hermaphrodites%23Simultaneous%20hermaphrodites">simultaneous hermaphrodites</a>, producing eggs and sperm at the same time and in a few of these, the same gonad, called an <a href="ovotestis">ovotestis</a>, produces both eggs and sperm. Other starfish are <a href="hermaphrodites%23Sequential%20hermaphrodites">sequential hermaphrodites</a>. <a href="Protandrous">Protandrous</a> individuals of species like "<a href="Asterina%20%28starfish%29">Asterina gibbosa</a>" start life as males before changing sex into females as they grow older. In some species such as "<a href="Nepanthia%20belcheri">Nepanthia belcheri</a>", a large female can <a href="Fragmentation%20%28reproduction%29">split in half</a> and the resulting offspring are males. When these grow large enough they change back into females.

Each starfish arm contains two gonads that release <a href="gametes">gametes</a> through openings called gonoducts, located on the central disc between the arms. <a href="Fertilization">Fertilization</a> is generally external but in a few species, internal fertilization takes place. In most species, the buoyant eggs and sperm are simply released into the water (free spawning) and the resulting <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s and <a href="larva">larva</a>e live as part of the <a href="plankton">plankton</a>. In others, the eggs may be stuck to the undersides of rocks. In certain species of starfish, the females <a href="Egg%20incubation">brood</a> their eggs – either by simply enveloping them or by holding them in specialised structures. Brooding may be done in pockets on the starfish's aboral surface, inside the pyloric stomach ("<a href="Leptasterias%20tenera">Leptasterias tenera</a>") or even in the interior of the gonads themselves. Those starfish that brood their eggs by "sitting" on them usually assume a humped posture with their discs raised off the substrate. "<a href="Pteraster%20militaris">Pteraster militaris</a>" broods a few of its young and disperses the remaining eggs, that are too numerous to fit into its pouch. In these brooding species, the eggs are relatively large, and supplied with <a href="yolk">yolk</a>, and they generally develop directly into miniature starfish without an intervening larval stage. The developing young are called lecithotrophic because they obtain their nutrition from the yolk as opposed to "planktotrophic" larvae that feed in the <a href="water%20column">water column</a>. In "<a href="Parvulastra%20parvivipara">Parvulastra parvivipara</a>", an <a href="wikt%3Aintragonadal">intragonadal</a> brooder, the young starfish obtain nutrients by eating other eggs and embryos in the brood pouch. Brooding is especially common in polar and deep-sea species that live in environments unfavourable for larval development and in smaller species that produce just a few eggs.

In the tropics, a plentiful supply of phytoplankton is continuously available for starfish larvae to feed on. Spawning takes place at any time of year, each species having its own characteristic breeding season. In temperate regions, the spring and summer brings an increase in food supplies. The first individual of a species to spawn may release a <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a> that serves to attract other starfish to aggregate and to release their gametes synchronously. In other species, a male and female may come together and form a pair. This behaviour is called <a href="pseudocopulation">pseudocopulation</a> and the male climbs on top, placing his arms between those of the female. When she releases eggs into the water, he is induced to spawn. Starfish may use environmental signals to coordinate the time of spawning (day length to indicate the correct time of the year, dawn or dusk to indicate the correct time of day), and chemical signals to indicate their readiness to breed. In some species, mature females produce chemicals to attract sperm in the sea water.

Most starfish embryos hatch at the <a href="blastula">blastula</a> stage. The original ball of cells develops a lateral pouch, the <a href="archenteron">archenteron</a>. The entrance to this is known as the <a href="blastopore">blastopore</a> and it will later develop into the anus. Another invagination of the surface will fuse with the tip of the archenteron as the mouth while the interior section will become the gut. At the same time, a band of <a href="Cilium">cilia</a> develops on the exterior. This enlarges and extends around the surface and eventually onto two developing arm-like outgrowths. At this stage the larva is known as a <a href="bipinnaria">bipinnaria</a>. The cilia are used for locomotion and feeding, their rhythmic beat wafting <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a> towards the mouth.

The next stage in development is a <a href="brachiolaria">brachiolaria</a> larva and involves the growth of three short, additional arms. These are at the anterior end, surround a sucker and have adhesive cells at their tips. Both bipinnaria and brachiolaria larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. When fully developed, the brachiolaria settles on the seabed and attaches itself with a short stalk formed from the ventral arms and sucker. Metamorphosis now takes place with a radical rearrangement of tissues. The left side of the larval body becomes the oral surface of the juvenile and the right side the aboral surface. Part of the gut is retained but the mouth and anus move to new positions. Some of the body cavities degenerate but others become the water vascular system and the visceral coelom. The starfish is now pentaradially symmetrical. It casts off its stalk and becomes a free-living juvenile starfish about in diameter. Starfish of the order Paxillosida have no brachiolaria stage, with the bipinnaria larvae settling on the seabed and developing directly into juveniles.

Some species of starfish are able to reproduce <a href="Asexual%20reproduction">asexually</a> as adults either by <a href="Fragmentation%20%28reproduction%29">fission</a> of their central discs or by <a href="autotomy">autotomy</a> of one or more of their arms. Which of these processes occurs depends on the genus. Among starfish that are able to regenerate their whole body from a single arm, some can do so even from fragments just long. Single arms that regenerate a whole individual are called comet forms. The division of the starfish, either across its disc or at the base of the arm, is usually accompanied by a weakness in the structure that provides a fracture zone.

The larvae of several species of starfish can reproduce asexually before they reach maturity. They do this by autotomising some parts of their bodies or by <a href="budding">budding</a>. When such a larva senses that food is plentiful, it takes the path of asexual reproduction rather than normal development. Though this costs it time and energy and delays maturity, it allows a single larva to give rise to multiple adults when the conditions are appropriate.

Some species of starfish have the ability to <a href="Regeneration%20%28biology%29">regenerate</a> lost arms and can regrow an entire new limb given time. A few can regrow a complete new disc from a single arm, while others need at least part of the central disc to be attached to the detached part. Regrowth can take several months or years, and starfish are vulnerable to infections during the early stages after the loss of an arm. A separated limb lives off stored nutrients until it regrows a disc and mouth and is able to feed again. Other than fragmentation carried out for the purpose of reproduction, the division of the body may happen inadvertently due to part being detached by a predator, or part may be actively shed by the starfish in an escape response. The loss of parts of the body is achieved by the rapid softening of a special type of connective tissue in response to nervous signals. This type of tissue is called catch connective tissue and is found in most echinoderms. An autotomy-promoting factor has been identified which, when injected into another starfish, causes rapid shedding of arms.

The lifespan of a starfish varies considerably between species, generally being longer in larger forms and in those with planktonic larvae. For example, "<a href="Leptasterias%20hexactis">Leptasterias hexactis</a>" broods a small number of large-yolked eggs. It has an adult weight of , reaches sexual maturity in two years and lives for about ten years. "<a href="Pisaster%20ochraceus">Pisaster ochraceus</a>" releases a large number of eggs into the sea each year and has an adult weight of up to . It reaches maturity in five years and has a maximum recorded lifespan of 34 years.

Echinoderms, including starfish, maintain a delicate internal <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> balance that is in equilibrium with sea water. This means that it is only possible for them to live in a marine environment and they are not found in any <a href="freshwater">freshwater</a> habitats. Starfish species inhabit all of the world's oceans. Habitats range from tropical <a href="coral%20reef">coral reef</a>s, rocky shores, <a href="tidal%20pool">tidal pool</a>s, mud, and sand to <a href="kelp%20forest">kelp forest</a>s, <a href="Seagrass">seagrass meadows</a> and the deep-sea floor down to at least . The greatest diversity of species occurs in coastal areas.

Most species are generalist predators, eating <a href="Microphyte">microalgae</a>, <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s, <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a>s, <a href="snail">snail</a>s and other small animals. The <a href="crown-of-thorns%20starfish">crown-of-thorns starfish</a> consumes <a href="coral">coral</a> polyps, while other species are <a href="detritivore">detritivore</a>s, feeding on decomposing organic material and faecal matter. A few are suspension feeders, gathering in <a href="phytoplankton">phytoplankton</a>; "<a href="Henricia">Henricia</a>" and "<a href="Echinaster">Echinaster</a>" often occur in association with sponges, benefiting from the water current they produce. Various species have been shown to be able to absorb organic nutrients from the surrounding water, and this may form a significant portion of their diet.

The processes of feeding and capture may be aided by special parts; "<a href="Pisaster%20brevispinus">Pisaster brevispinus</a>", the short-spined pisaster from the <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">West Coast</a> of America, can use a set of specialized tube feet to dig itself deep into the soft substrate to extract prey (usually <a href="clam">clam</a>s). Grasping the shellfish, the starfish slowly pries open the prey's shell by wearing out its <a href="Adduction">adductor</a> muscle, and then inserts its everted stomach into the crack to digest the soft tissues. The gap between the valves need only be a fraction of a millimetre wide for the stomach to gain entry.

Starfish are <a href="keystone%20species">keystone species</a> in their respective marine <a href="Community%20%28ecology%29">communities</a>. Their relatively large sizes, diverse diets and ability to adapt to different environments makes them ecologically important. The term "keystone species" was in fact first used by <a href="Robert%20T.%20Paine%20%28zoologist%29">Robert Paine</a> in 1966 to describe a starfish, "Pisaster ochraceus". When studying the low intertidal coasts of <a href="Washington%20%28state%29">Washington state</a>, Paine found that predation by "P. ochraceus" was a major factor in the diversity of species. Experimental removals of this top predator from a stretch of shoreline resulted in lower species diversity and the eventual domination of "<a href="Mytilus%20%28bivalve%29">Mytilus</a>" mussels, which were able to outcompete other organisms for space and resources. Similar results were found in a 1971 study of "<a href="Stichaster%20australis">Stichaster australis</a>" on the intertidal coast of the <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a> of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>. "S. australis" was found to have removed most of a batch of transplanted mussels within two or three months of their placement, while in an area from which "S. australis" had been removed, the mussels increased in number dramatically, overwhelming the area and threatening <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.

The feeding activity of the <a href="Omnivore">omnivorous</a> starfish "<a href="Oreaster%20reticulatus">Oreaster reticulatus</a>" on sandy and seagrass bottoms in the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a> appears to regulate the diversity, distribution and abundance of microorganisms. These starfish engulf piles of sediment removing the surface films and algae adhering to the particles. Organisms that dislike this disturbance are replaced by others better able to rapidly recolonise "clean" sediment. In addition, foraging by these migratory starfish creates diverse patches of organic matter, which may play a role in the distribution and abundance of organisms such as fish, crabs and sea urchins that feed on the sediment.

Starfish sometimes have negative effects on ecosystems. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and <a href="French%20Polynesia">French Polynesia</a>. A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically with the arrival of migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had an unintended effect on reef-feeding fish and the whole <a href="benthic">benthic</a> community. "<a href="Asterias%20amurensis">Asterias amurensis</a>" is one of a few echinoderm <a href="invasive%20species">invasive species</a>. Its larvae likely arrived in <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s. The species has since grown in numbers to the point where they threaten commercially important <a href="bivalve">bivalve</a> populations. As such, they are considered pests, and are on the Invasive Species Specialist Group's <a href="list%20of%20the%20world%27s%20100%20worst%20invasive%20species">list of the world's 100 worst invasive species</a>.

Starfish may be preyed on by conspecifics, other starfish species, <a href="Triton%20%28gastropod%29">tritons</a>, crabs, fish, <a href="gull">gull</a>s and <a href="sea%20otter">sea otter</a>s. Their first lines of defence are the <a href="saponin">saponin</a>s present in their body walls, which have unpleasant flavours. Some starfish such as "<a href="Astropecten%20polyacanthus">Astropecten polyacanthus</a>" also include powerful toxins such as <a href="tetrodotoxin">tetrodotoxin</a> among their chemical armoury, and the <a href="Pteraster%20tesselatus">slime star</a> can ooze out large quantities of repellent mucus. They also have body armour in the form of hard plates and spines. The <a href="crown-of-thorns%20starfish">crown-of-thorns starfish</a> is particularly unattractive to potential predators, being heavily defended by sharp spines, laced with toxins and sometimes with bright <a href="aposematism">warning colours</a>. Other species protect their vulnerable tube feet and arm tips by lining their ambulacral grooves with spines and heavily plating their extremities.

Several species sometimes suffer from a <a href="wasting">wasting</a> condition caused by bacteria in the genus "<a href="Vibrio">Vibrio</a>"; however, a more widespread <a href="Starfish%20wasting%20disease">wasting disease</a>, causing mass mortalities among starfish, appears sporadically. A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV).
The protozoan "<a href="Orchitophrya%20stellarum">Orchitophrya stellarum</a>" is known to infect the gonads of starfish and damage tissue. Starfish are vulnerable to high temperatures. Experiments have shown that the feeding and growth rates of "P. ochraceus" reduce greatly when their body temperatures rise above and that they die when their temperature rises to . This species has a unique ability to absorb seawater to keep itself cool when it is exposed to sunlight by a receding tide. It also appears to rely on its arms to absorb heat, so as to protect the central disc and vital organs like the stomach.

Starfish and other echinoderms are sensitive to <a href="marine%20pollution">marine pollution</a>. The <a href="common%20starfish">common starfish</a> is considered to be a <a href="bioindicator">bioindicator</a> for marine ecosystems. A 2009 study found that "P. ochraceus" is unlikely to be affected by <a href="ocean%20acidification">ocean acidification</a> as severely as other marine animals with <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> skeletons. In other groups, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution when the <a href="pH">pH</a> is lowered. Researchers found that when "P. ochraceus" were exposed to and 770 <a href="parts%20per%20million">ppm</a> <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> (beyond rises expected in the next century), they were relatively unaffected. Their survival is likely due to the nodular nature of their skeletons, which are able to compensate for a shortage of carbonate by growing more fleshy tissue.

Echinoderms first appeared in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> in the <a href="Cambrian">Cambrian</a>. The first known asterozoans were the <a href="Asterozoa%23Somasteroidea">Somasteroidea</a>, which exhibit characteristics of both groups. Starfish are infrequently found as fossils, possibly because their hard skeletal components separate as the animal decays. Despite this, there are a few places where accumulations of complete skeletal structures occur, fossilized in place in <a href="Lagerst%C3%A4tte">Lagerstätte</a>n — so-called "starfish beds".

By the late <a href="Paleozoic">Paleozoic</a>, the <a href="Crinoidea">crinoids</a> and <a href="blastoid">blastoid</a>s were the predominant echinoderms, and some limestones from this period are made almost entirely from fragments from these groups. In the two major <a href="extinction%20event">extinction event</a>s that occurred during the late <a href="Devonian">Devonian</a> and late <a href="Permian">Permian</a>, the blastoids were wiped out and only a few species of crinoids survived. Many starfish species also became extinct in these events, but afterwards the surviving few species diversified rapidly within about sixty million years during the <a href="Early%20Jurassic">Early Jurassic</a> and the beginning of the <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a>. A 2012 study found that <a href="speciation">speciation</a> in starfish can occur rapidly. During the last 6,000 years, divergence in the larval development of "<a href="Cryptasterina%20hystera">Cryptasterina hystera</a>" and "<a href="Cryptasterina%20pentagona">Cryptasterina pentagona</a>" has taken place, the former adopting internal fertilization and brooding and the latter remaining a broadcast spawner.

The scientific name Asteroidea was given to starfish by the French zoologist <a href="Henri%20Marie%20Ducrotay%20de%20Blainville">de Blainville</a> in 1830. It is derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "aster", ἀστήρ (a star) and the Greek "eidos", εἶδος (form, likeness, appearance). The class Asteroidea belongs to the phylum <a href="Echinodermata">Echinodermata</a>. As well as the starfish, the echinoderms include <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, <a href="sand%20dollar">sand dollar</a>s, <a href="Brittle%20star">brittle</a> and <a href="basket%20star">basket star</a>s, <a href="sea%20cucumber">sea cucumber</a>s and <a href="crinoid">crinoid</a>s. The larvae of echinoderms have bilateral symmetry, but during <a href="metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> this is replaced with <a href="Symmetry%20in%20biology">radial symmetry</a>, typically <a href="Pentamerism%23Pentamerism">pentameric</a>. Adult echinoderms are characterized by having a <a href="water%20vascular%20system">water vascular system</a> with external <a href="tube%20feet">tube feet</a> and a <a href="calcareous">calcareous</a> endoskeleton consisting of <a href="Ossicle%20%28echinoderm%29">ossicles</a> connected by a mesh of <a href="collagen">collagen</a> fibres. Starfish are included in the subphylum <a href="Asterozoa">Asterozoa</a>, the characteristics of which include a flattened, star-shaped body as adults consisting of a central disc and multiple radiating arms. The subphylum includes the two <a href="Class%20%28biology%29">classes</a> of Asteroidea, the starfish, and <a href="Ophiuroidea">Ophiuroidea</a>, the brittle stars and basket stars. Asteroids have broad-based arms with skeletal support provided by calcareous plates in the body wall while ophiuroids have clearly demarcated slender arms strengthened by paired fused ossicles forming jointed "vertebrae".

The starfish are a large and diverse class with about 1,500 living species. There are seven <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> orders, <a href="Brisingida">Brisingida</a>, <a href="Forcipulatida">Forcipulatida</a>, <a href="Notomyotida">Notomyotida</a>, <a href="Paxillosida">Paxillosida</a>, <a href="Spinulosida">Spinulosida</a>, <a href="Valvatida">Valvatida</a> and <a href="Velatida">Velatida</a> and two extinct ones, <a href="Calliasterellidae">Calliasterellidae</a> and <a href="Trichasteropsida">Trichasteropsida</a>. Living asteroids, the Neoasteroidea, are morphologically distinct from their forerunners in the Paleozoic. The taxonomy of the group is relatively stable but there is ongoing debate about the status of the <a href="Paxillosida">Paxillosida</a>, and the deep-water sea daisies, though clearly Asteroidea and currently included in <a href="Velatida">Velatida</a>, do not fit easily in any accepted lineage. <a href="Phylogenetics">Phylogenetic data</a> suggests that they may be a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a>, the Concentricycloidea, to the Neoasteroidea, or that the Velatida themselves may be a sister group.





Extinct groups within the Asteroidea include:

Starfish are <a href="deuterostome">deuterostome</a> animals, like the <a href="chordate">chordate</a>s. A 2014 analysis of 219 genes from all classes of echinoderms gives the following <a href="phylogenetic%20tree">phylogenetic tree</a>. The times at which the <a href="clade">clade</a>s diverged is shown under the labels in millions of years ago (mya).

The phylogeny of the Asteroidea has been difficult to resolve, with visible (morphological) features proving inadequate, and the question of whether traditional <a href="taxon">taxa</a> are <a href="clade">clade</a>s in doubt. The phylogeny proposed by Gale in 1987 is:

The phylogeny proposed by Blake in 1987 is:

Later work making use of <a href="Molecular%20clock">molecular evidence</a>, with or without the use of morphological evidence, had by 2000 failed to resolve the argument. In 2011, on further molecular evidence, Janies and colleagues noted that the phylogeny of the echinoderms "has proven difficult", and that "the overall phylogeny of extant echinoderms remains sensitive to the choice of analytical methods". They presented a phylogenetic tree for the living Asteroidea only; using the traditional names of starfish orders where possible, and indicating "part of" otherwise, the phylogeny is shown below. The Solasteridae are split from the Velatida, and the old Spinulosida is broken up.

Starfish are <a href="deuterostome">deuterostome</a>s, closely related, together with all other echinoderms, to <a href="chordate">chordate</a>s, and are used in reproductive and developmental studies. Female starfish produce large numbers of <a href="oocyte">oocyte</a>s that are easily isolated; these can be stored in a <a href="Meiosis">pre-meiosis</a> phase and stimulated to complete division by the use of <a href="Adenine">1-methyladenine</a>. Starfish oocytes are well suited for this research as they are large and easy to handle, transparent, simple to maintain in sea water at room temperature, and they develop rapidly. "<a href="Asterina%20pectinifera">Asterina pectinifera</a>", used as a <a href="model%20organism">model organism</a> for this purpose, is resilient and easy to breed and maintain in the laboratory.

Another area of research is the ability of starfish to regenerate lost body parts. The <a href="stem%20cell">stem cell</a>s of adult humans are incapable of much differentiation and understanding the regrowth, repair and cloning processes in starfish may have implications for human medicine.

Starfish also have an unusual ability to expel foreign objects from their bodies, which makes them difficult to tag for research tracking purposes.

An <a href="Australian%20Aborigine">aboriginal Australian</a> fable retold by the Welsh school headmaster <a href="William%20Jenkyn%20Thomas">William Jenkyn Thomas</a> (1870–1959) tells how some animals needed a canoe to cross the ocean. Whale had one but refused to lend it, so Starfish kept him busy, telling him stories and grooming him to remove parasites, while the others stole the canoe. When Whale realized the trick he beat Starfish ragged, which is how Starfish still is today.

In 1900, the scholar <a href="Edward%20Tregear">Edward Tregear</a> documented "The Creation Song", which he describes as "an ancient prayer for the dedication of a high chief" of <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. Among the "uncreated gods" described early in the song are the male Kumilipo ("Creation") and the female Poele, both born in the night, a coral insect, the earthworm, and the starfish.

<a href="Georg%20Eberhard%20Rumpf">Georg Eberhard Rumpf</a>'s 1705 "The Ambonese Curiosity Cabinet" describes the tropical varieties of "Stella Marina" or "Bintang Laut", "Sea Star", in Latin and <a href="Malay%20language">Malay</a> respectively, known in the waters around <a href="Ambon%20Island">Ambon</a>. He writes that the "Histoire des Antilles" reports that when the sea stars "see thunder storms approaching, [they] grab hold of many small stones with their little legs, looking to ... hold themselves down as if with anchors".

"Starfish" is the title of novels by <a href="Peter%20Watts%20%28author%29">Peter Watts</a> and Jennie Orbell, and in 2012, Alice Addison wrote a non-fiction book titled "Starfish - A year in the life of bereavement and depression". "<a href="The%20Starfish%20and%20the%20Spider">The Starfish and the Spider</a>" is a 2006 <a href="business%20management">business management</a> book by Ori Brafman and <a href="Rod%20Beckstrom">Rod Beckstrom</a>; its title alludes to the ability of the starfish to regenerate itself because of its decentralized nervous system, and the book suggests ways that a decentralized organisation may flourish.

In his 2002 book "The Divine Mystery Fort", Sri Sai Kaleshwar Swami wrote, "An eighth type of supernatural power object is a starfish. Sometimes at the full moon time, when the moon is really dazzling and hitting on the ocean, a starfish jumps out of the water and falls down. If you can get that you can suck unbelievable cosmic energy. You can use it as your own power object. It has to be only on the full moon day when it comes up."

In the <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> animated <a href="television%20program">television series</a> "<a href="SpongeBob%20SquarePants">SpongeBob SquarePants</a>", the <a href="wikt%3Aeponymous">eponymous</a> character's best friend is a dim-witted starfish, <a href="Patrick%20Star">Patrick Star</a>.

Starfish are widespread in the oceans, but are only occasionally used as food. There may be good reason for this: the bodies of numerous species are dominated by bony ossicles, and the body wall of many species contains <a href="saponins">saponins</a>, which have an unpleasant taste, and others contain <a href="tetrodotoxin">tetrodotoxin</a>s which are poisonous. Some species that prey on <a href="bivalve%20molluscs">bivalve molluscs</a> can transmit <a href="paralytic%20shellfish%20poisoning">paralytic shellfish poisoning</a>. Georg Eberhard Rumpf found few starfish being used for food in the <a href="Indonesia">Indonesia</a>n archipelago, other than as bait in fish traps, but on the island of "Huamobel" the people cut them up, squeeze out the "black blood" and cook them with sour <a href="tamarind">tamarind</a> leaves; after resting the pieces for a day or two, they remove the outer skin and cook them in <a href="coconut%20milk">coconut milk</a>. Starfish are sometimes eaten in China, Japan and in Micronesia.

Starfish are in some cases taken from their habitat and sold to tourists as <a href="souvenir">souvenir</a>s, <a href="Ornament%20%28art%29">ornaments</a>, curios or for display in aquariums. In particular, "Oreaster reticulatus", with its easily accessed habitat and conspicuous coloration, is widely collected in the Caribbean. In the early to mid 20th century, this species was common along the coasts of the West Indies, but collection and trade have severely reduced its numbers. In the <a href="Florida">State of Florida</a>, "O. reticulatus" is listed as <a href="endangered">endangered</a> and its collection is illegal. Nevertheless, it is still sold throughout its range and beyond. A similar phenomenon exists in the Indo-Pacific for species such as "<a href="Protoreaster%20nodosus">Protoreaster nodosus</a>".

With its multiple arms, the starfish provides a popular metaphor for <a href="computer%20network">computer network</a>s, companies and <a href="software">software</a> tools. It is also the name of a <a href="Sonar">seabed imaging system</a> and company.

Starfish has repeatedly been chosen as a name in <a href="military%20history">military history</a>. Three ships of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> have borne the name HMS "Starfish": an <a href="HMS%20Starfish%20%281894%29">A-class destroyer launched in 1894</a>; an <a href="HMS%20Starfish%20%281916%29">R-class destroyer launched in 1916</a>; and <a href="HMS%20Starfish%20%2819S%29">an S-class submarine launched in 1933</a> and lost in 1940. In the <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, <a href="Starfish%20site">Starfish site</a>s were large-scale night-time <a href="Military%20deception">decoys</a> created during <a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a> to simulate burning British cities. <a href="Starfish%20Prime">Starfish Prime</a> was a <a href="high-altitude%20nuclear%20explosion">high-altitude nuclear test</a> conducted by the <a href="United%20States">United States</a> on 9 July 1962.

Iguanodon

Iguanodon ( ; meaning "<a href="iguana">iguana</a>-<a href="tooth">tooth</a>") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that existed roughly halfway between the first of the swift <a href="bipedal">bipedal</a> <a href="hypsilophodont">hypsilophodont</a>ids of the <a href="mid-Jurassic">mid-Jurassic</a> and the <a href="duck-billed%20dinosaurs">duck-billed dinosaurs</a> of the late Cretaceous. While many species have been classified in the genus "Iguanodon", dating from the late <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a> to the early <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> Period of <a href="Asia">Asia</a>, Europe, and <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, research in the first decade of the 21st century suggests that there is only one well-substantiated species: "I. bernissartensis", which lived from the late <a href="Barremian">Barremian</a> to the earliest <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> ages (<a href="Early%20Cretaceous">Early Cretaceous</a>) in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, <a href="Spain">Spain</a>, <a href="England">England</a> and possibly elsewhere in <a href="Europe">Europe</a>, between about 126 and 113 million years ago. "Iguanodon" were large, bulky <a href="herbivory">herbivore</a>s. Distinctive features include large thumb spikes, which were possibly used for defense against <a href="predation">predators</a>, combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food.

The genus was named in 1825 by English <a href="geologist">geologist</a> <a href="Gideon%20Mantell">Gideon Mantell</a> but discovered by William Harding Bensted, based on fossil specimens found in England, some of which were subsequently assigned to "<a href="Mantellodon">Mantellodon</a>". "Iguanodon" was the second type of dinosaur formally named based on fossil specimens, after "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>". Together with "Megalosaurus" and "<a href="Hylaeosaurus">Hylaeosaurus</a>", it was one of the three genera originally used to define <a href="Dinosaur">Dinosaur</a>ia. The genus "Iguanodon" belongs to the larger group <a href="Iguanodont">Iguanodont</a>ia, along with the duck-billed hadrosaurs. The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> of this genus continues to be a topic of study as new species are named or long-standing ones reassigned to other genera.

Scientific understanding of "Iguanodon" has evolved over time as new information has been obtained from <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s. The numerous specimens of this genus, including nearly complete skeletons from two well-known <a href="bone%20bed">bone bed</a>s, have allowed researchers to make informed <a href="hypotheses">hypotheses</a> regarding many aspects of the living animal, including feeding, movement, and social behaviour. As one of the first scientifically well-known dinosaurs, "Iguanodon" has occupied a small but notable place in the public's perception of dinosaurs, its artistic representation changing significantly in response to new interpretations of its remains.

The discovery of "Iguanodon" has long been accompanied by a popular <a href="legend">legend</a>. The story goes that <a href="Gideon%20Mantell">Gideon Mantell</a>'s wife, <a href="Mary%20Ann%20Mantell">Mary Ann</a>, discovered the first teeth of an "Iguanodon" in the strata of <a href="Tilgate">Tilgate</a> Forest in <a href="Whitemans%20Green">Whitemans Green</a>, <a href="Cuckfield">Cuckfield</a>, <a href="Sussex">Sussex</a>, <a href="England">England</a>, in 1822 while her husband was visiting a patient. However, there is no evidence that Mantell took his wife with him while seeing patients. Furthermore, he admitted in 1851 that he himself had found the teeth, although he had previously stated in 1827 that Mrs. Mantell had indeed found the first of the teeth later named Iguanodon. Other later authors agree that the story is not certainly false. It is known from his notebooks that Mantell first acquired large fossil bones from the quarry at Whitemans Green in 1820. Because also <a href="theropod">theropod</a> teeth were found, thus belonging to carnivores, he at first interpreted these bones, which he tried to combine into a partial skeleton, as those of a giant <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>. In 1821 Mantell mentioned the find of herbivorous teeth and began to consider the possibility that a large herbivorous reptile was present in the strata. However, in his 1822 publication "Fossils of the South Downs" he as yet did not dare to suggest a connection between the teeth and his very incomplete skeleton, presuming that his finds presented two large forms, one carnivorous ("an animal of the Lizard Tribe of enormous magnitude"), the other herbivorous.

In May 1822 he first presented the herbivorous teeth to the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20London">Royal Society of London</a> but the members, among them <a href="William%20Buckland">William Buckland</a>, dismissed them as <a href="fish">fish</a> teeth or the incisors of a <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a> from a <a href="Tertiary">Tertiary</a> stratum. On 23 June 1823 <a href="Charles%20Lyell">Charles Lyell</a> showed some to <a href="Georges%20Cuvier">Georges Cuvier</a>, during a soiree in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, but the famous French naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros. Though the very next day Cuvier retracted, Lyell reported only the dismissal to Mantell, who became rather diffident about the issue. In 1824 Buckland described "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>" and was on that occasion invited to visit Mantell's collection. Seeing the bones on 6 March he agreed that these were of some giant saurian—though still denying it was a herbivore. Emboldened nevertheless, Mantell again sent some teeth to Cuvier, who answered on 22 June 1824 that he had determined that they were reptilian and quite possibly belonged to a giant herbivore. In a new edition that year of his "Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles" Cuvier admitted his earlier mistake, leading to an immediate acceptance of Mantell, and his new saurian, in scientific circles. Mantell tried to corroborate his theory further by finding a modern-day parallel among extant reptiles. In September 1824 he visited the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Surgeons%20of%20England">Royal College of Surgeons</a> but at first failed to find comparable teeth. However, assistant-curator <a href="Samuel%20Stutchbury">Samuel Stutchbury</a> recognised that they resembled those of an <a href="iguana">iguana</a> he had recently prepared, albeit twenty times longer.

In recognition of the resemblance of the teeth to those of the iguana, Mantell decided to name his new animal "Iguanodon" or "iguana-tooth", from "iguana" and the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> word ὀδών ("odon", "odontos" or "tooth"). Based on <a href="allometry">isometric scaling</a>, he estimated that the creature might have been up to long, more than the length of "Megalosaurus". His initial idea for a name was "Iguana-saurus" ("Iguana lizard"), but his friend <a href="William%20Daniel%20Conybeare">William Daniel Conybeare</a> suggested that that name was more applicable to the iguana itself, so a better name would be "Iguanoides" ("Iguana-like") or "Iguanodon". He neglected to add a <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> to form a proper <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial</a>, but one was supplied in 1829 by Friedrich Holl: "I. anglicum", which was later amended to "I. anglicus".

Mantell sent a letter detailing his discovery to the local Portsmouth Philosophical Society in December 1824, several weeks after settling on a name for the fossil creature. The letter was read to members of the Society at a meeting on 17 December, and a report was published in the "Hampshire Telegraph" the following Monday, 20 December, which announced the name, mis-spelt as "Iguanadon". Mantell formally published his findings on 10 February 1825, when he presented a paper on the remains to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society of London</a>.

A more complete specimen of similar animal was discovered in a quarry in <a href="Maidstone">Maidstone</a>, <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, in 1834 (lower <a href="Lower%20Greensand">Lower Greensand</a> Formation), which Mantell soon acquired. He was led to identify it as an "Iguanodon" based on its distinctive teeth. The Maidstone slab was utilized in the first skeletal reconstructions and artistic renderings of "Iguanodon", but due to its incompleteness, Mantell made some mistakes, the most famous of which was the placement of what he thought was a <a href="horn%20%28anatomy%29">horn</a> on the nose. The discovery of much better specimens in later years revealed that the horn was actually a modified thumb. Still encased in rock, the Maidstone skeleton is currently displayed at the <a href="Natural%20History%20Museum%2C%20London">Natural History Museum</a> in <a href="London">London</a>. The borough of Maidstone commemorated this find by adding an "Iguanodon" as a <a href="supporters%20%28heraldry%29">supporter</a> to their <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> in 1949. This specimen has become linked with the name "I. mantelli", a species named in 1832 by <a href="Christian%20Erich%20Hermann%20von%20Meyer">Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer</a> in place of "I. anglicus", but it actually comes from a different <a href="rock%20formation">formation</a> than the original "I. mantelli"/"I. anglicus" material. The Maidstone specimen, also known as Gideon Mantell's "Mantel-piece", and formally labelled NHMUK 3741 was subsequently excluded from "Iguanodon". It is classified as "cf." "Mantellisaurus" by McDonald (2012); as cf. "Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis" by Norman (2012); and made the holotype of a separate species "<a href="Mantellodon">Mantellodon carpenteri</a>" by Paul (2012).

At the same time, tension began to build between Mantell and <a href="Richard%20Owen">Richard Owen</a>, an ambitious scientist with much better funding and society connections in the turbulent worlds of <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform Act</a>-era British politics and science. Owen, a firm <a href="creationism">creationist</a>, opposed the early versions of <a href="evolution">evolutionary science</a> ("<a href="transmutation%20of%20species">transmutationism</a>") then being debated and used what he would soon coin as dinosaurs as a weapon in this conflict. With the paper describing Dinosauria, he scaled down dinosaurs from lengths of over , determined that they were not simply giant lizards, and put forward that they were advanced and mammal-like, characteristics given to them by <a href="God">God</a>; according to the understanding of the time, they could not have been "transmuted" from reptiles to mammal-like creatures.

In 1849, a few years before his death in 1852, Mantell realised that iguanodonts were not heavy, <a href="Pachydermata">pachyderm</a>-like animals, as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs; however, his passing left him unable to participate in the creation of the <a href="Crystal%20Palace%20Dinosaurs">Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures</a>, and so Owen's vision of the dinosaurs became that seen by the public for decades. With <a href="Benjamin%20Waterhouse%20Hawkins">Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins</a>, he had nearly two dozen lifesize <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a>s of various prehistoric animals built out of <a href="concrete">concrete</a> sculpted over a <a href="steel">steel</a> and <a href="brick">brick</a> framework; two iguanodonts (based on the "Mantellodon" specimen), one standing and one resting on its belly, were included. Before the sculpture of the standing iguanodont was completed, he held a banquet for twenty inside it.

The largest find of "Iguanodon" remains to that date occurred on 28 February 1878 in a coal mine at <a href="Bernissart">Bernissart</a> in <a href="Belgium">Belgium</a>, at a depth of , when two mineworkers, Jules Créteur and Alphonse Blanchard, accidentally hit on a skeleton that they initially took for <a href="petrified%20wood">petrified wood</a>. With the encouragement of <a href="Alphonse%20Briart">Alphonse Briart</a>, supervisor of mines at nearby <a href="Morlanwelz">Morlanwelz</a>, Louis de Pauw on 15 May 1878 started to excavate the skeletons and in 1882 <a href="Louis%20Dollo">Louis Dollo</a> reconstructed them. At least 38 "Iguanodon" individuals were uncovered, most of which were adults. In 1882, the holotype specimen of "I. bernissartensis" became one of the first ever dinosaur skeletons mounted for display. It was put together in a chapel at the <a href="Palace%20of%20Charles%20of%20Lorraine">Palace of Charles of Lorraine</a> using a series of adjustable ropes attached to scaffolding so that a lifelike pose could be achieved during the mounting process. This specimen, along with several others, first opened for public viewing in an inner courtyard of the palace in July 1883. In 1891 they were moved to the <a href="Royal%20Belgian%20Institute%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Royal Museum of Natural History</a>, where they are still on display; nine are displayed as standing mounts, and nineteen more are still in the Museum's basement. The exhibit makes an impressive display in the <a href="Royal%20Belgian%20Institute%20of%20Natural%20Sciences">Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences</a>, in <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>. A replica of one of these is on display at the <a href="Oxford%20University%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Oxford University Museum of Natural History</a> and at the <a href="Sedgwick%20Museum%20of%20Earth%20Sciences">Sedgwick Museum</a> in Cambridge. Most of the remains were referred to a new species, "I. bernissartensis", a larger and much more robust animal than the English remains had yet revealed. One specimen, IRSNB 1551, was at first referred to the nebulous, gracile "I. mantelli", but is currently referred to "<a href="Mantellisaurus">Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis</a>". The skeletons were some of the first complete dinosaur skeletons known. Found with the dinosaur skeletons were the remains of plants, fish, and other reptiles, including the crocodyliform "<a href="Bernissartia">Bernissartia</a>".

The science of conserving fossil remains was in its infancy, and new techniques had to be improvised to deal with what soon became known as "<a href="pyrite">pyrite</a> disease". Crystalline pyrite in the bones was being <a href="oxidation">oxidized</a> to <a href="Iron%28II%29%20sulfate">iron sulphate</a>, accompanied by an increase in volume that caused the remains to crack and crumble. When in the ground, the bones were isolated by anoxic moist clay that prevented this from happening, but when removed into the drier open air, the natural chemical conversion began to occur. To limit this effect, De Pauw immediately, in the mine-gallery, re-covered the dug-out fossils with wet clay, sealing them with paper and plaster reinforced by iron rings, forming in total about six hundred transportable blocks with a combined weight of a hundred and thirty tons. In Brussels after opening the plaster he impregnated the bones with boiling <a href="gelatine">gelatine</a> mixed with <a href="oil%20of%20cloves">oil of cloves</a> as a <a href="preservative">preservative</a>. Removing most of the visible pyrite he then hardened them with <a href="hide%20glue">hide glue</a>, finishing with a final layer of <a href="tin%20foil">tin foil</a>. Damage was repaired with <a href="papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9">papier-mâché</a>. This treatment had the unintended effect of sealing in moisture and extending the period of damage. In 1932 museum director <a href="Victor%20van%20Straelen">Victor van Straelen</a> decided that the specimens had to be completely restored again to safeguard their preservation. From December 1935 to August 1936 the staff at the museum in Brussels treated the problem with a combination of <a href="alcohol">alcohol</a>, <a href="arsenic">arsenic</a>, and 390 kilograms of <a href="shellac">shellac</a>. This combination was intended to simultaneously penetrate the fossils (with alcohol), prevent the development of mold (with arsenic), and harden them (with shellac). The fossils entered a third round of conservation from 2003 until May 2007, when the shellac, hide glue and gelatine were removed and impregnated with <a href="polyvinyl%20acetate">polyvinyl acetate</a> and <a href="cyanoacrylate">cyanoacrylate</a> and <a href="epoxy">epoxy</a> glues. Modern treatments of this problem typically involve either monitoring the humidity of fossil storage, or, for fresh specimens, preparing a special coating of <a href="polyethylene%20glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> that is then heated in a vacuum pump, so that moisture is immediately removed and pore spaces are infiltrated with polyethelene glycol to seal and strengthen the fossil.

Dollo's specimens allowed him to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for "Iguanodon". He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a> and <a href="wallaby">wallaby</a>, and put the spike that had been on the nose firmly on the <a href="thumb">thumb</a>. His reconstruction would prevail for a long period of time, but would later be discounted.

Excavations at the quarry were stopped in 1881, although it was not exhausted of fossils, as recent drilling operations have shown. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, when the town was occupied by <a href="German%20Empire">German forces</a>, preparations were made to reopen the mine for palaeontology, and <a href="Otto%20Jaekel">Otto Jaekel</a> was sent from <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a> to supervise. The <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20I">Allies</a> recaptured Bernissart just as the first fossiliferous layer was about to be uncovered. Further attempts to reopen the mine were hindered by financial problems and were stopped altogether in 1921 when the mine flooded.

Research on "Iguanodon" decreased during the early part of the 20th century as World Wars and the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> enveloped Europe. A new species that would become the subject of much study and taxonomic controversy, "I. atherfieldensis", was named in 1925 by <a href="Reginald%20Hooley">R. W. Hooley</a>, for a specimen collected at Atherfield Point on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>.

"Iguanodon" was not part of the initial work of the <a href="dinosaur%20renaissance">dinosaur renaissance</a> that began with the description of "<a href="Deinonychus">Deinonychus</a>" in 1969, but it was not neglected for long. <a href="David%20B.%20Weishampel">David B. Weishampel</a>'s work on ornithopod feeding mechanisms provided a better understanding of how it fed, and <a href="David%20B.%20Norman">David B. Norman</a>'s work on numerous aspects of the genus has made it one of the best-known dinosaurs. In addition, a further find of numerous "Iguanodon" skeletons, in Nehden, <a href="North%20Rhine-Westphalia">Nordrhein-Westphalen</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, has provided evidence for gregariousness in this genus, as the animals in this <a href="area">areally restricted</a> find appear to have been killed by <a href="flash%20flood">flash flood</a>s. At least 15 individuals, from long, have been found here, although at least some of them are gracile iguanodontians and belong to the related "<a href="Mantellisaurus">Mantellisaurus</a>" or "Dollodon" (described as "I. atherfieldensis", at that time believed to be another species of "Iguanodon").

One major revision to "Iguanodon" brought by the Renaissance would be another re-thinking of how to reconstruct the animal. A major flaw with Dollo's reconstruction was the bend he introduced into the <a href="tail">tail</a>. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the bend in the tail for a more wallaby or <a href="kangaroo">kangaroo</a>-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.

In the 21st century, "Iguanodon" material has been used in the search for dinosaur <a href="biomolecule">biomolecule</a>s. In research by Graham Embery "et al.," "Iguanodon" bones were processed to look for remnant <a href="protein">protein</a>s. In this research, identifiable remains of typical bone proteins, such as <a href="phosphoprotein">phosphoprotein</a>s and <a href="proteoglycan">proteoglycan</a>s, were found in a <a href="rib">rib</a>.

"Iguanodon" were bulky herbivores that could shift from <a href="bipedalism">bipedality</a> to <a href="quadruped">quadruped</a>ality. The only well-supported species, "I. bernissartensis", is estimated to have weighed about 3.08 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s (3.4 <a href="short%20ton">tons</a>) on average, and measured about long as an adult, with some specimens possibly as long as . These animals had large, tall but narrow skulls, with toothless <a href="beak">beak</a>s probably covered with <a href="keratin">keratin</a>, and teeth like those of <a href="iguana">iguana</a>s, but much larger and more closely packed.

The arms of "I. bernissartensis" were long (up to 75% the length of the legs) and robust, with rather inflexible hands built so that the three central fingers could bear weight. The thumbs were conical spikes that stuck out away from the three main digits. In early restorations, the spike was placed on the animal's nose. Later fossils revealed the true nature of the thumb spikes, although their exact function is still debated. They could have been used for defense, or for foraging for food. The <a href="little%20finger">little finger</a> was elongated and dextrous, and could have been used to manipulate objects. The phalangeal formula is 2-3-3-2-4, meaning that the innermost finger (phalange) has two bones, the next has three, etc. The legs were powerful, but not built for running, and each foot had three toes. The backbone and tail were supported and stiffened by <a href="ossification">ossified</a> <a href="tendon">tendon</a>s, which were tendons that turned to bone during life (these rod-like bones are usually omitted from skeletal mounts and drawings).

"Iguanodon" teeth are, as the name suggests, like those of an <a href="iguana">iguana</a>, but larger. Unlike hadrosaurids, which had columns of replacement teeth, "Iguanodon" only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position. The <a href="maxilla">upper jaw</a> held up to 29 teeth per side, with none at the <a href="premaxilla">front of the jaw</a>, and the <a href="mandible">lower jaw</a> 25; the numbers differ because teeth in the lower jaw are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply inset from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, "Iguanodon" had some sort of <a href="cheek">cheek</a>-like structure, muscular or non-muscular, to retain food in the mouth.

"Iguanodon" gives its name to the <a href="Linnaean%20taxonomy">unranked</a> <a href="clade">clade</a> <a href="Iguanodont">Iguanodont</a>ia, a very populous group of ornithopods with many species known from the <a href="Middle%20Jurassic">Middle Jurassic</a> to the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous</a>. Aside from "Iguanodon", the best-known members of the clade include "<a href="Dryosaurus">Dryosaurus</a>", "<a href="Camptosaurus">Camptosaurus</a>", "<a href="Ouranosaurus">Ouranosaurus</a>", and the duck-bills, or <a href="hadrosaurid">hadrosaurs</a>. In older sources, Iguanodontidae was shown as a distinct <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>. This family traditionally has been something of a <a href="wastebasket%20taxon">wastebasket taxon</a>, including ornithopods that were neither hypsilophodontids or hadrosaurids. In practice, animals like "<a href="Callovosaurus">Callovosaurus</a>", "Camptosaurus", "<a href="Craspedodon">Craspedodon</a>", "<a href="Kangnasaurus">Kangnasaurus</a>", "<a href="Mochlodon">Mochlodon</a>", "<a href="Muttaburrasaurus">Muttaburrasaurus</a>", "Ouranosaurus", and "<a href="Probactrosaurus">Probactrosaurus</a>" were usually assigned to this family.

With the advent of <a href="cladistics">cladistic analyses</a>, Iguanodontidae was traditionally construed was shown to be <a href="paraphyly">paraphyletic</a>, and these animals are recognised to fall at different points in relation to hadrosaurs on a <a href="cladistics%23Cladograms">cladogram</a>, instead of in a single distinct clade. Essentially, the modern concept of Iguanodontidae currently includes only "Iguanodon". Groups like Iguanodontoidea are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional iguanodontids are now included in the superfamily <a href="Hadrosauroidea">Hadrosauroidea</a>. "Iguanodon" lies between "Camptosaurus" and "Ouranosaurus" in cladograms, and is probably descended from a camptosaur-like animal. At one point, <a href="Jack%20Horner%20%28paleontologist%29">Jack Horner</a> suggested, based mostly on skull <a href="synapomorphy">features</a>, that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups, with "Iguanodon" on the line to the flat-headed <a href="Saurolophinae">hadrosaurines</a>, and "Ouranosaurus" on the line to the crested <a href="lambeosaurinae">lambeosaurines</a>, but his proposal has been rejected.
The cladogram below follows an analysis by Andrew McDonald, 2012.

Because "Iguanodon" is one of the first dinosaur genera to have been named, numerous species have been assigned to it. While never becoming the wastebasket taxon several other early genera of dinosaurs (such as "Megalosaurus") became, "Iguanodon" has had a complicated history, and its taxonomy continues to undergo revisions. Although Gregory Paul recommended restricting "I. bernissartensis" to the famous sample from Bernissart, ornithopod workers like Norman and McDonald have disagreed with Paul's recommendations, except exercising caution when accepting records of "Iguanodon" from France and Spain as valid.

"I. anglicus" was the original <a href="type%20species">type species</a>, but the <a href="lectotype">lectotype</a> was based on a single tooth and only partial remains of the species have been recovered since. In March 2000, the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Zoological%20Nomenclature">International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature</a> changed the type species to the much better known "I. bernissartensis", with the new holotype being IRSNB 1534. The original "Iguanodon" tooth is held at <a href="Museum%20of%20New%20Zealand%20Te%20Papa%20Tongarewa">Te Papa Tongarewa</a>, the national museum of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, although it is not on display. The fossil arrived in New Zealand following the move of Gideon Mantell's son Walter there; after the elder Mantell's death, his fossils went to Walter.

Only two species assigned to "Iguanodon" are still considered to be valid.




One of the first details noted about "Iguanodon" was that it had the teeth of a <a href="herbivory">herbivorous</a> reptile, although there has not always been consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, scoop-shaped form of the lower jaw <a href="symphysis%20menti">symphysis</a>, which he found best compared to that of the <a href="two-toed%20sloth">two-toed sloth</a> and the <a href="extinction">extinct</a> ground sloth "<a href="Mylodon">Mylodon</a>". He also suggested that "Iguanodon" had a <a href="prehensility">prehensile</a> <a href="tongue">tongue</a> which could be used to gather food, like a <a href="giraffe">giraffe</a>. More complete remains have shown this to be an error; for example, the <a href="hyoid%20bone">hyoid bone</a>s that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non-prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The giraffe-tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw.

The skull was structured in such a way that as it closed, the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw's teeth, grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian <a href="chewing">chewing</a>. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and could eat tough <a href="plant">plant</a> material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal's jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a keratinous material to form a cropping beak for biting off <a href="twig">twig</a>s and <a href="shoot">shoot</a>s. Its food gathering would have been aided by its flexible little finger, which could have been used to manipulate objects, unlike the other fingers.

Exactly what "Iguanodon" ate with its well-developed jaws is not known. The size of the larger species, such as "I. bernissartensis", would have allowed them access to food from ground level to <a href="tree">tree</a> <a href="leaf">foliage</a> at high. A diet of <a href="Equisetum">horsetails</a>, <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, and <a href="pinophyta">conifers</a> was suggested by David Norman, although iguanodonts in general have been tied to the advance of <a href="flowering%20plant">angiosperm</a> plants in the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> due to the dinosaurs' inferred low-browsing habits. Angiosperm growth, according to this <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a>, would have been encouraged by iguanodont feeding because gymnosperms would be removed, allowing more space for the <a href="weed">weed</a>-like early angiosperms to grow. The evidence is not conclusive, though. Whatever its exact diet, due to its size and abundance, "Iguanodon" is regarded as a dominant medium to large herbivore for its <a href="ecosystem">ecological communities</a>. In England, this included the small predator "<a href="Aristosuchus">Aristosuchus</a>", larger predators "<a href="Eotyrannus">Eotyrannus</a>", "<a href="Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a>", and "<a href="Neovenator">Neovenator</a>", low-feeding herbivores "Hypsilophodon" and "<a href="Valdosaurus">Valdosaurus</a>", fellow "iguanodontid" "Mantellisaurus", the <a href="armour%20%28zoology%29">armoured</a> herbivore "<a href="Polacanthus">Polacanthus</a>", and <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a>s like "<a href="Pelorosaurus">Pelorosaurus</a>".

Early fossil remains were fragmentary, which led to much speculation on the posture and nature of "Iguanodon". "Iguanodon" was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn-nosed beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were much smaller than the hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a stumpy creature with four pillar-like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod.

During his re-examination of "Iguanodon", David Norman was able to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the tripodal pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. Putting the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and <a href="pectoral%20girdle">pectoral girdle</a> more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing <a href="hoof">hoof</a>-like <a href="Phalanx%20bone">phalanges</a>, and able to <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20motion">hyperextend</a>. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The <a href="wrist">wrist</a> is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours.

Furthermore, it appears that "Iguanodon" became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier; <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">juvenile</a> "I. bernissartensis" have shorter arms than adults (60% of hindlimb length versus 70% for adults). When walking as a quadruped, the animal's hands would have been held so that the <a href="Hand">palms</a> faced each other, as shown by iguanodontian trackways and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three-toed <a href="Pes%20%28anatomy%29">pes</a> ("foot") of "Iguanodon" was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would have been used in a <a href="digitigrade">digitigrade</a> fashion (walking on the fingers and toes). The maximum speed of "Iguanodon" has been estimated at , which would have been as a biped; it would not have been able to <a href="Horse%20gallop">gallop</a> as a quadruped.

Large three-toed footprints are known in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly <a href="Wealden">Wealden</a> beds on the Isle of Wight, and these <a href="trace%20fossil">trace fossil</a>s were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. Tagert went so far as to assign them to an <a href="ichnotaxon">ichnogenus</a> he named "Iguanodon", and <a href="Samuel%20Beckles">Samuel Beckles</a> noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks, but might have come from dinosaurs. The identity of the trackmakers was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the hind leg of a young "Iguanodon", with distinctly three-toed feet, showing that such dinosaurs could have made the tracks. Despite the lack of direct evidence, these tracks are often attributed to "Iguanodon". A trackway in England shows what may be an "Iguanodon" moving on all fours, but the foot prints are poor, making a direct connection difficult. Tracks assigned to the ichnogenus "Iguanodon" are known from locations including places in Europe where the body fossil "Iguanodon" is known, to <a href="Spitsbergen">Spitsbergen</a>, <a href="Svalbard">Svalbard</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a>.

The thumb spike is one of the best-known features of "Iguanodon". Although it was originally placed on the animal's nose by Mantell, the complete Bernissart specimens allowed Dollo to place it correctly on the hand, as a modified thumb. (This would not be the last time a dinosaur's modified thumb claw would be misinterpreted; "<a href="Noasaurus">Noasaurus</a>", "Baryonyx", and "<a href="Megaraptor">Megaraptor</a>" are examples since the 1980s where an enlarged thumb claw was first put on the foot, as in <a href="dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurids</a>.)

This thumb is typically interpreted as a close-quarter <a href="stiletto">stiletto</a>-like weapon against predators, although it could also have been used to break into <a href="seed">seed</a>s and <a href="fruit">fruit</a>s, or against other "Iguanodon". One author has suggested that the spike was attached to a <a href="venom">venom</a> gland, but this has not been accepted, as the spike was not hollow, nor were there any grooves on the spike for conducting venom.

Although sometimes interpreted as the result of a single catastrophe, the Bernissart finds instead are now interpreted as recording multiple events. According to this interpretation, at least three occasions of mortality are recorded, and though numerous individuals would have died in a geologically short time span (?10–100 years), this does not necessarily mean these "Iguanodon" were <a href="herd">herd</a>ing animals.

An argument against herding is that juvenile remains are very uncommon at this site, unlike modern cases with herd mortality. They more likely were the periodic victims of flash floods whose carcasses accumulated in a lake or marshy setting. The Nehden find, however, with its greater span of individual ages, more even mix of "Dollodon" or "Mantellisaurus" to "Iguanodon bernissartensis", and confined geographic nature, may record mortality of herding animals migrating through rivers.

There is no evidence that "Iguanodon" was <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a> (with one <a href="sex">sex</a> appreciably different from the other). At one time, it was suggested that the Bernissart "I." "mantelli", or "I. atherfieldensis" ("Dollodon" and "Mantellisaurus", respectively) represented a sex, possibly <a href="female">female</a>, of the larger and more robust, possibly <a href="male">male</a>, "I. bernissartensis". However, this is not supported today. A 2017 analysis showed that "I. bernissartensis" does exhibit a large level of individual variation in both its limbs (<a href="scapula">scapula</a>, <a href="humerus">humerus</a>, thumb claw, <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a>, <a href="ischium">ischium</a>, <a href="femur">femur</a>, <a href="tibia">tibia</a>) and spinal column (<a href="axis%20%28anatomy%29">axis</a>, <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a>, tail vertebrae). Additionally, this analysis found that individuals of "I. bernissartensis" generally seemed to fall into two categories based on whether their tail vertebrae bore a furrow on the bottom, and whether their thumb claws were large or small.

Evidence of a <a href="fracture">fracture</a>d hip bone was found in a specimen of "Iguanodon", which had an injury to its ischium. Two other individuals were observed with signs of <a href="osteoarthritis">osteoarthritis</a> as evidenced by bone overgrowths in their anklebones which are called <a href="osteophyte">osteophyte</a>s.

Since its description in 1825, "Iguanodon" has been a feature of worldwide <a href="popular%20culture">popular culture</a>. Two lifesize reconstructions of "Mantellodon" (considered "Iguanodon" at the time) built at the <a href="The%20Crystal%20Palace%20Dinosaurs">Crystal Palace</a> in London in 1852 greatly contributed to the popularity of the genus. Their thumb spikes were mistaken for horns, and they were depicted as elephant-like quadrupeds, yet this was the first time an attempt was made at constructing full-size dinosaur models. In 1910 <a href="Heinrich%20Harder">Heinrich Harder</a> portrayed a group of "Iguanodon" in the classic German collecting cards about extinct and prehistoric animals "Tiere der Urwelt".

Several <a href="Film">motion pictures</a> have featured "Iguanodon". In the 2000 <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">Disney</a> film "<a href="Dinosaur%20%28film%29">Dinosaur</a>", an "Iguanodon" named Aladar served as the protagonist with three other iguanodonts as other main characters; a loosely related <a href="Dinosaur%20%28Disney%27s%20Animal%20Kingdom%29">ride of the same name</a> at <a href="Disney%27s%20Animal%20Kingdom">Disney's Animal Kingdom</a> is based around bringing an "Iguanodon" back to the present. "Iguanodon" is one of the three dinosaur genera that inspired <a href="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>; the other two were "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>". "Iguanodon" has also made appearances in some of the many <a href="The%20Land%20Before%20Time%20%28franchise%29">"The Land Before Time"</a> films, as well as episodes of the <a href="The%20Land%20Before%20Time%20%28TV%20series%29">television series</a>.

Aside from appearances in movies, "Iguanodon" has also been featured on the <a href="television">television</a> documentary miniseries "<a href="Walking%20with%20Dinosaurs">Walking with Dinosaurs</a>" (1999) produced by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, and played a starring role in <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s book, "<a href="The%20Lost%20World%20%28Conan%20Doyle%20novel%29">The Lost World</a>" as well as featuring in an episode of the <a href="Discovery%20Channel">Discovery Channel</a> documentary, "<a href="Dinosaur%20Planet%20%28TV%20series%29">Dinosaur Planet</a>" (incorrectly portrayed being able to run on all fours and living in the Late Cretaceous). It also was present in <a href="Bob%20Bakker">Bob Bakker</a>'s "<a href="Raptor%20Red">Raptor Red</a>" (1995), as a "<a href="Utahraptor">Utahraptor</a>" prey item. A <a href="asteroid%20belt">main belt</a> <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>, , has been named <a href="9941%20Iguanodon">9941 Iguanodon</a> in honour of the genus.

Because it is both one of the first dinosaurs described and one of the best-known dinosaurs, "Iguanodon" has been well-placed as a <a href="barometer">barometer</a> of changing public and scientific perceptions on dinosaurs. Its reconstructions have gone through three stages: the <a href="elephant">elephant</a>ine quadrupedal horn-snouted reptile satisfied the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorians</a>, then a bipedal but still fundamentally reptilian animal using its tail to prop itself up dominated the early 20th century, but was slowly overturned during the 1960s by its current, more agile and dynamic representation, able to shift from two legs to all fours.

The trophy has a silver <a href="chalice">chalice</a> attached to a large base on which the names of all winning teams, players and executives are engraved. The Grey Cup has been broken on several occasions, stolen twice and held for ransom. It survived a 1947 fire that destroyed numerous artifacts housed in the same building.

The Grey Cup was first won by the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto%20Varsity%20Blues">University of Toronto Varsity Blues</a>. Play was suspended from 1916 to 1918 due to the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> and in 1919 due to a rules dispute. The game has typically been contested in an east versus west format since the 1920s. The game was always played on a Saturdays until 1968, but since 1969 (except for 1970) has always been on a Sunday. Held in late November (in some years, but not since 1972, the game was played in early December), and mostly in outdoor stadiums, the Grey Cup has been played in inclement weather at times, including the 1950 "<a href="38th%20Grey%20Cup">Mud Bowl</a>", in which a player reportedly came close to drowning in a puddle, then the 1962 "<a href="50th%20Grey%20Cup">Fog Bowl</a>", when the final minutes of the game had to be postponed to the following day due to a heavy fog, and the 1977 "<a href="65th%20Grey%20Cup">Ice Bowl</a>", contested on the frozen-over artificial turf at <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>'s <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Montreal%29">Olympic Stadium</a>. Most recently, in the <a href="105th%20Grey%20Cup">2017 game</a> snow fell, at times heavily, throughout the game.

The <a href="Edmonton%20Eskimos">Edmonton Eskimos</a> formed the Grey Cup's longest <a href="dynasty%20%28sports%29">dynasty</a>, winning five consecutive championships from 1978 to 1982. Competition for the trophy has been exclusively between Canadian teams, except for a three-year period from 1993 to 1995, when an expansion of the CFL south into the United States resulted in the <a href="Baltimore%20Stallions">Baltimore Stallions</a> winning the 1995 championship and taking the Grey Cup south of the border for the only time in its history.

While the <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> was created in 1893 as the Canadian amateur hockey championship, professional teams were openly competing for the trophy by 1907. <a href="Albert%20Grey%2C%204th%20Earl%20Grey">Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey</a>, the <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General of Canada</a>, planned to donate a new trophy to serve as the senior amateur championship; however, <a href="H.%20Montagu%20Allan">Sir Montague Allan</a> donated the <a href="Allan%20Cup">Allan Cup</a> before he could finalize his plans. Grey instead offered an award to the <a href="Dominion%20of%20Canada">Dominion</a> amateur rugby football championship beginning in 1909. He initially failed to follow through on his offer; the trophy was not ordered until two weeks prior to the first championship game.

The <a href="1st%20Grey%20Cup">first Grey Cup</a> game was held on December 4, 1909, between two Toronto clubs: the <a href="Toronto%20Varsity%20Blues">University of Toronto Varsity Blues</a> defeated the <a href="Toronto%20Parkdale">Parkdale Canoe Club</a> 26–6 before 3,800 fans. The trophy was not ready for presentation following the game, and the Varsity Blues did not receive it until March 1910. They retained the trophy in the following two years, defeating the <a href="Hamilton%20Tigers%20%28football%29">Hamilton Tigers</a> in <a href="2nd%20Grey%20Cup">1910</a> and the <a href="Toronto%20Argonauts">Toronto Argonauts</a> in <a href="3rd%20Grey%20Cup">1911</a>. The University of Toronto failed to reach the <a href="4th%20Grey%20Cup">1912 Grey Cup</a>, which was won by the <a href="Hamilton%20Alerts">Hamilton Alerts</a> over the Argonauts. The Varsity Blues refused to hand over the trophy on the belief they could keep it until they were defeated in a title game. They kept the trophy until <a href="6th%20Grey%20Cup">1914</a> when they were defeated by the Argonauts, who made the trophy available to subsequent champions.

Canada's participation in the <a href="World%20War%20I">First World War</a> resulted in the cancellation of the championship from 1916 to 1918, during which time the Cup was forgotten. "<a href="Montreal%20Gazette">Montreal Gazette</a>" writer Bob Dunn claimed that the trophy was later rediscovered as "one of the family heirlooms" of an employee of the Toronto trust company where it had been sent for storage. The Grey Cup game was also cancelled in 1919 due to a lack of interest from the <a href="Interprovincial%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Interprovincial Rugby Football Union</a> (IRFU) and the intercollegiate unions, along with rules conflicts between the <a href="Football%20Canada">Canadian Rugby Union</a> (CRU) and the western union. Competition finally resumed in 1920 with the <a href="8th%20Grey%20Cup">8th Grey Cup</a> game, won 16–3 by the Varsity Blues over the Argonauts. It was the University of Toronto's fourth, and final, championship.

Competition for the Grey Cup was limited to member unions of the CRU, the champions of which petitioned the league body for the right to challenge for the national championship. The <a href="West%20Division%20%28CFL%29%23Pre-1936">Western Canada Rugby Football Union</a> (WCRFU) was formed in 1911, but the CRU did not come to a participation agreement with it until 1921, allowing the <a href="Edmonton%20Rugby%20Foot-ball%20Club">Edmonton Eskimos</a> (no lineage to the <a href="Edmonton%20Eskimos">similarly-named team</a> operating since 1949) of the WCRFU to challenge. Facing the Argonauts in the <a href="9th%20Grey%20Cup">9th Grey Cup</a>, the Eskimos became the first western team – and the first from outside Toronto or Hamilton – to compete for the trophy. The Argonauts entered the game with an undefeated record, having outscored their opposition 226 to 55 during the season. They dominated Edmonton, recording the first <a href="shutout">shutout</a> in Grey Cup history with a 23–0 victory. Multi-sport star <a href="Lionel%20Conacher">Lionel Conacher</a> was Toronto's top player, scoring 15 of his team's points before leaving the game after the third quarter to join his hockey team for their game. The same Edmonton team (renamed as Edmonton Elks) challenged for the trophy again in <a href="10th%20Grey%20Cup">1922</a>, but lost 13–1 to their eastern opposition, the <a href="Queen%27s%20Golden%20Gaels">Queen's University Golden Gaels</a>. For Queen's, it was the first of three consecutive titles.

Western teams continued to vie for the trophy, but were consistently outclassed for several years. Eastern teams and critics felt the quality of the western game was inferior to theirs, and when Queen's defeated the <a href="Regina%20Rugby%20Club">Regina Rugby Club</a> 54–0 in the <a href="11th%20Grey%20Cup">1923 final</a>, the critics felt they deliberately ran up the score to prove that point. Regina was western Canada's dominant team, appearing in the Grey Cup on six occasions between 1928 and 1934, but lost to their eastern opponents each time. Regina helped revolutionize Canadian football in <a href="17th%20Grey%20Cup">1929</a>, however, as they attempted the first <a href="forward%20pass">forward pass</a> in Grey Cup history. The Winnipeg 'Pegs (now the <a href="Winnipeg%20Blue%20Bombers">Blue Bombers</a>) became the first western Grey Cup champion in <a href="23rd%20Grey%20Cup">1935</a> when they defeated the Hamilton Tigers, 18–12. While the Grey Cup was slow to achieve national popularity, the advent of the east versus west format helped make the game the nation's largest sporting event.

As the quality of senior football improved, university teams realized they were no longer able to compete on equal footing and withdrew from competition for the Grey Cup in 1933. By 1938, only three unions continued to compete under the banner of the CRU: the IRFU and the <a href="Ontario%20Rugby%20Football%20Union">Ontario Rugby Football Union</a> (ORFU) in the east, and the <a href="Western%20Interprovincial%20Football%20Union">Western Interprovincial Football Union</a> (WIFU) in the west. The CRU experimented with a two-game, total points series to determine the champion in <a href="28th%20Grey%20Cup">1940</a>. The <a href="Ottawa%20Rough%20Riders">Ottawa Rough Riders</a> won both games against Toronto's <a href="Toronto%20Balmy%20Beach%20Beachers">Balmy Beach</a>, 8–2 and 12–5. The Grey Cup returned to its one-game format the following year.

Both the IRFU and WIFU suspended operations in 1942 due to the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>. Grey Cup play was expected to be suspended along with the unions; however, the military felt the game and sport would serve as a morale booster and organized teams at bases across the country. For the following three years, Grey Cup competition was limited to military teams, and in the <a href="30th%20Grey%20Cup">1942 Grey Cup</a>, the <a href="Toronto%20RCAF%20Hurricanes">Toronto RCAF Hurricanes</a> defeated the <a href="Winnipeg%20RCAF%20Bombers">Winnipeg RCAF Bombers</a> 8–5 to become the first non-civilian team to win the national championship. Two years later, the <a href="St.%20Hyacinthe%E2%80%93Donnacona%20Navy">St. Hyacinthe–Donnacona Navy</a> defeated the <a href="Hamilton%20Flying%20Wildcats">Hamilton Flying Wildcats</a>, 7–6; no Grey Cup championship since then has featured two eastern teams. The conclusion of the war led to the reformation of civilian teams; the IRFU resumed play in 1945, and the WIFU the following year.

A push by the sport's organizers to adopt an increasingly professional attitude dominated the post-war period: poor field conditions, previously accepted as part of the game, resulted in numerous complaints against the CRU following the <a href="37th%20Grey%20Cup">1949</a> and <a href="38th%20Grey%20Cup">1950</a> Grey Cups. Field conditions at Toronto's <a href="Varsity%20Stadium">Varsity Stadium</a> were so poor in 1950 that the game has since gained infamy as the "Mud Bowl". Deep ruts in the field and poor weather in the days leading up to the game resulted in a sloppy field covered in large puddles of water. The game also gained notoriety for the near drowning of Winnipeg's <a href="Buddy%20Tinsley">Buddy Tinsley</a>, who was found face down in a large puddle, apparently unconscious. Tinsley later said that he had not lost consciousness, but his leg had gone numb from a hard hit to a preexisting injury. Toronto won the game 13–0, the last time a team has been shut out in a Grey Cup game.
The ORFU, the last purely amateur union competing for the Grey Cup, withdrew from Cup competition in 1954. Although the IRFU and WIFU champions had faced each other in the Grey Cup final since 1945, the ORFU's withdrawal left the IRFU and WIFU unchallenged as Canada's top football unions. The Eskimos faced the <a href="Montreal%20Alouettes">Montreal Alouettes</a> in three consecutive Grey Cups in the mid-1950s, winning all three. Edmonton's first title in 1954 ended in bizarre fashion after <a href="Jackie%20Parker">Jackie Parker</a> scored a touchdown (converted by Bob Dean) from a fumble recovery late in the game that gave Edmonton a 26-25 lead. At the time in Canadian football, touchdowns were only worth 5 points. Parker's 90-yard fumble return was the longest in league history until Toronto's Cassius Vaughn returned a Calgary fumble 109 yards in the 2017 Grey Cup game which was won by Toronto. The 1954 game also marked the end of the amateur era as the top teams completed their transition to professional organizations.

As the 1950s wore on, the IRFU and WIFU distanced themselves from the CRU, forming the Canadian Football Council in 1956 to administer the game at the professional level. Two years later, on January 18, 1958, the CFC withdrew from the CRU and reorganized as the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> (CFL). The new league formally assumed control of the Grey Cup from the CRU.

In the CFL's initial seasons, the <a href="Hamilton%20Tiger-Cats">Hamilton Tiger-Cats</a> were the league's dominant team, appearing in nine Grey Cups and winning four titles between 1957 and 1967. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers opposed Hamilton on six of those occasions, winning four titles. The two teams were involved in a series of bizarre incidents, the first occurring during the <a href="45th%20Grey%20Cup">1957 Grey Cup</a>. Toronto-based lawyer and fan David Humphrey had talked his way past stadium security and had been allowed to watch the game from the sidelines. Ten minutes into the fourth quarter, Hamilton's <a href="Ray%20Bawel">Ray Bawel</a> intercepted a pass and it appeared he would return the ball for a touchdown when Humphrey stuck his leg out and tripped Bawel as he ran up the sideline. Unsure how to handle the situation as there was no rule designed to cover it, referee <a href="Paul%20Dojack">Paul Dojack</a> invented one on the spot. He placed the ball half the distance to the Winnipeg goal line from the point Bawel was tripped. The incident did not affect the final score, as Hamilton won 32–7. The league also created a new rule during the <a href="49th%20Grey%20Cup">1961 Grey Cup</a> as it was the first in history to end regulation time in a tie: CFL Commissioner Sid Halter determined the teams would play an <a href="overtime%20%28sports%29">overtime</a> period that consisted of two five-minute halves. That rule remained the CFL standard into the 2000s. Winnipeg scored the lone touchdown in overtime to defeat Hamilton 21–14.

Winnipeg and Hamilton met again in 1962, the <a href="50th%20Grey%20Cup">50th Grey Cup</a>, immortalized as the "Fog Bowl". The game was held at Toronto's <a href="Exhibition%20Stadium">Exhibition Stadium</a>, and began on Saturday, December 1, 1962. The fog rolled in early in the second quarter and became increasingly dense as the game progressed. By the fourth quarter, the players were unable to see the sideline markers and the fans unable to see the play. The players were unable to see the ball in the air – kick returners listened for the sound of the ball hitting the ground – and the action was largely invisible to the television audience. With nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds remaining in the game and Winnipeg holding onto a 28–27 lead, officials made the unprecedented decision to suspend play until the next day. Though the league feared that continuing fog on the morning of December 2 would force the complete abandonment of the game, it lifted in time for the contest to resume. Around 15,000 of the original 32,655 spectators watched Winnipeg win the Grey Cup without further scoring by either team. It was the first title game completed on a Sunday; the Grey Cup moved from its traditional Saturday start to Sunday in 1969; however, the game was played on a Saturday for the last time in 1970.

The Montreal Alouettes' <a href="58th%20Grey%20Cup">1970 Grey Cup</a> championship, an upset win over the favoured <a href="Calgary%20Stampeders">Calgary Stampeders</a>, served as a morale booster for the city of Montreal, which was reeling in the aftermath of the <a href="October%20Crisis">October Crisis</a>. The 1970s belonged to the Edmonton Eskimos, however, as they ended the decade as one of the most dominant teams in CFL history, reaching the Grey Cup nine times between 1973 and 1982. The team competed in three consecutive finals early in the decade, losing to Ottawa in <a href="61st%20Grey%20Cup">1973</a> and Montreal in <a href="62nd%20Grey%20Cup">1974</a>, before winning the franchise's fourth championship in <a href="63rd%20Grey%20Cup">1975</a>. The 1975 championship was held in Calgary and was the first Grey Cup played on the <a href="Canadian%20Prairies">Canadian Prairies</a>. A young woman infamously <a href="Streaking">streaked</a> across the field during the national anthem despite frigid temperatures well below freezing. The only time the Eskimos did not reach the Grey Cup final during this span was in <a href="64th%20Grey%20Cup">1976</a>, when the Saskatchewan Roughriders met the Ottawa Rough Riders, in what would be the final all-"Roughriders" Grey Cup game. Both teams would fight a see-saw battle, which was decided in the dying seconds of the game when Ottawa quarterback <a href="Tom%20Clements">Tom Clements</a> threw to <a href="Tony%20Gabriel">Tony Gabriel</a>, which stood out as the winning touchdown, 23-20. The <a href="65th%20Grey%20Cup">1977 Grey Cup</a> was the first held at <a href="Olympic%20Stadium">Olympic Stadium</a> in Montreal, contested by the home town Alouettes and the Eskimos in front of a record crowd of 68,318. The game became known as the "Ice Bowl", as low temperatures froze snow on the field that had been melted by groundskeepers with salt, making the <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a> extremely slippery. The Alouettes adapted to the field conditions by affixing staples to the soles of their shoes, improving their traction, and won the game by a 41–6 score.

Upset at losing the 1977 game under poor weather conditions, the Eskimos hoped for a rematch with Montreal in <a href="66th%20Grey%20Cup">1978</a>. Both teams reached the final game, which Edmonton won 20–13. It was the first of five consecutive championships, a streak that remains unmatched in the history of the Grey Cup. The Eskimos' <a href="Dynasty%20%28sports%29">dynasty</a> dominated the league, losing a total of only six games during the three seasons from 1979 to 1981. The <a href="69th%20Grey%20Cup">1981 Grey Cup</a> was expected to be yet another easy win for Edmonton, who posted a 14–1–1 record during the season and were considered overwhelming favourites against the 5–11 Ottawa Rough Riders. The first half did not go as Edmonton hoped, though, as Ottawa emerged with a 20–1 lead. Quarterback <a href="Warren%20Moon">Warren Moon</a> led the Eskimos back in the second half, and with the game tied at 23, <a href="Dave%20Cutler%20%28Canadian%20football%29">Dave Cutler</a> kicked the game-winning field goal with just three seconds remaining.

Edmonton's championship run came to an end in <a href="71st%20Grey%20Cup">1983</a> when they lost in the West Semi-Final game; the Argonauts defeated the <a href="BC%20Lions">BC Lions</a> to win the championship that year, ending the team's 31-year Grey Cup title drought. Despite Toronto's win, the CFL felt that the overall quality of play in the East Division had deteriorated compared to that of the West. In 1986, it altered the playoff format to allow the first non-playoff team in one division to take the last playoff spot, but stay in their division if they had a better record. The consequences of the new rules were felt immediately, as the league gave a playoff spot to the Stampeders having a better record than the Alouettes, and decided the East Division Final would be a 2-game-total-point Final between the Toronto Argonauts and the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, who finished first and second, respectively. The crossover, if necessary, would begin in 1987. In financial difficulty, the loss of the playoff spot was disastrous for Montreal, which ceased operations one year later. The crossover rule was eliminated and not revisited until a decade later due to Montreal's folding. Reduced to eight teams, the CFL shifted Winnipeg to the East Division, making the <a href="76th%20Grey%20Cup">1988 Grey Cup</a> between the Blue Bombers and Lions the first championship game between two <a href="Western%20Canada">western Canadian</a> teams.

The <a href="77th%20Grey%20Cup">1989 Grey Cup</a> is considered one of the finest games in Canadian football history: The Saskatchewan Roughriders defeated the Hamilton Tiger-Cats 43–40 in the highest scoring Grey Cup game of all-time. Saskatchewan kicker <a href="Dave%20Ridgway">Dave Ridgway</a>'s last-second field goal won the game and made him a legend in the prairie province.

Declining interest in the CFL during the 1990s left the league in financial difficulty. Hoping to restore the league's credibility with fans, a new ownership group featuring <a href="Bruce%20McNall">Bruce McNall</a>, hockey player <a href="Wayne%20Gretzky">Wayne Gretzky</a> and actor <a href="John%20Candy">John Candy</a> purchased the Toronto Argonauts in 1991 and lured American college standout <a href="Raghib%20Ismail">Rocket Ismail</a> to Canada with a four-year, $26.2 million contract which made him the highest paid player in football history at that time. The Argonauts reached the <a href="79th%20Grey%20Cup">1991 Grey Cup</a> and defeated the Calgary Stampeders 36–21. With 261 all-purpose yards on the game, including a then-Grey Cup record 87-yard <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a> return for a touchdown, Ismail was named <a href="Grey%20Cup%20Most%20Valuable%20Player">Grey Cup Most Valuable Player</a>.

The potential for the league to enter the American market was discussed in 1987 when operators of the defunct <a href="United%20States%20Football%20League">United States Football League</a> approached the CFL about merging the two leagues. The league showed little interest at the time, but as it continued its decline, the CFL reevaluated its position. In 1992, the CFL announced that it would <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League%20in%20the%20United%20States">expand into the United States</a>. The <a href="Sacramento%20Gold%20Miners">Sacramento Gold Miners</a> joined the league and became the first American team eligible to win the Grey Cup. The league added three additional American teams in 1994 and two in 1995 (with one team folding), but the initiative failed in most markets, and by 1996, the CFL again operated exclusively within Canada.

The lone successful American market was in Baltimore, home to the <a href="Baltimore%20Stallions">Stallions</a>. The team averaged over 35,000 fans per game in its inaugural season, nearly double that of Toronto or Hamilton. They matched that success on the field by becoming the first American team to play in the Grey Cup. The BC Lions kept the Grey Cup in Canada with a 26–23 victory in the <a href="82nd%20Grey%20Cup">1994 final</a>. Baltimore returned to the title game <a href="83rd%20Grey%20Cup">one year later</a> and became the only American team to win the trophy by defeating the Calgary Stampeders, 37–20. The <a href="Cleveland%20Browns%20relocation%20controversy">relocation</a> of the <a href="National%20Football%20League">National Football League</a>'s <a href="Cleveland%20Browns">Cleveland Browns</a> to Baltimore in 1996 caused the Stallions to seek a new city to avoid direct competition with an NFL team. The team moved to Montreal, forming the current incarnation of the Alouettes franchise and ending the CFL's excursion into the United States.

The league approached the <a href="84th%20Grey%20Cup">1996 Grey Cup</a> in dire financial straits: the American expansion had been a failure, the 120-year-old Ottawa Rough Riders franchise ceased operations at the conclusion of the regular season, and out of the eight remaining teams, seven had lost money and two required direct assistance from the league to stay afloat. The Edmonton Eskimos could not afford to bring their players' families to the championship game. The "<a href="Toronto%20Star">Toronto Star</a>" echoed fears spoken by fans and media across the country when it asked if the 1996 championship, won by Toronto over Edmonton, would be the final Grey Cup.

While the league struggled, the Grey Cup game itself retained its popularity and remained a national institution. The strength of the contest allowed the league to endure its challenges. The CFL survived into 1997 and was buoyed by an interest-free loan from the NFL, a new television deal with <a href="The%20Sports%20Network">The Sports Network</a> which, along with the launch of its popular "Friday Night Football" program, has been credited with saving the league. <a href="85th%20Grey%20Cup">That year's</a> Grey Cup, held in Edmonton and won by Toronto, drew nearly 22,000 more fans than the previous year. The CFL restored its reputation over time, enjoying new popularity into the 2000s such that it no longer had to rely on an exciting Grey Cup final to achieve stability for the next season.

In <a href="88th%20Grey%20Cup">2000</a>, the 8–10 BC Lions made history when they defeated the Montreal Alouettes, 28–26, becoming the first team in history to win the Grey Cup with a losing record in the regular season. In the game, 25-year veteran <a href="Lui%20Passaglia">Lui Passaglia</a> ended the longest career in CFL history by kicking what was ultimately the game-winning field goal. The Calgary Stampeders matched the Lions' feat <a href="89th%20Grey%20Cup">the next year</a> by becoming the second 8–10 team to win the Grey Cup, defeating the Winnipeg Blue Bombers by a 27–19 score in front of 65,255 fans, the second largest crowd in the game's history.

The <a href="93rd%20Grey%20Cup">2005 Grey Cup</a> was the second overtime game in Grey Cup history, and the first one using the league's shootout overtime format (introduced in 2000). Both the Eskimos and Alouettes scored touchdowns on their first possessions, while Edmonton scored a field goal in its second and held Montreal scoreless to win the game by a 38–35 score. The game was played in the middle of a stretch of eight Grey Cup appearances by the Alouettes between 2000 and 2010. In <a href="97th%20Grey%20Cup">2009</a>, they defeated the Roughriders in dramatic fashion: placekicker <a href="Damon%20Duval">Damon Duval</a> missed a last-second field goal attempt that appeared to give Saskatchewan the victory. However, the Riders were penalized for having <a href="too%20many%20men">too many men</a> on the field, allowing Duval a second opportunity. His second attempt was successful, giving Montreal a 28–27 victory.

The <a href="100th%20Grey%20Cup">100th Grey Cup</a> game was played on November 25, 2012 at the <a href="Rogers%20Centre">Rogers Centre</a> in Toronto between the Toronto Argonauts and the Calgary Stampeders. The Toronto Argonauts won the Grey Cup with a score of 35–22.

As per a new title sponsorship deal with <a href="Shaw%20Communications">Shaw Communications</a> announced in May 2015, the event will henceforth be known as the Grey Cup presented by Shaw.

The <a href="104th%20Grey%20Cup">104th Grey Cup</a> game was played at <a href="BMO%20Field">BMO Field</a> in Toronto, which became the new home of the Argonauts beginning in the 2016 season. After being promised the <a href="102nd%20Grey%20Cup">102nd Grey Cup</a> game as an incentive to rejoin the league, the <a href="105th%20Grey%20Cup">105th Grey Cup</a> game was played at <a href="TD%20Place%20Stadium">TD Place Stadium</a> in Ottawa in 2017, as part of <a href="150th%20anniversary%20of%20Canada">celebrations</a> to mark 150 years of <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Confederation</a>. The <a href="55th%20Grey%20Cup">55th Grey Cup</a>, played at the end of the <a href="1967%20CFL%20season">1967 CFL season</a>, was also held in Ottawa as part of <a href="Canadian%20Centennial">celebrations</a> to mark 100 years of Confederation.

The trophy was commissioned in 1909 at a cost of $48. The <a href="chalice">chalice</a> is made of <a href="sterling%20silver">sterling silver</a> and stands tall. Its original base was made of wood, with silver shields listing each championship year and winning team's name, beginning with the University of Toronto Varsity Blues. The players of the 1915 championship Hamilton team, apparently as revenge for Toronto's refusal to relinquish the trophy in 1912 and 1913, added a shield for the 1908 Tigers team to give the appearance that their organization had won the first Grey Cup.

A 1947 fire destroyed the clubhouse of the Toronto <a href="Argonaut%20Rowing%20Club">Argonaut Rowing Club</a> and damaged the Grey Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts in the clubhouse melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail attached to a surviving wall when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's <a href="Blake%20Dermott">Blake Dermott</a> head-butted it; in 2006, when the chalice broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 when one of the handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when the chalice broke away from its base again as the Calgary Stampeders celebrated their win. The CFL commissioned a replica of the trophy in 2008.

The Grey Cup has been stolen on two occasions: it disappeared for three days in 1967 when it was taken from the Hamilton Tiger-Cats as a prank, and in December 1969 it was stolen from the offices of the Ottawa Rough Riders at <a href="Lansdowne%20Park">Lansdowne Park</a>. The thieves attempted to ransom the trophy, but the CFL refused to pay and made plans to replace it with a duplicate. An anonymous phone call led to the trophy's recovery two months later in a locker at Toronto's <a href="Fairmont%20Royal%20York">Royal York Hotel</a>. The thieves were never found.
The current design of the Grey Cup's base was introduced in 1987. The base stands high and is made of black-lacquered aluminum with silver plates engraved with the names of each winning team's players and executives since 1909. The trophy, one of Canada's best known symbols, ran out of room for new additions following the <a href="100th%20Grey%20Cup">2012 Grey Cup</a>. The league announced that the base will be redesigned but will remain similar in shape to its current design.

Similar to the more famous <a href="Stanley%20Cup">Stanley Cup</a> used exclusively today by the NHL, members of the winning teams are allowed time to celebrate with the trophy in their own fashion, often taking it to their home towns or tours in locations across Canada. The board of directors for the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canadian Football Hall of Fame</a> act as the Grey Cup's trustees and control its rental for events. The trophy is accompanied by a designated representative of the Hall of Fame at all times. Like the Stanley Cup, but unlike the <a href="Vince%20Lombardi%20Trophy">Vince Lombardi Trophy</a> for the NFL's Super Bowl, a new trophy is not made every year; rather, the Grey Cup is loaned to the winning team for a year.

Each year, the host city organizes numerous events as part of the annual Grey Cup festival. Gala concerts, parties, and fan festivals are held in the days leading up to the championship game. The CFL hands out its annual awards during the festival, and an annual Grey Cup parade is held. Historically, the festival also featured the "Miss Grey Cup" beauty pageant; this was discontinued in 1992. The game itself includes a performance of the Canadian national anthem (usually sung in both English and French) and a <a href="List%20of%20Grey%20Cup%20Halftime%20Performances">halftime show</a>, often featuring performances by well-known Canadian musical acts such as <a href="Nickelback">Nickelback</a>, who performed at the 2011 game.

Nicknamed Canada's "Grand National Drunk", the Grey Cup party originated in the <a href="36th%20Grey%20Cup">1948 championship</a> when hundreds of Calgary Stampeders fans descended on Toronto for their team's first appearance in the game. Bringing <a href="chuckwagon">chuckwagon</a>s and horses, the fans organized a pancake breakfast – a staple of the <a href="Calgary%20Stampede">Calgary Stampede</a> – for bewildered Torontonians. According to historian <a href="Hugh%20Dempsey">Hugh Dempsey</a>, "The Grey Cup was just another game until Calgary went down to Toronto with chuckwagons and everything and turned it into an event." The Stampeders won the game on the strength of the "sleeper play", a touchdown scored by <a href="Norm%20Hill">Norm Hill</a> after he hid himself from the Ottawa defence by lying down on the sidelines, as if asleep. He received the pass from quarterback <a href="Keith%20Spaith">Keith Spaith</a> while still on his back. The victory completed the only undefeated season in the history of Canadian professional football. The boisterous celebrations that followed the win gave rise to the legend of Calgary alderman and future mayor <a href="Donald%20Hugh%20Mackay">Don Mackay</a> riding his horse into the lobby of the Royal York Hotel. This event was repeated in the 2012 Grey Cup game in Toronto to much of the delight of the fans of both teams. The Calgary Grey Cup Committee maintains the tradition of organizing a pancake breakfast at each year's championship.

A 2012 survey found that Canadians consider the Grey Cup to be the most important annual event to attend. Fans of all teams converge at the game venue, including some who have attended 60 or more Grey Cups. The influx of people from across the country is estimated to have an economic impact of over $120 million for the region hosting the championship game.

The Toronto Argonauts have won the most Grey Cup championships (17), followed by the Edmonton Eskimos (14) and Winnipeg Blue Bombers (10). The <a href="Winnipeg%20Blue%20Bombers">Winnipeg Blue Bombers</a> have made the most Grey Cup appearances (24). Since the Canadian Football League began in 1958, the Eskimos have won the most Grey Cup Championships (11) and have made the most Grey Cup appearances (19). The Saskatchewan Roughriders have the most losses in Grey Cup play (15), including five consecutive losses between 1928 and 1932. The defending champions are the Calgary Stampeders who won the <a href="106th%20Grey%20Cup">106th Grey Cup</a> in 2018. Six teams in CFL history have won the Grey Cup at home, the 2013 Saskatchewan Roughriders, the 2012 Toronto Argonauts, the 2011 BC Lions, the 1994 BC Lions, the 1977 Montreal Alouettes, and 1972 Hamilton Tiger-Cats. The Blue Bombers were the losing team in 2011, extending Winnipeg's championship drought at the time to 21 seasons, and at 28 seasons (1991–2018) is the longest active streak in the CFL.

Individually, three players have won seven Grey Cups: <a href="Jack%20Wedley">Jack Wedley</a> (Toronto, Montreal Navy), <a href="Bill%20Stevenson%20%28offensive%20lineman%29">Bill Stevenson</a> (Edmonton) and <a href="Hank%20Ilesic">Hank Ilesic</a> (Edmonton, Toronto). Ilesic is one of seven players to appear in nine Grey Cup games. Among quarterbacks, <a href="Anthony%20Calvillo">Anthony Calvillo</a> appeared in a record eight games, winning three. Five coaches share the record for Grey Cup championships at five: <a href="Wally%20Buono">Wally Buono</a> (the CFL's all-time leader in total games won), <a href="Don%20Matthews">Don Matthews</a>, <a href="Frank%20Clair">Frank Clair</a>, <a href="Hugh%20Campbell">Hugh Campbell</a> and <a href="Lew%20Hayman">Lew Hayman</a>.

Two individual awards are handed out following each game. The <a href="Grey%20Cup%20Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> award is given to the top performer in the Grey Cup. Between 1974 and 1990, the league named both offensive and defensive most valuable players. Three people have been named MVP on three occasions: <a href="Doug%20Flutie">Doug Flutie</a>, <a href="Damon%20Allen">Damon Allen</a> and <a href="Sonny%20Wade">Sonny Wade</a>. The <a href="Dick%20Suderman%20Trophy">Dick Suderman Trophy</a> is given to the most valuable Canadian. It is named in honour of <a href="Dick%20Suderman">Dick Suderman</a>, who died of a brain hemorrhage in 1972 while an active player for the Edmonton Eskimos. <a href="Dave%20Sapunjis">Dave Sapunjis</a> and <a href="Don%20Sweet">Don Sweet</a> have each won the award three times (however, Sapunjis is the only player to win the award in back-to-back years).

The city of Toronto has hosted the most Grey Cup games with 47, including 30 of the first 45 games played. The first game was held on December 4, 1909, at <a href="Rosedale%20Field">Rosedale Field</a>. Hamilton and Ottawa hosted several early games while Sarnia and Kingston each hosted one as the game's early years were dominated by teams in southern Ontario. The Grey Cup game and champion first left the province in 1931, when Montreal hosted the event and the <a href="Montreal%20AAA%20Winged%20Wheelers">Montreal AAA Winged Wheelers</a> won the <a href="19th%20Grey%20Cup">19th Grey Cup</a>. The game did not leave central Canada until 1955 when the <a href="43rd%20Grey%20Cup">43rd Grey Cup</a> was played in Vancouver. That contest achieved what was at the time an all-time Canadian football attendance record of 39,491. It was the first of 16 games hosted by the British Columbia city, second among all host cities.

The four highest attended Grey Cup games have been held at the <a href="Olympic%20Stadium%20%28Montreal%29">Olympic Stadium</a> in Montreal, with an all-time record of 68,318 set in 1977.
The 1940 Grey Cup was a two-game series, Toronto & Ottawa each hosted a game.

The Grey Cup game was first broadcast on radio in 1928. The <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> (CBC) carried radio coverage of the game for 51 years until 1986, when a network of private broadcasters took over.

Canadian television was in its infancy in 1952 when Toronto's <a href="CBLT-DT">CBLT</a> paid $7,500 for the rights to carry the first televised broadcast of a Grey Cup game. Within two years, it was estimated that 80 percent of the nation's 900,000 television sets were tuned into the game, even though the first national telecast did not occur until 1957. The Grey Cup continues to be one of Canada's most-viewed sporting events. The 1962 "<a href="50th%20Grey%20Cup">Fog Bowl</a>" game was the first Grey Cup to be broadcast on American television.

The CBC carried the first national telecasts exclusively, but the <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV Television Network</a> purchased rights to the 1962 game. The move sparked concern across Canada as the newly formed network was not yet available in many parts of the country. The debate over whether an "event of national interest" should be broadcast by the publicly funded CBC or private broadcasters reached the floor of <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">Parliament</a> as members of the federal government weighed in. It was decided that both networks would carry the game. The two networks continued with the <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a> arrangement until 1986 when CTV ceased its coverage.

The CFL operated the <a href="Canadian%20Football%20Network">Canadian Football Network</a>, a coalition of private broadcasters that shared league games and the Grey Cup with the CBC, from 1987 to 1990. CBC then broadcast the championship game alone until 2007, when the CFL sold exclusive rights to all games, including the Grey Cup, to specialty channel <a href="The%20Sports%20Network">The Sports Network</a> (TSN) and its French-language sister station <a href="R%C3%A9seau%20des%20sports">Réseau des sports</a> (RDS), a deal that was criticized by Canadians without cable access. Nonetheless, TSN and RDS achieved a record audience for the 2009 Grey Cup, with 6.1 million Canadians watching the game in its entirety, and over 14 million viewing at least part of the contest. Viewership has declined in recent years, and in 2014, about 33%, of Canadians watched at least some of the game, peaking at 5.1 million viewers in the fourth quarter.

The University of California, Riverside (UCR or UC Riverside), is a <a href="public%20university">public</a> <a href="research%20university">research university</a> in <a href="Riverside%2C%20California">Riverside, California</a>. It is one of the 10 general campuses of the <a href="University%20of%20California">University of California</a> system. The main campus sits on in a suburban district of Riverside with a branch campus of in <a href="Palm%20Desert%2C%20California">Palm Desert</a>. In 1907 the predecessor to UCR was founded as the <a href="UC%20Citrus%20Experiment%20Station">UC Citrus Experiment Station</a>, Riverside which pioneered research in <a href="biological%20pest%20control">biological pest control</a> and the use of <a href="plant%20hormone">growth regulators</a> responsible for extending the <a href="citrus">citrus</a> growing season in California from four to nine months. Some of the world's most important research collections on <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Riverside%20Citrus%20Variety%20Collection">citrus diversity</a> and <a href="Entomology%20Research%20Museum">entomology</a>, as well as <a href="Eaton%20collection">science fiction</a> and <a href="UCR/California%20Museum%20of%20Photography">photography</a>, are located at Riverside.

UCR's undergraduate <a href="UCR%20College%20of%20Humanities%2C%20Arts%2C%20and%20Social%20Sciences">College of Letters and Science</a> opened in 1954. The <a href="Regents%20of%20the%20University%20of%20California">Regents of the University of California</a> declared UCR a general campus of the system in 1959, and graduate students were admitted in 1961. To accommodate an enrollment of 21,000 students by 2015, more than $730 million has been invested in new construction projects since 1999. Preliminary accreditation of the <a href="UC%20Riverside%20School%20of%20Medicine">UC Riverside School of Medicine</a> granted in October 2012 and the first class of 50 students was enrolled in August 2013. It is the first new research-based public <a href="medical%20school">medical school</a> in 40 years.

UCR is consistently ranked as one of the most ethnically and economically diverse universities in the United States. The 2019 "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>" Best Colleges rankings places UCR tied for 35th among top public universities and ranks 85th nationwide. Over 27 of UCR's academic programs, including the Graduate School of Education and the <a href="Bourns%20College%20of%20Engineering">Bourns College of Engineering</a>, are highly ranked nationally based on peer assessment, student selectivity, financial resources, and other factors. "<a href="Washington%20Monthly">Washington Monthly</a>" ranked UCR 2nd in the United States in terms of social mobility, research and community service, while "U.S. News" ranks UCR as the fifth most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving <a href="Pell%20Grant">Pell Grant</a>s (42 percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation. Over 70% of all UCR students graduate within six years without regard to economic disparity. UCR's extensive outreach and retention programs have contributed to its reputation as a "university of choice" for minority students. In 2005, UCR became the first public university campus in the nation to offer a <a href="gender-neutral%20housing">gender-neutral housing</a> option.

UCR's sports teams are known as the Highlanders and play in the <a href="Big%20West%20Conference">Big West Conference</a> of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) <a href="Division%20I%20%28NCAA%29">Division I</a>. Their nickname was inspired by the high altitude of the campus, which lies on the foothills of <a href="Box%20Springs%20Mountain">Box Springs Mountain</a>. The UCR women's basketball team won back-to-back Big West championships in 2006 and 2007. In 2007, the men's baseball team won its first conference championship and advanced to the regionals for the second time since the university moved to Division I in 2001.

At the turn of the 20th century, <a href="Southern%20California">Southern California</a> was a major producer of citrus, the region's primary <a href="export">agricultural export</a>. The industry developed from the country's first <a href="navel%20orange">navel orange</a> trees, planted in <a href="Riverside%2C%20California">Riverside</a> in 1873. Lobbied by the citrus industry, the UC Regents established the UC <a href="Citrus%20Experiment%20Station">Citrus Experiment Station</a> (CES) on February 14, 1907, on of land on the east slope of <a href="Mount%20Rubidoux">Mount Rubidoux</a> in Riverside. The station conducted experiments in <a href="fertilization%20%28soil%29">fertilization</a>, <a href="irrigation">irrigation</a> and <a href="crop">crop</a> improvement. In 1917, the station was moved to a larger site, near Box Springs Mountain.

The 1944 passage of the <a href="Servicemen%27s%20Readjustment%20Act%20%28USA%29">GI Bill</a> during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> set in motion a rise in college enrollments that necessitated an expansion of the state university system in California. A local group of citrus growers and civic leaders, including many <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Berkeley">UC Berkeley</a> alumni, lobbied aggressively for a UC-administered <a href="liberal%20arts%20college">liberal arts college</a> next to the CES. State Senator Nelson Dilworth, former Assemblyman <a href="Philip%20L.%20Boyd">Philip L. Boyd</a> and Riverside State Assemblyman John Babbage were instrumental in shepherding the legislation through the State Legislature. Governor <a href="Earl%20Warren">Earl Warren</a> signed the bill in 1949, allocating $2 million for initial campus construction.

Gordon S. Watkins, <a href="Dean%20%28education%29">dean</a> of the College of Letters and Science at <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a>, became the first <a href="Provost%20%28education%29">provost</a> of the new college at Riverside. Initially conceived of as a small college devoted to the liberal arts, he ordered the campus built for a maximum of 1,500 students and recruited many young junior faculty to fill teaching positions. He presided at its opening with 65 faculty and 127 students on February 14, 1954, remarking, "Never have so few been taught by so many."

UCR's enrollment exceeded 1,000 students by the time <a href="Clark%20Kerr">Clark Kerr</a> became president of the UC system in 1958. Anticipating a "tidal wave" in enrollment growth required by the <a href="Baby%20Boomer">baby boom</a> generation, Kerr developed the <a href="California%20Master%20Plan%20for%20Higher%20Education">California Master Plan for Higher Education</a> and the Regents designated Riverside a general <a href="university">university</a> campus in 1959. UCR's first <a href="chancellor%20%28education%29">chancellor</a>, <a href="Herman%20Spieth">Herman Theodore Spieth</a>, oversaw the beginnings of the school's transition to a full university and its expansion to a capacity of 5,000 students. UCR's second chancellor, <a href="Ivan%20Hinderaker">Ivan Hinderaker</a> led the campus through the era of the <a href="free%20speech%20movement">free speech movement</a> and kept student protests peaceful in Riverside. According to a 1998 interview with Hinderaker, the city of Riverside received negative press coverage for <a href="smog">smog</a> after the mayor asked Governor <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> to declare the <a href="South%20Coast%20Air%20Basin">South Coast Air Basin</a> a <a href="disaster%20area">disaster area</a> in 1971; subsequent student enrollment declined by up to 25% through 1979. Hinderaker's development of innovative programs in business administration and <a href="UCR%20Division%20of%20Biomedical%20Sciences">biomedical sciences</a> created incentive for enough students to enroll at Riverside to keep the campus open.
In the 1990s, the UC experienced a new surge of enrollment applications, now known as "Tidal Wave II". The Regents targeted UCR for an annual growth rate of 6.3%, the fastest in the UC system, and anticipated 19,900 students at UCR by 2010. By 1995, African American, American Indian, and Latino student enrollments accounted for 30% of the UCR student body, the highest proportion of any UC campus at the time. The 1997 implementation of <a href="Proposition%20209">Proposition 209</a>—which banned the use of <a href="affirmative%20action">affirmative action</a> by state agencies—reduced the ethnic diversity at the more selective UC campuses but further increased it at UCR.

With UCR scheduled for dramatic population growth, efforts have been made to increase its popular and academic recognition. The students voted for a fee increase to move UCR athletics into <a href="NCAA%20Division%20I">NCAA Division I</a> standing in 1998. In the 1990s, proposals were made to establish a law school, a medical school, and a school of public policy at UCR, with the UCR School of Medicine and the School of Public Policy becoming reality in 2012. In June 2006, UCR received its largest gift, 15.5 million from two local couples, in trust towards building its medical school. The Regents formally approved <a href="UC%20Riverside%20School%20of%20Medicine">UCR's medical school</a> proposal in 2006. Projected to be completed by 2013, it will be the first new medical school in 40 years built in California.

UCR's main campus sits at an elevation of to near Box Springs Mountain, 3 miles (5 km) east of downtown Riverside, and comprises divided into eastern and western areas by the <a href="California%20State%20Route%2060">State Route 60</a> freeway.

East Campus, occupying approximately , hosts the core cluster of academic buildings and services. The original buildings that formed the earliest kernel of the campus included the UC Citrus Experiment Station, residential buildings, and barn, all of which are still in use. They were designed by Lester H. Hibbard, in association with H.B. Cody. Built by 1917 at a cost of $165,000, the <a href="architecture">architecture</a> of the major buildings followed the <a href="Mission%20Revival%20Style%20architecture">Mission Revival</a> style suggesting the Spanish colonial heritage of Southern California.
Further major construction largely ceased on the site until the groundbreaking for the College of Humanities Arts and Social Sciences (CHASS) in April 1951. A group of five buildings designed by different architects in a decidedly more <a href="Modern%20architecture">Modern</a> style were completed by 1954: the Rivera Library, Webber Hall, Geology Building, Physical Education Building and Watkins Hall. After the Regents declared UCR a "general campus" of the UC system in 1958, many new buildings and additions were laid out over the following decade. Following an east–west axis, new student residence halls and athletic facilities were developed along the southeastern quadrant of the main campus, while academic and research facilities were built along the central campus area closer to the freeway. The Bell Tower, one of only five <a href="carillon">carillon</a>s in California, was built in this period. Designed by <a href="A.%20Quincy%20Jones">A. Quincy Jones</a>, the tower is tall and contains 48 bells, each weighing from to , covering four chromatic <a href="octave">octave</a>s.

After the drop in enrollment and subsequent restructuring of academic programs in the 1970s, little capacity construction was undertaken over the next two decades. However, enrollment growth in the late 1980s justified considerable further campus expansion over the 1990s. Major additions built in the period include: <a href="UC%20Riverside%20Marlan%20and%20Rosemary%20Bourns%20College%20of%20Engineering">Bourns Hall</a>, completed in 1995; the Humanities & Social Science building, completed in 1996; and the Science Library, completed in 1998. The Pentland and Stonehaven residence halls were completed in 2000, and the Arts building was completed in 2001. Active construction projects include the "Multidisciplinary Research Building," new residence halls located east of A-I and ongoing renovations to Pierce Hall. The first phase of a new Commons was completed in 2007, and phase II is in development. Other ongoing projects include a new CHASS Instructional and Research Center and Students Academic Support Services Building. Since 1999, more than $730 million has been invested in construction projects.
Of the of UCR property constituting West Campus, approximately along University Avenue have been developed. These include facilities such as University Extension, the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Agriculture">United States Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA) Germplasm Repository, International Village (student housing), Human Resources and Highlander Hall. University Village, a <a href="Mixed-use%20development">mixed use</a> commercial development, features a movie theater, stores, restaurants, office space, and an apartment complex, along with a parking structure and <a href="parking%20lot">surface parking</a>. Citrus groves and row crops occupy the remaining stretching northwest to the intersection of Chicago Avenue and Le Conte Drive. Plans for future expansion include converting a portion of these fields into new UCR infrastructure.

The University of California, Riverside, has recently united its three downtown arts presentation venues under the umbrella name of the UCR ARTSblock. The ARTSblock is composed of the UCR/California Museum of Photography, The Sweeney Art Gallery, and the Culver Center of the Arts, a media lab and presentation facility. The three institutions reside side by side in the heart of downtown Riverside's historic <a href="pedestrian%20mall">pedestrian mall</a>.

The Richard J. Heckmann International Center for Entrepreneurial Management was founded in <a href="Palm%20Desert%2C%20CA">Palm Desert</a> in 2001. After the <a href="UC%20Citrus%20Experiment%20Station%23The%20Citrus%20Research%20Center%20and%20Agricultural%20Experiment%20Station">Coachella Valley Agricultural Research Station</a>, it is UCR's second institutional presence in the <a href="Coachella%20Valley">Coachella Valley</a>. Initially by a $6 million gift from Richard J. Heckmann, a <a href="water%20treatment">water treatment</a> entrepreneur, the institution was planned as a teaching and research center of the A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management at the UCR School of Business Administration. The center encourages local <a href="entrepreneurship">entrepreneurship</a> through the Coachella Valley Angel Network, an <a href="Angel%20investor">angel investment network</a>. A further investment of $10 million from the State of California and a donation of of land from the City of Palm Desert allowed for the opening of an expanded graduate center on April 15, 2005, adjacent to the <a href="California%20State%20University%2C%20San%20Bernardino%20Palm%20Desert%20Campus">California State University, San Bernardino Palm Desert Campus</a>. The center is also home to university researchers in <a href="conservation%20biology">conservation biology</a>, <a href="technology%20transfer">technology transfer</a> and <a href="Native%20American%20studies">Native American studies</a>. Master's level instruction in <a href="business%20management">business management</a> and <a href="creative%20writing">creative writing</a> is available at the center.

As a campus of the University of California system, UCR is governed by a <a href="Regents%20of%20the%20University%20of%20California">Board of Regents</a> and administered by a president. The current president is <a href="Janet%20Napolitano">Janet Napolitano</a>, and the <a href="Chancellor%20%28education%29">administrative head</a> of UCR is Kim Wilcox. UCR's academic policies are set by its Academic Senate, a legislative body composed of all UCR faculty members.

UCR is organized into four academic colleges, two professional schools, and several interdisciplinary divisions. UCR's liberal arts college, the College of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, was founded in 1954, and began accepting graduate students in 1960. The <a href="College%20of%20Natural%20and%20Agricultural%20Sciences">College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences</a>, founded in 1960, incorporated the CES as part of the first research-oriented institution at UCR; it eventually also incorporated the natural science departments formerly associated with the liberal arts college to form its present structure in 1974. UCR's newest academic unit, the Bourns College of Engineering, was founded in 1989. Comprising the professional schools are the <a href="UCR%20Graduate%20School%20of%20Education">Graduate School of Education</a>, founded in 1968, and the <a href="UCR%20School%20of%20Business%20Administration">UCR School of Business Administration</a>, founded in 1970. These units collectively provide 81 <a href="Academic%20major">majors</a> and 52 minors, 48 <a href="master%27s%20degree">master's degree</a> programs, and 42 <a href="Doctor%20of%20Philosophy">Doctor of Philosophy</a> (PhD) programs. UCR is the only UC campus to offer undergraduate degrees in creative writing and <a href="Policy">public policy</a> and one of three UCs (along with <a href="UC%20Berkeley">Berkeley</a> and <a href="UC%20Irvine">Irvine</a>) to offer an undergraduate degree in <a href="Administration%20%28business%29">business administration</a>. Through its Division of Biomedical Sciences, founded in 1974, UCR offers the Thomas Haider medical degree program in collaboration with <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20Los%20Angeles">UCLA</a>. UCR's doctoral program in the emerging field of <a href="dance%20theory">dance theory</a>, founded in 1992, was the first program of its kind in the United States, and UCR's minor in <a href="gender%20studies">lesbian, gay and bisexual studies</a>, established in 1996, was the first undergraduate program of its kind in the UC system. A new BA program in <a href="bagpipes">bagpipes</a> was inaugurated in 2007.

<a href="College%20and%20university%20rankings">Institutional rankings</a> of UC Riverside vary widely, depending on the criteria of the publication. For instance, UC Riverside was ranked the #15 college in the United States by the Social Mobility Index college rankings. In the 2018 edition of "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>"'s "America's Best Colleges", UCR was ranked tied for 85th among national universities; criteria include professor peer assessment, student selectivity and retention, as well as faculty resources, financial resources, and alumni giving. In the 2018 edition of the "<a href="Washington%20Monthly">Washington Monthly</a>" college rankings, UCR ranked 28th among national universities. "Washington Monthly" assesses the quality of schools based on social mobility (recruiting and graduating low-income students), research (producing cutting-edge scholarship and PhDs), and service (encouraging students to give something back to their country). In the 2018 edition of "Webometrics Ranking of World Universities" based in Spain, UCR was ranked 67th among national universities and 127th among world universities. "Money" magazine ranked UC Riverside 32nd in the country out of the nearly 1500 schools it evaluated for its 2018 Best Colleges ranking. The Daily Beast ranked UC Riverside 153rd in the country out of the nearly 2000 schools it evaluated for its 2013 Best Colleges ranking. According to the <a href="Faculty%20Scholarly%20Productivity%20Index">Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index</a> published by "Academic Analytics" in 2006, UCR as an institution ranked 46th among top research universities considering such criteria as faculty publications, citations, research funding and other honors. Since 1997, more than 110 UCR faculty members have been elected fellows of the <a href="American%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Science">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a>. Over the course of UCR's history, seven current or former faculty members have been elected to the <a href="United%20States%20National%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">National Academy of Sciences</a>, and more than 50 have received <a href="Guggenheim%20Fellowship">Guggenheim Fellowship</a>s. UCR currently has two Nobel Laureates on its faculty.

UCR operated under a $727 million budget in fiscal year 2014–15. The state government provided $214 million, student fees accounted for $224 million and $100 million came from contracts and grants . Private support and other sources accounted for the remaining $189 million. Overall, monies spent at UCR have an economic impact of nearly $1 billion in California. Faculty members received over $100 million in research funding in 2011–12, mostly from federal agencies such as the <a href="National%20Science%20Foundation">National Science Foundation</a> and the <a href="National%20Institutes%20of%20Health">National Institutes of Health</a>. Total research <a href="expenditure">expenditure</a>s at Riverside are significantly concentrated in <a href="agricultural%20science">agricultural science</a>, accounting for 53% of total research expenditures spent by the university in 2002. Top research centers by expenditure, as measured in 2002, include the Agricultural Experiment Station, the Center for Environmental Research and Technology, the Center for Bibliographical Studies, the Air Pollution Research Center, and the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics.

Throughout UCR's history, researchers have developed more than 40 new citrus varieties and invented new techniques to help the $960 million-a-year California <a href="agribusiness">citrus industry</a> fight pests and diseases. In 1927, <a href="entomologist">entomologist</a>s at the CES introduced two <a href="wasp">wasp</a>s from <a href="Australia">Australia</a> as natural enemies of a major citrus pest, the citrophilus <a href="mealybug">mealybug</a>, saving growers in Orange County $1 million in annual losses. This event was pivotal in establishing <a href="biological%20control">biological control</a> as a practical means of reducing pest populations. In 1963, plant physiologist Charles Coggins proved that application of <a href="gibberellic%20acid">gibberellic acid</a> allows fruit to remain on citrus trees for extended periods. The ultimate result of his work, which continued through the 1980s, was the extension of the citrus-growing season in California from four to nine months. In 1980, UC Riverside released the Oroblanco <a href="grapefruit">grapefruit</a>, its first <a href="patent">patent</a>ed citrus variety. Since then, the citrus breeding program has released other varieties such as the Melogold grapefruit, the Gold Nugget mandarin (or <a href="tangerine">tangerine</a>), and others that have yet to be given <a href="trademark">trademark</a> names. To assist entrepreneurs in developing new products, UCR is a primary partner in the Riverside Regional Technology Park, which includes the City of Riverside and the <a href="Riverside%20County%2C%20California">County of Riverside</a>. It also administers six reserves of the <a href="University%20of%20California%20Natural%20Reserve%20System">University of California Natural Reserve System</a>. UCR recently announced a partnership with <a href="China%20Agricultural%20University">China Agricultural University</a> to launch a new center in <a href="Beijing">Beijing</a>, which will study ways to respond to the country's growing environmental issues. UCR can also boast the birthplace of two name reactions in organic chemistry, the <a href="Castro-Stephens%20coupling">Castro-Stephens coupling</a> and the <a href="Midland%20Alpine%20Borane%20Reduction">Midland Alpine Borane Reduction</a>.

Admission to UC Riverside is rated as "more selective" by "<a href="U.S.%20News%20%26amp%3B%20World%20Report">U.S. News & World Report</a>".

For Fall 2018, UCR received 49,079 freshmen applications; 24,820 were admitted (50.6%). The average <a href="GPA">GPA</a> of the enrolled freshmen was 3.83, while the average <a href="SAT">SAT</a> scores were 620 for reading & writing and 635 for math.

In 2006, 43.4 percent of admitted students were first generation college students, 38.7 percent came from low family income backgrounds, and 24 percent graduated from low-performing high schools as measured by <a href="Academic%20Performance%20Index">Academic Performance Index</a> (API) scores. In 2007, "<a href="U.S.%20News">U.S. News</a>" ranked UCR as the third most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving <a href="Pell%20Grants">Pell Grants</a> (42 percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation.

According to statistics released by the Education Trust, a national nonprofit, in 2005 UC Riverside graduated 65.3 percent of its students in six years, a figure consistent with national averages but behind the average set by the top five public research universities by as much as 22 percent. However, UCR's consistency with the national average is well above the median of 39 percent for low-income-serving institutions as calculated in 2006 by the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Education%20Statistics">National Center for Education Statistics</a>, making the campus a model for successful approaches to <a href="Diversity%20%28politics%29">diversity</a> in higher education.

Total <a href="library">library</a> collections at UCR comprise more than 2 million volumes, 14,017 electronic journals, 23,000 serial subscriptions, and 1.7 million microformats. Two large, four-story libraries house most of the physical collections. The Rivera library was constructed in 1954 and named after <a href="Tom%C3%A1s%20Rivera">Tomás Rivera</a> in 1985. It seats a capacity of 956 and houses general humanities and social science collections, as well as special collections, including the world's largest collection of <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a>, <a href="Horror%20fiction">horror</a> and <a href="fantasy">fantasy</a> literature, the 110,000-volume <a href="Eaton%20collection">Eaton Collection</a>. The Rivera Library also hosts the only <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">U.S. Patent and Trademark Depository</a> based on a UC campus. The Raymond L. Orbach Science Library, built in 1998, seats a capacity of 1,360 and houses 533,000 volumes in the physical, natural, agricultural, biomedical, engineering and computer sciences, with special strengths in the areas of citrus and sub-tropical horticulture, entomology, and arid lands agriculture. On November 3, 2009, the Science library was officially renamed the Raymond L. Orbach Science Library in honor of former Chancellor Raymond L. Orbach. Smaller libraries include the Media and Cultural Library, the Music Library, and a branch digital library in Palm Desert. The UCR Library is one of 116 members of the <a href="Association%20of%20Research%20Libraries">Association of Research Libraries</a>, and is ranked 93rd in this group.

UCR's academic colleges administer significant <a href="collection%20%28museum%29">museum collections</a> in the arts and sciences. The <a href="UCR%20Citrus%20Variety%20Collection">Citrus Variety Collection</a> constitutes 1,800 trees representing two of each of the 640 types of Citrus and 28 other related genera in the <a href="Rutaceae">Rutaceae</a> family, the largest such collection in the world. The <a href="UCR%20Herbarium">Herbarium</a> houses more than 110,000 dried plant specimens from across the Western hemisphere. UCR is also home to of botanical gardens containing more than 3,500 plant species from around the world. The Gardens are located in the eastern foothills of the Box Springs Mountain on the University of California, Riverside campus. Over four miles (6 km) of trails wind through many microclimates and hilly terrain. The <a href="Entomology%20Research%20Museum">Entomology Research Museum</a> contains more than three million insect specimens, with particular strengths in <a href="Hymenoptera">Hymenoptera</a>, <a href="Chalcidoidea">Chalcidoidea</a>, <a href="Aphelinidae">Aphelinidae</a>, <a href="Thysanoptera">Thysanoptera</a> and <a href="Meloidae">Meloidae</a>. The <a href="UCR/California%20Museum%20of%20Photography">UCR/California Museum of Photography</a> and Sweeney Art Gallery house UCR's primary art collections. The UCR/CMP includes the world's largest holding of vintage <a href="stereograph">stereograph</a>s, one of the three great public collections of photographic apparatus in the US, and the University Print Collection of contemporary and historical images by over 1000 photographers. Located adjacent to the UCR/CMP, the Sweeney Art Gallery holds approximately 650 unique works, with especially strong collections from the <a href="modern%20art">modern</a> to <a href="contemporary%20art">contemporary</a> periods, including pieces by <a href="Alexander%20Calder">Alexander Calder</a>, <a href="Roy%20Lichtenstein">Roy Lichtenstein</a>, <a href="Millard%20Sheets">Millard Sheets</a> and <a href="Kara%20Walker">Kara Walker</a>.

Much of the student life on campus revolves around extensive local outreach and retention programs. Riverside enrolls the highest percentage of African American students of any of the 10 UC campuses and the second highest percentage of Latino students after Merced, prompting the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" and "<a href="New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" to run stories stating that UCR is a "campus of choice" for minority students. UCR was the first college in California to open a staffed lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) resource center in 1993, the first UC campus to offer a LGBT minor studies program in 1996, and the first campus in the nation to offer a <a href="gender-neutral%20housing">gender-neutral housing</a> option in 2005. In recognition of this, "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28LGBT%20magazine%29">The Advocate</a>" recognized UCR as one of the nation's best campuses for LGBT students in 2006, although it did not make the top 20. The "<a href="Princeton%20Review">Princeton Review</a>" listed UCR as a "Best Western College." While over 83 percent of students are non-white, there is a tendency for the different ethnic groups to self-segregate.

UCR's residence halls consist of three structures—Aberdeen-Inverness, Lothian, and Pentland Hills—which housed 2,930 students in triple, double and single rooms. In addition, UCR features several on-campus <a href="apartment%20complex">apartment complex</a>es such as Stonehaven, Bannockburn Village, University Plaza, Falkirk, Oban, Glen Mor and International Village, which together house 959 students. UCR also offers student family housing at Canyon Crest, a low-density residential community that serves 268 and is slated for demolition to make room for higher-density residence halls. Oban has since been upgraded to accommodate family housing as Canyon Crest is beginning to get demolished. Glen Mor, an apartment housing complex adjacent to Pentland Hills, was opened in 2007, and the university also purchased a nearby apartment complex, which is now known as Falkirk, for student housing in 2007. About half of the student population lives in off-campus apartments, one-fourth commute, and one-fourth live on campus. Thirty percent of students remain on campus for the weekend.

Reflecting UCR's diversity, a number of residence halls have been established for specific social, cultural and academic needs. Ethnic and gender-oriented theme halls include "Unete a Mundo", for students seeking to support Latino or Chicano students in acclimating to life at UCR; a Pan African Theme Hall for students interested in developing consciousness of African culture in relation to other cultures of the world; and Stonewall Hall, dedicated to students of all gender identities and sexual orientations who wish to live in a <a href="gender-neutral">gender-neutral</a> community. UCR's three academic colleges in the humanities, sciences and engineering fields are represented by respective theme halls, and halls exist for honor students and transfer students.

In Fall 2018, UCR began construction of a new residence hall and dining facility in the parking lot behind Aberdeen-Inverness. It is slated to be called Dundee-Glasgow and will feature UCR's first two-story residential restaurant.

UCR hosts over 375 registered student organizations, including the Associated Students of the University of California, Riverside (ASUCR), which represents undergraduates on administrative and policy issues. ASUCR is guided by a Senate composed of 16 elected senators, who represent the three undergraduate colleges in proportion to their enrollment, 5 Executive Cabinet Officers (President, Executive Vice President, Vice President of Campus Internal Affairs, Vice President of External Affairs, and Vice President of Finance), and 6 Directors, who are in charge of the various parts of ASUCR, and a Judicial Council of 6, which adjudicates any cases involving personnel misconduct or interpretation of the Constitution. Membership is composed of all UCR students who pay mandatory activity fees. ASUCR assesses these fees and distributes funds to registered student groups on campus, including student lobbying groups, a right that ASUCR won in a federal court case against the Regents in 1999.

Of the registered student groups, 40 are <a href="fraternities%20and%20sororities">fraternities and sororities</a>. Nine men's fraternities belong to the <a href="North-American%20Interfraternity%20Conference">North-American Interfraternity Conference</a>; seven women's sororities belong to the <a href="National%20Panhellenic%20Conference">National Panhellenic Conference</a>; seven men's fraternities and ten women's sororities represent the <a href="National%20Multicultural%20Greek%20Council">National Multicultural Greek Council</a>, and two others fall under the campus <a href="La%20Raza">Raza</a> Assembly and are unique to UCR. Thirteen percent of the undergraduate student body participates in Greek life, although chapter houses are not permitted. Including the Greek letter organizations, more than 60 student volunteer service organizations at UCR contribute to more than 100,000 hours of collective and individual service done in the community each year. Jewish student life has existed for over a decade through UCR Hillel.

Student media organizations include "The Highlander" student newspaper, currently published every Tuesday during the academic year. First published in 1954, "The Highlander" remains an independent student media outlet. It was an entirely self-funded organization until 2001, when ASUCR passed a funding referendum for it. Student fees from the referendum go towards overhead and printing costs, however "The Highlander" is primarily funded through its own advertising revenue. In 2003, "The Highlander" published a comic depicting a stereotypical <a href="Asian%20American">Asian American</a> graduate teaching assistant with poor English skills, inciting community backlash and prompting an apology from Editor-in-Chief Kahlil Ford. Other student news publications on campus include the "Asian Community Times, Indian Time, Nuestra Cosa, Queeriosity", and the "X-Factor Student Newspaper". Campus literary magazines include "Mosaic", published at UCR since 1959, and "Crate," published by graduate students in UCR's master's level creative writing program since 2005. UCR broadcasts over <a href="radio">radio</a> as <a href="KUCR">KUCR</a> at 88.3 FM. The station programs a variety of independent music, news and commentary.

On-campus entertainment events are planned by a 14-member Associated Students Program Board (ASPB), comprising six student-run divisions that include concerts, films and lectures, cultural events and special events, as well as a marketing and leadership division. ASPB's major events include the Block Party Concert, Winter Soulstice, Homecoming Bonfire and Spring Splash.

Still other on-campus events take place at The Barn, one of the original buildings on campus grounds. Throughout the 60s', 70s' and 80s' popular up and coming bands played at The Barn including No Doubt and Radiohead. During the 90s' however, the university administration sought to avoid a "party school" stigma and did away with the concerts and events and remodeled the facility into a restaurant, The Big West Bar and Grill. As recently as the fall of 2007, concerts returned to The Barn and efforts are underway to rejuvenate it and once again make it into an on-campus venue attracting students as well as the larger university community.

The Graduate Student Association of the University of California, Riverside (GSAUCR) is ASUCR's counterpart on the graduate level. It is guided by a Graduate Student Council consisting of representatives from every department on campus. GSAUCR assesses fees required of all graduate students and uses them to fund research awards and colloquiums, conference travel grants, and speaker funds.

UCR's <a href="varsity%20team">varsity team</a>s compete in the Big West Conference of NCAA Division I. Programs include men's and women's soccer, cross country, basketball, track and field, baseball, softball, tennis, golf and women's volleyball. After students voted to assess themselves $35 a quarter to fund the athletic programs in 1998, men's and women's soccer and golf were added, and the athletic department switched from <a href="NCAA%20Division%20II">NCAA Division II</a> in 2000. While at Division II level, UCR produced 5 national championship teams in men's baseball and women's volleyball. , UCR had produced 17 individual national champions, 175 <a href="All-American">All-American</a>s and many conference and regional champions. The men's golf team represented UCR in the 2004 and 2005 NCAA West Regionals after winning back-to-back Conference Championships in those respective years while having three athletes ranked in the top 100 in the country. In 2006, 2007, and 2010 the UCR women's basketball team represented the conference in the Division I tournament but lost all three times in the first round. In December 2008, the UCR women's basketball team upset the #16-seeded Vanderbilt Commodores.

In 2005 the women's soccer team competed in the first round of the NCAA tournament. In 2007, UCR's baseball team won their first Big West championship and reached the Division I postseason for the second time since 2003, and the cross country team sent its first two athletes to the national championships.
<a href="UC%20Riverside%20Highlanders%20football">Football</a> was played until 1975, and the team won two <a href="California%20Collegiate%20Athletic%20Association">CCAA</a> championships before the sport was discontinued because of low attendance and in anticipation of the impact of <a href="Title%20IX">Title IX</a> regulations.

The volleyball and basketball teams play home games in the <a href="Student%20Recreation%20Center%20Arena">Student Recreation Center Arena</a> (SRC), which seats 3,168. The baseball team competes at the <a href="Riverside%20Sports%20Complex">Riverside Sports Complex</a>, just off campus at the corner of Blaine and Rustin streets. UCR graduate <a href="Troy%20Percival">Troy Percival</a> personally built UCR's baseball clubhouse to <a href="Major%20league%20baseball">major league</a> quality standards. Softball is played at the Amy S. Harrison Field, named after a UCR graduate who donated $300,000 towards its upgrade in 2004. Adjacent to the softball field are the soccer and track fields. The soccer field was resurfaced with <a href="artificial%20turf">artificial turf</a> in 2007. In 2011, the old track and field facility, which had bleachers that dated back to the 1950s and a track surface that was over 15 years old, was completely torn out and replaced with a brand new facility.

Non-varsity student sports clubs that compete with other area universities include the Rugby Football Club, established in 2006, which plays in the Southern California Rugby Football Union. The karate program is provided through the UC Riverside Recreation Center's Leisure Line classes. The classes are provided by top of the line USA Shotokan karate team coaches from the American JKA Karate Association, an association that has been in the city for over 40 years. It is one of the largest collegiate programs in the United States, that take competitors to local, national and international competitions. A Men's and Women's Club Soccer team also competes in the West Coast Soccer Association.

In 1954, UCR's founding class adopted the name "Highlanders", reflecting the campus' high altitude. After the student body passed a referendum to move to Division I competition in 1998, the bear mascot, formerly called "Scotty", was professionally redesigned to look more ferocious. The new mascot featured a half-blue face in homage to <a href="William%20Wallace">William Wallace</a>, the subject of the movie <a href="Braveheart">Braveheart</a>. In line with the <a href="Scottish%20people">Scottish</a> motif, UCR assembles a <a href="bagpipe">bagpipe</a> band made up of students and staff who play at graduation and other campus events. The blue and gold <a href="tartan">tartan</a> worn by the pipe band and the mascot is a registered trademark of the University of California. For the women's basketball team's first appearance at the NCAA Tournament in 2006, UCR sent 22 members of the pipe band to play at halftime.


More than 94,000 alumni have graduated from UCR over the course of its history. A Alumni and Visitors Center was established in 2007. It is used as a central gathering place for alumni and holds several facilities for use including meeting rooms, a formal board room, a central lobby area, a library, several alumni affairs offices, and a café.

Some of the most notable alumni include the following:

<doc id="230916" url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=230916" title="Kinetoscope">
Kinetoscope

The Kinetoscope is an <a href="History%20of%20film%23Precursors%20of%20film">early motion picture</a> exhibition device. The Kinetoscope was designed for films to be viewed by one individual at a time through a <a href="peephole">peephole</a> viewer window at the top of the device. The Kinetoscope was not a <a href="movie%20projector">movie projector</a>, but introduced the basic approach that would become the standard for all cinematic projection before the advent of <a href="video">video</a>, by creating the illusion of movement by conveying a strip of <a href="film%20perforations">perforated film</a> bearing sequential images over a light source with a high-speed shutter. A process using roll film first described in a patent application submitted in France and the U.S. by French inventor <a href="Louis%20Le%20Prince">Louis Le Prince</a>, the concept was also used by U.S. inventor <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a> in 1889, and subsequently developed by his employee <a href="William%20Kennedy%20Laurie%20Dickson">William Kennedy Laurie Dickson</a> between 1889 and 1892. Dickson and his team at the Edison lab also devised the Kinetograph, an innovative <a href="movie%20camera">motion picture camera</a> with rapid <a href="intermittent%20movement">intermittent, or stop-and-go, film movement</a>, to photograph movies for in-house experiments and, eventually, commercial Kinetoscope presentations.

A prototype for the Kinetoscope was shown to a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope was held at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Museum">Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences</a> on May 9, 1893. Instrumental to the birth of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international <a href="patents">patents</a> on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a <a href="phonograph%20cylinder">cylinder</a> <a href="phonograph">phonograph</a>. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.

An encounter with the work and ideas of photographic pioneer <a href="Eadweard%20Muybridge">Eadweard Muybridge</a> appears to have spurred Edison to pursue the development of a motion picture system. On February 25, 1888, in <a href="Kaust%2C%20Kentucky">Kaust, Kentucky</a>, Muybridge gave a lecture that may have included a demonstration of his <a href="zoopraxiscope">zoopraxiscope</a>, a device that projected sequential images drawn around the edge of a glass disc, producing the illusion of motion. The Edison facility was very close by, and the lecture was possibly attended by both Edison and his company's official photographer, William Dickson. Two days later, Muybridge and Edison met at Edison's laboratory in <a href="West%20Orange%2C%20New%20Jersey">West Orange</a>; Muybridge later described how he proposed a collaboration to join his device with the Edison phonograph—a combination system that would play sound and images concurrently. No such collaboration was undertaken, but in October 1888, Edison filed a preliminary claim, known as a caveat, with the <a href="United%20States%20Patent%20and%20Trademark%20Office">U.S. Patent Office</a> announcing his plans to create a device that would do "for the Eye what the phonograph does for the Ear". It is clear that it was intended as part of a complete audiovisual system: "we may see & hear a whole Opera as perfectly as if actually present". In March 1889, a second caveat was filed, in which the proposed motion picture device was given a name, Kinetoscope, derived from the Greek roots "<a href="wikt%3A%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B9%CF%82">kineto-</a>" ("movement") and "<a href="wikt%3A%CF%83%CE%BA%CE%BF%CF%80%CF%8C%CF%82">scopos</a>" ("to view").

Edison assigned Dickson, one of his most talented employees, to the job of making the Kinetoscope a reality. Edison would take full credit for the invention, but the historiographical consensus is that the title of creator can hardly go to one man:

While Edison seems to have conceived the idea and initiated the experiments, Dickson apparently performed the bulk of the experimentation, leading most modern scholars to assign Dickson with the major credit for turning the concept into a practical reality. The Edison laboratory, though, worked as a collaborative organization. Laboratory assistants were assigned to work on many projects while Edison supervised and involved himself and participated to varying degrees.
Dickson and his then lead assistant, Charles Brown, made halting progress at first. Edison's original idea involved recording pinpoint photographs, 1/32 of an inch wide, directly on to a cylinder (also referred to as a "drum"); the cylinder, made of an opaque material for positive images or of glass for negatives, was coated in <a href="collodion">collodion</a> to provide a photographic base. An audio cylinder would provide synchronized sound, while the rotating images, hardly operatic in scale, were viewed through a microscope-like tube. When tests were made with images expanded to a mere 1/8 of an inch in width, the coarseness of the <a href="silver%20halide">silver bromide</a> <a href="photographic%20film">emulsion</a> used on the cylinder became unacceptably apparent. Around June 1889, the lab began working with sensitized <a href="celluloid%23Photography">celluloid</a> sheets, supplied by John Carbutt, that could be wrapped around the cylinder, providing a far superior base for the recording of photographs. The first film made for the Kinetoscope, and apparently the first motion picture ever produced on photographic film in the United States, may have been shot at this time (there is an unresolved debate over whether it was made in June 1889 or November 1890); known as "<a href="Monkeyshines%2C%20No.%201">Monkeyshines, No. 1</a>", it shows an employee of the lab in an apparently tongue-in-cheek display of physical dexterity. Attempts at synchronizing sound were soon left behind, while Dickson would also experiment with disc-based exhibition designs.

The project would soon head off in more productive directions, largely impelled by a trip of Edison's to Europe and the <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281889%29">Exposition Universelle</a> in Paris, for which he departed August 2 or 3, 1889. During his two months abroad, Edison visited with scientist-photographer <a href="%C3%89tienne-Jules%20Marey">Étienne-Jules Marey</a>, who had devised a "<a href="chronophotography">chronophotographic gun</a>"—the first portable motion picture <a href="camera">camera</a>—which used a strip of flexible film designed to capture sequential images at twelve frames per second. Upon his return to the United States, Edison filed another patent caveat, on November 2, which described a Kinetoscope based not just on a flexible filmstrip, but one in which the film was perforated to allow for its engagement by <a href="sprockets">sprockets</a>, making its mechanical conveyance much more smooth and reliable. The first motion picture system to employ a perforated image band was apparently the Théâtre Optique, patented by French inventor <a href="Charles-%C3%89mile%20Reynaud">Charles-Émile Reynaud</a> in 1888. Reynaud's system did not use photographic film, but images painted on gelatine frames. At the Exposition Universelle, Edison would have seen both the Théâtre Optique and the <a href="electrotachyscope">electrical tachyscope</a> of German inventor Ottamar Anschütz. This disc-based projection device is often referred to as an important conceptual source for the development of the Kinetoscope. Its crucial innovation was to take advantage of the <a href="persistence%20of%20vision">persistence of vision</a> theory by using an intermittent light source to momentarily "freeze" the projection of each image; the goal was to facilitate the viewer's retention of many minutely different stages of a photographed activity, thus producing a highly effective illusion of constant motion. By late 1890, intermittent visibility would be integral to the Kinetoscope's design.

The question of when the Edison lab began working on a filmstrip device is a matter of historical debate. According to Dickson, in the summer of 1889, he began cutting the stiff celluloid sheets supplied by Carbutt into strips for use in such a prototype machine; in August, by his description, he attended a demonstration of <a href="George%20Eastman">George Eastman</a>'s new flexible film and was given a roll by an Eastman representative, which was immediately applied to experiments with the prototype. As described by historian Marta Braun, Eastman's product

was sufficiently strong, thin, and pliable to permit the intermittent movement of the film strip behind [a camera] lens at considerable speed and under great tension without tearing ... stimulat[ing] the almost immediate solution of the essential problems of cinematic invention.
Some scholars—in particular, <a href="Gordon%20Hendricks">Gordon Hendricks</a>, in "The Edison Motion Picture Myth" (1961)—have argued that the lab began working on a filmstrip machine much later and that Dickson and Edison misrepresented the date to establish priority for reasons of both patent protection and intellectual status. In any event, though film historian David Robinson claims that "the cylinder experiments seem to have been carried on to the bitter end" (meaning the final months of 1890), as far back as September 1889—while Edison was still in Europe, but corresponding regularly with Dickson—the lab definitely placed its first order with the Eastman company for roll film. Three more orders for roll film were placed over the next five months.

Only sporadic work was done on the Kinetoscope for much of 1890 as Dickson concentrated on Edison's unsuccessful venture into ore milling—between May and November, no expenses at all were billed to the lab's Kinetoscope account. By early 1891, however, Dickson, his new chief assistant, <a href="William%20Heise">William Heise</a>, and another lab employee, Charles Kayser, had succeeded in devising a functional strip-based film viewing system. In the new design, whose mechanics were housed in a wooden cabinet, a loop of horizontally configured 19 mm (3/4 inch) film ran around a series of spindles. The film, with a single row of perforations engaged by an electrically powered sprocket wheel, was drawn continuously beneath a magnifying lens. An electric lamp shone up from beneath the film, casting its circular-format images onto the lens and thence through a peephole atop the cabinet. As described by Robinson, a rapidly spinning shutter "permitted a flash of light so brief that [each] frame appeared to be frozen. This rapid series of apparently still frames appeared, thanks to the persistence of vision phenomenon, as a moving image." The lab also developed a <a href="electric%20motor">motor</a>-powered camera, the Kinetograph, capable of shooting with the new sprocketed film. To govern the intermittent movement of the film in the camera, allowing the strip to stop long enough so each frame could be fully exposed and then advancing it quickly (in about 1/460 of a second) to the next frame, the sprocket wheel that engaged the strip was driven by an <a href="escapement">escapement</a> disc mechanism—the first practical system for the high-speed stop-and-go film movement that would be the foundation for the next century of <a href="cinematography">cinematography</a>.

On May 20, 1891, the first public demonstration of a prototype Kinetoscope was given at the laboratory for approximately 150 members of the National Federation of Women's Clubs. The <a href="New%20York%20Sun%20%28historical%29">New York "Sun"</a> described what the club women saw in the "small pine box" they encountered:

In the top of the box was a hole perhaps an inch in diameter. As they looked through the hole they saw the picture of a man. It was a most marvelous picture. It bowed and smiled and waved its hands and took off its hat with the most perfect naturalness and grace. Every motion was perfect...

The man was Dickson; the little movie, approximately three seconds long, is now referred to as "<a href="Dickson%20Greeting">Dickson Greeting</a>". On August 24, three detailed patent applications were filed: the first for a "Kinetographic Camera", the second for the camera as well, and the third for an "Apparatus for Exhibiting Photographs of Moving Objects". In the first Kinetograph application, Edison stated, "I have been able to take with a single camera and a tape-film as many as forty-six photographs per second...but I do not wish to limit the scope of my invention to this high rate of speed...since with some subjects a speed as low as thirty pictures per second or even lower is sufficient." Indeed, according to the Library of Congress archive, based on data from a study by historian <a href="Charles%20Musser">Charles Musser</a>, "Dickson Greeting" and at least two other films made with the Kinetograph in 1891 were shot at 30 frames per second or even slower. The Kinetoscope application also included a plan for a <a href="stereoscopy">stereoscopic</a> film projection system that was apparently abandoned.

In the spring of the following year, steps began to make coin operation, via a nickel slot, part of the mechanics of the viewing system. By autumn 1892, the design of the Kinetoscope was essentially complete. The filmstrip, based on stock manufactured first by Eastman, and then, from April 1893 onward, by New York's Blair Camera Co., was <a href="35%20mm%20film">35 mm</a> (1 3/8 inches) wide; each vertically sequenced frame bore a rectangular image and four perforations on each side. Within a few years, this basic format would be adopted globally as the standard for motion picture film, which it remains to this day. The publication in the October 1892 "Phonogram" of <a href="cinematography">cinematographic</a> sequences shot in the format demonstrates that the Kinetograph had already been reconfigured to produce movies with the new film.

As for the Kinetoscope itself, there is a significant disagreement over the location of the shutter providing the crucial intermittent visibility effect. According to a report by inventor <a href="Herman%20Casler">Herman Casler</a> described as "authoritative" by Hendricks, who personally examined five of the six still-extant first-generation devices, "Just above the film...a shutter wheel having five spokes and a very small rectangular opening in the rim [rotates] directly over the film. An incandescent lamp...is placed below the film...and the light passes up through the film, shutter opening, and magnifying lens...to the eye of the observer placed at the opening in the top of the case." Robinson, on the other hand, says the shutter—which he agrees has only a single slit—is positioned lower, "between the lamp and film". The Casler–Hendricks description is supported by the diagrams of the Kinetoscope that accompany the 1891 patent application, in particular, diagram 2. A side view, it does not illustrate the shutter, but it shows the impossibility of it fitting between the lamp and the film without a major redesign and indicates a space that seems suitable for it between the film and the lens. Robinson's description, however, is supported by a photograph of a Kinetoscope interior that appears in Hendricks's own book.

On February 21, 1893, a patent was issued for the system that governed the intermittent movement of film in the Kinetograph. However, Robinson (1997) misleadingly stated that "patents for the Kinetograph camera and the Kinetoscope viewer were finally issued" in early 1893 (p. 38). As explained by Braun (1992), "except for the device used to stop and start the moving film, which was granted a patent in 1893, all the parts of the application describing the camera were ultimately disallowed because of previous inventors' claims" (p. 191). Also, Hendricks (1961) described the outcome of the camera patent similarly to Braun (pp. 136–137). The facts in sum are: (a) a patent solely for the intermittent movement apparatus was issued in February 1893; (b) all the other elements of the original Kinetograph patent applications were successfully challenged; and (c) a patent, number 589,168, for a complete Kinetograph camera, one substantially different from that described in the original applications, was issued on August 31, 1897.

The escapement-based mechanism would be superseded within a few years by competing systems, in particular those based on the so-called <a href="Geneva%20drive">Geneva drive</a> or "Maltese cross" that would become the norm for both movie cameras and projectors. The exhibition device itself—which, despite erroneous accounts to the contrary, never employed intermittent film movement, only intermittent lighting or viewing—was finally awarded its patent, number 493,426, on March 14. The Kinetoscope was ready to be unveiled.

The premiere of the completed Kinetoscope was held not at the <a href="World%27s%20Columbian%20Exposition">Chicago World's Fair</a>, as originally scheduled, but at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. The first film publicly shown on the system was "<a href="Blacksmith%20Scene">Blacksmith Scene</a>" (aka "Blacksmiths"); directed by Dickson and <a href="cinematography">shot</a> by Heise, it was produced at the new Edison moviemaking studio, known as the <a href="Edison%27s%20Black%20Maria">Black Maria</a>. Despite extensive promotion, a major display of the Kinetoscope, involving as many as twenty-five machines, never took place at the Chicago exposition. Kinetoscope production had been delayed in part because of Dickson's absence of more than eleven weeks early in the year with a nervous breakdown. Robinson argues that "[s]peculation that a single Kinetoscope reached the Fair seems to be conclusively dismissed by an 1894 leaflet issued for the launching of the invention in London," which states, "the Kinetoscope was not perfected in time for the great Fair." Hendricks, in contrast, refers to accounts in the "<a href="Scientific%20American">Scientific American</a>" of July 21 and October 21, 1893, that constitute evidence no less "conclusive" that one Kinetoscope did make it to the fair. The weight of evidence supports Hendricks; as fair historian Stanley Appelbaum states, "Doubt has been cast on the reports of [the Kinetoscope's] actual presence at the fair, but these reports are numerous and circumstantial" (Appelbaum does err in claiming that the device was "first shown at the Exposition").
Work proceeded, though slowly, on the Kinetoscope project. On October 6, a U.S. <a href="copyright">copyright</a> was issued for a "publication" received by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> consisting of "Edison Kinetoscopic Records." It remains unclear what film was awarded this, the first motion picture copyright in North America. By the turn of the year, the Kinetoscope project would be reenergized. During the first week of January 1894, a five-second film starring an Edison technician was shot at the Black Maria; "<a href="Fred%20Ott%27s%20Sneeze">Fred Ott's Sneeze</a>", as it is now widely known, was made expressly to produce a sequence of images for an article in "<a href="Harper%27s">Harper's</a>" magazine. Never intended for exhibition, it would become one of the most famous Edison films and the first identifiable motion picture to receive a U.S. copyright. Three months later, the Kinetoscope's epochal moment arrived.

On April 14, 1894, a public Kinetoscope parlor was opened by the Holland Bros. in New York City at 1155 Broadway, on the corner of 27th Street—the first commercial motion picture house. The venue had ten machines, set up in parallel rows of five, each showing a different movie. For 25 cents a viewer could see all the films in either row; half a dollar gave access to the entire bill. The machines were purchased from the new Kinetoscope Company, which had contracted with Edison for their production; the firm, headed by Norman C. Raff and Frank R. Gammon, included among its investors Andrew M. Holland, one of the entrepreneurial siblings, and Edison's former business chief, Alfred O. Tate. The ten films that comprise the first commercial movie program, all shot at the Black Maria, were descriptively titled: "Barber Shop", "Bertoldi (mouth support)" (Ena Bertoldi, a British vaudeville contortionist), "Bertoldi (table contortion)", "Blacksmiths", "Roosters" (some manner of cock fight), "Highland Dance", "Horse Shoeing", "Sandow" (<a href="Eugen%20Sandow">Eugen Sandow</a>, a German strongman managed by <a href="Florenz%20Ziegfeld">Florenz Ziegfeld</a>), "Trapeze", and "Wrestling". As historian Charles Musser describes, a "profound transformation of American life and performance culture" had begun.

Twenty-five cents for no more than a few minutes of entertainment was hardly cheap diversion. For the same amount, one could purchase a ticket to a major <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> theater; when America's first <a href="amusement%20park">amusement park</a> opened in <a href="Coney%20Island">Coney Island</a> the following year, a 25-cent entrance fee covered admission to three rides, a performing sea lion show, and a dance hall. The Kinetoscope was an immediate success, however, and by June 1, the Hollands were also operating venues in Chicago and San Francisco. Entrepreneurs (including Raff and Gammon, with their own International Novelty Co.) were soon running Kinetoscope parlors and temporary exhibition venues around the United States. New firms joined the Kinetoscope Company in commissioning and marketing the machines. The Kinetoscope exhibition spaces were largely, though not uniformly, profitable. After fifty weeks in operation, the Hollands' New York parlor had generated approximately $1,400 in monthly receipts against an estimated $515 in monthly operating costs; receipts from the Chicago venue (located in a Masonic temple) were substantially lower, about $700 a month, though presumably operating costs were lower as well. For each machine, Edison's business at first generally charged $250 to the Kinetoscope Company and other distributors, which would use them in their own exhibition parlors or resell them to independent exhibitors; individual films were initially priced by Edison at $10. During the Kinetoscope's first eleven months of commercialization, the sale of viewing machines, films, and auxiliary items generated a profit of more than $85,000 for Edison's company.

One of the new firms to enter the field was the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company; the firm's partners, brothers Otway and Grey Latham, Otway's friend <a href="Enoch%20Rector">Enoch Rector</a>, and their employer, Samuel J. Tilden Jr., sought to combine the popularity of the Kinetoscope with that of <a href="boxing">prizefighting</a>. This led to a series of significant developments in the motion picture field: The Kinetograph was then capable of shooting only a 50-foot-long negative (evidence suggests feet was the longest length actually used). At 16 frames per foot, this meant a maximum running time of 20 seconds at 40 frames per second (fps), the speed most frequently employed with the camera. At the rate of 30 fps that had been used as far back as 1891, a film could run for almost 27 seconds. Hendricks identifies "Sandow" as having been shot at 16 fps, as does the Library of Congress in its online catalog, where its duration is listed as 40 seconds. Even at the slowest of these rates, the running time would not have been enough to accommodate a satisfactory exchange of fisticuffs; 16 fps, as well, might have been thought to give too herky-jerky a visual effect for enjoyment of the sport. The Kinetograph and Kinetoscope were modified, possibly with Rector's assistance, so they could manage filmstrips three times longer than had previously been used.

On June 14, a match with abbreviated rounds was staged between boxers Michael Leonard and Jack Cushing at the Black Maria. Seven-hundred-and-fifty feet worth of images or even more were shot at the rate of 30 fps—easily the longest motion picture to date. In August 1894, the film premiered at the Kinetoscope Exhibition Company's parlor at 83 Nassau Street in New York. A half-dozen expanded Kinetoscope machines each showed a different round of the fight for a dime, meaning sixty cents to see the complete bout. For a planned series of follow-up fights (of which the outcome of at least the first was fixed), the Lathams signed famous heavyweight <a href="James%20J.%20Corbett">James J. Corbett</a>, stipulating that his image could not be recorded by any other Kinetoscope company—the first movie star contract.

Just three months after the commercial debut of the motion picture came the first recorded instance of motion picture <a href="censorship">censorship</a>. The film in question showed a performance by the Spanish dancer <a href="Carmencita">Carmencita</a>, a New York music hall star since the beginning of the decade. According to one description of her live act, she "communicated an intense sexuality across the footlights that led male reporters to write long, exuberant columns about her performance"—articles that would later be reproduced in the Edison film catalog. The Kinetoscope movie of her dance, shot at the Black Maria in mid-March 1894, was playing in the New Jersey resort town <a href="Asbury%20Park%2C%20New%20Jersey">Asbury Park</a> by summer. The town's founder, James A. Bradley, a real estate developer and leading member of the <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a> community, had recently been elected a state senator: "The "Newark Evening News" of 17 July 1894 reported that [Senator] Bradley...was so shocked by the glimpse of Carmencita's ankles and lace that he complained to Mayor Ten Broeck. The showman was thereupon ordered to withdraw the offending film, which he replaced with "Boxing Cats"." The following month, a San Francisco exhibitor was arrested for a Kinetoscope operation "alleged to be indecent." The group whose disgruntlement occasioned the arrest was the Pacific Society for the Suppression of Vice, whose targets included "illicit literature, obscene pictures and books, the sale of morphine, cocaine, opium, tobacco and liquors to minors, lottery tickets, etc.," and which proudly took credit for having "caused 70 arrests and obtained 48 convictions" in a recent two-month span.

The Kinetoscope was also gaining notice on the other side of the Atlantic. In the summer of 1894, it was demonstrated at 20, boulevard Poissonnière in Paris; this was one of the primary inspirations to the <a href="Auguste%20and%20Louis%20Lumi%C3%A8re">Lumière</a> brothers, who would go on to develop the first commercially successful movie projection system. On October 17, 1894, the first Kinetoscope parlor outside the United States opened in London. Dissemination of the system proceeded rapidly in Europe, as Edison had left his patents unprotected overseas. The most likely reason was the technology's reliance on a variety of foreign innovations and a consequent belief that patent applications would have little chance of success. An alternative view, however, used to be popular: The 1971 edition of the "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>", for instance, claims that Edison "apparently thought so little of his invention that he failed to pay the $150 that would have granted him an international copyright ." As recently as 2004, Andrew Rausch stated that Edison "balked at a $150 fee for overseas patents" and "saw little commercial value in the Kinetoscope." Given that Edison, as much a businessman as an inventor, spent approximately $24,000 on the system's development and went so far as to build a facility expressly for moviemaking before his U.S. patent was awarded, Rausch's interpretation is not widely shared by present-day scholars. Whatever the cause, two Greek entrepreneurs, George Georgiades and George Tragides, took advantage of the opening. Already successfully operating a pair of London movie parlors with Edison Kinetoscopes, they commissioned English inventor and manufacturer <a href="Robert%20W.%20Paul">Robert W. Paul</a> to make copies of them. After fulfilling the Georgiades–Tragides contract, Paul decided to go into the movie business himself, proceeding to make dozens of additional Kinetoscope reproductions. Paul's work would result in a series of important innovations in both camera and exhibition technology. Meanwhile, plans were advancing at the Black Maria to realize Edison's goal of a motion picture system uniting image with sound.

The Kinetophone (aka Phonokinetoscope) was an early attempt by Edison and Dickson to create a <a href="sound%20film">sound-film</a> system. Reports suggest that in July 1893, a Kinetoscope accompanied by a cylinder phonograph had been presented at the Chicago World's Fair. The first known movie made as a test of the Kinetophone was shot at Edison's New Jersey studio in late 1894 or early 1895, which is now referred to as <a href="The%20Dickson%20Experimental%20Sound%20Film">The Dickson Experimental Sound Film</a>; this film, along with a short film from 1913 called Nursery Favorites and a 1912 demonstration film, are the only surviving movies with live-recorded sound made for the Kinetophone. In March 1895, Edison offered the device for sale; involving no technological innovations, it was a Kinetoscope whose modified cabinet included an accompanying cylinder phonograph. Kinetoscope owners were also offered kits with which to retrofit their equipment. The first Kinetophone exhibitions appear to have taken place in April. Though a Library of Congress educational website states, "The picture and sound were made somewhat synchronous by connecting the two with a belt," this is incorrect. As historian David Robinson describes, "The Kinetophone...made no attempt at synchronization. The viewer listened through tubes to a phonograph concealed in the cabinet and performing approximately appropriate music or other sound." Historian <a href="Douglas%20Gomery">Douglas Gomery</a> concurs, "[Edison] did not try to synchronize sound and image." Leading production sound mixer Mark Ulano writes, "[O]nly 45 Kinetophones were made. They did NOT play synchronously other than the phonograph turned on when viewing and off when stopped." Though the surviving Dickson test involves live-recorded sound, certainly most, and probably all, of the films marketed for the Kinetophone were shot as silents, predominantly march or dance subjects; exhibitors could then choose from a variety of musical cylinders offering a rhythmic match. For example, three different cylinders with orchestral performances were proposed as accompaniments for "Carmencita": "Valse Santiago", "La Paloma", and "Alma-Danza Spagnola".

Even as Edison followed his dream of securing the Kinetoscope's popularity by adding sound to its allure, many in the field were beginning to suspect that film projection was the next step that should be pursued. When Norman Raff communicated his customers' interest in such a system to Edison, the great inventor summarily rejected the notion:

No, if we make this screen machine that you are asking for, it will spoil everything. We are making these peep show machines and selling a lot of them at a good profit. If we put out a screen machine there will be a use for maybe about ten of them in the whole United States. With that many screen machines you could show the pictures to everybody in the country—and then it would be done. Let's not kill the goose that lays the golden egg.

Under continuing pressure from Raff, Edison eventually conceded to investigate the possibility of developing a projection system. He seconded one of his lab's technicians to the Kinetoscope Company to initiate the work, without informing Dickson. Dickson's ultimate discovery of this move appears to have been one of the central factors leading to his break with Edison that occurred in spring 1895.

Over the course of 1895, it became clear that the Kinetoscope was going to lose out on one end to projected motion pictures and, on the other, to a new "peep show" device, the cheap, <a href="flip%20book">flip-book</a>-based <a href="Mutoscope">Mutoscope</a>. In its second year of commercialization, the Kinetoscope operation's profits plummeted by more than 95 percent, to just over $4,000. The Latham brothers and their father, <a href="Woodville%20Latham">Woodville</a>, had retained the services of former Edison employee <a href="Eugene%20Lauste">Eugene Lauste</a> and then, in April 1895, Dickson himself to develop a film projection system. On May 20, in New York City, the new <a href="Eidoloscope">Eidoloscope</a> was used for the first commercial screening of a motion picture: a boxing match between <a href="Young%20Griffo">Young Griffo</a> and Charles Barnett, four or eight minutes long. European inventors, most prominently the Lumières and Germany's <a href="Max%20Skladanowsky">Skladanowsky</a> brothers, were moving forward with similar systems.

By the beginning of 1896, Edison had turned his attention to promoting a projector technology, the Photoscope, developed by young inventors <a href="Charles%20Francis%20Jenkins">Charles Jenkins</a> . The rights to the system had been acquired by Charles and Gammon, who redubbed it the <a href="Vitascope">Vitascope</a> and arranged with Edison to present himself as its creator. With Dickson having left his employ, the Kinetophone was soon mothballed and Edison suspended work on sound cinema for an extended period. Departing the Vitascope operation after little more than a year, Edison commissioned the development of his own projection systems, the Projectoscope and then multiple iterations of the Projecting Kinetoscope. In 1912, he introduced the ambitious and expensive Home Projecting Kinetoscope, which employed a unique format of three parallel columns of sequential frames on one strip of film—the middle column ran through the machine in the reverse direction from its neighbors. It was a commercial failure. Four years later, the Edison operation came out with its last substantial new film exhibition technology, a short-lived theatrical system called the Super Kinetoscope. Much of the Edison company's most creative work in the motion picture field from 1897 on involved the use of Kinetoscope-related patents in threatened or actual lawsuits for the purpose of financially pressuring or blocking commercial rivals.
As far back as the Vitascope days, some exhibitors had screened films accompanied by phonographs playing appropriate, though very roughly timed, sound effects; in the style of the Kinetophone described above, rhythmically matching recordings were also made available for march and dance subjects. While Edison oversaw cursory sound-cinema experiments after the success of "<a href="The%20Great%20Train%20Robbery%20%281903%20film%29">The Great Train Robbery</a>" (1903) and other Edison Manufacturing Company productions, it was not until 1908 that he returned in earnest to the combined audiovisual concept that had first led him to enter the motion picture field. Edison patented a synchronization system connecting a projector and a phonograph, located behind the screen, via an assembly of three rigid shafts—a vertical one descending from each device, joined by a third running horizontally the entire length of the theater, beneath the floor. Two years later, he supervised a press demonstration at the laboratory of a sound-film system of either this or a later design. In 1913, Edison finally introduced the new Kinetophone—like all of his sound-film exhibition systems since the first in the mid-1890s, it used a cylinder phonograph, now connected to a Projecting Kinetoscope via a fishing line–type belt and a series of metal pulleys. While it met with great acclaim in the short term, poorly trained operators had trouble keeping picture in synchronization with sound and, like other sound-film systems of the era, the Kinetophone had not solved the issues of insufficient amplification and unpleasant audio quality. Its drawing power as a novelty soon faded and when a fire at Edison's West Orange complex in December 1914 destroyed all of the company's Kinetophone image and sound masters, the system was abandoned.

Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)

Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death) is the fourth studio album by American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Marilyn%20Manson%20%28band%29">Marilyn Manson</a>. It was released on November 11, 2000 by <a href="Nothing%20Records">Nothing</a> and <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a>. A <a href="rock%20opera">rock opera</a> <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>, it is the final installment of a <a href="triptych">triptych</a> that also included "<a href="Antichrist%20Superstar">Antichrist Superstar</a>" (1996), and marked a return to the <a href="industrial%20metal">industrial metal</a> style of the band's earlier work, after the <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a>-influenced production of "<a href="Mechanical%20Animals">Mechanical Animals</a>" (1998). After its release, the band's <a href="Marilyn%20Manson">eponymous vocalist</a> said that the overarching story within the trilogy is presented in reverse chronological order: "Holy Wood", therefore, begins the narrative.

In the aftermath of the <a href="Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre">Columbine High School massacre</a> on April 20, 1999, national news media reported that the perpetrators were wearing the band's T-shirts during the rampage, and had been <a href="Columbine%20High%20School%20massacre%23Music">influenced by their music</a>. As their first release after the massacre, the record was Manson's rebuttal to the accusations leveled against him and the group, and was described by the vocalist as a "declaration of war". It was written in the singer's former home in the <a href="Hollywood%20Hills">Hollywood Hills</a> and recorded in several undisclosed locations, including <a href="Death%20Valley">Death Valley</a> and <a href="Laurel%20Canyon%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Laurel Canyon</a>. His ambitions for "Holy Wood" initially included an eponymous film exploring its backstory—a project which has since been abandoned and was modified into the as-yet-unreleased "<a href="Holy%20Wood%20%28book%29">Holy Wood</a>" novel.

The album was released to generally positive reviews. Several writers praised it as the band's finest work, and multiple publications ranked it as one of the best albums of 2000. British rock magazine "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" went on to include it on its list of the best albums of the decade. In the US, "Holy Wood" was not as commercially successful as the band's preceding records, debuting at number 13 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>. However, it became their most successful album internationally, debuting in the top twenty of numerous <a href="Record%20chart">national charts</a>. It was certified gold in several countries, including Canada, Japan, Switzerland and the UK.

Three singles were released from the record: "<a href="Disposable%20Teens">Disposable Teens</a>", "<a href="The%20Fight%20Song%20%28Marilyn%20Manson%20song%29">The Fight Song</a>" and "<a href="The%20Nobodies%20%28song%29">The Nobodies</a>", and the band embarked on the worldwide <a href="Guns%2C%20God%20and%20Government%20Tour">Guns, God and Government Tour</a>. In 2010, "Kerrang!" published a 10th-anniversary commemorative piece in which they called the album "Manson's finest hour ... A decade on, there has still not been as eloquent and savage a musical attack on the media and mainstream culture ... [It is] still scathingly relevant [and] a credit to a man who refused to sit and take it, but instead come out swinging."

In the late 1990s, <a href="Marilyn%20Manson">Marilyn Manson</a> and his <a href="Marilyn%20Manson%20%28band%29">eponymous band</a> established themselves as a household name, and as one of the most controversial rock acts in music history. Their albums "<a href="Antichrist%20Superstar">Antichrist Superstar</a>" (1996) and "<a href="Mechanical%20Animals">Mechanical Animals</a>" (1998) were both critical and commercial successes, and by the time of their <a href="Rock%20Is%20Dead%20Tour">Rock Is Dead Tour</a> in 1999, the frontman had become a <a href="culture%20war">culture war</a> iconoclast and a rallying icon for alienated youth. As their popularity increased, the confrontational nature of the group's music and imagery outraged <a href="Social%20conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">social conservative</a>s. Numerous politicians lobbied to have their performances banned, citing false and exaggerated claims that they contained animal sacrifices, bestiality and rape. Their concerts were routinely picketed by religious advocates and parent groups, who asserted that their music had a corrupting influence on youth culture by inciting "rape, murder, blasphemy and suicide".

On April 20, 1999, <a href="Columbine%20High%20School">Columbine High School</a> students <a href="Eric%20Harris%20and%20Dylan%20Klebold">Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold</a> shot dead 12 students and a teacher and wounded 21 others, before committing suicide. In the aftermath of the <a href="school%20shooting">school shooting</a>, the band were widely reported to have influenced the killings; early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and were wearing the group's T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, speculation in national media and among the public continued to blame Manson's music and imagery for inciting Harris and Klebold. Later reports revealed that the two were not fans—and, on the contrary, had disliked the band's music. Despite this, Marilyn Manson (as well as other bands and forms of entertainment, such as movies and video games) were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures.

Under mounting pressure in the days after Columbine, the group postponed their last five North American tour dates out of respect for the victims and their families. On April 29, ten US senators (led by <a href="Sam%20Brownback">Sam Brownback</a> of Kansas) sent a letter to <a href="Edgar%20Bronfman%20Jr.">Edgar Bronfman Jr.</a> – the president of <a href="Seagram">Seagram</a> (the owner of Interscope) – requesting a voluntary halt to his company's distribution to children of "music that glorifies violence". The letter named Marilyn Manson for producing songs which "eerily reflect" the actions of Harris and Klebold. Later that day, the band cancelled their remaining North American shows. Two days later, Manson published his response to these accusations in an <a href="op-ed">op-ed</a> piece for "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", titled "Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?", where he castigated <a href="Gun%20culture%20in%20the%20United%20States">America's gun culture</a>, the political influence of the <a href="National%20Rifle%20Association">National Rifle Association</a>, and the media's irresponsible coverage, which he said facilitated the placing of blame on a <a href="scapegoat">scapegoat</a>, instead of debating more relevant societal issues.

On May 4, a hearing on the marketing and distribution of violent content to minors by the television, music, film and video-game industries was held by the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Commerce%2C%20Science%20and%20Transportation">United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation</a>. The committee heard testimony from former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Education">Secretary of Education</a> and <a href="FreedomWorks">Empower America</a> co-founder <a href="William%20Bennett">William Bennett</a>, the Archbishop of Denver <a href="Charles%20J.%20Chaput">Charles J. Chaput</a>, professors and mental-health professionals. Speakers criticized the band, its label-mate <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, and the 1999 film "<a href="The%20Matrix">The Matrix</a>" for their alleged contribution to a cultural environment enabling violence such as the Columbine shootings. The committee requested that the <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Justice">United States Department of Justice</a> investigate the entertainment industry's marketing practices to minors.

After concluding the European and Japanese legs of their tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view. The early development of "Holy Wood" coincided with Manson's three-month seclusion at his home in the <a href="Hollywood%20Hills">Hollywood Hills</a>, during which he considered how to respond to the controversy. Manson said the maelstrom made him re-evaluate his career: "There was a bit of trepidation, [in] deciding: 'Is it worth it? Are people understanding what I'm trying to say? Am I even gonna be allowed to say it?' Because I definitely had every single door shut in my face ... there were not a lot of people who stood behind me." He told "<a href="Alternative%20Press%20%28music%20magazine%29">Alternative Press</a>" that he felt his safety was threatened to the point that he "could be <a href="Murder%20of%20John%20Lennon">shot Mark David Chapman-style</a>." He began work on the album as a counterattack.

Several of the tracks that appear on "Holy Wood" date back to 1995, prior to the release of "Antichrist Superstar", although much of this material consisted of "scattered ideas". Manson, the band's vocalist, developed this material into more substantial compositions during his three-month period of seclusion. Following this, the full band worked for a year on re-writing and developing the material. The record is the group's most collaborative effort to date; all members contributed to the songwriting process. Most of the compositional work was done by Manson alongside guitarists <a href="Twiggy%20Ramirez">Twiggy Ramirez</a> and <a href="John%205%20%28guitarist%29">John 5</a>. The vocalist contrasted his songwriting sessions between the two, calling sessions with the latter "very focused", saying that most of their compositions would be completed before being taken to the rest of the band for consideration. In contrast, his sessions with Ramirez were less demanding, and the pair frequently experimented with <a href="absinthe">absinthe</a>. Drummer <a href="Ginger%20Fish">Ginger Fish</a> worked constantly on new material, and is credited with performing <a href="Keyboard%20instrument">keyboards</a> and <a href="Programming%20%28music%29">programming</a>, while keyboardist <a href="Madonna%20Wayne%20Gacy">Madonna Wayne Gacy</a> provided input on "President Dead" and "Cruci-Fiction in Space". Altogether, the band wrote 100 musical fragments, of which between 25 and 30 became songs.
Band members maintained a low profile during the album's recording. Manson indicated that their <a href="MarilynManson.com">website</a> would be their "only contact with humanity" during this period. The album was recorded at several locations, including <a href="Death%20Valley">Death Valley</a>, Manson's home in the Hollywood Hills, and <a href="Rick%20Rubin">Rick Rubin</a>'s <a href="The%20Mansion%20%28recording%20studio%29">Mansion Studio</a> in <a href="Laurel%20Canyon%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Laurel Canyon</a>. Locations were chosen for the atmosphere they were intended to impart to the music, and the band visited Death Valley a number of times to "imprint the feeling of the desert into [their] minds", and to avoid composing artificial-sounding songs. Manson co-produced the album alongside <a href="mixing%20engineer">mixing engineer</a> <a href="Dave%20Sardy">Dave Sardy</a>, while <a href="Bon%20Harris">Bon Harris</a> of <a href="electronic%20body%20music">electronic body music</a> group <a href="Nitzer%20Ebb">Nitzer Ebb</a> is credited with programming and pre-production editing. Experimental sound effects and acoustic songs were recorded using <a href="live%20instrumentation">live instrumentation</a>. Harris' programming skills would prove invaluable during the recording process, as he would take the natural sounds the band had been recording and reconstruct them into processed background effects. Manson also explained that the acoustic songs were "acoustic" in the sense that they were not recorded with electronic instruments, but he said the album's sonic landscape would be "intrinsically electronic".

Manson announced on December 16, 1999, that the album was progressing under the <a href="working%20title">working title</a> "In the Shadow of the Valley of Death", and that its logo would be the alchemical symbol for mercury. Expanding on the symbol's relationship to the album's concept, Manson said "It represents both the <a href="Androgyny%23Symbols%20and%20iconography">androgyne</a> and the <a href="prima%20materia">prima materia</a>, which has been associated with Adam, the first man." The band spent considerable time at the Mansion Studio, where the bulk of Ginger Fish's live drumming would be recorded, with its cavernous rooms particularly suitable for recording percussion. On February 23, 2000, Manson delivered a 20-minute lecture via satellite to a current-events convention, "DisinfoCon 2000", aimed at exposing <a href="disinformation">disinformation</a> where he posed the question, "White teenagers, why are they mad? They’re white. They’re spoiled. Is it because they know that America’s a lie? ... Is adult entertainment killing our children? Or is killing our children entertaining adults?" Six days later, it was announced that their upcoming album had been re-titled "Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)". By April, the album was in the final stages of recording, and Manson began posting footage of the band from the studio.

Manson's ambitions for the project initially included an eponymous film exploring the album's backstory. In July 1999, he had reportedly begun negotiating with <a href="New%20Line%20Cinema">New Line Cinema</a> to produce and distribute the film and its soundtrack. At the <a href="1999%20MTV%20Europe%20Music%20Awards">1999 MTV Europe Music Awards</a> in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a> (where the band performed on November 11), he disclosed the film's title and his production plans. Manson met Chilean <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> filmmaker <a href="Alejandro%20Jodorowsky">Alejandro Jodorowsky</a> at the event to discuss work on the film, although no final decision was made. By February 29, 2000, the deal fell through when Manson had reservations that New Line Cinema would take the film in a direction which would not have "retained his artistic vision".

Abandoning his attempt to bring "Holy Wood" to the screen, Manson announced plans to publish two books accompanying the album. The first was a "graphic and phantasmagoric" <a href="novel">novel</a> intended for release shortly after the album by <a href="ReganBooks">ReganBooks</a> (a division of <a href="HarperCollins">HarperCollins</a>). The novel's style was inspired by <a href="William%20S.%20Burroughs">William S. Burroughs</a>, <a href="Kurt%20Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a>, <a href="Aldous%20Huxley">Aldous Huxley</a> and <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>, and would be followed by a <a href="coffee%20table%20book">coffee table book</a> of images created for the project. In a December 2000 interview with Manson, novelist <a href="Chuck%20Palahniuk">Chuck Palahniuk</a> mentioned the "Holy Wood" novel (due for release in spring 2001) and complimented its style. Neither book has been released, reportedly due to a publishing dispute.

Manson described "Holy Wood" as a "declaration of war." The album's plot is a <a href="parable">parable</a>, which he told "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" was semi-autobiographical. While it can be viewed on several levels, he said its simplest interpretation is to see it as a story about an idealistic man whose revolution is commercialized, leading him to "destroy the thing he has created, which is himself." It takes place in a thinly-veiled satire of modern America called "Holy Wood", which Manson described as a <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World">Disneyesque</a>, city-sized amusement park where the main attractions are death and violence, and where consumerism is taken to hyperbolic extreme. Its <a href="Foil%20%28literature%29">literary foil</a> is "Death Valley", which is used as a "metaphor for the outcast and the imperfect of the world."

The central character is the protagonist <a href="Adam%20Kadmon">Adam Kadmon</a>—a name derived from the <a href="Kabbalah">Kabbalah</a> which means "original man". The story follows him as he goes in search of a better life out of Death Valley and into Holy Wood. Disenchanted by what he finds, he fashions a counterculture revolution, only to have it usurped and co-opted by Holy Wood's consumer culture, and he finds himself appropriated as a figure of Holy Wood's ideology of "Celebritarianism": an ideology in which fame is the primary moral value of a religion deeply rooted in celebrity worship and martyrdom; where <a href="Posthumous%20fame">dead celebrities are revered as saints</a>, and <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> is idolized as the contemporary <a href="Jesus%20Christ">Jesus Christ</a>. Holy Wood's religion parallels Christianity, in that it juxtaposes the dead-celebrity phenomenon in American culture with the <a href="crucifixion%20of%20Jesus">crucifixion of Jesus</a>.
The phrase "guns, god and government" is repeated multiple times throughout the album. It is suggested that these are the root cause of violence, and the album examines the role <a href="Conservatism%20in%20the%20United%20States">conservative</a> <a href="Culture%20of%20the%20United%20States">American culture</a> played in the Columbine massacre: specifically its advocacy of gun culture, the inadequacies of <a href="Tradition">traditional</a> <a href="family%20values">family values</a>, the American inclination toward <a href="War%20hawk">war-mongering</a> solely for <a href="War%20profiteering">profit</a>, and the <a href="Christian%20right">Christian right's</a> proclivity for <a href="moral%20panic">moral panic</a>. This glorification of violence within mainstream American culture is the central theme of the record. A substantive portion of the record analyzes the cultural role of Jesus Christ, specifically Manson's view that the image of his crucifixion was the origin of celebrity. Manson said that while his previous work argued against the Bible's content, for the purpose of "Holy Wood", he instead looked for things in the Bible to which he could relate. He developed an opinion that Christ was a revolutionary figure—a person who was killed for having dangerous opinions, and whose image was later exploited and merchandised for financial gain in the name of <a href="free%20market">free market</a> <a href="capitalism">capitalism</a>.

Christ's death is also compared to <a href="Abraham%20Zapruder">Abraham Zapruder</a>'s <a href="Zapruder%20film">film</a> of the <a href="assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">assassination of John F. Kennedy</a>, which Manson called "the only thing that's happened in modern times to equal the crucifixion." He watched the clip many times as a child, and said it was the most violent thing he had ever seen. <a href="John%20Lennon">John Lennon</a> is also referred to on the album as an <a href="Murder%20of%20John%20Lennon">assassinated icon</a> murdered by a <a href="born-again%20Christian">born-again Christian</a>, <a href="Mark%20David%20Chapman">Mark David Chapman</a>, who was incensed by Lennon's "<a href="more%20popular%20than%20Jesus">more popular than Jesus</a>" remark. While recording "Holy Wood", Manson was drawn to <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>' 1968 "<a href="The%20Beatles%20%28album%29">White Album</a>", due to its alleged role in inspiring the <a href="Charles%20Manson%23Family%20crimes">Charles Manson "Family" murders</a>, and the parallels he observed between that incident and Columbine, saying: "To my knowledge, it's the first rock n' roll record that's been blamed and linked to violence. When you've got "<a href="Helter%20Skelter%20%28Manson%20scenario%29">Helter Skelter</a>" [taken from the <a href="Helter%20Skelter%20%28song%29">Beatles song of the same name</a>] written in blood on someone's wall, it's a little more damning than anything I've been blamed for."

The record is primarily an <a href="industrial%20metal">industrial metal</a> album, although it has also been described as <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, and <a href="gothic%20rock">gothic rock</a>. The vocalist claimed in a pre-release interview with "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>" that the album would contain some of the <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heaviest</a> material the band had recorded to date. "Holy Wood" combines the <a href="glam%20rock">glam rock</a>-influenced production of "Mechanical Animals" with the <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a> soundscape of the band's earlier work. He also called the record "arrogant, in an <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a> sense" and said that, as a result of the lyrical content, most of the songs contained three or four distinct parts, although the band took great care to avoid being "self-indulgent". He also said that the record was intended to be the "<a href="Industrial%20music">industrial</a> "White Album"", and that he wrote "Holy Wood" in the same house where <a href="The%20Rolling%20Stones">The Rolling Stones</a> wrote their 1970 single "<a href="Let%20It%20Bleed%20%28song%29">Let It Bleed</a>"—another source of inspiration.

Like "Antichrist Superstar" before it, "Holy Wood" uses a <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a> structure, dividing the album into four movements. These movements are titled A: In the Shadow, D: The Androgyne, A: Of Red Earth, and M: The Fallen. Manson described the record as "the final piece of a triptych that I began with "Antichrist Superstar"." Despite being the last of the three albums to be released, Manson explained that the triptych's storyline takes place in reverse chronological order; "Holy Wood" began the story, and "Mechanical Animals" and "Antichrist Superstar" were sequels. The storyline unfolds in a multi-tiered series of metaphors and allusions; for example, the album's title refers not only to the <a href="Hollywood%20Sign">Hollywood Sign</a>, but also to "the tree of knowledge that Adam took the first fruit from when he fell out of paradise, the wood that Christ was crucified on, the wood that [Lee Harvey] Oswald's rifle is made from, and the wood that so many coffins are made of."

"GodEatGod" is the first song on the record. It opens with the sound of a <a href="Focal-plane%20shutter">mechanical shutter</a> in slow-motion capturing gunshots ringing in the background while onlookers scream and then follows Adam as he meditates in the desert. The song is driven by keyboards, synthesizers and a <a href="Synthesizer%23Bass_synthesizer">synth bass</a>. "The Love Song" was described by Manson as about "America's romance with guns", and its title originated from his observation that "Love Song" is one of the most common titles in music. The lyrics are composed around an elaborate metaphor about guns. Manson explained: "I was suggesting with the lyrics that the father is the hand, the mother is the gun, and the children are the bullets. Where you shoot them is your responsibility as parents." The chorus is a rhetorical take on a popular American <a href="bumper%20sticker">bumper sticker</a>: "Do you love your God, gun, government?" "Kerrang!" described "<a href="The%20Fight%20Song%20%28Marilyn%20Manson%20song%29">The Fight Song</a>" as a "playground punk anthem", and Manson revealed that its theme is Adam's desire to be a part of Holy Wood, saying that it is about "a person who's grown up all his life thinking that the grass is greener on the other side, but when he finally [gets there], he realizes that it's worse than where he came from." "<a href="Disposable%20Teens">Disposable Teens</a>" is a "signature Marilyn Manson song" with a bouncing guitar riff composed of <a href="staccato">staccato</a> <a href="Articulation%20%28music%29">articulation</a>. Its lyrics juxtapose the disenfranchisement of contemporary <a href="Millennials">millenial</a> youth with the revolutionary idealism of their <a href="Baby%20boomers">baby boomer</a> parents' generation. The Beatles' influence is evident in this song; the chorus echoes the disillusionment of the "White Album" "<a href="Revolution%201">Revolution 1</a>".

Manson singled out "Target Audience (Narcissus Narcosis)" as his favorite song on the album and said that it describes every person's desire for <a href="self-actualization">self-actualization</a>. The song's <a href="flanging">flanged</a> <a href="arpeggio">arpeggiated chords</a> builds into heavy guitar chugs and <a href="string%20bending">string bending</a> during the chorus and features an <a href="optigan">optigan</a>. <a href="Drowned%20In%20Sound">Drowned In Sound</a> described the song as "a shining moment" in the album. "President Dead" is a guitar-driven song showcasing John 5's technical skills. It opens with a sample of <a href="Don%20Gardiner">Don Gardiner</a>'s "<a href="ABC%20News%20Radio">ABC News Radio</a>" broadcast announcing the death of John F. Kennedy and accents both the first verse and guitar solo with a <a href="mellotron">mellotron</a>. The song is 3:13 long, which is a deliberate numerological reference to <a href="Film%20frame">frame</a> 313 of the Zapruder film—the frame displaying the moment of impact of the fatal head shot which killed Kennedy. "In the Shadow of the Valley of Death" is an introspective song with Adam at his most emotionally vulnerable. The song is divided into two parts. The first portion consists of samples and a 'death loop' on a simple <a href="strum">strum</a> from a 1952 <a href="Gibson">Gibson</a> <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a>. In the second portion the samples and 'death loop' are replaced by a <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a> and drums over <a href="Plucked%20string%20instrument">plucked</a> chords. "Cruci-Fiction in Space" further explores the Kennedy assassination, postulating that human beings have evolved from monkeys to men to guns. It's composition is slow and heavy; bereft of "speed or intricacy." Its middle 8 has a <a href="Time%20signature%23Mixed%20meters">mixed meter</a> <a href="drum%20beat">drum beat</a> in 4/4 time with two additional <a href="eighth%20note">eighth note</a>s at the end; "it doesn't start in 4/4, it doesn't end in 4/4, so it's confusing." "A Place in the Dirt" is another personal song, characterized by Adam's self-analysis of his place in Holy Wood.

"<a href="The%20Nobodies%20%28song%29">The Nobodies</a>" is a mournful, elegiac <a href="dirge">dirge</a> over a <a href="clavecin%20%C3%A9lectrique">clavecin électrique</a> and synthesized-drums. Its title is taken from a quote by Mark David Chapman. The verse "Today I am dirty and I want to be pretty, tomorrow I'll know that I'm just dirt" has an <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a>-style vocal delivery, building to the "adrenaline-fueled" chorus. "<a href="College%20Music%20Journal">CMJ</a>" noted that the song could be interpreted as a tribute to the Columbine shooters, but its point was not to glorify violence; rather, it was to depict a society drenched in its children's blood. "The Death Song" is the turning point for Adam; he no longer cares. Manson described it as sarcastic and nihilistic: "it's like 'We have no future and we don't give a fuck'." "Kerrang!" described it as one of the album's heaviest songs. The <a href="Bridge%20%28music%29">bridge</a> of "Lamb of God" paraphrases the chorus of "<a href="Across%20the%20Universe">Across the Universe</a>" (from 1970's "<a href="Let%20It%20Be">Let It Be</a>"), whose lyric "Nothing's gonna change my world" inspired the song. Manson elaborated that: "Mark David Chapman came along and proved him very wrong. That was always something growing up that was very sad and tragic to me". The song uses the assassinations of JFK and John Lennon to criticize media <a href="sensationalism">sensationalism</a>, and for turning tragedy into televised spectacle. The song is keyboard-heavy featuring various instrumentation such as a piano, a <a href="minipiano">minipiano</a>, a <a href="leslie%20speaker">leslie speaker</a>, and multiple synthesizers. John 5's rhythm and acoustic guitar work were recorded in an unusual fashion. "Born Again" is the second song in the record to use the synth bass. It is primarily driven by Ramirez and John 5's guitars and is the only other song in the record, apart from "The Nobodies", to use the drum machine. "Burning Flag" is a heavy-metal song reminiscent of American industrial metal band <a href="Ministry%20%28band%29">Ministry</a>.

"Coma Black" is composed using a "warped guitar" played by Ramirez and a <a href="Phaser%20%28effect%29">phaze guitar</a> played by John 5. The album ends with an interlocking group of songs: "Valentine's Day", "The Fall of Adam", "King Kill 33°" and "Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)" each end abruptly before being instantaneously followed by the intro of the proceeding track. The mellotron makes a return in the song "Valentine's Day." Guitar parts for "The Fall of Adam" were recorded in the pouring rain in an effort to extract a unique sound. John 5 purposely <a href="Scordatura%23Guitar">mistuned</a> his Gibson for the song's introduction to "produce a sweeter sound." The final song "Count to Six and Die (The Vacuum of Infinite Space Encompassing)" has piano work from Bon Harris and makes use of a <a href="string%20synthesizer">string synthesizer</a>. It concludes on a <a href="cliffhanger">cliffhanger</a>; it ends with the sound of a solitary bullet being loaded into a <a href="revolver">revolver</a> against a background of distant fireworks followed by the <a href="Chamber%20%28firearms%29">chamber</a> being spun repeatedly. Its <a href="Hammer%20%28firearms%29">hammer</a> is cocked six times, although its <a href="Trigger%20%28firearms%29">trigger</a> is pulled only five times. The result of the sixth and final chamber is left for the listener to determine.

Manson posted a four-minute video clip on the band's website on December 16, 1999, featuring clips of two previously unreleased songs. The first clip was of a rock song which later became "Disposable Teens", while the second was a rough <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demo</a> of a cover of <a href="Frankie%20Laine">Frankie Laine</a> and <a href="Jimmy%20Boyd">Jimmy Boyd</a>'s 1953 single "The Little Boy and the Old Man" (composed by <a href="Wayne%20Shanklin">Wayne Shanklin</a> a year earlier as "Little Child"; it was most popularly performed under the title "Mommy Dear" in the 1964 movie "<a href="The%20Naked%20Kiss">The Naked Kiss</a>"). As a <a href="Valentine%27s%20Day">Valentine's Day</a> gift for fans, Manson posted a download of the band's cover of Charles Manson's "Sick City", from his 1970 album "". In August, he announced an October 24 release date for the record, and posted a partial track listing containing 13 song titles, while also indicating that their website would be updated weekly. Within three weeks, the album's full track listing had been revealed, and sound files of "Burning Flag", "Cruci-Fiction in Space" and "The Love Song" had been released for free download, along with the cover of the "Holy Wood" novel.

On September 18, Manson announced that the album's US release would be postponed until November 14 (to fine-tune the final mix), and that its first single would be "Disposable Teens". The album was released on three formats on November 13 in the UK by <a href="Nothing%20Records">Nothing</a> and Interscope Records. Versions of the <a href="enhanced%20CD">enhanced CD</a> edition released in the UK featured an acoustic version of "The Nobodies" as a bonus track, while Japanese editions also included a live version of "Mechanical Animals". The album was released on <a href="Double%20album">double</a>-<a href="Gramophone%20record">LP</a> and <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a>. <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Japan</a> released a <a href="remaster">remaster</a>ed version of the album on Super High Material CD (SHM-CD) on March 23, 2013.
Artwork for the album was designed by Manson and <a href="P.%20R.%20Brown">P. R. Brown</a>. Manson began conceptualizing it as he wrote the songs, and Brown and Manson worked in tandem to realize the imagery after deciding to do the work themselves. The cover art, which portrays Manson as a crucified Christ with his jawbone torn off, is intended as a criticism of censorship and America's obsession with martyrs. It is a cropped reinterpretation of <a href="The%20Hanged%20Man%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The Hanged Man</a> <a href="Tarot">Tarot</a> card. Underneath is an obscured portion of John F. Kennedy's coroner report, displaying the words "clinical record" and "autopsy". The typeface used on the band's name is the same font used on the <a href="Walt%20Disney%20World%20Resort">Disney World</a> logo in the 1960s.

The cover was controversial; editions of the album sold at <a href="Circuit%20City">Circuit City</a> came housed in a cardboard sleeve featuring an alternative cover, while <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a> and <a href="Kmart">Kmart</a> refused to stock the album at all. A pastor in Memphis, Tennessee threatened to go on a <a href="hunger%20strike">hunger strike</a> unless the album was pulled from shelves. Manson described these actions as attempts at censorship: "The irony is that my point of the photo on the album was to show people that the crucifixion of Christ is, indeed, a violent image. My jaw is missing as a symbol of this very kind of censorship. This doesn't piss me off as much as it pleases me, because those offended by my album cover have successfully proven my point." In 2008, <a href="Gigwise">Gigwise</a> ranked it at number ten on their list of "The 50 Most Controversial Album Covers of All Time".

A set of fourteen redesigned <a href="Major%20Arcana">Major Arcana</a> tarot cards, based on the <a href="Rider-Waite%20tarot%20deck">Rider-Waite deck</a>, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in <a href="surrealism">surrealistic</a> tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: <a href="The%20Fool%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The Fool</a> is stepping off a cliff, with grainy images of <a href="Jacqueline%20Kennedy%20Onassis">Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</a> and a JFK campaign poster in the background; <a href="The%20Emperor%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The Emperor</a>, with prosthetic legs, is sitting in a wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag; <a href="Justice%20%28Tarot%20card%29">Justice</a> weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: <a href="The%20Magician%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The Magician</a>, <a href="The%20High%20Priestess">The High Priestess</a>, <a href="The%20Hierophant">The Hierophant</a>, <a href="The%20Hermit%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The Hermit</a>, <a href="Death%20%28Tarot%20card%29">Death</a>, <a href="The%20Devil%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The Devil</a>, <a href="The%20Tower%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The Tower</a>, <a href="The%20Star%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The Star</a> and <a href="The%20World%20%28Tarot%20card%29">The World</a>. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.

Three singles were released to promote the album, with "Disposable Teens" being released as its <a href="lead%20single">lead single</a>. The band made their debut appearance on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>'s "<a href="Top%20of%20the%20Pops">Top of the Pops</a>" to perform the song. Its music video was directed by <a href="Samuel%20Bayer">Samuel Bayer</a>, which debuted on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>" on October 25. The single was released in the UK on November 6, and featured several B-sides, including covers of Lennon's "<a href="Working%20Class%20Hero">Working Class Hero</a>" and <a href="The%20Doors">The Doors</a>' "<a href="Five%20to%20One">Five to One</a>", as well as original tracks "Diamonds & Pollen" and "<a href="Astonishing%20Panorama%20of%20the%20Endtimes">Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes</a>". The latter had been released the previous year on the <a href="Celebrity%20Deathmatch%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack</a> to "<a href="Celebrity%20Deathmatch">Celebrity Deathmatch</a>". The band performed "Disposable Teens" on the "<a href="MTV%20New%20Year%27s">MTV New Year's</a>" Eve celebration in 2000, along with a cover of <a href="Cheap%20Trick">Cheap Trick</a>'s "<a href="Surrender%20%28Cheap%20Trick%20song%29">Surrender</a>". It was also performed at the <a href="American%20Music%20Awards%20of%202001">2001 "American Music Awards"</a>.

From November 1, the UK division of Interscope held a contest to promote the album. The contest invited fans to log onto the band's website daily to pick up a series of coded clues which led to a hidden message. Fans who solved the riddle received an exclusive download, and were entered into a drawing for a one-week trip for two to meet the band in Hollywood. On November 14, the band took a break from the Guns, God and Government Tour to celebrate the album's US release date with a brief, invitation-only acoustic set at the Saci nightclub in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Tickets for the show were given out via their website, in radio contests, and to the first 100 album buyers at <a href="Tower%20Records%20%28music%20retailer%29">Tower Records</a> on Broadway in New York. The set consisted of four songs, including their cover "<a href="Suicide%20Is%20Painless">Suicide Is Painless</a>" – the theme of the film (and <a href="M%2AA%2AS%2AH%20%28TV%20series%29">TV series</a>) "<a href="MASH%20%28film%29">M*A*S*H</a>" – which they had recently contributed to the of "". The following day, the vocalist appeared on "Total Request Live" in a segment entitled "Mothers Against Marilyn Manson".

"The Fight Song" was released as the album's second single on February 19, 2001 in the UK. A <a href="remix">remix</a> of the song by <a href="Joey%20Jordison">Joey Jordison</a> of <a href="Slipknot%20%28band%29">Slipknot</a> appeared as its B-side. Its music video was directed by Manson and <a href="W.I.Z.">W.I.Z.</a> and sparked controversy for its violent depiction of an <a href="American%20football">American football</a> game between <a href="Jock%20%28athlete%29">jock</a>s and <a href="Goth%20subculture">goths</a>, with "<a href="NME">NME</a>" accusing it of being exploitative of the Columbine tragedy. Manson dismissed the claims as hype, and said: "I'm trying to show that sports as well as music can be seen as violent, so I chose a traditional black vs white, good vs evil theme for the video." Manson appeared on an April 2001 episode of "<a href="The%20O%27Reilly%20Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a>", where he once again denied that the band's music was responsible for Columbine. <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28political%20commentator%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> argued that "disturbed kids" without direction from responsible parents could misinterpret the message of his music as endorsing the belief that "when I'm dead [then] everybody's going to know me." Manson responded:

In mid-2001, <a href="Universal%20Music%20Group">Universal Music Group</a> was criticized for airing commercials promoting the album during episodes of "Total Request Live". Manson suspected that former <a href="2000%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">Democratic vice-presidential candidate</a> <a href="Joseph%20Lieberman">Joseph Lieberman</a> played a role in the criticism. Lieberman and <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> had recently introduced the Media Marketing Accountability Act of 2001 before the <a href="107th%20United%20States%20Congress">107th United States Congress</a>. This legislation proposed to ban the entertainment-industry from marketing suspected violent or explicit material to minors.

Manson announced prior to the release of "The Fight Song" that "The Nobodies" would be issued as the album's third single, whilst indicating a desire to film its video in Russia because "the atmosphere, the desolation, the coldness and the architecture would really suit the song." Another early plan was to incorporate the MTV series "<a href="Jackass%20%28TV%20series%29">Jackass</a>", as the song was included in the show's soundtrack. The idea was later abandoned, however, when the show drew the ire of Lieberman. The music video was directed by <a href="Paul%20Fedor%20%28director%29">Paul Fedor</a> and premiered on MTV in June, and the single was released in the UK on September 3. Its release was timed to coincide with the band's appearance at the <a href="Reading%20Festival">Reading Festival</a>, and was accompanied by another competition on the band's website—the winner was awarded two full-weekend passes to the festival, as well as unrestricted backstage access and a private sleeping area. A remix of the song later appeared in the 2001 <a href="Johnny%20Depp">Johnny Depp</a> film "<a href="From%20Hell%20%28film%29">From Hell</a>".

The album was promoted by the worldwide Guns, God and Government Tour, which began in North America in 3–6,000-capacity venues on October 27, 2000 at the <a href="Orpheum%20Theatre%20%28Minneapolis%29">Orpheum Theatre</a> in <a href="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a>. Typically for the band, the concerts were highly theatrical. The tour's imagery was mainly derived from the concept and themes found on the album; its logo was a rifle, with handguns arranged to resemble the Christian cross. Sets were designed with <a href="Communism">communist</a>, religious and "celebritarian" imagery. Manson had a number of costume changes during each show: a bishop's <a href="dalmatic">dalmatic</a> and <a href="mitre">mitre</a> (often confused with <a href="Papal%20regalia%20and%20insignia">papal regalia</a>); a costume made from animals (including <a href="epaulette">epaulette</a>s made from a horse's tail and a shirt made from skinned goat heads and ostrich spines); his signature black leather <a href="bondage%20corset">corset</a>, <a href="g-string">g-string</a> and <a href="Garter%20%28stockings%29">garter stockings</a>; an elaborate <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> <a href="legionary">legionary</a>-style imperial <a href="Galea%20%28helmet%29">galea</a>; an <a href="Uniforms%20and%20insignia%20of%20the%20Schutzstaffel">Allgemeine SS-style</a> peaked police cap; a black-and-white fur coat, and a large conical skirt which lifted him in the air.

The <a href="Ozzfest">Ozzfest</a> leg of the tour marked the band's first performance in <a href="Denver%2C%20Colorado">Denver, Colorado</a> (on June 22, 2001 at <a href="Mile%20High%20Stadium">Mile High Stadium</a>) after the Columbine High School massacre in Littleton. After initially canceling due to a scheduling conflict, the band changed their plans to play the Denver date. The group's decision met resistance from conservative groups; Manson received death threats and demands to cancel the band's performance. A group of church leaders, businesses and families related to Columbine formed an <a href="ad%20hoc">ad hoc</a> organization opposing the show. Citizens for Peace and Respect, which was supported by <a href="Governor%20of%20Colorado">Colorado governor</a> <a href="Bill%20Owens%20%28Colorado%20politician%29">Bill Owens</a> and <a href="Colorado%20House%20of%20Representatives">representative</a> <a href="Tom%20Tancredo">Tom Tancredo</a>, claimed on their website that the band "promotes hate, violence, death, suicide, drug use, and the attitudes and actions of the Columbine killers". In response, Manson issued a statement:

Two films of the concert tour were made. The "<a href="Guns%2C%20God%20and%20Government">Guns, God and Government</a>" DVD was released on October 29, 2002 by <a href="Eagle%20Rock%20Entertainment">Eagle Rock Entertainment</a>, and featured live footage taken from several different performances in Los Angeles, Russia, Japan, and throughout Europe. It also included a 30-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, "The Death Parade", with guest appearances from <a href="Ozzy%20Osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> and <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a>. This was followed seven years later by a <a href="Blu-ray">Blu-ray</a> titled "Guns, God and Government – Live in L.A." Released by Eagle Rock on November 17, 2009, it depicts the band's entire sixteen-song set from their January 13, 2001 performance at the <a href="Grand%20Olympic%20Auditorium">Grand Olympic Auditorium</a>—the final headlining show of the North American leg of the tour.

"Holy Wood" received generally positive reviews from music critics at the time of its release. At <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, which assigns a <a href="Standard%20score">normalized</a> rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an <a href="weighted%20mean">average</a> score of 72 based on 14 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews", and is the 88th best-reviewed album of the year. The record was praised by several publications as being the band's finest work: <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> described it as their definitive record; a writer for "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" called it their "most potent effort yet", and April Long of "<a href="NME">NME</a>" said it was "by far the best thing Manson has ever set his warped mind to, [it] ultimately inspires something far more potent than fear or hatred—respect."

The band received acclaim for the quality of their songwriting. Daniel Durchholz of <a href="Wall%20of%20Sound%20%28website%29">Wall of Sound</a> called "Holy Wood" their most ambitious and musically accomplished record to date. "<a href="LA%20Weekly">LA Weekly</a>" said that "almost all [of the songs] contain a double-take chord change or a textural overdose or a mind-blowing bridge, and they'll be terroristic in concert." "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>" praised the band for their inventive <a href="Arrangement">musical arrangements</a>, and said that ""Holy Wood" is a far better record than many would have dared to expect." Drowned in Sound rated the album 10 out of 10 and praised the band's performance, saying that they "play tighter than [ever] before (looking at the credits show it to be much more of a team effort) ... and, musically, it has a lot more variation and scope than the <a href="Limp%20Bizkit">Limp Bizkit</a>s of the world." The band's vocalist was also applauded for his lyricism; Barry Walters of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" commended him for "addressing real-life issues with a theatrical verve and genuine vitriol that no other mainstream act can match." "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine was similarly impressed, calling Manson one of the most skilled lyricists of his generation. "<a href="Revolver%20%28magazine%29">Revolver</a>" editor Christopher Scapelliti compared his lyrics to those of John Lennon's, writing: "What comes across loudest on the album is not the music, but the sense of injury expressed in Manson's lyrics. Like "<a href="John%20Lennon/Plastic%20Ono%20Band">Plastic Ono Band</a>", "Holy Wood" screams with a primal fury that's evident even in its quietest moments."

The album also received some mixed reviews. Several publications criticized its length, as well as the band for abandoning the glam rock-influenced production of "Mechanical Animals". <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> argued that the album was too long, and claimed it would have been a more consistent record if subject matter was addressed literally, instead of through a 'concept album' format. Joshua Klein of "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" rated "Holy Wood" a B−, but was overall critical of the lack of glam rock-influenced songs on the album. <a href="Robert%20Hilburn">Robert Hilburn</a>, in a review for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", was also disappointed that the album did not live up to "the promise of "Mechanical Animals"". He viewed the musical cross-pollination of "Antichrist Superstar" and "Mechanical Animals" as confusion on the band's part as to which of the two albums appealed most to casual listeners.

The album appeared in numerous publication's lists of best albums of 2000. It appeared at number nine on "<a href="Kerrang%21">Kerrang!</a>"s list of albums of the year, and went on to rate it the 11th best album of the 2000–2009 decade, while "<a href="NME">NME</a>" ranked it at number 34 in their critic's pick of the 50 best albums of 2000 in their "Decade in Music" series. German magazine "Musik Express/Sounds" listed the album at number 30 in their critics' top 50, and at number nine in the popular poll of their "Albums of 2000" list. The French edition of British magazine "<a href="Rock%20Sound">Rock Sound</a>" ranked "Holy Wood" 15th in their "Le choix de la rédaction" (editors choice) and 5th in "Le choix des lecteurs" (readers choice) of their 2000 "Albums de l'année" (albums of the year). "<a href="Record%20Collector">Record Collector</a>" also included it on their "Best of 2000" list. It went on to win the "Best Album" accolade at the 2001 <a href="Kerrang%21%20Awards">"Kerrang!" Awards</a>.

Retrospective commentary on the album has been highly positive. In November 2010, "Kerrang!" published a tenth-anniversary commemorative issue dedicated to "Holy Wood" titled "Screaming For Vengeance", calling it "Manson's finest hour". In 2014, "<a href="Metal%20Hammer">Metal Hammer</a>" identified the album as a <a href="modern%20classic">modern classic</a>, calling it the band's "creative <a href="zenith">zenith</a>". Manson said in a June 2015 <a href="Reddit%20AMA">Reddit AMA</a> that he considered the record to be his best work, and, that same month, "NME" referred to it as the band's best album. A 2016 feature in "<a href="Houston%20Press">Houston Press</a>" called "Holy Wood" "the album that really cemented the band as more than just <a href="shock%20rock">shock-rockers</a>, but true musical mavericks with an intelligent perspective on social issues." "Metal Hammer" referred to the record as "perfect", saying: "Manson has yet to better "Holy Wood" and that's fine—nobody's really bettered it. The flow of the record, the delivery of its concept, the clarity with which it strikes its opponents. A gargantuan artistic feat that will go down in history as Manson's defining statement."

Prior to the record's release, several critics and retailers openly questioned whether the band still had significant commercial appeal with mainstream consumers, with <a href="rap%20rock">rap rock</a> emerging as the predominant rock genre of the early 2000s. Furthermore, according to "Metal Hammer", "By the turn of the century, Manson was no longer America's demon dog. <a href="White%20trash">White trash</a> superstar Eminem had clocked his position and supplanted him." A <a href="clean%20version">clean version</a> of the album was never manufactured. This resulted in "Holy Wood" being banned from sale at major retailers such as Walmart and Kmart, who enforce a strict policy on not stocking albums labeled with a <a href="Parental%20Advisory">Parental Advisory</a> sticker. <a href="Best%20Buy">Best Buy</a>'s sales projections estimated its first-week sales at about 150,000 units nationally, significantly less than the 223,000 copies sold by "Mechanical Animals" during its first week.

"Holy Wood" debuted and peaked at number 13 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> with first-week sales of 117,279—an initial commercial disappointment. It spent 13 consecutive weeks on the chart before dropping off – far short of the 52 and 33 weeks "Antichrist Superstar" and "Mechanical Animals" spent on the chart, respectively – making it the shortest-charting full-length LP by the band until "<a href="The%20High%20End%20of%20Low">The High End of Low</a>" (2009). It took over two years to be certified gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a> (in March 2003), denoting shipments in excess of 500,000 units. The album sold over 573,000 copies in the US by 2010, according to <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a>. Manson attributed its lack of commercial appeal to the musical climate of the time, and argued that, at the height of the band's popularity, their US album sales peaked between one and two million units, so "it's not such a disaster as if we were coming down from seven or eight million records." He also said that the drop in US sales was off-set by increasing international success.

The record reached the top 20 of numerous international markets, including Canada, where it peaked at number 13 and was certified gold by the <a href="Canadian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">CRIA</a> for shipments of over 50,000 units. The record was more successful in <a href="continental%20Europe">continental Europe</a> than preceding albums, peaking at number nine on "Billboard"s <a href="European%20Top%20100%20Albums">Eurochart</a>. It entered the top 10 of the <a href="Record%20chart">national charts</a> in Austria, Italy, and Sweden, and the top 20 in a further six countries: France, Norway, Poland, and Spain. It debuted at number 11 on the <a href="German%20Albums%20Chart">German Albums Chart</a> and spent over five months on the chart—their second-longest chart run there, behind "<a href="The%20Golden%20Age%20of%20Grotesque">The Golden Age of Grotesque</a>" (2003). It also reached the top 20 in Switzerland, where it was certified gold by the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20the%20Phonographic%20Industry">IFPI</a> almost five years after its release for shipments in excess of 25,000 units. Similarly, despite peaking at number 23 and spending just four weeks on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, it would be certified gold by the <a href="British%20Phonographic%20Industry">BPI</a> in July 2013 for sales in excess of 100,000 copies.

In <a href="Australasia">Australasia</a>, "Holy Wood" peaked at number eight on the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">Australian Albums Chart</a>, and reached the top twenty in New Zealand, peaking at number 18. The album also peaked at number 13 on the Japanese <a href="Oricon">Oricon</a> chart, where it was certified gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20Japan">Recording Industry Association of Japan</a> for shipments of over 100,000 units.

Humpback whale

The humpback whale ("Megaptera novaeangliae") is a species of <a href="baleen%20whale">baleen</a> <a href="whale">whale</a>. One of the larger <a href="rorqual">rorqual</a> species, adults range in length from and weigh around . The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long <a href="pectoral%20fins">pectoral fins</a> and a knobbly head. It is known for <a href="Whale%20surfacing%20behaviour">breaching</a> and other distinctive <a href="Cetacean%20surfacing%20behaviour">surface behaviors</a>, making it popular with <a href="whale%20watching">whale watchers</a>. Males produce a complex <a href="Whale%20sound">song</a> lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat for hours at a time. Its purpose is not clear, though it may have a role in mating.

Found in <a href="ocean">ocean</a>s and <a href="sea">sea</a>s around the world, humpback whales typically <a href="animal%20migration">migrate</a> up to each year. They feed in <a href="Polar%20region">polar</a> waters, and migrate to <a href="tropics">tropical</a> or <a href="subtropical">subtropical</a> waters to breed and give birth, <a href="fasting">fasting</a> and living off their <a href="Blubber">fat</a> reserves. Their diet consists mostly of <a href="krill">krill</a> and small <a href="fish">fish</a>. Humpbacks have a diverse repertoire of feeding methods, including the <a href="Bubble%20net%20feeding">bubble net</a> technique.

Like other large whales, the humpback was a target for the <a href="whaling">whaling</a> industry. Once hunted to the brink of <a href="extinction">extinction</a>, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered to some 80,000 animals worldwide, entanglement in <a href="fishing%20net">fishing gear</a>, collisions with ships and <a href="noise%20pollution">noise pollution</a> continue to impact on the species.

Humpback whales are <a href="rorqual">rorqual</a>s, members of the <a href="Balaenopteridae">Balaenopteridae</a> <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> that includes the <a href="blue%20whale">blue</a>, <a href="fin%20whale">fin</a>, <a href="Bryde%27s%20whale">Bryde's</a>, <a href="sei%20whale">sei</a> and <a href="minke%20whale">minke whale</a>s. The rorquals are believed to have diverged from the other families of the suborder <a href="Mysticeti">Mysticeti</a> as long ago as the middle <a href="Miocene">Miocene</a> era. However, it is not known when the members of these families diverged from each other.

Though clearly related to the giant whales of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Balaenoptera">Balaenoptera</a>", the humpback is the sole member of its genus. Recent <a href="DNA%20sequencing">DNA sequencing</a> has indicated the humpback is actually more closely related to certain rorquals, particularly the fin whale ("B. physalus") and possibly the <a href="gray%20whale">gray</a> ("Eschrichtius robustus"), than it is to others such as the minke.

The humpback was first identified as "baleine de la Nouvelle Angleterre" by <a href="Mathurin%20Jacques%20Brisson">Mathurin Jacques Brisson</a> in his "Regnum Animale" of 1756. In 1781, <a href="Georg%20Heinrich%20Borowski">Georg Heinrich Borowski</a> described the species, converting Brisson's name to its <a href="Latin">Latin</a> equivalent, "Balaena novaeangliae". In 1804, <a href="Bernard%20Germain%20de%20Lac%C3%A9p%C3%A8de">Lacépède</a> shifted the humpback from the family <a href="Balaenidae">Balaenidae</a>, renaming it "B. jubartes". In 1846, <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a> created the genus "Megaptera", classifying the humpback as "Megaptera longipinna", but in 1932, <a href="Remington%20Kellogg">Remington Kellogg</a> reverted the species names to use Borowski's "novaeangliae". The common name is derived from the curving of their backs when diving. The generic name "Megaptera" from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Greek</a> "mega-"/μεγα- "giant" and "ptera"/πτερα "wing", refers to their large front flippers. The specific name means "New Englander" and was probably given by Brisson due to regular sightings of humpbacks off the coast of <a href="New%20England">New England</a>.

Genetic research in mid-2014 by the <a href="British%20Antarctic%20Survey">British Antarctic Survey</a> confirmed that the separate populations in the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Southern Oceans are more distinct than previously thought. Some biologists believe that these should be regarded as separate subspecies and that they are evolving independently.

Humpbacks can easily be identified by their stocky body, obvious hump, black <a href="Dorsum%20%28biology%29">dorsal</a> coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw are covered with knobs called <a href="tubercle%20%28anatomy%29">tubercles</a>, which are <a href="hair%20follicle">hair follicle</a>s and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.

Humpbacks have 270 to 400 darkly colored <a href="baleen">baleen</a> plates on each side of their mouths. The plates measure from in the front to about in the back, behind the hinge.

<a href="Ventral">Ventral</a> grooves run from the lower jaw to the <a href="Navel">umbilicus</a>, about halfway along the underside of the body. These grooves are less numerous (usually 14–22) than in other rorquals, but are fairly wide.

The female has a hemispherical lobe about in diameter in her genital region. This visually distinguishes males and females. The male's penis usually remains hidden in the genital slit.

Fully grown males average . Females are slightly larger at ; one large recorded specimen was long and had pectoral fins measuring each. The largest humpback on record, according to whaling records, was a female killed in the Caribbean; she was long with a weight of , although the reliability of these extremely atypical data is impossible to confirm. The largest measured by the scientists of the Discovery Committee were a female 14.9 m (49 ft) and a male 14.75 m (48.5 ft), although this was out of a sample size of only 63 whales. Body mass typically is in the range of , with large specimens weighing over .

Newborn calves are roughly the length of their mother's head. At birth, calves measure at . They nurse for about six months, then mix nursing and independent feeding for possibly six months more. Humpback milk is 50% fat and pink in color.

Females reach sexual maturity at age five, achieving full adult size a little later. Males reach sexual maturity around seven years of age.

The long black and white tail fin can be up to a third of body length. Several hypotheses attempt to explain the humpback's pectoral fins, which are proportionally the longest fins of any <a href="cetacean">cetacean</a>. The higher maneuverability afforded by long fins and the usefulness of the increased surface area for temperature control when migrating between warm and cold climates possibly supported this adaptation.

The varying patterns on the tail flukes distinguish individual animals. A study using data from 1973 to 1998 on whales in the North Atlantic gave researchers detailed information on gestation times, growth rates and calving periods, as well as allowing more accurate population predictions by simulating the <a href="mark-release-recapture">mark-release-recapture</a> technique. A photographic catalogue of all known North Atlantic whales was developed over this period and is maintained by <a href="College%20of%20the%20Atlantic">College of the Atlantic</a>. Similar photographic identification projects operate around the world.

The lifespan of rorquals ranges from 45 to 100 years.

The humpback social structure is loose-knit. Typically, individuals live alone or in small, transient groups that disband after a few hours. Groups may stay together longer in summer to forage and feed cooperatively. Longer-term relationships between pairs or small groups, lasting months or even years, have rarely been observed. Some females possibly retain bonds created via cooperative feeding for a lifetime. Humpback whales often leap out of the water, a behaviour known as "breaching", and slap the water with their fins or tails

<a href="Courtship">Courtship</a> rituals take place during the winter months, following migration toward the <a href="equator">equator</a> from summer feeding grounds closer to the <a href="South%20pole">poles</a>. Competition is usually fierce. Unrelated males, dubbed escorts, frequently trail females, as well as cow-calf pairs. Males gather into "competitive groups" around a female and fight for the right to mate with her. Group size ebbs and flows as unsuccessful males retreat and others arrive. Behaviors include breaching, <a href="spyhopping">spyhopping</a>, <a href="Cetacean%20surfacing%20behaviour">lob-tailing</a>, <a href="Cetacean%20surfacing%20behaviour">tail-slapping</a>, <a href="Cetacean%20surfacing%20behaviour">pectoral fin-slapping</a>, <a href="Cetacean%20surfacing%20behaviour">peduncle throws</a>, charging and parrying.

Whale song is thought to have an important role in mate selection; however, they may also be used between males to establish dominance. <a href="Polyandry%20in%20nature">Polyandry</a> has been observed in humpback whales, with the females having multiple male partners throughout their lifespan.

Females typically breed every two or three years. The gestation period is 11.5 months. The peak months for birth are January, February (Northern Hemisphere), July and August (Southern Hemisphere). Females wait for one to two years before breeding again. Recent research on <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> reveals that groups living in proximity to each other may represent distinct breeding pools. Humpback whale births have been rarely observed. One birth witnessed off Madagascar occurred within four minutes. Humpback whales have been occasionally known to hybridize with other rorquals, as there is a well-documented report of a humpback-<a href="blue%20whale">blue whale</a> hybrid in the South Pacific.

Humpbacks are a friendly species that interact with other cetacean species such as <a href="bottlenose%20dolphin">bottlenose dolphin</a>s. <a href="Right%20whale">Right whale</a>s interact with humpbacks. These behaviors have been recorded in all oceans. Records of humpback and <a href="southern%20right%20whale">southern right whale</a>s demonstrating what were interpreted to be mating behaviors have been documented off the <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a> and Brazilian coasts. Humpback whales appear in mixed groups with other species, such as the blue, fin, minke, gray and sperm whales. Interaction with gray, fin, and right whales have been observed. Teams of researchers observed a male humpback whale singing an unknown type of song and approaching a fin whale at <a href="Rarotonga">Rarotonga</a> in 2014. One individual was observed playing with a <a href="bottlenose%20dolphin">bottlenose dolphin</a> in <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands%20Humpback%20Whale%20National%20Marine%20Sanctuary">Hawaiian waters</a>. Recently, incidents of humpback whales protecting other species of animals such as seals and other whales from <a href="killer%20whales">killer whales</a> has been documented and filmed. Studies of such incidents indicate that the phenomenon is species-wide and global, with incidents being recorded at various locations across the world. In September 2017 in Rarotonga, the Cook Islands, two adult humpback whales were observed protecting snorkeler and whale biologist Nan Hauser from a <a href="tiger%20shark">tiger shark</a>, with one whale pushing the woman away from the shark while the other used its tail to block the predator's advances. This may be the first recorded incidence of humpback whales acting protectively over a human.

 Both male and female humpback whales vocalize, but only males produce the long, loud, complex "song" for which the species is famous. Each song consists of several sounds in a low <a href="register%20%28music%29">register</a>, varying in <a href="amplitude">amplitude</a> and <a href="frequency">frequency</a> and typically lasting from 10 to 20 minutes. Individuals may sing continuously for more than 24 hours. <a href="Cetacean">Cetacean</a>s have no vocal cords, instead, they produce sound via a larynx like structure found in the throat, the mechanism of which has not as of yet been clearly identified. Whales do not have to exhale to produce sound.

Whales within a large area sing a single song. All North Atlantic humpbacks sing the same song, while those of the North Pacific sing a different song. Each population's song changes slowly over a period of years without repeating.

Scientists are unsure of the purpose of whale songs. Only males sing, suggesting one purpose is to attract females. However, many of the whales observed to approach a singer are other males, often resulting in conflict. Singing may, therefore, be a challenge to other males. Some scientists have hypothesized the song may serve an <a href="animal%20echolocation">echolocative</a> function. During the feeding season, humpbacks make unrelated vocalizations for herding fish into their <a href="bubble%20net">bubble net</a>s.

Humpback whales make other sounds to communicate, such as grunts, groans, snorts and barks.

Whales are air-breathing mammals who must surface to get the air they need. The stubby <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a> is visible soon after the <a href="Blowhole%20%28biology%29">blow</a> (exhalation) when the whale surfaces, but disappears by the time the flukes emerge. Humpbacks have a , heart-shaped to bushy blow through the blowholes.

They do not generally sleep at the surface, but they must continue to breathe. Possibly only half of their brain sleeps at one time, with one half managing the surface-blow-dive process without awakening the other half.

Migratory patterns and social interactions were explored in the 1960s and by further studies in 1971. Calambokidis et al. provided the "first quantitative assessment of the migratory structure of humpback whales in the entire North Pacific basin."

Humpbacks inhabit all major oceans, in a wide band running from the Antarctic ice edge to <a href="77th%20parallel%20north">77° N</a> latitude. The four global populations are North Pacific, Atlantic, Southern Ocean and Indian Ocean populations. These populations are distinct. Although the species has cosmopolitan distribution and is usually not considered to cross the equator line, seasonal observations at <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a> suggest possible interactions among populations from both hemispheres. Aside from the Arabian Sea group, year-round presences have been confirmed among British and Norwegian waters. Parts of wintering grounds around the globe have been poorly studied or being undetected, such as around <a href="Pitcairn%20Islands">Pitcairn Islands</a>, <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a> (e.g. <a href="Marpi%20Reef">Marpi</a> and CK Reefs vicinity to <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a> ), <a href="Dait%C5%8D%20Islands">Daitō Islands</a>, <a href="Volcano%20Islands">Volcano Islands</a>, <a href="Pasaleng%20Bay">Pasaleng Bay</a>, <a href="Trindade%20and%20Martin%20Vaz">Trindade and Martin Vaz</a>, <a href="Mauritius">Mauritius</a>, <a href="Aldabra">Aldabra</a>, and so on.

Whales were once uncommon in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> and the <a href="Baltic%20Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, but have increased their presence in both waters as global populations have recovered. Recent increases within the Mediterranean basin, including re-sightings, indicate that more whales may migrate into the inland sea in the future, not only for wintering but also for feeding. Humpbacks are also showing signs of re-expanding into former ranges, such as <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Skagerrak">Skagerrak</a> and <a href="Kattegat">Kattegat</a>, as well as <a href="Scandinavia">Scandinavia</a>n fjords such as <a href="Kv%C3%A6nangen%20%28fjord%29">Kvænangen</a>, where they had not been observed for decades.

In the North Atlantic, feeding areas range from Scandinavia to New England. Breeding occurs in the Caribbean and <a href="Cape%20Verde">Cape Verde</a>. In the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, whales may breed off Brazil, as well the coasts of central, southern and southeastern Africa (including Madagascar). Whale visits into <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> have been infrequent, but occurred in the gulf historically. In the South Atlantic, <a href="Whales%20in%20Ghanaian%20waters">about 10% of world population of the species possibly migrate to the Gulf of Guinea</a>. Comparison of songs between those at <a href="Cape%20Lopez">Cape Lopez</a> and <a href="Abrolhos%20Archipelago">Abrolhos Archipelago</a> indicate that trans-Atlantic mixings between western and southeastern populations occur.

A large population spreads across the <a href="Hawaiian%20Islands">Hawaiian Islands</a> every winter, ranging from the <a href="Hawaii%20%28island%29">island of Hawaii</a> in the south to <a href="Kure%20Atoll">Kure Atoll</a> in the north. These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the Bering Sea. Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a <a href="Dominance%20%28ecology%29">dominance</a> over <a href="North%20Pacific%20right%20whale">North Pacific right whale</a>s, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.

A 2007 study identified seven individuals then wintering off the Pacific coast of <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a> as having traveled from the Antarctic—around . Identified by their unique tail patterns, these animals made the longest documented mammalian migration. In Australia, two main migratory populations were identified, off the west and east coasts. These two populations are distinct, with only a few females in each generation crossing between the two groups.

In <a href="Panama">Panama</a> and Costa Rica, humpback whales come from both the Southern Hemisphere (July–October with over 2,000 whales) and the Northern Hemisphere (December–March numbering about 300). South Pacific populations migrating off mainland <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>, <a href="Kermadec%20Islands">Kermadec Islands</a>, and <a href="Tasmania">Tasmania</a> are increasing, but less rapidly than in <a href="Australia">Australia</a>n waters because of illegal whaling by the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> in the 1970s.

Some recolonizing habitats are confirmed, especially in the North and South Atlantic (e.g. English and Irish coasts, <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>) to coasts in the north such as the <a href="North%20Sea">North Sea</a> and <a href="Wadden%20Sea">Wadden Sea</a>, where the first confirmed sighting since 1755 was made in 2003, South Pacific (e.g. New Zealand coasts and Niue), pelagic islands of Chile such as <a href="Isla%20Salas%20y%20G%C3%B3mez">Isla Salas y Gómez</a> and <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>, where possibilities of undocumented wintering grounds have been considered, southern <a href="fiord">fiord</a>s of Chile and Peru (e.g. <a href="Gulf%20of%20Penas">Gulf of Penas</a>, <a href="Strait%20of%20Magellan">Strait of Magellan</a>, <a href="Beagle%20Channel">Beagle Channel</a>) and in Asia. Areas in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> such as the <a href="Babuyan%20Islands">Babuyan Islands</a>, <a href="Cagayan">Cagayan</a> (the first modern mortality of the species in the nation was in 2007), <a href="Calayan%2C%20Cagayan">Calayan</a> and <a href="Pasaleng%20Bay">Pasaleng Bay</a>, the <a href="Ryukyu%20Islands">Ryukyu Islands</a>, the <a href="Volcano%20Islands">Volcano Islands</a> in Japan and the <a href="Northern%20Mariana%20Islands">Northern Mariana Islands</a> recently again became stable/growing wintering grounds while the <a href="Marshall%20Islands">Marshall Islands</a>, <a href="Vietnam">Vietnam</a>ese, <a href="Taiwan">Taiwan</a>ese and <a href="China">Chinese</a> coasts show slow or no obvious recovery.

Whales again migrate off Japanese archipelagos and into the <a href="Sea%20of%20Japan">Sea of Japan</a>. Connections between these stocks and whales seen in the <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>, on <a href="Kamchatka">Kamchatka</a> coasts and around the <a href="Commander%20Islands">Commander Islands</a> have been studied. Historical wintering distributions could have been much wider and more southerly distributed, as whales were seen in areas along the <a href="Batanes">Batanes</a>, <a href="Sulu%20Sea">Sulu</a> and <a href="Celebes%20Sea">Celebes Sea</a>s including off <a href="Palawan">Palawan</a>, <a href="Luzon">Luzon</a>, <a href="Malaysia">Malaysia</a> and <a href="Mindanao">Mindanao</a>, with higher densities around today's <a href="Cape%20Eluanbi">Cape Eluanbi</a> and <a href="Kenting%20National%20Park">Kenting National Park</a>. Unconfirmed sightings have been reported near <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a> in modern times. The first confirmation in modern Taiwan was of a pair off <a href="Hualien%20City">Hualien</a> in 1994, followed by a successful escape from entanglement off <a href="Taitung%20City">Taitung</a> in 1999, and continuous sightings around <a href="Orchid%20Island">Orchid Island</a> in 2000. Few/none regularly migrate into Kenting National Park. In addition, despite sightings reported almost annually off <a href="Green%20Island%2C%20Taiwan">Green</a> and Orchid Islands, relatively short stays in these waters indicate recoveries as winter foraging has not occurred. Sightings, including of a cow-calf pair, have occurred along the east coast of Taiwan. Around Hong Kong, two documented sightings were recorded in 2009 and in 2016. One of the first documented sightings within the <a href="Yellow%20Sea">Yellow Sea</a> was of a group of 3 or 4 individuals, including a cow/calf pair in <a href="Changhai%20County">Changhai County</a> in October, 2015.

Since November 2015, whales gather around <a href="Hachij%C5%8D-jima">Hachijō-jima</a>, far north from the known breeding areas in the Bonin Islands. All breeding activities except for giving births had been confirmed as of January, 2016. That makes Hachijo-jima the northernmost breeding ground in the world, north of breeding grounds such as <a href="Amami%20%C5%8Cshima">Amami Ōshima</a>, <a href="Midway%20Island">Midway Island</a>, and <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a>.

A non-migratory population in the <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a> remains there year-round. More typical annual migrations cover up to , making it one of the most-traveled mammalian species. Genetic studies and visual surveys indicate that the Arabian group is the most isolated of all humpback groups and is the most endangered, numbering possibly fewer than 100 animals. Within Arabian Sea, <a href="Masirah%20Island">Masirah Island</a> and Gulf of Masirah, <a href="Dhofar%20Governorate">Halaniyat Islands</a> and <a href="Khuriya%20Muriya%20Islands">Kuria Muria Bay</a> are hot spots for the species.

Whales were historically common in continental and marginal waters such as <a href="Shalim%20and%20the%20Hallaniyat%20Islands">Hallaniyat Islands</a>, along Indian coasts, <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a> and <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aden">Gulf of Aden</a> and recent migrations into the gulf including by cow-calf pairs. It is unknown whether whales seen in the <a href="Red%20Sea">Red Sea</a> originate in this population, however sightings increased since in 2006 even in the northern part of the sea such as in <a href="Gulf%20of%20Aqaba">Gulf of Aqaba</a>. Individuals may reach the <a href="Maldives">Maldives</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, or further east. Humpbacks have been considered rather vagrant into Persian Gulf, however new studies indicate more regular presences can be expected.

Origins of whales occurring at Maldives are not clear either from Arabian or south Pacific populations, and overlaps are possible.

Humpbacks feed primarily in summer and live off fat reserves during winter. They feed only rarely and opportunistically in their wintering waters. The humpback is an energetic hunter, taking <a href="krill">krill</a> and small schooling fish such as juvenile <a href="Atlantic%20salmon">Atlantic</a> and <a href="Pacific%20salmon">Pacific salmon</a>, <a href="Atlantic%20herring">herring</a>, <a href="capelin">capelin</a> and <a href="Sand%20lance">American sand lance</a>, as well as <a href="Atlantic%20mackerel">Atlantic mackerel</a>, <a href="Pollachius%20virens">pollock</a> and <a href="haddock">haddock</a> in the North Atlantic. They have been documented opportunistically feeding near fish hatcheries in Southeast Alaska, feasting on salmon fry released from the hatcheries. Krill and <a href="copepod">copepod</a>s are prey species in Australian and Antarctic waters. Humpbacks hunt by direct attack or by stunning prey by hitting the water with pectoral fins or flukes.

The humpback has the most diverse hunting repertoire of all <a href="baleen%20whale">baleen whale</a>s. Its most inventive technique is known as bubble net feeding; a group of whales swims in a shrinking circle blowing bubbles below a school of prey. The shrinking ring of bubbles encircles the school and confines it in an ever-smaller cylinder. This ring can begin near in diameter and involve the cooperation of a dozen animals. Using a <a href="crittercam">crittercam</a> attached to a whale's back, researchers found that some whales blow the bubbles, some dive deeper to drive fish toward the surface and others herd prey into the net by vocalizing.The whales then suddenly swim upward through the "net", mouths agape, swallowing thousands of fish in one gulp. The water is then squeezed out through <a href="baleen">baleen plates</a> in the mouth to filter out the prey.

So-called lobtail feeding was observed in the North Atlantic. This technique involves the whale slapping the surface of the ocean with its tail between one and four times before creating the bubble net. Using <a href="network-based%20diffusion%20analysis">network-based diffusion analysis</a>, the study authors argued that these whales learned the behavior from other whales in the group over a period of 27 years in response to a change in the primary form of prey.

Visible scars indicate that <a href="killer%20whale">killer whale</a>s (orcas) can prey upon juvenile humpbacks, though until recently hunting had never been witnessed and attacks were assumed to be superficial in nature. However, a 2014 study off Western Australia observed that when available in large numbers, young humpbacks can be attacked and sometimes killed by orcas. Moreover, mothers and (possibly related) adults escort <a href="neonate">neonate</a>s to deter such predation. The suggestion is that when humpbacks suffered near-extinction during the whaling era, orcas turned to other prey, but are now resuming their former practice. There is evidence that humpback whales will defend against or attack killer whales who are attacking either humpback calves or juveniles as well as members of other species.

Humpback whales were hunted as early as the 18th century. By the 19th century, many nations (the United States in particular), were hunting the animal heavily in the Atlantic Ocean and to a lesser extent in the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian</a> and Pacific Oceans. The late-19th-century introduction of the <a href="explosive%20harpoon">explosive harpoon</a> allowed whalers to accelerate their take. This, along with hunting in the <a href="Antarctic%20Ocean">Antarctic Ocean</a> beginning in 1904, sharply reduced whale populations. During the 20th century, over 200,000 humpbacks were taken, reducing the global population by over 90%. North Atlantic populations dropped to as low as 700 individuals.

In 1946, the <a href="International%20Whaling%20Commission">International Whaling Commission</a> (IWC) was founded to oversee the industry. They imposed hunting regulations and created hunting seasons. To prevent <a href="extinction">extinction</a>, IWC banned commercial humpback whaling in 1966. By then, the global population had been reduced to around 5,000. The ban has remained in force since 1966.

Prior to commercial whaling, populations could have reached 125,000. North Pacific kills alone are estimated at 28,000. The Soviet Union deliberately under-recorded its catches; the Soviets reported catching 2,820 between 1947 and 1972, but the true number was over 48,000.

As of 2004, hunting was restricted to a few animals each year off the Caribbean island of <a href="Bequia">Bequia</a> in the nation of <a href="St.%20Vincent%20and%20the%20Grenadines">St. Vincent and the Grenadines</a>. The take is not believed to threaten the local population. Japan had planned to kill 50 humpbacks in the 2007/08 season under its <a href="Institute%20for%20Cetacean%20Research">JARPA II</a> research program. The announcement sparked global protests. After a visit to Tokyo by the IWC chair asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and antiwhaling nations on the commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed to take no humpback whales during the two years it would take to reach a formal agreement.

In 2010, the IWC authorized Greenland's native population to hunt a few humpback whales for the following three years.

In Japan, humpback, minkes, sperm and many other smaller Odontoceti, including critically endangered species such as <a href="North%20Pacific%20right%20whale">North Pacific right</a>, <a href="Gray%20whale">western gray</a> and <a href="northern%20fin%20whale">northern fin</a>, have been targets of illegal captures. The hunts use harpoons for dolphin hunts or intentionally drive whales into nets, reporting them as cases of entanglement. Humpback meat can be found in markets. In one case, humpbacks of unknown quantities were illegally hunted in the <a href="Exclusive%20Economic%20Zone">Exclusive Economic Zone</a>s of anti-whaling nations such as off <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a> and <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a>.

Whale watching is the leisure activity of observing humpbacks in the wild. Participants watch from shore or on touring boats. Humpbacks are generally curious about nearby objects. Some individuals, referred to as "friendlies", approach whale-watching boats closely, often staying under or near the boat for many minutes.

Because humpbacks are typically easily approachable, curious, identifiable as individuals and display many behaviors, they have become the mainstay of whale tourism around the world. Hawaii has used the concept of "<a href="ecotourism">ecotourism</a>" to benefit from the species without killing them. This business brings in revenue of $20 million per year for the state's economy.

In December 1883, a male humpback swam up the <a href="Firth%20of%20Tay">Firth of Tay</a> in Scotland, past what was then the whaling port of <a href="Dundee">Dundee</a>. Harpooned during a failed hunt, it was found dead off of <a href="Stonehaven">Stonehaven</a> a week later. Its carcass was exhibited to the public by a local entrepreneur, John Woods, both locally and then as a touring exhibition that travelled to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and <a href="London">London</a>. The whale was dissected by Professor <a href="John%20Struthers%20%28anatomist%29">John Struthers</a>, who wrote seven papers on its anatomy and an 1889 monograph on the humpback.

An <a href="albino">albino</a> humpback whale that travels up and down the east coast of Australia became famous in local media because of its rare, all-white appearance. Migaloo is the only known all-white specimen and is a true <a href="albino">albino</a>. First sighted in 1991, the whale was named for an <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">indigenous Australian</a> word for "white fella". To prevent sightseers approaching dangerously close, the Queensland government decreed a 500-m (1600-ft) exclusion zone around him.

In 1985, Humphrey swam into <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> and then up the <a href="Sacramento%20River">Sacramento River</a> towards <a href="Rio%20Vista%2C%20California">Rio Vista</a>. Five years later, Humphrey returned and became stuck on a <a href="bay%20mud">mudflat</a> in San Francisco Bay immediately north of <a href="Sierra%20Point%2C%20Brisbane%2C%20California">Sierra Point</a> below the view of onlookers from the upper floors of the <a href="Dakin%20Building">Dakin Building</a>.

He was twice rescued by <a href="the%20Marine%20Mammal%20Center">the Marine Mammal Center</a> and other concerned groups in California. He was pulled off the mudflat with a large <a href="cargo%20net">cargo net</a> and the help of the <a href="US%20Coast%20Guard">US Coast Guard</a>. Both times, he was successfully guided back to the Pacific Ocean using a "sound net" in which people in a <a href="flotilla">flotilla</a> of boats made unpleasant noises behind the whale by banging on steel pipes, a Japanese fishing technique known as "oikami". At the same time, the attractive sounds of humpback whales preparing to feed were broadcast from a boat headed towards the open ocean.

He was last sighted in the vicinity of the <a href="Farallon%20Islands">Farallon Islands</a> in 1991.

Analyses of whale songs in the 1960s led to worldwide media interest and convinced the public that whales were highly <a href="cetacean%20intelligence">intelligent</a>, aiding the antiwhaling advocates.

While whaling no longer threatens the species, individuals are vulnerable to collisions with ships, <a href="By-catch">entanglement</a> in <a href="fishing%20net">fishing gear</a> and <a href="noise%20pollution">noise pollution</a>. Like other cetaceans, humpbacks can be injured by excessive noise. In the 19th century, two humpback whales were found dead near sites of repeated oceanic sub-bottom blasting, with traumatic injuries and fractures in the ears.

<a href="Saxitoxin">Saxitoxin</a>, a <a href="paralytic%20shellfish%20poisoning">paralytic shellfish poisoning</a> from contaminated mackerel, has been implicated in humpback whale deaths.

Whale researchers along the Atlantic Coast report that there have been more stranded whales with signs of vessel strikes and fishing gear entanglement in recent years than ever before. The <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">NOAA</a> recorded 88 stranded humpback whales between January 2016 and February 2019. This is more than double the number of whales stranded between 2013 and 2016. Because of the increase in stranded whales <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">NOAA</a> declared an unusual mortality event in April 2017. This declaration still stands. Virginia Beach aquarium’s stranding response coordinator, Alexander Costidis says the conclusions are that the two causes of these unusual mortality events are vessel interactions and entanglements. 

The worldwide population is at least 80,000, with 18,000–20,000 in the North Pacific, about 12,000 in the North Atlantic and over 50,000 in the <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">Southern Hemisphere</a>, down from a pre<a href="whaling">whaling</a> population of 125,000.

Protecting Humpback Whales

The <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">NOAA</a> is committed to protecting and recovering the humpback whale. <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">NOAA</a> enacted vessel speed restrictions which serve to protect the endangered North Atlantic right whale and many other species of whales. They respond to dead, injured, or entangled whales. They also educate whale watchers, tourists, and vessel operators on responsible viewing of the humpback whales. <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">NOAA</a> works to develop methods to reduce vessel strikes and reduce risk of entanglement in fishing gear. The <a href="National%20Oceanic%20and%20Atmospheric%20Administration">NOAA</a>’s work will help reduce the number of humpback whale deaths. 

In August 2008, the <a href="IUCN">IUCN</a> changed humpback's status from Vulnerable to Least Concern, although two subpopulations remain endangered. The United States is considering listing separate humpback populations, so smaller groups, such as North Pacific humpbacks, which are estimated to number 18,000–20,000 animals, might be delisted. This is made difficult by humpbacks’ migrations, which can extend from <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> to <a href="Costa%20Rica">Costa Rica</a>. In Costa Rica, the <a href="Osa%20%28canton%29">Ballena Marine National Park</a> is designed for humpback protection.

Areas where population data is limited and the species may be at higher risk include the <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a>, the western North Pacific Ocean, the west coast of Africa and parts of <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>.

The species was listed as vulnerable in 1996 and <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a> as recently as 1988. Most monitored stocks have rebounded since the end of commercial whaling. In the North Atlantic stocks are believed to be approaching prehunting levels. However, the species is considered endangered in some countries, including the United States.

A 2008 US <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20Commerce">Department of Commerce</a> analysis (SPLASH) noted that the many challenges to determining the recovery status included the lack of accurate population estimates, the unexpected complexity of population structures and their migration. The report was based on data collected from 2004 to 2006. At the time, the North Pacific population was some 18,302. The estimate is consistent with a moderate rate of recovery for a depleted population, although it was considered to be a "dramatic increase in abundance" from other post-1960s estimates. By comparison, Calambokidis et al. estimated 9,819, covering 1991–1993. This represents a 4% annual increase in population from 1993 to 2006. The sanctuary provided by US national parks, such as <a href="Glacier%20Bay%20National%20Park%20and%20Preserve">Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve</a> and <a href="Cape%20Hatteras%20National%20Seashore">Cape Hatteras National Seashore</a>, became major factors in population recovery.

Off the west coast of Canada, the <a href="Gwaii%20Haanas%20National%20Marine%20Conservation%20Area%20Reserve%20and%20Haida%20Heritage%20Site">Gwaii Haanas National Marine Conservation Area Reserve</a> covers . It is "a primary feeding habitat" of the North Pacific population. Their critical habitat overlaps with tanker shipping routes between Canada and its eastern trade partners. In 2005 the North Pacific population was listed as threatened under Canada’s Species at Risk Act (SARA). On April 19, 2014 the Department of the Environment recommended an amendment to SARA to downgrade their status off the Pacific coast from "threatened" to "species of special concern". According to <a href="Committee%20on%20the%20Status%20of%20Endangered%20Wildlife%20in%20Canada">Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada</a> (COSEWIC), the North Pacific humpback population increased at about 4% annually from 1992 to 2008. Although socioeconomic costs and benefits were considered in their decision to upgrade their status, according to the University of British Columbia’s Marine Mammal Research Consortium's research director, the decision was based on biology, not politics.

<a href="The%20United%20Kingdom">The United Kingdom</a>, among other countries, designated the humpback as a priority species under the national <a href="Biodiversity%20Action%20Plan">Biodiversity Action Plan</a>.

Naruto

"Naruto" was serialized in Shueisha's magazine, "<a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a>" from 1999 to 2014, and released in "<a href="tank%C5%8Dbon">tankōbon</a>" (book) form in 72 volumes. The manga was adapted into an <a href="anime">anime</a> television series produced by <a href="Studio%20Pierrot">Studio Pierrot</a> and <a href="Aniplex">Aniplex</a>, which broadcast 220 episodes in Japan from 2002 to 2007; the English adaptation of the series aired on <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> from 2005 to 2009. "", a sequel to the original series, premiered in Japan in 2007, and ended in 2017, after 500 episodes. The English adaptation was broadcast on <a href="Disney%20XD%20%28United%20States%29">Disney XD</a> from 2009 to 2011, and then switched to <a href="Adult%20Swim">Adult Swim</a>'s Toonami block in January 2014. Besides the anime series, Studio Pierrot has developed eleven movies and eleven <a href="original%20video%20animation">original video animation</a>s (OVAs). Other "Naruto"-related merchandise includes <a href="light%20novel">light novel</a>s, video games, and trading cards developed by several companies.

<a href="Viz%20Media">Viz Media</a> licensed the manga and anime for North American production and serialized "Naruto" in their digital "<a href="Weekly%20Shonen%20Jump%20%28American%20magazine%29">Weekly Shonen Jump</a>" magazine. The anime series began airing in the United States and Canada in 2005, and in the United Kingdom and Australia in 2006 and 2007, respectively. The films and most OVAs from the series were also released by Viz, with the first film premiering in movie theaters. Viz Media began streaming the two anime series on their streaming service Neon Alley in December 2012. The story of "Naruto" continues with Naruto's son, <a href="Boruto%20Uzumaki">Boruto Uzumaki</a>, in "": Boruto wishes to create his own ninja way instead of following his father's.

"Naruto" is the <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20manga">third best-selling manga series</a> in history, selling copies worldwide in 35 countries. It has become one of Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their English translations of the volumes have appeared on "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" bestseller list several times, and the seventh volume won a <a href="Quill%20Award">Quill Award</a> in 2006. Reviewers praised the manga's character development, strong storylines, and well-executed fight scenes, though some felt the fight scenes slowed the story down. Critics noted that the manga, which has a <a href="coming-of-age">coming-of-age</a> theme, makes use of cultural references from <a href="Japanese%20mythology">Japanese mythology</a> and <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>.

A powerful fox known as the <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20characters%23Kurama">Nine-Tails</a> attacks Konoha, the hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha, the <a href="Minato%20Namikaze">Fourth Hokage</a>, seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, <a href="Naruto%20Uzumaki">Naruto Uzumaki</a>, making Naruto a host of the beast; this costs Naruto's father his life, and the <a href="Hiruzen%20Sarutobi">Third Hokage</a> returns from retirement to become leader of Konoha again. Naruto is often ridiculed by the Konoha villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Because of a decree made by the Third Hokage forbidding anyone to mention these events, Naruto knows nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja, reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher <a href="Iruka%20Umino">Iruka Umino</a>.

Shortly afterwards, Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with <a href="Sasuke%20Uchiha">Sasuke Uchiha</a>, against whom he often competes, and <a href="Sakura%20Haruno">Sakura Haruno</a>, on whom he has a crush, to form <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20characters%23Team%207">Team 7</a>, under an experienced "<a href="sensei">sensei</a>", the elite ninja <a href="Kakashi%20Hatake">Kakashi Hatake</a>. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.

After several missions, including a major one in the Land of Waves, Kakashi allows Team 7 to take a ninja exam, enabling them to advance to a higher rank and take on more difficult missions, known as Chunin Exams. During the exams, <a href="Orochimaru%20%28Naruto%29">Orochimaru</a>, a wanted criminal, invades Konoha and kills the Third Hokage for revenge. <a href="Jiraiya%20%28Naruto%29">Jiraiya</a>, one of the three legendary ninjas, declines the title of Fifth Hokage and searches with Naruto for <a href="Tsunade%20%28Naruto%29">Tsunade</a> whom he chooses to become Fifth Hokage instead.

During the search, it is revealed that Orochimaru wishes to train Sasuke because of his powerful genetic heritage, the Sharingan. After Sasuke attempts and fails to kill his older brother <a href="Itachi%20Uchiha">Itachi</a> when he showed up in Konoha to kidnap Naruto, he joins Orochimaru, hoping to gain from him the strength needed to kill Itachi. The story takes a turn when Sasuke leaves the Konoha village and when Tsunade finds out, she sends a group of ninja, including Naruto, to retrieve Sasuke, but Naruto is unable to persuade or force him to come back. Naruto and Sakura do not give up on Sasuke: Naruto leaves Konoha to receive training from Jiraiya to prepare himself for the next time he encounters Sasuke, while Sakura becomes Tsunade's apprentice.

Two and a half years later, Naruto returns from his training with Jiraiya. The Akatsuki starts kidnapping the hosts of the powerful Tailed Beasts. Team 7 and other Leaf ninja fight against them and search for their teammate Sasuke. The Akatsuki succeeds in capturing and extracting seven of the Tailed Beasts, killing all the hosts except <a href="Gaara">Gaara</a>, who is now the Kazekage. Meanwhile, Sasuke betrays Orochimaru and faces Itachi to take revenge. After Itachi dies in battle, Sasuke learns from the Akatsuki founder <a href="Tobi%20%28Naruto%29">Tobi</a> that Itachi received an order from Konoha's superiors to destroy his clan to prevent a coup. He accepted it on the condition that he would be allowed to spare Sasuke. Saddened by this revelation, Sasuke joins the Akatsuki to destroy Konoha in revenge. As Konoha ninjas defeat several Akatsuki members, the Akatsuki figurehead leader, <a href="Nagato%20%28Naruto%29">Nagato</a>, kills Jiraiya and devastates Konoha, but Naruto defeats and redeems him, earning the village's respect and admiration.

With Nagato's death, Tobi, disguised as <a href="Madara%20Uchiha">Madara Uchiha</a> (one of Konoha's founding fathers), announces that he wants to capture all nine Tailed Beasts to perform an illusion powerful enough to control all humanity and achieve <a href="world%20peace">world peace</a>. The leaders of the five ninja villages refuse to help him and instead join forces to confront Tobi and his allies. That decision results in a Fourth Shinobi World War between the combined armies of the Five Great Countries (known as the Allied Shinobi Forces) and Akatsuki's forces of zombie-like ninjas. The Five Kage try to keep Naruto, unaware of the war, in a secret island turtle near Kumogakure (Hidden Cloud Village), but Naruto finds out and escapes from the island with <a href="Killer%20Bee%20%28Naruto%29">Killer Bee</a>, the host of the Eight-Tails. At that time, Naruto — along with the help of Killer Bee — gains control of his Tailed Beast and the two of them head for the battlefield.

During the conflict, it is revealed that Tobi is Obito Uchiha, a former teammate of Kakashi's who was thought to be dead. The real Madara saved Obito's life, and they have since collaborated. As Sasuke learns the history of Konoha, including the circumstances that led to his clan's downfall, he decides to protect the village and rejoins Naruto and Sakura to thwart Madara and Obito's plans. However, Madara's body ends up possessed by <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20characters%23Kaguya%20%C5%8Ctsutsuki">Kaguya Otsutsuki</a>, an ancient princess who intends to subdue all humanity. A reformed Obito sacrifices himself to help Team 7 stop her. Once Kaguya is sealed, Madara dies as well. Sasuke takes advantage of the situation and takes control of all the Tailed Beasts, as he reveals his goal of ending the current village system. Naruto confronts Sasuke to dissuade him from his plan, and after they almost kill each other in a final battle, Sasuke admits defeat and reforms. After the war, Kakashi becomes the Sixth Hokage and pardons Sasuke for his crimes. Years later, Kakashi steps down while Naruto marries <a href="Hinata%20Hyuga">Hinata Hyuga</a> and becomes the Seventh Hokage, raising the next generation.

In 1995, Shueisha released "Karakuri", a one-shot manga by Masashi Kishimoto that earned an honorable mention in the "Hop Step Award" in 1996. Kishimoto was unsatisfied with his subsequent drafts for a follow up, and decided to work on another project. The new project was originally going to feature Naruto as a chef, but this version never made it to print. Kishimoto originally wanted to make Naruto a child who could transform into a fox, so he created a one-shot of "Naruto" for the summer 1997 issue of "Akamaru Jump" based on the idea. Despite the positive feedback it received in a readers' poll, Kishimoto was unhappy with the art and the story, so he rewrote it as a story about ninjas.

The first eight chapters of "Naruto" were planned before it appeared in "<a href="Weekly%20Sh%C5%8Dnen%20Jump">Weekly Shōnen Jump</a>", and these chapters originally devoted many panels of intricate art to illustrating the Konoha village. By the time "Naruto" debuted, the background art was sparse, instead emphasizing the characters. Though Kishimoto had concerns that chakra (the energy source used by the ninjas in "Naruto") made the series too Japanese, he still believed it is an enjoyable read. Kishimoto is a fan of <a href="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, and the tailed beasts mythology was introduced because Kishimoto wanted an excuse to draw monsters. He has said that the central theme in <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20chapters%20%28Part%20I%29">Part I</a> of "Naruto" is how people accept each other, citing Naruto's development across the series as an example.

For Part II of the manga, Kishimoto tried to keep the panel layouts and the plot easy for the reader to follow, and avoid "overdo[ing] the typical manga style". He considers that his drawing style has changed from "the classic manga look to something a bit more realistic." Because of wishing to end the arc involving Sasuke Uchiha search for his brother, Itachi, in a single volume, Kishimoto decided that volume 43 should include more chapters than regular volumes. As a result, Kishimoto apologized to readers for this since volume 43 was more expensive than regular volumes.

When he created "Naruto", Kishimoto looked to other "shōnen" manga as influences for his work and tried to make his characters unique, while basing the story on Japanese culture. The separation of the characters into different teams was intended to give each group a particular flavor. Kishimoto wanted each member to have a high level of aptitude in one skill and be talentless in another. He found it difficult to write about romance, but emphasized it more in <a href="List%20of%20Naruto%20volumes%23Part%20II">Part II of the manga</a>, beginning with volume 28. He introduced villains into the story to have them act as a counterpoint to his characters' moral values and clearly illustrate their differences. As a result of how the younger characters were significantly weaker than the villains, Kishimoto made the <a href="timeskip">timeskip</a> in order to have them age and become stronger during this time.

Kishimoto made use of the <a href="Chinese%20astrology">Chinese zodiac</a> tradition, which had a long-standing presence in Japan; the zodiac hand signs originate from this. When Kishimoto was creating the primary setting of the "Naruto" manga, he concentrated initially on the designs for the village of Konoha. The idea of the setting came to him "pretty spontaneously without much thought," but admits that the scenery became based on his home in the Japanese prefecture <a href="Okayama%20Prefecture">of Okayama prefecture</a>. Since the storyline does not specify when it is set, he was able to include modern elements in the series such as convenience stores. He considered including automobiles, planes and simple computers, but excluded projectile weapons and vehicles from the plot.

When serialization began, Kishimoto decided the ending would feature a fight between two characters: Naruto and Sasuke, which would end with Naruto forgiving Sasuke as he had forgiven Nagato. Kishimoto chose Hinata Hyuga as Naruto's romantic partner from the early stages of the manga, since Hinata had always respected and admired Naruto even before the series' beginning, and Kishimoto felt this meant the two of them could build a relationship. This decision annoyed his wife because she wanted Naruto to marry Sakura Haruno, but Kishimoto viewed Sakura as Naruto's friend and teammate, rather than a future wife. When Hinata first appeared, Kishimoto thought of forming a <a href="love%20triangle">love triangle</a> among the three characters, but because he decided that fighting was the main focus of the manga, there was little room for romantic plotlines. By August 2009, Kishimoto had already planned the series' following chapters and how it would conclude, stating he had yet needed the energy to finish the series.

"Naruto" was published in Shueisha's magazine, "Weekly Shōnen Jump" from September 21, 1999 (No. 43), to November 10, 2014 (No. 50). The manga was also published in "tankōbon" (book) form in Japan and other countries, releasing 72 volumes—27 for Part I, and the rest for Part II. The first 238 chapters are Part I and constitute the first section of the "Naruto" storyline. Chapters 239 to 244 include a "<a href="gaiden">gaiden</a>" (side-story) focusing on Kakashi Hatake's background. The remaining chapters (245 to 700) belong to Part II, which continues the story after a two-and-a-half year gap in the internal timeline. The first "tankōbon" was released on March 3, 2000. Shueisha have also released several <a href="Films%20comic">ani-manga</a> "tankōbon", each based on one of the "Naruto" movies, and has released the series in Japanese for cell-phone download on their website "Shueisha Manga Capsule". A miniseries titled , centered on the main characters' children, began serialization in the Japanese and English editions of "Weekly Shōnen Jump" on April 27, 2015, and ended after ten chapters on July 6, 2015.

"Naruto" was <a href="scanlation">scanlated</a> (translated by fans) and available online before a licensed version was released in North America; the rights were acquired by Viz Media, who began serializing "Naruto" in their anthology comic magazine "<a href="Shonen%20Jump%20%28magazine%29">Shonen Jump</a>", starting with the January 2003 issue. The schedule was accelerated at the end of 2007 to catch up with the Japanese version, and again in early 2009, with 11 volumes (from 34 to 44) appearing in three months, after which it returned to a quarterly schedule. All 27 volumes of Part I were released in a boxed set on November 13, 2007. On May 3, 2011, Viz started selling the manga in an omnibus format with each book containing three volumes.

As of March 31, 2008, the franchise has been licensed in 90 countries, and the manga serialized in 35 countries. <a href="Carlsen%20Verlag">Carlsen Comics</a> has licensed the series, through its regional divisions, and released the series in German and Danish.

A spin-off comedy manga by Kenji Taira, titled focuses on the character <a href="Rock%20Lee">Rock Lee</a>, a character who aspires to be strong as a ninja but has no magical "jutsu" abilities. It ran in Shueisha's "<a href="Saiky%C5%8D%20Jump">Saikyō Jump</a>" magazine from December 3, 2010, to July 4, 2014, and was made into an <a href="List%20of%20Rock%20Lee%20%26amp%3B%20His%20Ninja%20Pals%20episodes">anime</a> series, produced by Studio Pierrot, and premiering on TV Tokyo on April 3, 2012. Crunchyroll <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a>ed the series' premiere on their website and streamed the following episodes. Taira also wrote , which released on October 3, 2014, which runs in the same magazine and features Sasuke.

A monthly sequel series titled "" began in the Japanese and English editions of "Weekly Shōnen Jump" in early 2016, illustrated by Mikio Ikemoto and written by Ukyō Kodachi, with supervision by Kishimoto. Ikemoto was Kishimoto's chief assistant during the run of the original "Naruto" series, and Kodachi was his writing partner for the "" film screenplay. The monthly series was preceded by a one-shot written and illustrated by Kishimoto. The staff from Shueisha asked Kishimoto if he would write a sequel to "Naruto". However, Kishimoto refused the offer and offered his former assistant Mikio Ikemoto and writer Ukyo Kodachi write "Boruto: Naruto Next Generations" as the sequel to "Naruto".

Subsequent episodes were released as part of DVD boxed sets, beginning with the first season on January 26, 2010. In the United Kingdom, the series was licensed by <a href="Manga%20Entertainment">Manga Entertainment</a> who released the first DVD collection on June 14, 2010.

Eleven "Naruto" <a href="original%20video%20animations">original video animations</a> (OVAs) have been released.

The series was adapted into eleven films; the first three correspond to the first anime series, and the remaining eight correspond to the second series. Dates in the list below are for the original Japanese release; all the films were released in English, usually no more than three years later.

In July 2015, <a href="Lionsgate">Lionsgate</a> announced they were developing a live-action "Naruto" with <a href="Avi%20Arad">Avi Arad</a> through his production company "Arad Productions", with <a href="Michael%20Gracey">Michael Gracey</a> directing, and <a href="Erik%20Feig">Erik Feig</a>, Geoff Shaveitz, and Kelly O'Malley producing. On December 17, 2016, Kishimoto announced that he has been asked to help develop the movie.

Twenty-six "Naruto" <a href="light%20novel">light novel</a>s, the first nine written by Masatoshi Kusakabe, have been published in Japan. Of these, the first two have been released in English in North America. The first adapted novel, "Naruto: Innocent Heart, Demonic Blood" (2002), retells a Team 7 mission in which they encounter the assassins Zabuza and Haku; the second, "Naruto: Mission: Protect the Waterfall Village!" (2003) was based on the second OVA of the anime. Viz has also published 16 <a href="Chapter%20Book">chapter books</a> written by Tracey West with illustrations from the manga. Unlike the series, these books were aimed at children ages seven to ten.

Thirteen original novels have appeared in Japan; eleven of these are part of a series, and the other two are independent novels unconnected to the series. The first independent novel, titled "Naruto: Tales of a Gutsy Ninja" (2009), is presented as an in-universe novel written by Naruto's master <a href="Jiraiya">Jiraiya</a>. It follows the adventures of a fictional "shinobi" named Naruto Musasabi, who served as Naruto's namesake. The other independent novel, "Naruto Jinraiden: The Day the Wolf Howled" (2012), is set shortly after Sasuke's fight with Itachi.

"Itachi Shinden", which consists of two novels, and "Sasuke Shinden", a single novel, both appeared in 2015, and both were adapted into anime arcs in "Naruto: Shippuden" in 2016, titled "Naruto Shippūden: Itachi Shinden-hen: Hikari to Yami" and "Book of Sunrise" respectively. "Hiden" is a series of six light novels published in 2015 that explores the stories of various characters after the ending of the manga.

<a href="Toshio%20Masuda%20%28composer%29">Toshio Masuda</a> composed and arranged the "Naruto" soundtracks. "Naruto Original Soundtrack" was released on April 3, 2003, and contains 22 tracks used during the first season of the anime. This was followed by "Naruto Original Soundtrack II", released on March 18, 2004, which includes 19 tracks.

Eight tracks from the series were selected and released on a CD called "Naruto in Rock -The Very Best Hit Collection Instrumental Version-" released on December 19, 2007. Soundtracks for the three movies based on the first anime series were available for sale near their release dates. On October 12, 2011, a <a href="Compact%20disc">CD</a> collecting the themes from "Naruto Shōnen Hen" was released. Various CD series were released with voice actors performing original episodes.

The soundtracks of "Naruto: Shippuden" were produced by <a href="Yasuharu%20Takanashi">Yasuharu Takanashi</a>; they were titled "Naruto Shippūden Original Soundtrack I", "II", and "III", and were released in 2007, 2009, and 2016. "Naruto All Stars", released in 2008, consists of 10 original "Naruto" songs remixed and sung by characters from the series. Ten themes from the two anime series were collected in the DVD box "Naruto Super Hits 2006–2008", which appeared in 2008. Soundtracks from the "Shippuden" films have also been released, with the first one available in 2007. A final one composed of the series is set to be released in late 2017 with Aniplex having started a survey of all "Naruto" and "Naruto Shippuden" themes to be included in the CD.

"Naruto" video games have been released on various consoles by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>, <a href="Sony">Sony</a>, and <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>. Most of them are <a href="fighting%20game">fighting game</a>s in which the player directly controls one of the characters from "Naruto". The player pits their character against another character controlled by the game's <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">AI</a> or by another player; the objective is to reduce the opponent's health to zero using basic attacks as well as special techniques unique to each character derived from techniques they use in the "Naruto" anime or manga. The first "Naruto" video game was "Naruto: Konoha Ninpōchō", which was released in Japan on March 27, 2003, for the <a href="WonderSwan%23WonderSwan%20Color">WonderSwan Color</a>. Most "Naruto" video games have been released only in Japan. The first games released outside of Japan were the "" series and the "" series, released in North America under the titles of "Naruto: Clash of Ninja" and "Naruto: Ninja Council". In January 2012, Namco Bandai announced they had sold 10 million "Naruto" games worldwide.

Three official artbooks based on the "Naruto" series have been released. The first two, titled "Art Collection: Uzumaki", and "Illustration Collection: Naruto", were released in Japan in 2004 and 2009, with North American editions following in 2007 and 2010 respectively. The third artbook "Illustration Collection: Naruto Uzumaki", was published in 2015 in Japan and later the same year in North America; it contains artwork originally on "Shonen Jump" comic covers. It has no text except a brief commentary by Kishimoto about his favorite artworks. An interactive coloring book called "Paint Jump: Art of Naruto" was released in 2008. An unreleased artbook titled "Naruto Exhibition Official Guest Book" by Masashi Kishimoto was given to those who attended the "Naruto" art exhibition at the <a href="Mori%20Art%20Museum">Mori Art Museum</a> on April 25, 2015.

Four guidebooks titled "First Official Data Book" through "Fourth Official Data Book" have been released; the first two cover Part I of the manga, and were released in 2002 and 2005; the third and fourth volumes appeared in 2008 and 2014 These books contain character profiles, Jutsu guides, and drafts by Kishimoto. For the anime, a series of guidebooks called "Naruto Anime Profiles" was released. These books contain information about the production of the anime episodes and explanations of the characters' designs. A manga fan book titled "Secret: Writings from the Warriors Official Fanbook" appeared in 2002, and another fan book was released to commemorate the series' 10th anniversary, including illustrations of Naruto Uzumaki by other manga artists, a novel, Kishimoto's one-shot titled "Karakuri," and an interview between Kishimoto and <a href="Yoshihiro%20Togashi">Yoshihiro Togashi</a>.

Produced by Bandai, the "Naruto Collectible Card Game" was released in Japan in 2003, and in North America in 2006. The game is played between two players using a customized deck of fifty cards from the set, and a game mat. To win, a player must either earn ten "battle rewards" through their actions in the game or cause the other player to exhaust their deck. The cards were released in named sets called "series," in the form of four 50-card pre-constructed box sets. Each set includes a <a href="Starter%20pack">starter deck</a>, the game mat, a turn-counter, and one stainless steel "Ninja Blade Coin." Extra cards are available in 10-card <a href="booster%20pack">booster pack</a>s, and deck sets. Four box sets sold in retailers are available for each series. Cards for each set are available in collectible tins, containing several booster packs and exclusive promotional cards in a metal box. By October 2006, seventeen series had been released in Japan with 417 unique cards. As of August 2008, ten of these series had been released in North America.

The manga has sold copies worldwide, including in Japan and overseas, making it the third <a href="List%20of%20best-selling%20manga">best-selling manga series</a> in history. More than half of the sales were in Japan, with the remaining sales from 35 other countries. It has become one of North American publisher Viz Media's best-selling manga series; their translation of the series appeared on "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" bestseller lists several times, and volume seven of the manga won the <a href="Quill%20Award">Quill Award</a> for <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> in 2006. It was included in the fiction section of "Teacher Librarian"'s recommended list for 2008, and "School Library Journal" described it as an essential manga for school libraries. Volume 28 of the manga reached 17th place in the "USA Today Booklist" in its first week of release in March 2008, only two places short of the record for a manga, held by "<a href="Fruits%20Basket">Fruits Basket</a>". The volume had one of the biggest debut weeks of any manga in years, becoming the top-selling manga volume of 2008 and the second best-selling book in North America. In 2010, Viz, the publisher, commented on the loyalty of readers, who reliably continued to buy the manga as the volume count went over 40.

In April 2007, volume 14 earned Viz the Manga Trade Paperback of the Year Gem Award from <a href="Diamond%20Comic%20Distributors">Diamond Comic Distributors</a>. The manga was nominated for Favorite Manga Series in "<a href="Nickelodeon%20Magazine">Nickelodeon Magazine</a>"s 2009 Comics Awards. In February 2015, "<a href="Asahi%20Shimbun">Asahi Shimbun</a>" announced that "Naruto" was one of nine nominees for the nineteenth annual <a href="Tezuka%20Osamu%20Cultural%20Prize">Tezuka Osamu Cultural Prize</a>, and the following month Kishimoto was the winner of Rookie of the Year for the series in the Japanese government's <a href="Agency%20for%20Cultural%20Affairs">Agency for Cultural Affairs</a> 2014 Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology Fine Arts Recommendation Awards. Responding to "Naruto" success, Kishimoto said in "Naruto Collector Winter 2007/2008" that he was "very glad that the American audience has accepted and understood ninja. It shows that the American audience has good taste [...] because it means they can accept something previously unfamiliar to them."

"Naruto Shippuden" has been ranked several times as one of the most watched series in Japan. The first DVD compilation released by Viz received a nomination from the <a href="American%20Anime%20Awards">American Anime Awards</a> for best package design.

Several reviewers commented on the balance between fight scenes and plot development; A. E. Sparrow of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> and Casey Brienza of <a href="Anime%20News%20Network">Anime News Network</a> (ANN) felt that the result was a strong storyline, but Carl Kimlinger, also writing for ANN, suggested that there were too many fights, which slowed down the plot. Kimlinger liked the character designs, and approved of the fight scenes themselves which also drew positive comments from Rik Spanjers, who felt that the excitement of the scenes depends on Kishimoto's skill in depicting action. Javier Lugo, writing for Manga Life, agreed, describing the artwork as "dramatic, exciting, and just right for the story he's telling".

The anime and manga magazine "<a href="Neo%20%28magazine%29">Neo</a>" described Naruto's character as "irksome", but considered that the series' "almost sickening addictiveness" was due to the quality of the characterization, and in Briana Lawrence's opinion the growth of the characters gave Part II an adult feel. In a review of volume 28 Brienza also praised Part II's storyline and characterization, though she commented that not every volume reached a high level of quality.

Gō Itō, a professor in the manga department of <a href="Tokyo%20Polytechnic%20University">Tokyo Polytechnic University</a>, compared the series' development to <a href="Dragon%20Ball%20%28manga%29">the manga of "Dragon Ball"</a>, saying that both manga present good illustrations of three-dimensional body movements that capture the characters' martial arts very well. Gō felt readers could empathize with the characters in "Naruto" via their inner monologue during battles.

The series also influenced the movie "<a href="Scott%20Pilgrim%20vs.%20The%20World">Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</a>" with director <a href="Edgar%20Wright">Edgar Wright</a> saying he was inspired by how whenever there is a "killer move" in the manga, there is an impact in the background following any technique's usage. There is an <a href="internet%20meme">internet meme</a> known as "Naruto run" based on the way the characters run leaning forward with their arms behind their backs. In September 2017, students from the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Philippines%20Los%20Ba%C3%B1os">University of the Philippines Los Baños</a> Perspective started covering publications of students running like "Naruto" characters. When the manga ended, multiple authors from the magazine expressed congratulations to Kishimoto's work.

The "Naruto" anime was listed as the 38th best animated show in IGN's Top 100 Animated Series. In September 2005, Japanese television network <a href="TV%20Asahi">TV Asahi</a> broadcast a popularity poll based on a nationwide survey in which "Naruto" placed 17th. Mike Hale of "The New York Times" described the series as much better than American animation aimed at children, but the animation received some criticism from both the T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews critics: Christina Carpenter felt Kishimoto's artistic style translated poorly into animation, and Derrick Tucker was also negative, though he felt that at their best, the depictions "[left] little to be desired". As with the manga, some reviewers, such as Martin Theron of ANN, along with Tucker, felt there were too many fight scenes, though Justin Rich argued that the fight scenes were the most important and enjoyable element of the show. Carpenter also commented positively on the characters, though she felt that most were fairly stereotypical.

"Naruto: Shippuden" was well-reviewed by Activeanime's David C. Jones who commented that the animation had improved. ANN noted that the series has a more serious tone and a better balance between comedy and drama than the first anime series; with more interesting digressions from the main plot. Although the pacing for the first episodes was criticised as slow, the delivery and development of the interactions between the characters received positive comments. Writing for the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>", Charles Solomon ranked "Shippuden" the third best anime on his "Top 10".

Amy Plumb argues that Kishimoto's use of references to <a href="Japanese%20mythology">Japanese mythology</a> in "Naruto" are intended to add further layers to the story. Kishimoto expects his readers to decode the references, which allows him to avoid direct explanations. One example is Itachi, who has three ninja techniques named after Shinto deities: <a href="Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto">Tsukiyomi</a>, <a href="Amaterasu">Amaterasu</a>, and <a href="Susanoo-no-Mikoto">Susano-o</a>. Plumb also cites Sasuke's clan's heraldic symbol, a fan known as an "uchiwa". These fans are used in Japanese myths to exorcise evil, by blowing it away; Sasuke discovers late in the series that he has the ability to "blow away" the influence of the Nine-Tailed Fox on Naruto. Foxes (<a href="Kitsune">"kitsune tsuki"</a>) are tricksters in Japanese mythology, and in some stories they take over human bodies; Plumb comments on the obvious similarities to the Nine-Tail sealed in Naruto, and the pranks Naruto plays.

Christopher A. Born notes that the "Naruto" storyline contains traditional <a href="Confucianism">Confucian</a> values, and suggests that students who analyse manga such as "Naruto" and "<a href="Bleach%20%28manga%29">Bleach</a>" will learn more about Confucianism than they would from studying its abstract ideas. Norman Melchor Robles Jr. evaluated the portrayal of both positive and negative ideas in "Naruto" by counting words in the script which were associated with either violence or positive values; he found that a small majority of tagged words were violent, but commented that the portrayal of violence seemed organized to show how positive strategies on the part of the protagonists could overcome the violence. Sheuo Hui Gan considers the series to have a set of "traditional ethical values." She also compares the treatment of <a href="wikt%3Aalienate">alienation</a> in "Naruto", which Naruto overcomes by joining his society, to the portrayal of alienation in "<a href="Akira%20%281988%20film%29">Akira</a>" and "<a href="Neon%20Genesis%20Evangelion">Neon Genesis Evangelion</a>", where the main characters remain alienated.

"Naruto" has been described by several critics as a <a href="coming-of-age%20story">coming-of-age story</a>. Psychologist Lawrence C. Rubin suggests that the storylines would appeal to readers of any age who have lost loved ones, or are having difficulty finding friends, or who are in other situations shown in the series. In <a href="Yukari%20Fujimoto">Yukari Fujimoto</a>'s view, as the characters mature, they show respect to the adults who have raised and taught them, making it a conservative storyline in comparison to other manga of the same time period such as "<a href="One%20Piece">One Piece</a>" and "<a href="Air%20Gear">Air Gear</a>". Rik Spanjers sees the difference between Sasuke (a loner) and Naruto (an optimist) as tragic, arguing that the contrast between the two protagonists' approach to the world is fundamental to the plot: "Naruto’s strength grows as he gains more loved ones to protect, while Sasuke remains alone and is increasingly absorbed by his quest for revenge". Omote Tomoyuki points out that there are many comic moments in the story despite the difficulties Naruto finds himself in, but the comic elements diminish dramatically over time as Naruto grows into a teenager, particularly once Part II begins. "Shōnen Jump" began to carry comedies such as "<a href="Gin%20Tama">Gintama</a>" and "<a href="Reborn%21">Reborn!</a>" from 2003 onwards, and in Tomoyuki's view this is part of the reason for the change in emphasis: "Naruto" "was not supposed to provide laughter anymore".

Fujimoto argues that the story has overly traditional gender roles, noting "[...] its representations suggest that men are men and women are women and that they differ naturally regarding aptitude and vocation". For example, the girls initially outperform the boys in the Ninja Academy, but "once the boys get serious, the girls cannot keep pace". Fujimoto points out that this does not upset Sakura, who is now surpassed by Naruto. Character development based on female roles, when it does occur, again uses stereotypical roles: Tsunade, for example, a middle-aged woman with large breasts, is a clear mother figure, and when she teaches Sakura to be a medical ninja, which requires special skills possessed only by women, the story reinforces the idea that women only belong on the battlefield as healers. Tsunade herself, who is a figure of authority in "Naruto", is portrayed as ridiculous in a way that men in the same position are not. Fujimoto suggests this presentation of women may explain why the female characters are often the most disliked characters among readers of the manga.

Common chiffchaff

The common chiffchaff ("Phylloscopus collybita"), or simply the chiffchaff, is a common and widespread <a href="leaf%20warbler">leaf warbler</a> which breeds in open woodlands throughout northern and temperate Europe and Asia.

It is a <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> <a href="passerine">passerine</a> which winters in southern and western Europe, southern <a href="Asia">Asia</a> and north <a href="Africa">Africa</a>. Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named <a href="onomatopoeia">onomatopoeically</a> for its simple "chiff-chaff" song. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends <a href="territory%20%28animal%29">his territory</a> against rivals, and attacks potential predators.

A small <a href="insectivore">insectivorous bird</a>, it is subject to predation by mammals, such as cats and <a href="mustelidae">mustelids</a>, and birds, particularly hawks of the genus "<a href="Accipiter">Accipiter</a>". Its large range and population mean that its status is secure, although one subspecies is probably extinct.

The <a href="Great%20Britain">British</a> naturalist <a href="Gilbert%20White">Gilbert White</a> was one of the first people to separate the similar-looking common chiffchaff, <a href="willow%20warbler">willow warbler</a> and <a href="wood%20warbler">wood warbler</a> by their songs, as detailed in 1789 in "<a href="The%20Natural%20History%20and%20Antiquities%20of%20Selborne">The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne</a>", but the common chiffchaff was first formally described as "Sylvia collybita" by <a href="France">French</a> <a href="ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="Louis%20Jean%20Pierre%20Vieillot">Louis Vieillot</a> in 1817 in his "Nouveau Dictionnaire d'Histoire Naturelle".

Described by German zoologist <a href="Friedrich%20Boie">Friedrich Boie</a> in 1826, the genus "Phylloscopus" contains about 50 species of small insectivorous Old World woodland warblers which are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below. The genus was formerly part of the <a href="Old%20World%20warbler">Old World warbler</a> family Sylvidae, but has now been split off as a separate family Phylloscopidae. The chiffchaff's closest relatives, other than former subspecies, are a group of leaf warblers which similarly lack crown stripes, a yellow rump or obvious wing bars; they include the willow, Bonelli's, wood and <a href="plain%20leaf%20warbler">plain leaf warbler</a>s.

The common chiffchaff has three still commonly accepted subspecies, together with some from the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, and the <a href="Caucasus">Caucasus</a> which are now more often treated as full species.


The common chiffchaff's <a href="English%20language">English</a> name is onomatopoeic, referring to the repetitive "chiff-chaff" song of the European subspecies. There are similar names in some other European languages, such as the <a href="Dutch%20language">Dutch</a> "tjiftjaf", the <a href="German%20language">German</a> "Zilpzalp" and <a href="Welsh%20language">Welsh</a> "siff-saff". The <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">binomial name</a> is of <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> origin; "Phylloscopus" comes from "phyllon"/φυλλον, "leaf", and "skopeo"/σκοπεω, "to look at" or "to see", since this genus comprises species that spend much of their time feeding in trees, while "collybita" is a corruption of "kollubistes", "money changer", the song being likened to the jingling of coins.

The common chiffchaff is a small, dumpy, 10–12 centimetres (4 in) long leaf warbler. The male weighs 7–8 grammes (0.28–0.31 oz), and the female 6–7 grammes (0.25–0.28 oz). The spring adult of the western <a href="Subspecies%23Nomenclature">nominate subspecies</a> " P. c. collybita" has brown-washed dull green upperparts, off-white underparts becoming yellowish on the flanks, and a short whitish <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a>. It has dark legs, a fine dark bill, and short <a href="Flight%20feather%23Primary%20extension">primary projection</a> (extension of the <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s beyond the folded wing). As the plumage wears, it gets duller and browner, and the yellow on the flanks tends to be lost, but after the breeding season there is a prolonged complete <a href="moulting">moult</a> before migration. The newly fledged juvenile is browner above than the adult, with yellow-white underparts, but moults about 10 weeks after acquiring its first plumage. After moulting, both the adult and the juvenile have brighter and greener upperparts and a paler supercilium. 

This warbler gets its name from its simple distinctive song, a repetitive cheerful "chiff-chaff". This song is one of the first <a href="bird">avian</a> signs that spring has returned. Its call is a "hweet", less <a href="syllable">disyllabic</a> than the "hooeet" of the willow warbler or "hu-it" of the <a href="western%20Bonelli%27s%20warbler">western Bonelli's warbler</a>.

The song differs from that of the Iberian chiffchaff, which has a shorter . However, mixed singers occur in the hybridisation zone and elsewhere, and can be difficult to allocate to species.

When not singing, the common chiffchaff can be difficult to distinguish from other leaf warblers with greenish upperparts and whitish underparts, particularly the willow warbler. However, that species has a longer primary projection, a sleeker, brighter appearance and generally pale legs. Bonelli's warbler ("P. bonelli)" might be confused with the common chiffchaff subspecies "tristis", but it has a plain face and green in the wings. The common chiffchaff also has rounded wings in flight, and a diagnostic tail movement consisting of a dip, then sidewards wag, that distinguishes it from other "Phylloscopus" warblers and gives rise to the name "tailwagger" in India.

Perhaps the greatest challenge is distinguishing non-singing birds of the nominate subspecies from Iberian chiffchaff in the field. In <a href="Great%20Britain">Great Britain</a> and the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, all accepted records of vagrant Iberian chiffchaffs relate to singing males.

The common chiffchaff breeds across Europe and Asia east to eastern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> and north to about 70°N, with isolated populations in northwest Africa, northern and western <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> and northwestern <a href="Iran">Iran</a>. It is migratory, but it is one of the first <a href="passerine">passerine</a> birds to return to its breeding areas in the spring and among the last to leave in late autumn. When breeding, it is a bird of open woodlands with some taller trees and ground cover for nesting purposes. These trees are typically at least 5 metres (16 ft) high, with undergrowth that is an open, poor to medium mix of grasses, <a href="bracken">bracken</a>, nettles or similar plants. Its breeding habitat is quite specific, and even near relatives do not share it; for example, the <a href="willow%20warbler">willow warbler</a> ("P. trochilus") prefers younger trees, while the <a href="wood%20warbler">wood warbler</a> ("P. sibilatrix") prefers less undergrowth. In winter, the common chiffchaff uses a wider range of habitats including scrub, and is not so dependent on trees. It is often found near water, unlike the willow warbler which tolerates drier habitats. There is an increasing tendency to winter in western Europe well north of the traditional areas, especially in coastal southern <a href="England">England</a> and the mild urban <a href="microclimate">microclimate</a> of <a href="London">London</a>. These overwintering common chiffchaffs include some visitors of the eastern subspecies "abietinus" and "tristis", so they are certainly not all birds which have bred locally, although some undoubtedly are.

The male common chiffchaff is highly territorial during the breeding season, with a core territory typically 20 metres (66 ft) across, which is fiercely defended against other males. Other small birds may also be attacked. The male is inquisitive and fearless, attacking even dangerous predators like the <a href="stoat">stoat</a> if they approach the nest, as well as egg-thieves like the <a href="Eurasian%20jay">Eurasian jay</a>. His song, given from a favoured prominent vantage point, appears to be used to advertise an established territory and contact the female, rather than as a paternity guard strategy.

Beyond the core territory, there is a larger feeding range which is variable in size, but typically ten or more times the area of the breeding territory. It is believed that the female has a larger feeding range than the male. After breeding has finished, this species abandons its territory, and may join small flocks including other warblers prior to migration.

The male common chiffchaff returns to its breeding territory two or three weeks before the female and immediately starts singing to establish ownership and attract a female. When a female is located, the male will use a slow butterfly-like flight as part of the courtship ritual, but once a pair-bond has been established, other females will be driven from the territory. The male has little involvement in the nesting process other than defending the territory. The female's nest is built on or near the ground in a concealed site in brambles, nettles or other dense low vegetation. The domed nest has a side entrance, and is constructed from coarse plant material such as dead leaves and grass, with finer material used on the interior before the addition of a lining of feathers. The typical nest is 12.5 centimetres (5 in) high and 11 centimetres (4 in) across.

The clutch is two to seven (normally five or six) cream-coloured eggs which have tiny ruddy, purple or blackish spots and are about 1.5 centimetres (0.6 in) long and 1.2 centimetres (0.5 in) across. They are incubated by the female for 13–14 days before hatching as naked, blind <a href="altricial">altricial</a> chicks. The female broods and feeds the chicks for another 14–15 days until they fledge. The male rarely participates in feeding, although this sometimes occurs, especially when bad weather limits insect supplies or if the female disappears. After fledging, the young stay in the vicinity of the nest for three to four weeks, and are fed by and roost with the female, although these interactions reduce after approximately the first 14 days. In the north of the range there is only time to raise one brood, due to the short summer, but a second brood is common in central and southern areas.

Although pairs stay together during the breeding season and <a href="polygamy">polygamy</a> is uncommon, even if the male and female return to the same site in the following year there is no apparent recognition or fidelity. Interbreeding with other species, other than those formerly considered as subspecies of "P. collybita", is rare, but a few examples are known of hybridisation with the willow warbler. Such hybrids give mixed songs, but the latter alone is not proof of interspecific breeding.

Like most Old World warblers, this small species is <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a>, moving restlessly though foliage or briefly hovering. It has been recorded as taking <a href="insect">insect</a>s, mainly <a href="fly">flies</a>, from more than 50 families, along with other small and medium-sized invertebrates. It will take the eggs and <a href="larva">larva</a>e of <a href="lepidoptera">butterflies and moths</a>, particularly those of the <a href="winter%20moth">winter moth</a>. The chiffchaff has been estimated to require about one-third of its weight in insects daily, and it feeds almost continuously in the autumn to put on extra fat as fuel for the long migration flight.

As with most small birds, mortality in the first year of life is high, but adults aged three to four years are regularly recorded, and the record is more than seven years. Eggs, chicks and fledglings of this ground-nesting species are taken by <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s, <a href="weasel">weasel</a>s and crows such as the <a href="European%20magpie">European magpie</a>, and the adults are hunted by <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>, particularly the <a href="Accipitridae">sparrowhawk</a>. Small birds are also at the mercy of the weather, particularly when migrating, but also on the breeding and wintering grounds.

The common chiffchaff is occasionally a host of <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasitic</a> <a href="cuckoo">cuckoo</a>s, including the <a href="common%20cuckoo">common</a> and <a href="Horsfield%27s%20cuckoo">Horsfield's cuckoo</a>s, but it recognises and rejects <a href="mimicry">non-mimetic</a> eggs and is therefore only rarely successfully brood-parasitised. Like other passerine birds, the common chiffchaff can also acquire intestinal <a href="nematode">nematode</a> parasites and external ticks.

The main effect of humans on this species is indirect, through woodland clearance which affects the habitat, predation by cats, and collisions with windows, buildings and cars. Only the first of these has the potential to seriously affect populations, but given the huge geographical spread of "P. c. abietinus" and "P. c. tristis", and woodland conservation policies in the range of "P. c. collybita", the chiffchaff's future seems assured.

The common chiffchaff has an enormous range, with an estimated global extent of 10 million square kilometres (3.8 million square miles) and a population of 60–120 million individuals in Europe alone. Although global population trends have not been quantified, the species is not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, the species is evaluated as "least concern".

None of the major subspecies is under threat, but "exsul", as noted above, is probably extinct. There is a slow population increase of common chiffchaff in the Czech Republic. The range of at least "P. c. collybita" seems to be expanding, with northward advances in <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a>, <a href="Norway">Norway</a> and <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a> and a large population increase in <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>.

Richard Gavin Reid

Richard Gavin "Dick" Reid (17 January 1879 – 17 October 1980) was a Canadian politician who served as the <a href="List%20of%20premiers%20of%20Alberta">sixth Premier</a> of <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> from 1934 to 1935. He was the last member of the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> (UFA) to hold the office, and that party's defeat at the hands of the upstart <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Alberta">Social Credit League</a> in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 election</a> made him the shortest serving premier to that point in Alberta's history.

Born near <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, Reid worked a number of jobs as a young adult—including wholesaler, army medic (during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>), farmhand, lumberjack, and dentist—and immigrated to Canada in 1903. He involved himself in local politics and joined the recently formed UFA, which nominated him to run in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201921">1921 provincial election</a> as its candidate in <a href="Vermilion%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Vermilion</a>. The UFA won the election, and Reid served in several capacities in the cabinets of Premiers <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a> and <a href="John%20Edward%20Brownlee">John Edward Brownlee</a>, where he established a reputation for competence and fiscal conservatism. When a <a href="John%20Brownlee%20sex%20scandal">sex scandal</a> forced Brownlee from office in 1934, Reid was the caucus' unanimous choice to succeed him as Premier.

When Reid took office, Alberta was experiencing the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20Canada">Great Depression</a>. Reid took measures to ease Albertans' suffering, but believed that inducing a full economic recovery was beyond the capacity of the provincial government. In this climate, Alberta voters were attracted to the economic theories of evangelical preacher <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>, who advocated a version of <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a>. Despite Reid's claims that Aberhart's proposals were economically and constitutionally unfeasible, Social Credit routed the UFA in the 1935 election; Reid's party did not retain a single seat. Reid lived forty-five years after his defeat, but these years were spent in obscurity; he never returned to political life.

Reid was born 17 January 1879 near Glasgow, Scotland, to George (1843–1913) and Margaret (Ogston) Reid (1850–1928). He attended school in Glasgow and worked for several years in the wholesale provisions business before enlisting in the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a>. He served in South Africa as a <a href="Lance-Sergeant">Lance-Sergeant</a> from 1900 to 1902 during the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, doing hospital duty, before returning to Scotland. There he began to plan his future, considering returning to South Africa to live before deciding on Canada.

He arrived in <a href="Killarney%2C%20Manitoba">Killarney</a>, <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, in 1903, where he worked as a farmhand during the harvest. When winter came, he found work as a lumberjack in <a href="Fort%20William%2C%20Ontario">Fort William, Ontario</a>. A voyage west followed, and he set up a homestead in east-central Alberta. Once there, he began to practice dentistry, drawing on his army experience. On 9 September 1919, he married Marion Stuart. They had three sons and two daughters.

Reid's political career began with four years on the municipal council of Buffalo Coulee, around present-day <a href="Vermilion%2C%20Alberta">Vermilion</a>. He spent two of these as <a href="Reeve%20%28Canada%29">Reeve</a>. He was instrumental in founding the Vermilion municipal hospital district, on whose board he served for many years. Federally, he was active with the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> <a href="Battle%20River">Battle River</a> Political Association, of which he became president.

Reid was nominated as the UFA candidate in <a href="Vermilion%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Vermilion</a> during the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201921">1921 provincial election</a>, the first in which the UFA ran candidates. The <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a> was dominated by the <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberals</a>, who had governed Alberta since its creation in 1905. To Reid's great surprise, he defeated his Liberal opponent and was elected to the legislature, along with 37 of his fellow UFA candidates—enough to form a <a href="majority%20government">majority government</a>. He chaired the first meeting of the new UFA caucus, at which it selected <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a> as Premier. Reid was re-elected in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201926">1926</a> and <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201930">1930 elections</a>.

Reid occupied high-ranking cabinet positions in Greenfield's government and that of his successor, <a href="John%20Edward%20Brownlee">John Edward Brownlee</a>. Greenfield appointed him Minister of Health and Minister of Municipal Affairs in 1921. In the former capacity, he drew on his past experience with the Vermilion board in establishing new municipal health boards. He also proposed a program of <a href="eugenics">eugenics</a> through the sterilisation of the mentally handicapped, which in 1928 led to the "<a href="Sexual%20Sterilization%20Act%20of%20Alberta">Sexual Sterilization Act of Alberta</a>". As an advocate of government-wide economy, he laid off all school inspection nurses and many public health nurses. This inclination towards thrift was also evident in his performance as Minister of Municipal Affairs, in which he resisted a 1926 call from several municipalities to transfer a greater proportion of the responsibility for caring for indigents to the province. In 1929, he disagreed with them again when he insisted that they be responsible for 10% of the old age pensions paid to their residents.

In 1923 Greenfield moved Reid out of both of his portfolios and made him Provincial Treasurer, where he perpetuated his fiscal conservatism across the government. Early in his tenure, he presented a brief to cabinet recommending that ministers reduce their budgets and that the government create a purchasing department tasked with coordinating spending on supplies. In these proposals he found a close ally in Brownlee, Greenfield's Attorney-General, and when Brownlee succeeded Greenfield as Premier in 1925 he kept Reid as Provincial Treasurer and re-appointed him as Minister of Municipal Affairs. Brownlee and Reid had a history of working closely not only on fiscal issues, but also on agricultural ones: in July 1923, they had travelled together to investigate the creation of a <a href="wheat%20pool">wheat pool</a> in Alberta. This trip included a meeting with cooperative pioneer <a href="Aaron%20Sapiro">Aaron Sapiro</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> and a visit to <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>'s <a href="commodity%20market">commodity market</a>. Both Reid and Brownlee concluded that a pool ought to be proceeded with cautiously, if at all, though this view was overruled when a later visit by Sapiro to Alberta generated sufficient enthusiasm that the government had little choice but to go along with the creation of the <a href="Alberta%20Wheat%20Pool">Alberta Wheat Pool</a>.

With Brownlee as premier and Reid as Provincial Treasurer, government deficits ceased: the budget showed a surplus in every year from 1925 until 1930, except for 1927. In 1929, Reid predicted that Alberta was on the cusp of a period of economic expansion; instead, he was soon confronted with the Great Depression. He drastically cut provincial spending and raised taxes, in part by creating a new <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>. He reluctantly accepted that these measures could not prevent a return to <a href="deficit%20spending">deficit spending</a>. His willingness to outspend revenues was due less to any <a href="Keynesian">Keynesian</a> desire to stimulate the economy than to a belief that there was no further spending to be cut or further taxes that could reasonably be raised. Conversely, he rejected calls from the opposition Liberals to cut taxes as a stimulus measure.

Though Brownlee was no more enthusiastic than Reid about deficits, his continued confidence in his Provincial Treasurer was evidenced by his decision to give him yet another ministerial portfolio. In 1930 Brownlee secured Alberta's long-sought control over its natural resources from the federal government, and he appointed Reid Alberta's first Minister of Lands and Mines on 10 October 1930. In this capacity, Reid favoured private over public ownership. He opposed calls from his own party to promote government-developed <a href="hydroelectricity">hydroelectricity</a> projects, and viewed the provincially owned railways as a burden to the government, though they finally turned a profit in 1927. He was a leading advocate of selling them to private interests, a course that was eventually followed in 1929.

In 1934, Brownlee was implicated in a <a href="John%20Brownlee%20sex%20scandal">sex scandal</a>, as a young family friend and her father sued him for seduction. By Reid's account, he had to convince his premier not to quit "hundreds of times". When the jury found in favour of the plaintiffs, however, Brownlee had no choice, and resigned effective 10 July 1934. Reid was the most prominent minister in the cabinet and among the most popular, and was the UFA caucus' unanimous choice to take over. He also replaced Brownlee as <a href="Provincial%20Secretary">Provincial Secretary</a> and installed himself in the newly created position of <a href="Treasury%20Board">Treasury Board</a> President.

The UFA was in an uncertain position when Reid became Premier; besides Brownlee's resignation, longtime Minister of Public Works <a href="Oran%20McPherson">Oran McPherson</a> was in the midst of a scandalous divorce and had also left cabinet, and UFA MLAs <a href="Peter%20Miskew">Peter Miskew</a> and <a href="Omer%20St.%20Germain">Omer St. Germain</a> had <a href="Crossing%20the%20floor">crossed the floor</a> to the Liberals. Additionally, the province's economic condition remained poor. Liberal leader <a href="William%20R.%20Howson">William R. Howson</a> tried to take advantage of this to undermine the government and position himself as the province's next Premier; he attacked Reid relentlessly for what he alleged were spendthrift habits, and suggested the province's tax rates were causing the confiscation of family homes. Reid asserted in response that Alberta's taxes had decreased since 1921, and criticised Howson for simultaneously attacking government spending and demanding new infrastructure projects.

In the meantime, Reid's government took a number of policy initiatives. It passed legislation authorizing the government purchase of cattle from farmers who could no longer afford feed, and worked out a cost-sharing agreement with the federal government and the railways to relocate farmers fleeing the province's dust belt. Reid also called for the creation of a <a href="Canadian%20Wheat%20Board">federal wheat marketing board</a>, and proposed legislation—the "Agricultural Industry Stabilisation Act"—that protected from creditors any portion of a farmer's revenue that was used on operating costs for his farm or living expenses for his family. Despite these measures, Reid found himself at odds with his party's membership, which was reacting to the Great Depression by following an increasingly <a href="socialism">socialist</a> path. He found UFA President <a href="Robert%20Gardiner%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Robert Gardiner</a> to be of the "far left", and considered the <a href="Cooperative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Cooperative Commonwealth Federation</a>, in whose founding many UFA members had participated, to be an "unholy amalgamation". Even so, his government experimented with a form of universal <a href="health%20insurance">health insurance</a>, to be jointly funded by government, employers, and employees, that would provide Albertans with free medical, dental, and hospital care; the project was to be launched as a <a href="pilot%20project">pilot project</a> in <a href="Camrose%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Camrose</a>, but was never begun because of the intervention of the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201935">1935 election</a>. More controversially, Reid's government reacted to McPherson's divorce and its attendant coverage by proposing to ban newspapers from covering divorce proceedings, a proposal that prompted Liberal MLA <a href="Joseph%20Miville%20Dechene">Joseph Miville Dechene</a> to compare Reid to <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a>, <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Mussolini</a>, and <a href="Joseph%20Stalin">Stalin</a>.

A more dangerous opponent than Howson was <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>, the <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> preacher who was proposing a form of <a href="social%20credit">social credit</a> to cure the province's ills. Social credit, the brainchild of British engineer <a href="C.%20H.%20Douglas">C. H. Douglas</a>, purported to bridge the gap between a society's production and its <a href="purchasing%20power">purchasing power</a>; Aberhart maintained that this gap was the source of Alberta's economic hardships. Reid was leery of Aberhart though he, like most politicians of the era, pronounced himself in favour of Douglas's philosophy. <a href="Tim%20Byrne">T. C. Byrne</a> suggests that this expressed support was dishonest, that Reid considered social credit in all of its forms to be "complete nonsense", and paid it <a href="%3Awikt%3Alip%20service">lip service</a> only because of its popularity among voters.

Though he was gaining adherents, Aberhart insisted that his aim was not to enter politics, but to persuade existing parties to adopt social credit in their platforms. To this end, he appeared at the UFA convention of 15 January 1935. The night before, he organised a reception for delegates. Besides Aberhart, it featured actors portraying two characters of whom Aberhart had been making considerable use in presentations around the province: the Man from Mars, who expressed bewilderment that poverty could exist in the midst of plenty and that governments were doing nothing about it, and Kant B. Dunn, who brought up <a href="straw%20man">straw man</a> arguments against social credit for Aberhart to dismantle. Another of Aberhart's characters, the bumbling socialist C. C. Heifer, did not make an appearance; Aberhart biographers David Elliott and Iris Miller suggest that this was to avoid alienating the many UFA members who supported socialism.

The next day, the UFA began debate on a resolution that read
Resolved that a system of social credit as outlined by William Aberhart, Calgary, be put in as a plank in the UFA provincial platform to be brought before the electorate at the next provincial election.
Debate was vigorous. One delegate said that UFA members wanted social credit, and if they could not get it through the UFA they would find other means. After three hours, UFA Vice President Norman Priestly noted in frustration that delegates were debating the merits of "a system of social credit as outlined by" Aberhart without ever having heard Aberhart outline his proposed system. It was agreed to invite Aberhart to appear. Using the analogy of blood flowing through the human body, he argued that the of blood contained in the human body were sufficient for the heart to pump much more than that per day; so it was, he argued, with currency, whose circulation needed to be accelerated to enhance Albertans' purchasing power. He closed by expressing pessimism that the delegates would choose to support social credit, and this pessimism proved well-founded: though sources are inconsistent on the precise outcome—journalist John Barr reports that the exact vote was not recorded, while historian Bradford Rennie states there were 30 affirmative votes out of 400 delegates present—there is agreement that the resolution was handily defeated. While the vote appeared to be a decisive victory for Reid and his fellow traditionalists, Byrne suggests that many members <a href="abstained">abstained</a>.

The threat from within apparently defeated, Reid and his government turned their attention to the threat from without: the convention's repudiation had convinced Aberhart that his <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Alberta">Social Credit League</a> must run candidates in the next election. Reid's defence took two forms. The first was an overt attack on Aberhart and his policies. He insisted that Aberhart's proposed "monthly credit dividends" of <a href="C%24">C$</a>25 could not be issued unless taxes increased tenfold. He argued that Aberhart's proposed means of raising revenue—"unearned increments" and "production levies"—were actually disguised taxes, which would be paid primarily by farmers, and that his claims that the necessary credit could be created "at the stroke of a fountain pen" on an accounting ledger were absurd. He further pointed out that elements of Aberhart's plan, including the provincial government's entry into banking and the creation of a provincial <a href="tariff">tariff</a>, were "<a href="ultra%20vires">ultra vires</a>" the province under the <a href="Canadian%20constitution">Canadian constitution</a>. These themes were expounded on by Priestly and Brownlee, both of whom undertook speaking tours and radio addresses, and by legal and economic experts commissioned by the government.

The second element of Reid's approach was to call into question Aberhart's understanding of social credit by exposing inconsistencies between his statements and the theories advanced by Douglas. Douglas and Aberhart did not like each other, and Douglas did not believe that Aberhart fully understood his theories; though he declined to comment publicly, one of his deputies once called one of Aberhart's pamphlets "fallacious from start to finish". Hoping to capitalize on this rift, Reid invited Douglas to come to Alberta and serve as "Economic Reconstruction Advisor" at an annual fee of $2,500 plus a $2,000 expense allowance for each of his annual three-week trips to the province. Douglas accepted. Angered that the government had incurred this sizable expense without consulting the legislature, <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Conservative</a> leader <a href="David%20Milwyn%20Duggan">David Duggan</a> introduced a motion calling on Aberhart to be hired in a similar capacity. This suited Reid, who hoped that by inducing both men to submit detailed plans he would at last have something concrete from Aberhart to attack, and something equally concrete from Douglas with which to contrast it. Aberhart confounded Reid's plan by declining his offer. Douglas, for his part, provided mixed results: on his way to Edmonton he publicly repudiated Aberhart's impugned pamphlet and also pronounced himself against the creation of a provincial social credit political vehicle. On the other hand, shortly after his arrival he sent Aberhart a letter, gleefully released by Aberhart, asserting that there was no conflict between the "Douglas" and "Aberhart" versions of social credit. Moreover, his interim report to the government concerned itself primarily with political and legal, rather than economic, realities: he recommended setting up a provincially controlled media outlet to counter the anti-social credit propaganda he anticipated from the privately owned press, organizing a provincial government credit institution, and accumulating a stockpile of currency, stocks, and bonds. He also suggested that the UFA might need to form a <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a> to implement social credit. The report was of little use to Reid's government, so he had his Attorney-General, <a href="John%20Lymburn">John Lymburn</a>, ask Douglas to critique one of Aberhart's radio broadcasts. Douglas demurred, and made only vague comments about minor technical errors in the transcript.

Reid's approach to combating Aberhart's influence had failed. The first element, attacking the validity of Aberhart's ideas directly, had failed because much of the Alberta public, in abject poverty, was not interested in hearing economic and legal arguments against social credit. This state of mind was illustrated by a voter's comments to Brownlee on Aberhart's proposals:
Mr. Brownlee, we have listened to you with a great deal of attention and the answers you have given seem pretty hard to meet. But I have one more question ... I'm selling my wheat at 25 cents a bushel. If I tried to sell a steer tomorrow I'd probably hardly get enough to pay the freight. I get three cents a dozen for eggs. I'm lucky to get a dollar for a can of cream. Will you tell me what I've got to lose?
The second part of the strategy, contrasting Aberhart's proposals with Douglas's, failed largely because both men were too evasive in their statements to make any kind of direct comparison of their views. <a href="Lakeland%20College%20%28Alberta%29">Lakeland College</a> historian Franklin Foster offers an additional explanation: when Albertans were exposed to the charismatic evangelist Aberhart and the dry technocrat Douglas, they preferred the former, irrespective of credentials or economic expertise.

When the election came in August 1935, Aberhart offered economic recovery while Reid offered criticisms of Aberhart. Highlighting the UFA's record of clean government, low taxes, and fiscal responsibility, Reid committed himself and his government to bringing a sense of security. More tangibly, he promised to build a government <a href="oil%20refinery">oil refinery</a> (predicting that "the near future will witness the greatest explorations for oil which this province has ever known"). Most of the campaign was conducted around Social Credit's promise to pull the province out of depression with its monetary theories. Reid alleged that Aberhart's policies would destroy the province's credit and leave it unable to borrow the money it needed to carry on, but voters—even those sceptical of Social Credit's promises—saw no alternative hopes offered by the UFA. On 11 August, election day, every UFA MLA was defeated; Reid himself finished third in his riding, barely ahead of the <a href="Communist%20Party%20%28Alberta%29">Communist</a> candidate, and resigned as Premier effective 22 August.

Time would prove Reid correct in most of his criticisms of Aberhart: he did lack a specific economic agenda, much of his legislation was struck down by the courts, and the depression did continue for several more years in Alberta. This was of cold comfort to Reid, whose defeat was total: at 408 days, his time as Premier was the shortest in the province's history to that point.

After the election, Reid orchestrated a quick transfer of power. The Social Credit victory had provoked a <a href="bank%20run">bank run</a>, and he wanted to re-establish stability as quickly as possible. Moreover, the province needed to borrow a large sum of money to meet even its short-term obligations, and the UFA, as a <a href="lame%20duck%20%28politics%29">lame duck</a> government, was unable to make promises to would-be creditors. Once in office, confronted with a dire financial situation, Aberhart accused the UFA government of mismanagement. Reid responded in January 1936 that there had been no such mismanagement, that the province's financial problems were due to Social Credit's policies, both real and promised, and that had the UFA won re-election in 1935 it could have continued governing without serious difficulty. He also resisted insinuations that it had been too restrained in helping impoverished farmers: as late as 1969 he was offering the view that shrinking sources of provincial revenue made further assistance impossible.

Apart from these occasional forays defending his record, Reid withdrew from politics. He became a commission agent, and later the librarian for <a href="Canadian%20Utilities">Canadian Utilities Limited</a>. For this latter role, he was made an honorary member of the Edmonton Library Association. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, he served on the Canadian government's mobilisation board. Richard Reid died in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> 17 October 1980 at the age of 101. He was <a href="cremation">cremated</a>, and his ashes buried in Edmonton.

Historians generally view Reid as a victim of circumstance: like many governments across Canada, his was defeated by the Great Depression. Rennie argues that Reid's approach to government, frugal and non-interventionist, was well-suited to the prosperous 1920s but less so to the 1930s, and highlights his lack of charisma. But he also writes that virtually nobody could have won the 1935 election for the UFA. Foster agrees, assessing Reid as "a quietly competent, gentle man" who "merited the confidence of his colleagues", but who was in 1935 "distinctly out of his element". As Rennie closes, "In 1935 Albertans wanted a saviour. Richard Gavin Reid was a mere mortal."

Charles Stewart (Canadian politician)

Charles Stewart, (August 26, 1868 – December 6, 1946) was a <a href="Canadians">Canadian</a> politician who served as the <a href="List%20of%20premiers%20of%20Alberta">third Premier of Alberta</a> from 1917 until 1921. Born in <a href="Strabane%2C%20Ontario">Strabane, Ontario</a>, in <a href="Wentworth%20County%2C%20Ontario">Wentworth County</a>, Stewart was a farmer who moved west to <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> after his farm was destroyed by a storm. There he became active in politics and was elected to the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a> in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201909">1909 election</a>. He served as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Municipal Affairs—the first person to hold the latter position in Alberta—in the government of <a href="Arthur%20Sifton">Arthur Sifton</a>. When Sifton left provincial politics in 1917 to join the federal cabinet, Stewart was named his replacement.

As premier, Stewart tried to hold together his <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal Party</a>, which was divided by the <a href="Conscription%20Crisis%20of%201917">Conscription Crisis of 1917</a>. He endeavoured to enforce <a href="Prohibition%20in%20Canada">prohibition of alcoholic beverages</a>, which had been enshrined in law by a referendum during Sifton's premiership, but found that the law was not widely enough supported to be effectively policed. His government took over several of the province's financially troubled railroads, and guaranteed bonds sold to fund irrigation projects. Several of these policies were the result of lobbying by the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> (UFA), with which Stewart enjoyed good relations; even so, the UFA was politicized during Stewart's premiership and ran candidates in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201921">1921 election</a>. Unable to match the UFA's appeal to rural voters, Stewart's government was defeated at the polls and he was succeeded as premier by <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a>.

After leaving provincial politics, Stewart was invited to join the federal cabinet of <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a>, in which he served as Minister of the Interior and Mines. In this capacity he signed, on behalf of the federal government, an agreement that transferred control of Alberta's natural resources from Ottawa to the provincial government—a concession he had been criticized for being unable to negotiate as Premier. He served in King's cabinet until 1930, when the King government was defeated, but remained a member of Parliament until he lost his seat in 1935. He died in December 1946 in Ottawa.

Charles Stewart was born on August 26, 1868, in <a href="Strabane%2C%20Ontario">Strabane, Ontario</a>, on <a href="Wentworth%20County%2C%20Ontario">Wentworth County</a>, to Charles and Catherine Stewart. Charles Sr. was a <a href="stonemasonry">stonemason</a> and farmer. As a child, Charles Jr. accompanied his father to <a href="Carlisle%2C%20Middlesex%20County%2C%20Ontario">Carlisle</a> to hear Canadian Prime Minister Sir <a href="John%20A.%20Macdonald">John A. Macdonald</a>. According to family lore, Macdonald noticed the young future Premier and told him that he was a fine boy who would make a good politician someday. When Charles Jr. was 16, he moved with his family to a farm near <a href="Barrie%2C%20Ontario">Barrie</a>. Seven years later, on December 17, 1891, he married Jane Russell Sneath; the pair had eight children. After marrying Sneath, he converted to her <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> faith.

In 1892, Charles Sr. died, leaving his son in charge of the family farm. Twelve years later, this farm was destroyed by a storm, and Stewart decided to move west, settling near <a href="Killam%2C%20Alberta">Killam, Alberta</a> in 1906. His family endured a cold winter—the warmest place in their shack was on the kitchen table, so they kept the baby there—and in the spring their crops were destroyed by hail. As he was unsuccessful at farming, he supplemented his income using the stonemason's skills he had learned from his father: he laid foundations for the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, worked on the <a href="High%20Level%20Bridge%20%28Edmonton%29">High Level Bridge</a> in <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>, and dug Killam's town well. He later worked in real estate and as a farm implement dealer, earning enough to buy a new and larger homestead in 1912.

Stewart was active in his local community: he was the first chair of the Killam School District, attended the first meeting of Killam ratepayers on January 19, 1907, and was involved in the incorporation of Killam in January 1908. In 1909, the <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Alberta Liberal Party</a>, which had dominated provincial politics throughout Alberta's short history, came seeking a candidate to run in the new <a href="riding%20%28politics%29">riding</a> of <a href="Sedgewick%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Sedgewick</a>. Stewart agreed to run and was elected by <a href="acclamation">acclamation</a> in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201909">1909 election</a>.

At the time of Stewart's acclamation, Premier <a href="Alexander%20Cameron%20Rutherford">Alexander Cameron Rutherford</a> seemed unassailable: he controlled 36 of the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a>'s 41 seats (Stewart's being one), and his Liberals had just won nearly sixty percent of the vote in their re-election bid. Months later, however, Rutherford and his government were embroiled in the <a href="Alberta%20and%20Great%20Waterways%20Railway%20scandal">Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal</a>, and the Liberal Party was split. Initially, Stewart remained loyal to Rutherford, and went so far as to allege in the legislature that insurgent Liberal <a href="John%20R.%20Boyle">John R. Boyle</a> had offered two members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), who were also hotel keepers, immunity from prosecution for liquor violations if they would support a new government in which Boyle was <a href="Attorney-General">Attorney-General</a>. As additional details of the scandal emerged, however, Stewart himself became an insurgent, and was pleased when <a href="Arthur%20Sifton">Arthur Sifton</a> replaced Rutherford as Premier.

In May 1912, Sifton expanded his cabinet, and Stewart was made the province's first Minister of Municipal Affairs. As was required by the custom of the day when an MLA was appointed to cabinet, he resigned his seat to run in a <a href="by-election">by-election</a>, in which he easily defeated <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Conservative</a> <a href="William%20John%20Blair">William John Blair</a>. In cabinet, he became known as an advocate of public ownership of utilities, which placed him more in sympathy with the Conservative opposition than with Sifton. Despite this position, he backed Sifton's 1913 resolution to the Alberta and Great Waterways problem, which involved partnering with the private sector; this vote marked the first time that the Liberal caucus was united on the railways question since before the scandal broke in 1910.

In December 1913, Sifton moved Stewart from Municipal Affairs into the Public Works portfolio; in this capacity, Stewart played a major role in the incorporation of the <a href="Alberta%20Farmers%27%20Co-operative%20Elevator%20Company">Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company</a>, which was a farmer-run co-operative with a charter to own and operate <a href="grain%20elevator">grain elevator</a>s.

Shortly after the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201917">1917 provincial election</a> (in which Stewart and the Liberals were both soundly re-elected), Canada found itself embroiled in a <a href="Conscription%20crisis%20of%201917">conscription crisis</a>. The federal <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29">Conservative</a> government, led by <a href="Robert%20Borden">Robert Borden</a>, supported implementing conscription. The opposition Liberals, led by <a href="Wilfrid%20Laurier">Wilfrid Laurier</a>, nominally opposed conscription, but many English-speaking Liberals in fact supported it. The crisis was resolved when Borden formed a <a href="Unionist%20Party%20%28Canada%29">Union</a> government composed of Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals. Sifton, falling into the latter group, was chosen as Alberta's representative in that government, and resigned as Premier in October 1917. <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Alberta">Lieutenant-Governor</a> <a href="Robert%20Brett">Robert Brett</a>, accepting Sifton's choice of successor, asked Stewart to form a government. His only serious rival for the position of premier was <a href="Charles%20Wilson%20Cross">Charles Wilson Cross</a>, who opposed conscription and was therefore not a palatable choice for much of the Liberal establishment.

The Alberta and Great Waterways scandal had opened up a rift in the provincial Liberal Party, between those who remained loyal to Cross and Rutherford and those who did not, with the latter group being led by <a href="William%20Henry%20Cushing">William Henry Cushing</a> and <a href="Frank%20Oliver%20%28politician%29">Frank Oliver</a>. Sifton had papered over, if not in fact healed, this rift, and it did not burst open again until the conscription crisis. This time, however, the fault lines were different: Cross and Oliver had put aside their longtime enmity to join in opposing conscription, and Sifton, who had been selected Premier in part because he was not identified with either faction in the old feud, was Alberta's most prominent pro-conscription Liberal.

Stewart was a supporter of conscription and of the Union government, but did not take any active part in the acrimonious <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201917">1917 federal election</a>, which was fought on the issue. Several of his ministers were not so circumspect: Attorney-General Cross, Education Minister Boyle, and Municipal Affairs Minister <a href="Wilfrid%20Gari%C3%A9py">Wilfrid Gariépy</a> campaigned for the <a href="Laurier%20Liberals">Laurier Liberals</a>; Public Works Minister <a href="Archibald%20J.%20McLean">Archibald J. McLean</a> and Treasurer <a href="Charles%20R.%20Mitchell">Charles R. Mitchell</a> stayed out of the fray while leaving no doubt of their support for Union. During the first legislative session after this election, Stewart came under attack from members of his own party. <a href="Alexander%20Grant%20MacKay">Alexander Grant MacKay</a> criticized his failure to take advantage of the recent conference of premiers to press for the transfer of rights over Alberta's natural resources from the federal to the provincial government (Sifton had made this a priority during the pre-war years, but had largely ceased his advocacy on the breakout of hostilities), and <a href="James%20Gray%20Turgeon">James Gray Turgeon</a> attacked the government's policy of levying taxes for the support of soldiers' dependants on the grounds that he considered it a federal responsibility.
Divisions within the provincial Liberals came to a head in August 1918, when Stewart dismissed Cross as Attorney-General. It later emerged that Cross had refused to fire two detectives in his department after Stewart had concluded that their work would be better done by the provincial police, and that Stewart had found Cross's work to be generally poor. He had asked for Cross's resignation, received no response, and rescinded the <a href="Order%20in%20Council">Order in Council</a> appointing him. In an effort to secure Cross's departure from politics, Stewart offered him the position of Alberta's provincial agent in <a href="London%2C%20England">London, England</a>; Cross refused it, and Stewart was criticized for using appointments for political advantage.

Alberta had implemented <a href="prohibition%20in%20Canada">prohibition</a> in 1916 as the result of a <a href="referendum">referendum</a> supported by the powerful <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> (UFA) lobby group. By the time Stewart took office, it was becoming apparent that the policy was not being universally complied with: Conservative MLA <a href="George%20Douglas%20Stanley">George Douglas Stanley</a> alleged that judges were often <a href="Hangover">hungover</a> when they sat in judgment of those accused of violating liquor laws, and Cross's replacement as Attorney-General, John Boyle, admitted that in his estimation 65% of the province's male population broke the Prohibition Act. In 1921 the government realized profits of $800,000 on alcohol legally sold for "medicinal" purposes, and Boyle estimated <a href="rum-running">bootleggers</a>' profits at nine times that figure. Stewart blamed the problems on insufficient public support for the law, but even as he did so it was clear that there was not enough support to repeal it.

Prohibition was not the only UFA-endorsed policy to have been passed by Sifton's government: indeed, the legislation that allowed for citizen-initiated referenda of the sort that had led to prohibition was itself the result of UFA advocacy. Once Stewart became Premier, he committed to the introduction of another UFA-favoured democratic reform—<a href="proportional%20representation">proportional representation</a>. However, a committee formed to examine the possibility disintegrated over what historian Carrol Jaques calls "battles within the group and a general dislike of the concept".

Railway development had dominated the premierships of Stewart's predecessors and, while losing political potency as an issue, it was still a matter that demanded his attention. Though Sifton had established a railway policy in 1913 that was satisfactory to all wings of the Liberal Party, the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> the following year had all but put an end to railway construction across Canada. Once peace came, Albertans living near promised but as yet unbuilt lines began to clamour for their completion. The private companies with whom the government had partnered, however, were in no position to undertake the construction. The Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway was taken over by the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, with a clause in the agreement requiring the provincial government to spend $1 million to improve the route, and the Alberta and Great Waterways was taken over by Stewart's government directly (J. D. McArthur, the line's previous owner, retained an option to repurchase it, but it was never exercised).

<a href="Irrigation">Irrigation</a> projects also occupied much of Stewart's attention as Premier. As with railways, the First World War had disrupted planned irrigation projects, and Albertan farmers, especially those from the arid <a href="Southern%20Alberta">south</a>, were eager to see them resumed. Specifically popular was a project to irrigate in <a href="Lethbridge%20County">Lethbridge County</a>, but when <a href="bond%20%28finance%29">bonds</a> were issued to finance the project, they did not sell. Stewart sought federal backing of the bonds, but Prime Minister <a href="Arthur%20Meighen">Arthur Meighen</a> declined. Stewart reluctantly agreed to offer a provincial guarantee, but to avoid negative reaction from <a href="northern%20Alberta">northern Alberta</a> he linked the enabling legislation to one allowing for <a href="drainage">drainage</a> in northern areas.

The <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> had its beginnings as a farmers' advocacy organization; Stewart, a farmer, had joined it. The UFA had achieved several successes in dealing with the Sifton government, and Stewart also endeavoured to cooperate with it. The irrigation project was strongly supported by the UFA, as was Stewart's action on proportional representation. When <a href="Peace%20River%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Peace River</a> MLA <a href="William%20Archibald%20Rae">William Archibald Rae</a> introduced legislation to allow <a href="Imperial%20Oil">Imperial Oil</a> to build a <a href="pipeline%20transport">pipeline</a> in the province, UFA President <a href="Henry%20Wise%20Wood">Henry Wise Wood</a> sent Stewart a telegram of protest, as he believed that pipelines should be <a href="common%20carrier">common carrier</a>s; Stewart read it in the legislature, and Rae's bill was withdrawn. Even given the victories, the UFA was not satisfied with the government's record: in 1918, the government took action on only three of the many resolutions the UFA had sent to it.

Some in the UFA had long favoured contesting elections directly as a political party instead of remaining on the sidelines as a pressure group, but Wood and other UFA leaders were implacably opposed to the idea. During the war, however, the political wing began to gain momentum, and at the 1919 UFA convention, it was decided that UFA candidates would contest the next provincial election. In fact, it ended up doing so somewhat sooner: in 1919, <a href="Charles%20W.%20Fisher">Charles W. Fisher</a>, Liberal MLA for <a href="Cochrane%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Cochrane</a>, died as a result of that year's <a href="influenza">influenza</a> epidemic, and a by-election was necessitated to replace him. The UFA's <a href="Alex%20Moore%20%28politician%29">Alex Moore</a> defeated his only opponent, Liberal Edward V. Thomson, by 835 votes to 708.

Stewart felt betrayed: "It has been my fight ever since I became a minister to see that the farmers of the province were having a square deal," he remarked, "and I think I have done this with some success." Despite his general sympathy with the aims of the UFA, he could not support their transition into a political party. For one, he disagreed with the UFA's belief that politics should be conducted along <a href="social%20class">class</a>, rather than ideological, lines. Stewart believed that "the more strongly armed the classes become the harder will it be to get the things we really need in our government" and asserted that "I never did and never will have any desire to form a coalition with anybody except with men who think the same as I do."

Given the UFA's formal adoption of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier. While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart "an honourable, upright citizen, doing the best he could under difficult circumstances" and boasted that "if I have got to tear down the character of an honourable man to build up something that I want, I am not going to build it up." When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier. After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to "old style politics," the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader), but he announced otherwise.

The last provincial election had been held in June 1917, and four years was the normal life of a legislature in Canada. Stewart called an election for July 19. Though the Liberals' fortunes had been sagging in the post-war years, there remained no doubt that they could again defeat the Conservatives; their real challenge was evidently from the newly politicized UFA. Bolstering this challenge by increasing farmers' discontent was a collapse of agricultural prices. The UFA had no leader, no fixed platform, and no inclination to attack Stewart or his government. What it did have was superior organization, and on election day this organization made itself felt in the form of thirty-nine UFA members elected to fourteen Liberals. Stewart, who has been acclaimed in his own riding of Sedgewick, announced that he would resign as Premier as soon as the UFA had selected somebody to replace him. Once it selected <a href="Herbert%20Greenfield">Herbert Greenfield</a>, Stewart made good on his pledge, and Greenfield replaced him August 13.

In Jaques' view, Stewart was defined by what he was not: 
he was not involved in any of the railway scandals, current or past; he was not conspicuously involved in any of the personal battles that had consumed Alexander Rutherford, Frank Oliver, the brothers Arthur and Clifford Sifton, Charles Cross, or any of their followers; he was not a high-powered flamboyant Liberal partisan; he did not let himself get involved in federal Liberal Party machinations over issues such as the conscription crisis; nor did he seem to be high-handed or dictatorial—a criticism levelled at his predecessor, Arthur Sifton.

She argues that he was a "decent family man" whose career was a product of the circumstances in which he found himself.

Historian L. G. Thomas recognized Stewart's admirable qualities, but criticized him for lacking Sifton's "ruthless and forceful leadership" and claimed that "few provincial premiers have been more universally praised by their opponents and more unanimously deplored by their supporters." Even so, he acknowledged that the decisive factor in Stewart's downfall was not anything that he did, but the decision by the UFA to run candidates in 1921; in Thomas's view, Sifton would have been defeated in 1917 if he had had to contend with a politicized UFA.

Mount Charles Stewart is located in the Bow Valley just north of Canmore. The peak was named for him in 1928.

Following the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201921">1921 federal election</a>, <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie%20King">William Lyon Mackenzie King</a>'s Liberals came to power in Ottawa. They had not won any seats in Alberta, and Stewart was invited to join King's cabinet as Minister of the Interior and Mines (which included responsibility as Superintendent-General of Indian Affairs). He won a 1922 by-election in the <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> seat of <a href="Argenteuil%20%28electoral%20district%29">Argenteuil</a>, before shifting to the more familiar territory of <a href="Edmonton%20West">Edmonton West</a> in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201925">1925 election</a>; he was re-elected there in <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201926">1926</a> and <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201930">1930</a>. In the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201935">1935 election</a>, he ran in the new riding of <a href="Jasper%E2%80%94Edson">Jasper—Edson</a>, where he was defeated by <a href="Social%20Credit%20Party%20of%20Canada">Social Crediter</a> <a href="Walter%20Frederick%20Kuhl">Walter Frederick Kuhl</a>.

As a cabinet minister, Stewart aggressively marketed Canada's coal both domestically and internationally, for which he was honoured by Alberta's coal producers at a banquet and later awarded the <a href="Robert%20Randolph%20Bruce">Randolph Bruce</a> Gold Medal in Science by the <a href="Canadian%20Institute%20of%20Mining%20and%20Metallurgy">Canadian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy</a>. He took a great interest in <a href="water%20power">water power</a>, and advised the government on jurisdictional issues surrounding the <a href="Niagara%20River">Niagara</a>, <a href="St.%20Mary%20River%20%28Montana-Alberta%29">St. Mary</a>, and <a href="Milk%20River%20%28Montana-Alberta%29">Milk Rivers</a>. In 1927, he served as Canada's representative at the <a href="League%20of%20Nations">League of Nations</a>. As Minister of the Interior, he oversaw the 1927 creation of <a href="Prince%20Albert%20National%20Park">Prince Albert National Park</a>. Ironically, given the attacks he had sustained as Premier from Alexander Grant MacKay, he was part of the federal delegation that finally negotiated the transfer of resource control from the federal to the Alberta provincial government in December 1929. The same agreement transferred resource rights to <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> and <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>. After it was signed but before it took effect, Manitoba Premier <a href="John%20Bracken">John Bracken</a> concluded an agreement with the Winnipeg Electric Company, a private concern, to develop a <a href="hydroelectric%20dam">hydroelectric dam</a> at Seven Sisters' Reach. Because resource rights were still controlled by the federal government, the deal required federal approval. Stewart advocated withholding this approval in deference to Manitoba public opinion, which favoured public ownership of such projects, but King honoured a provision of the resource transfer agreement that required the wishes of provincial governments to be respected until the transfer was complete and granted approval. Stewart's preference for public over private ownership extended to King's planned creation of the <a href="Bank%20of%20Canada">Bank of Canada</a>; Stewart wanted the new institution entirely under the control of the government, but King preferred an arrangement whereby half of its directors would be appointed by the government and half by private shareholders and suggested that advocates of public ownership might find themselves more at home in the socialist <a href="Cooperative%20Commonwealth%20Federation">Cooperative Commonwealth Federation</a> than in his Liberal caucus.

Despite Stewart's involvement in transferring resource rights to Alberta, his relationship with the UFA government that had defeated him in 1921 was frosty: <a href="Lakeland%20College%20%28Alberta%29">Lakeland College</a> historian Franklin Foster, in his biography of UFA Premier <a href="John%20Edward%20Brownlee">John Edward Brownlee</a>, alleges that this antipathy influenced Stewart's preference for private corporations over the Alberta government in granting <a href="hydroelectric%20power">hydroelectric power</a> permits. He also feuded with then-Premier Brownlee over development in Alberta's <a href="List%20of%20National%20Parks%20of%20Canada">national parks</a> (Stewart favouring large-scale private development and Brownlee opposing it), causing King to record in his diary "Brownlee strikes me as...being superior to Mr. Stewart, who is handicapped in his dislike of [Brownlee]." When King sought to absorb <a href="Progressive%20Party%20of%20Canada">Progressives</a> into his Liberal Party to form a stronger coalition against the Conservatives, Stewart opposed cooperation with the UFA leaders who made up a large part of the Progressives' Albertan base. While King was inclined to view UFA politicians, like Progressives elsewhere, as "Liberals in a hurry" who were fundamentally comfortable with his government and preferred it to the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29">Conservatives</a>, Stewart understood that the UFA was a distinct group whose members were in many respect more conservative than liberal. King dismissed his minister's views as being the result of Stewart's acrimonious history with the UFA.

In fact, Stewart did not enjoy King's confidence. Though he brought him into his cabinet in 1921 in part at the urging of Progressive leader <a href="Thomas%20Crerar">Thomas Crerar</a>, King found Stewart to be an inadequate protector of western interests—especially in his advocacy of <a href="tariff">tariff</a> reduction, which King found lacklustre—and did not trust his political advice on the west. By 1925 he was considering appointing Stewart to the <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senate</a>, to remove him from active political involvement, but was handicapped by the absence of any other Alberta representation in his cabinet. In 1926 Stewart served as an emissary from King to recruit Saskatchewan Premier <a href="Charles%20Avery%20Dunning">Charles Avery Dunning</a> to the federal cabinet; the mission fulfilled, King kept Stewart in cabinet but wrote in his diary that all matters pertaining to Alberta were to be "left to Dunning to do as he thinks best". By 1927, King complained that Stewart had "no grip" on the province of which he had once been Premier, and in 1930 he wrote "Organization in Alberta is terrible. Stewart is worse than useless, is like an old woman, with no real control of situation." In the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201930">1930 federal election</a> Dunning and Crerar were both defeated; King complained that it was "perfectly terrible to have Stewart alone representing the West." When Stewart too went down to defeat in 1935, King was pleased "not to have to consider him" in assembling his new cabinet, and opted instead to leave Alberta unrepresented to punish it for failing to elect any Liberals.

After Stewart's defeat in 1935, he was appointed by <a href="George%20V%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">George V</a> to chair the Canadian section of the <a href="International%20Joint%20Commission">International Joint Commission</a>, in recognition of his expertise on international water boundary issues. In 1938, he was appointed chair of the Canadian section of the British Columbia – Yukon – Alaska Highway Commission. In these capacities, he travelled across Canada, visiting his son George at the family homestead near Killam at every opportunity. He died December 6, 1946, leaving an estate of $21,961.

Born in one of Canada's original provinces, Stewart moved west as part of a vast migration to the prairies, and settled in Alberta the year it became a province. As Alberta grew, Stewart played an increasingly important political role in it, until he joined the federal government to become Alberta's voice there, ultimately helping it achieve constitutional equality with the older provinces by transferring to its government control of its resources. As Mackenzie King eulogized him, "in more respects than one, Mr. Stewart's career mirrored the development of Canada itself."

Arthur Sifton

Arthur Lewis Watkins Sifton, <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">PC (UK)</a>, <a href="Queen%27s%20Privy%20Council%20for%20Canada">PC (Can)</a>, <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">KC</a> (October 26, 1858 – January 21, 1921), was a Canadian politician who served as the <a href="List%20of%20premiers%20of%20Alberta">second Premier of Alberta</a> from 1910 until 1917. He became a minister in the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Government of Canada</a> thereafter. Born in <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, he grew up there and in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, where he became a lawyer. He subsequently practised law with his brother <a href="Clifford%20Sifton">Clifford Sifton</a> in <a href="Brandon%2C%20Manitoba">Brandon, Manitoba</a>, where he was also active in municipal politics. He moved west to <a href="Prince%20Albert%2C%20Saskatchewan">Prince Albert</a> in 1885 and to <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> in 1889. There he was elected to the <a href="4th%20North-West%20Legislative%20Assembly">4th</a> and <a href="5th%20North-West%20Legislative%20Assembly">5th</a> North-West Legislative Assemblies; he later served as a minister in the government of Premier <a href="Frederick%20W.%20A.%20G.%20Haultain">Frederick W. A. G. Haultain</a>. In 1903, the federal government, at the instigation of his brother who was now one of its ministers, made Arthur Sifton the Chief Justice of the Northwest Territories. When Alberta was created out of a portion of the Northwest Territories in 1905, Sifton became its first chief justice.

In 1910, the government of Alberta Premier <a href="Alexander%20Cameron%20Rutherford">Alexander Cameron Rutherford</a> was embroiled in the <a href="Alberta%20and%20Great%20Waterways%20Railway%20scandal">Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal</a>. The Liberal Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta, <a href="George%20Bulyea">George Bulyea</a>, determined that for the sake of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Alberta">Liberal Party of Alberta</a>, Rutherford had to be pushed aside in favour of a new Premier. When other prominent Liberals declined it, the position was offered to Sifton. As Premier, he smoothed over the divisions in the party that had caused and been exacerbated by the railway scandal. He made attempts to break with the Rutherford railway policy; when these were rebuffed by the courts, he adopted a course similar to Rutherford's. He unsuccessfully pursued the transfer of rights over Alberta's natural resources from the federal government, which had retained them by the terms of Alberta's provincehood.

While Sifton was Premier, the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> rose as a political force. Sifton tried to accommodate many of their demands: his government constructed <a href="agricultural%20college">agricultural college</a>s, incorporated a farmer-run <a href="grain%20elevator">grain elevator</a> cooperative, and implemented a municipal system of <a href="hail">hail</a> insurance. Outside of agriculture, the UFA was instrumental in the Sifton government's implementation of some <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a> measures (which resulted in <a href="prohibition%20in%20Canada">prohibition</a>) and the extension of the vote to women.

During the <a href="conscription%20crisis%20of%201917">conscription crisis of 1917</a>, Sifton supported the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29">Conservative</a> Prime Minister, <a href="Robert%20Borden">Robert Borden</a>, in his attempt to impose <a href="conscription">conscription</a> to help win the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>. He backed the creation of a <a href="Unionist%20Party%20%28Canada%29">Union</a> government composed of Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals. In 1917 he left provincial politics and became a minister in this government. Over the next three and a half years he served briefly in four different ministries and was a delegate to the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference of 1919</a>. He died in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> in January 1921 after a brief illness.

Arthur Sifton was born October 26, 1858, in <a href="Arva%2C%20Ontario">Arva, Ontario</a>, to <a href="John%20Wright%20Sifton">John Wright Sifton</a> (1833–1912) and Catherine "Kate" Watkins (1832–1909). He was the older brother of politician <a href="Clifford%20Sifton">Clifford Sifton</a>. He attended public schools across southern Ontario, culminating with a boys' school in <a href="Dundas%2C%20Ontario">Dundas</a> and high school in <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London</a>. His father was a devout <a href="Methodist">Methodist</a> and a staunch <a href="Reform%20movement%20%28pre-Confederation%20Canada%29">Reformer</a> and, later, <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal</a>. These allegiances permeated his home life; the Sifton household was often visited by clergy, laity, businessmen, lawyers, and politicians. In 1874 or 1875, John Sifton won contracts for preliminary construction work on the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> (CPR) and moved the family to <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, where Arthur completed high school at <a href="Wesley%20College%20%28Manitoba%29">Wesley College</a>. Following his graduation, he and Clifford attended <a href="Victoria%20University%20in%20the%20University%20of%20Toronto">Victoria College</a>, then located in <a href="Cobourg%2C%20Ontario">Cobourg</a>, Ontario. In 1880, he graduated with a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a>. While in Cobourg, he was not a devoted student: he skipped many classes, and was judged by his classmates to be "intellectually, morally, physically and erratically preeminent in virtue and otherwise, especially otherwise".

Upon graduation, Arthur Sifton returned to Winnipeg to <a href="Articled%20clerk">article</a> with Albert Monkman until 1881, when he followed his father to <a href="Brandon%2C%20Manitoba">Brandon</a>. John hoped to take advantage of a local <a href="real%20estate">real estate</a> boom; nominally, Arthur was running a Brandon branch of Monkman's law firm, though he had not yet finished his articling and was accordingly unqualified to practise law. On September 20, 1882, he married Mary Deering of Cobourg; the pair would have two children, Nellie Louise Sifton (born August 1883) and Lewis Raymond St Clair Sifton (born February 1898). In 1883, he wrote and passed his <a href="bar%20exam">bar exam</a> and joined Clifford's Brandon law firm, now styled Sifton and Sifton.

<a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a> historian David Hall describes the next phase of Sifton's life as "shrouded in mystery". For reasons that are not clear, in 1885 Sifton dissolved his partnership with his brother and moved his family to <a href="Prince%20Albert%2C%20Saskatchewan">Prince Albert</a>. (Hall speculates that the brothers had a falling out, but notes that their later working relationship appears to have been amicable.) In 1885, Prince Albert's prospects did not appear bright, as it had been bypassed by the CPR line. Regardless, Sifton practised law and was in 1885 made a <a href="notary%20public">notary public</a>. Three years later, he earned a <a href="Master%20of%20Arts">Master of Arts</a> from Victoria College and a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> from the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a>. In 1889, he relocated again, to <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>; there is some suggestion that this move was for the sake of his wife's health. There he opened a law office, worked in the office of the city solicitor, and became a partner in the firm of Sifton, Short, and Stuart. At one point he was a <a href="crown%20prosecutor">crown prosecutor</a>. In 1892, he was appointed <a href="Queen%27s%20Counsel">Queen's Counsel</a>.

Sifton's first foray into politics was in 1878, when he campaigned for the introduction of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20Canada">prohibition</a> under the auspices of the <a href="Canada%20Temperance%20Act">Canada Temperance Act</a> in the Manitoba electoral districts of <a href="Lisgar%20%28electoral%20district%29">Lisgar</a> and <a href="Marquette%20%28Canadian%20electoral%20district%29">Marquette</a>. His first bid for elected office took place in 1882, when he was elected to Brandon's first city council. He was re-elected in 1883, and did not seek re-election at the conclusion of this second term, though he did briefly consider running for mayor before concluding that he had insufficient support to be elected. He also served on the local school board. When his brother Clifford became <a href="Wilfrid%20Laurier">Wilfrid Laurier</a>'s Minister of the Interior in November 1896, Sifton advised him on Liberal Party affairs in western Canada. This advice included suggested <a href="patronage">patronage</a> appointments, one of which was an unimplemented proposal that Arthur himself be appointed chief justice of the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a> (a position that did not at the time exist). In 1898, Sifton re-entered politics—Hall speculates to increase his chances at a judgeship—by challenging <a href="Robert%20Brett">Robert Brett</a>, the long-time Member of the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Northwest%20Territories">Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories</a> for <a href="Banff%20%28N.W.T.%20electoral%20district%29">Banff</a>, in the <a href="Northwest%20Territories%20general%20election%2C%201898">1898 territorial election</a>. Election day returns showed Sifton with a plurality of thirty-six votes, but by the time contested ballots were dealt with this had turned into a majority of two votes for Brett. Sifton successfully challenged this result in court, and in the ensuing by-election he defeated Brett by a comfortable margin. One oft-repeated anecdote from the campaign involved a campaign forum for which Brett was late. After giving his own speech, Sifton offered to give the still-absent Brett's speech as well, since he had heard it so many times. He did so, and when Brett eventually arrived to give a speech nearly identical to the one Sifton had given on his behalf he was puzzled by the audience's amusement.

Having defeated Brett, Sifton was immediately one of the area's most prominent Liberals, and was named president of the <a href="District%20of%20Alberta">District of Alberta</a> Liberals shortly thereafter. In 1901 Clifford Sifton appointed <a href="James%20Hamilton%20Ross">James Hamilton Ross</a>, Northwest Territories Treasurer and Minister of Public Works, <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Yukon">Commissioner of Yukon</a>. It fell to Northwest Territories Premier <a href="Frederick%20William%20Gordon%20Haultain">Frederick William Gordon Haultain</a> to fill the ensuing vacancy and, to preserve the delicate non-partisan balance of his administration, he had to pick a successor who was, like Ross, a Liberal. The role fell to Sifton. Soon after his appointment, Clifford offered him his sought-after position of Northwest Territories Chief Justice; Arthur declined on the basis of his recently assumed ministerial duties, but made it clear that he was still interested in receiving it eventually.

As minister, Sifton had to cope with increasing expenses and with grants from the federal government that did not keep pace. He dealt with this through support for territorial autonomy—the creation of one or more new provinces from the Northwest Territories. Campaigning on this position, he was re-elected in the <a href="Northwest%20Territories%20general%20election%2C%201902">1902 territorial election</a>. Months later, however, T. H. Maguire retired as territorial chief justice, and this time Sifton accepted his brother's offer of the position. He resigned his political offices in January 1903.

Despite the accusations of <a href="nepotism">nepotism</a> that greeted his appointment on January 3, 1903, Sifton fast became a well-respected judge. He served as chief justice of the Northwest Territories until September 16, 1907, when the <a href="Alberta%20Court%20of%20Queen%27s%20Bench">Supreme Court of Alberta</a> was established, whereupon he headed this new court, sitting in Calgary as the first <a href="Chief%20Justice%20of%20Alberta">Chief Justice of Alberta</a>. He was notoriously difficult for barristers to read: he generally heard arguments expressionlessly smoking a cigar, and it was as a judge that he first acquired his long-time nickname of the <a href="Sphinx">Sphinx</a> for his inscrutability. In one trial, he sat apparently vigorously taking notes during both sides' lengthy closing arguments and, once they concluded, immediately delivered his judgment. The bewildered lawyers wondered what he had been writing down, since he had obviously made up his mind before closing arguments; once Sifton had left the courtroom, they found their answer in the form of page after page covered with the judge's signature. He rarely recorded his "<a href="ratio%20decidendi">ratio decidendi</a>" but, despite this, few of his decisions were overturned on appeal. It has also been argued that his fellow judges had difficulty ruling on appeals from his decisions specifically because he rarely provided reasons. Much of his work was in <a href="criminal%20law">criminal law</a>, dealing especially with theft of livestock (in which cases he generally delivered a sentence of three years <a href="hard%20labour">hard labour</a>, severe by the standards of the day). By the end of his judicial career, he had convicted as many Americans as Canadians. His rulings were generally concerned with practicalities rather than legal theory, based more on social morality than legal precedent, and he did not establish any important <a href="stare%20decisis">precedents</a>.

In 1907, Sifton was one member of a three-member commission assigned to investigate labour unrest between coal miners and mine operators. His colleagues were mining executive Lewis Stockett and miners' union executive William Haysom. Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay. The mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum. The commission recommended that children under sixteen should not be allowed to work in mines, that inspectors should post their reports, that mine sites should have bath houses, and that ventilation inspection should be improved. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (except to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of <a href="company%20stores">company stores</a> (a sore point among the miners), and the <a href="incorporation%20%28business%29">incorporation</a> of mine unions (which was recommended by mines but opposed by the unions). It made no recommendation about working hours, but Premier <a href="Alexander%20Rutherford">Alexander Rutherford</a>'s government legislated an <a href="eight-hour%20day">eight-hour day</a> anyway.

He resigned from the bench on May 25, 1910 to become Premier.

In 1910, the <a href="Alberta%20Liberal%20Party">Liberal</a> government of <a href="Alexander%20Cameron%20Rutherford">Alexander Cameron Rutherford</a> was embroiled in the <a href="Alberta%20and%20Great%20Waterways%20Railway%20scandal">Alberta and Great Waterways (A&GW) Railway scandal</a>. Accusations of favouritism by the government towards the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway had split the Liberal Party, and Rutherford's ability to remain at its head was in doubt. Lieutenant-Governor <a href="George%20Bulyea">George Bulyea</a>, a Liberal who had reluctantly asked Rutherford to form a government in 1905, saw his doubts about the Premier's leadership skills validated and quietly began looking for candidates to replace him and save the Liberal Party. Several possibilities—including <a href="William%20Henry%20Cushing">William Henry Cushing</a>, <a href="Peter%20Talbot%20%28politician%29">Peter Talbot</a>, and <a href="Frank%20Oliver%20%28politician%29">Frank Oliver</a>—were considered and either rejected or found to be uninterested in the job. As early as March 14, Bulyea had concluded that Sifton might be "the only permanent solution", though it was not until May that the Lieutenant-Governor was able to secure Rutherford's agreement to resign and the agreement of both major factions in the Liberal caucus to accept Sifton as Premier. Even up until the last minute, Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) loyal to <a href="Charles%20Wilson%20Cross">Charles Wilson Cross</a>—the province's Attorney-General and a staunch Rutherford ally—threatened to scuttle the arrangement unless Cross was kept on as attorney-general, to which Sifton refused to agree. On May 26, Rutherford resigned and Arthur Sifton became the second Premier of Alberta.

One of his first challenges was to craft a cabinet satisfactory to all factions; this he did by excluding the leaders of all sides. He himself took the portfolios of Public Works and Provincial Treasurer. <a href="Charles%20R.%20Mitchell">Charles R. Mitchell</a>, who like Sifton had been a judge during the scandal and had accordingly played no part in it, became Minister of Education and Attorney-General. <a href="Archibald%20J.%20McLean">Archibald J. McLean</a> was named Provincial Secretary. His support for the insurgents (though not as one of their leaders) was offset by the continuation of Rutherford's Agriculture Minister <a href="Duncan%20Marshall">Duncan Marshall</a>, who had played no particular role during the scandal but had remained loyal to Rutherford. To the consternation of the opposition <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Conservatives</a>, Bulyea <a href="prorogued">prorogued</a> the legislation before this new government's strength could be tested by a <a href="vote%20of%20confidence">vote of confidence</a>. Still, its acceptance by the Liberal caucus can be measured by the fact that only one member, <a href="Ezra%20Riley">Ezra Riley</a>, resigned in protest. Riley objected to the exclusion from cabinet of insurgency leader W. H. Cushing; after his resignation he ran as an independent Liberal in the ensuing by-election, but was defeated by Sifton supporter <a href="Archibald%20J.%20McArthur">Archibald J. McArthur</a>. As time began to heal old wounds, Sifton expanded his cabinet to include several of the old adversaries: in February 1912 Cross was re-instated as Attorney-General and rebel leader <a href="John%20R.%20Boyle">John R. Boyle</a> was made Minister of Education (Mitchell, who had previously held both of these posts, was transferred to the Public Works portfolio). The other new additions to cabinet—<a href="Malcolm%20McKenzie">Malcolm McKenzie</a> as Provincial Treasurer and <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Charles Stewart</a> in the new position of Minister of Municipal Affairs—had voted with the Rutherford government during the scandal.

Another early challenge for the new Premier was to win a seat in the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a>. Although he lived and worked in Calgary, his first cabinet was composed mostly of southern members (McLean represented <a href="Lethbridge%20District">Lethbridge District</a>, Marshall represented <a href="Olds%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Olds</a>, and Mitchell would soon be elected in <a href="Medicine%20Hat%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Medicine Hat</a>), so Sifton had <a href="Archibald%20Campbell%20%28Alberta%20politician%29">Archibald Campbell</a> resign his <a href="Vermilion%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Vermilion</a> seat and sought election there. Sifton made few promises during the campaign, though he did identify as his priorities "the development of [Alberta's] agricultural and mining resources and the transportation facilities". Despite accusations by the Conservatives that the Liberals bought "the foreign vote" with beer, whiskey, and tobacco, he won a comfortable majority.

Before resigning, Rutherford's government had called a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> into the Alberta and Great Waterways affair, and this commission had not reported by the time that Sifton took office. Between that and the proroguing of the legislature, the new Premier enjoyed a calm that lasted until November 10, when the legislature reconvened. Conservative leader <a href="Edward%20Michener">Edward Michener</a> attacked the government's <a href="speech%20from%20the%20throne">speech from the throne</a> for failing to commit itself on railway policy and attacked Sifton for failing to call a general election or seek the confidence of the legislature during his first half year in office. In the meantime, Sifton was facing a breach in his own party on the railway question. Many Liberals from the south of the province, including Sifton himself, felt inclined to abandon the construction of "pioneer" railways (such as the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway) designed to hasten the settlement of the province's emptier areas, and concentrate only on those connecting major population centres. Members from the north of the province, who comprised most of the Liberal caucus, disagreed, and were vehement in their insistence that the A&GW be built. Even among this latter group there were divisions: some Liberals agreed with the Conservatives that the railway should be directly built by the government, while others, including Cross, favoured a partnership with a "responsible company". These divisions were not calmed by the release of the commission's report, whose majority condemned Rutherford and Cross for poor judgment even as it concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that they had engaged in improper behaviour.

It was against this backdrop that Sifton announced his government's policy with respect to the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company. Because it had failed to meet its construction obligations, Sifton introduced legislation to confiscate the proceeds of the sale of government-guaranteed <a href="Bond%20%28finance%29">bonds</a> sold to finance the railway's construction. He gave no indication of how the money, which was being held in trust by several banks, would be used. Cross's faction of (primarily northern) Liberals opposed the bill on the grounds that it did not commit the government to using the money to construct the railway, while the Conservatives opposed it as an unjustified confiscation of private property. As Conservative <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a> said,
[The bill is] an act of confiscation, an act such as never before has been carried out in the British Empire, an act such as has few equals in the pages of history. Similar acts have been carried out, once in Nicaragua and Virginia, and in South Carolina and only in times of war or revolution ... In my opinion the bargain was an improvident one, but that does not justify confiscation ... I did not think the new road would pay. But it is a new doctrine that because a bargain did not pay it should be repudiated and one should become a repudiator of bargains and a confiscator of private rights.
In speaking of A&GW President William Clarke (an American), Bennett went on to say "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect, because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property without due process of the law." The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the real question was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides? The answer came in December, when the bill passed <a href="third%20reading">third reading</a> by a vote of twenty-five votes to fourteen. Nine Liberals had reversed themselves and saved Sifton's government, though both Cross and Rutherford were among those to vote against it.

Despite calls from Clarke for the federal government to use its power of <a href="disallowance%20and%20reservation">reservation</a> to stop the legislation, Bulyea granted <a href="royal%20assent">royal assent</a> December 16. Sifton, in his capacity as provincial treasurer, immediately tried to access the money; the <a href="Royal%20Bank%20of%20Canada">Royal</a>, <a href="Toronto-Dominion%20Bank">Dominion</a>, and <a href="Union%20Bank%20of%20Halifax">Union</a> banks, where the funds were deposited, refused payment. Attorney-General Mitchell sued the banks; on November 4, 1911, Justice <a href="Charles%20Stuart%20%28politician%29">Charles Allen Stuart</a> of the <a href="Alberta%20Court%20of%20Queen%27s%20Bench">Supreme Court of Alberta</a> found in the government's favour. The Royal Bank appealed this ruling and unsuccessfully petitioned the federal government to use its powers of <a href="disallowance">disallowance</a> to strike down the provincial act. In the meantime, Sifton announced a new railway policy that would see eight new lines constructed by private companies with the assistance of provincial <a href="loan%20guarantees">loan guarantees</a>, including several pioneer lines; this policy, in its resemblance to the Rutherford policy, met with the approval of the Cross faction, and the Liberals were once more united.

In 1912, Justice Stuart's ruling was upheld by the Supreme Court of Alberta "<a href="en%20banc">en banc</a>". Again the Royal Bank appealed, and on January 31, 1913, the <a href="Judicial%20Committee%20of%20the%20Privy%20Council">Judicial Committee of the Privy Council</a>, which was at the time Canada's highest judicial authority, found for the Royal Bank, ruling that the provincial government did not have the right to confiscate money raised outside of the province. On September 22 Sifton announced new management of the AG&W agreeable to the bondholders, the government, and the banks. The Conservatives protested that other companies were prepared to construct the railroad for less than the sum agreed on with the A&GW, to which Sifton replied that the Privy Council's ruling meant that the government could not use the money raised to deal with any other company. The Conservatives <a href="filibuster">filibuster</a>ed the legislation and moved a series of amendments (including one calling for the scheme to be put to <a href="referendum">referendum</a>), but the Liberals voted unanimously in its favour. The Alberta and Great Waterways saga had reached its end, and Sifton's caucus was never more united.

When Alberta and <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a> were made provinces in 1905, the federal government retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal</a> government of <a href="Sir%20Wilfrid%20Laurier">Sir Wilfrid Laurier</a>, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender. In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from the federal government as compensation. In 1910, however, Liberal MLA <a href="Alwyn%20Bramley-Moore">Alwyn Bramley-Moore</a> (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called "Alberta's first <a href="Alberta%20separatism">separatist</a>" by the "<a href="Edmonton%20Journal">Edmonton Journal</a>") moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to "take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern". Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end. He asserted "I have always believed ... that we should administer our mines and timber. The question is not now whether we would like to control our natural resources, but what is the best way to get them."

Soon after, Sifton made a trip east and spoke on the subject of provincial resource control to the <a href="Canadian%20Club%20of%20Toronto">Canadian Club of Toronto</a>, where his points were well received. In May 1910, Sifton and Saskatchewan Premier <a href="Thomas%20Walter%20Scott">Walter Scott</a> met with Laurier in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, where he was able to secure the Prime Minister's agreement that if the Liberals were re-elected in the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201911">1911 federal election</a> they would transfer to Alberta control over its resources. This election was fought primarily on the issue of <a href="Reciprocity%20%28Canadian%20politics%29">reciprocity</a>, which was popular in Alberta, and Sifton campaigned actively for Laurier (distinguishing himself from his brother, who broke with Laurier on reciprocity). Despite winning six of Alberta's seven seats, the Liberals were defeated nationally by <a href="Robert%20Borden">Robert Borden</a>'s <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29">Conservatives</a>.

Initially, this did not appear to be a problem; Borden had long called for the transfer of resource control to the prairie provinces, but when Sifton and Scott raised the issue with the new Prime Minister, little action resulted. Borden stalled for some time, and it emerged that he did not wish to buoy the fortunes of the provincial Liberal parties by giving them the political victory that would result from the transfer of resource control. Upon the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the issue fell out of public prominence, and it was not until 1930 that Alberta would achieve this long-time objective.

Sifton's time as Premier corresponded with the rise of the <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> (UFA) as a political force. Formed in 1909 by the merger of the Society of Equity and the <a href="Alberta%20Farmers%27%20Association">Alberta Farmers' Association</a>, the UFA would later become a political party and govern Alberta from 1921 until 1935. During Sifton's tenure, however, its entry into direct politics was still several years away, and it confined itself to advocating for farmers' interests. In a province in which 50,004 people voted in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201909">1909 provincial election</a>, the UFA claimed an initial membership of 2,100, which climbed to 9,400 in 1913. Moreover, these figures did not include the many farmers who were active in the organization without paying dues; the UFA was a force to be reckoned with, and Sifton took notice.

The UFA's first provincial victory took place in 1910, and involved the construction of <a href="agricultural%20college">agricultural college</a>s. Premier Alexander Rutherford, always a stalwart ally of the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a>, approved a plan to locate Alberta's first agricultural college on the university's campus, in Rutherford's home town of <a href="Strathcona%2C%20Alberta">Strathcona</a>. At the 1910 UFA convention, a resolution proposed putting the college in southern Alberta, though it was supplanted by an <a href="Edward%20Michener">Edward Michener</a> motion calling for the UFA's leadership to consult with the province on a mutually amenable location. After consultation with the UFA, Sifton agreed that, in addition to the college, agricultural schools would be built around the province, and that farmers would be guaranteed representation on the college's board. In fact, Sifton held off on the establishment of the college all together in favour of the creation of seven demonstration farms in different regions of the province. In 1912, the government announced the creation of agricultural colleges in connection with three of these farms (all of them in the <a href="electoral%20district">ridings</a> of provincial cabinet ministers: Duncan Marshall's <a href="Olds%2C%20Alberta">Olds</a>, <a href="Claresholm%2C%20Alberta">Claresholm</a> in Archibald McLean's Lethbridge District, and Sifton's <a href="Vermilion%2C%20Alberta">Vermilion</a>).

Another of the UFA's policies called for a single tax on land to replace most other forms of taxation. The farmers hoped that this tax would help replace <a href="tariff">tariff</a>s, which made it harder for them to export their produce, and shift the tax burden towards cities, where land values were higher. They also called for a surtax on undeveloped land to curb <a href="land%20speculation">land speculation</a> and encourage the sale of land to farmers. On this demand too, Sifton acted: in 1911–1912 he allowed municipalities to levy <a href="property%20tax">property tax</a>es and required that rural municipalities tax only land, and in 1914 he imposed a provincial tax on undeveloped land to discourage land speculation. Other UFA-motivated acts by Sifton's government included abandonment of a 1912 plan to privatize <a href="hail">hail</a> insurance (it instead enacted a municipal insurance scheme) and the prohibition of contract clauses that allowed farm machinery companies to avoid responsibility for their products. Perhaps the most important piece of farm legislation passed by Sifton's government was the incorporation of the <a href="Alberta%20Farmers%27%20Co-operative%20Elevator%20Company">Alberta Farmers' Co-operative Elevator Company</a> (AFCEC). Though the UFA's first preference was for government ownership and operation of <a href="grain%20elevators">grain elevators</a>, which Sifton refused, it gladly accepted the AFCEC, in which only farmers could hold shares and which was supported by provincial startup loans.

Hall writes that "the Sifton government in effect responded wholly or in part to practically every resolution from the 1913 UFA convention related to provincial powers." This rate could not sustain itself, however, especially once the First World War began to occupy an increasing share of the province's attention and resources. During the 1916 legislative session, the government acted on only two of the UFA's twenty-three demands of that year — one to allow the sale of <a href="gopher%20%28animal%29">gopher</a> poison by UFA locals, and one dealing with <a href="Livestock%20branding">brand</a> inspection.

It was not only in agricultural policy that the UFA spread its influence. The organization had a strong <a href="progressivism">progressive</a> bent, and advocated <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a>, <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, and <a href="Prohibition%20in%20Canada">prohibition</a>. In response to the first of these, Sifton in 1913 introduced the "Direct Democracy Act". Though it went somewhat less far than the UFA would have liked—for example, it made no provision for <a href="recall%20election">recall</a> of elected officials—it did allow for Albertans to call a referendum directly by submitting a <a href="petition">petition</a> including the names of eligible voters totalling ten percent of the votes cast in the previous provincial election, including at least eight percent in each of eighty-five percent of the province's ridings. The Conservatives were on record as supporting direct democracy, and could therefore criticize the bill only in detail.

The large number of signatures required (beginning with the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201913">1913 election</a>, 9,399 signatures were required) meant that only an issue capable of galvanizing much of the province could lead to a referendum. Prohibition was such an issue. The Conservatives were advocates of such a referendum (during the <a href="1st%20Alberta%20Legislative%20Assembly">1st Alberta Legislative Assembly</a>, Conservative <a href="Cornelius%20Hiebert">Cornelius Hiebert</a> had advocated prohibition or, failing that, a government monopoly on alcohol sales), but Sifton and his Liberals were less enthusiastic. They knew the boon to government coffers that liquor sales represented, and were not eager to alienate either the UFA's moral reformers or the province's hoteliers and saloonkeepers. Once the referendum legislation was in place, however, its advocates wasted no time: in 1914 the legislature accepted a petition bearing 23,656 names, and duly called a referendum on the subject. The <a href="Alberta%20prohibition%20referendum">Alberta prohibition referendum</a> passed resoundingly, and the legislature passed the <a href="Prohibition%20Act">Prohibition Act</a> in the spring of 1916. Initially the new Act appeared successful: in 1917 there were 5,151 convictions for all crimes across Alberta, as compared to an annual average of 12,706 over the preceding four years. By the time the province's enforcement of the act was exposed as being either deliberately lax or merely futile, depending on the observer, Sifton had left office.

Alberta's women, especially those of the UFA-affiliated United Farm Women of Alberta, were active in the province's moral reform movement. They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them "did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came down here to ask me for the vote? If you haven't you'd better go home because you're not going to get any votes from me." In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people. At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were "played out", but expressed concern at the increases that would result to the cost of elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage. In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum. On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute "placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned." True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections. The Conservatives supported it enthusiastically, and only <a href="St.%20Albert%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">St. Albert</a> MLA <a href="Lucien%20Boudreau">Lucien Boudreau</a> voted against it (though <a href="Ribstone%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Ribstone</a> Liberal <a href="James%20Gray%20Turgeon">James Gray Turgeon</a> admitted that he was supporting his leader's legislation against his own convictions).

Arthur Sifton's political style was to remain aloof and detached, and to say no more than necessary; this cemented his reputation as "the Sphinx". He was authoritarian and, while he inspired respect, he was not loved; historian L. G. Thomas credits him with holding the Liberal Party together through his strength, but blames him for failing to heal its underlying divisions. Sifton was originally selected as Premier in the hopes that he would lead the Liberal Party to continued dominance of provincial politics in Alberta. His success in this regard was mixed: although he led the party to victory in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201913">1913</a> and <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201917">1917</a> elections, its majorities declined each time. Moreover, his victories were marred by accusations of unethical electoral tactics.

In advance of the 1913 election, government-sponsored <a href="Redistribution%20%28election%29">redistribution</a> legislation increased the number of ridings from 41 to 56 and left them of unequal size; only 103 votes were cast in <a href="Clearwater%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Clearwater</a> in its first election. The Liberals argued that a model of straight <a href="representation%20by%20population">representation by population</a> was inappropriate in a province in which some districts were growing far more quickly than others. David Hall has called the bill a "flagrant <a href="gerrymander">gerrymander</a>" and the ensuing election the "crookedest election in Alberta history". There being few policy differences separating the Liberals from the Conservatives, the electoral battle was instead an organizational one, with the two sides accusing one another of bribing ethnic minorities with alcohol and importing elections workers from outside of the province to bribe, intimidate, and mislead rural voters. The Conservatives also accused the Liberals of using government-paid civil servants to campaign for their re-election. Sifton, not confident of victory in his own riding, sought election both there and in <a href="Macleod%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Macleod</a>. In the event, he was defeated there but retained his Vermilion riding.

Since the 1917 election was held in the throes of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, it was unlikely to be an election as usual—indeed, the Conservatives favoured prolonging the legislature until the end of the war. Sifton was not willing to go that far, but did introduce legislation to re-elect, by act of the legislature, the twelve MLAs who had enlisted in the armed forces—of these, seven were Liberals and five Conservatives; one of the Liberals, <a href="Joseph%20Stauffer">Joseph Stauffer</a> of <a href="Didsbury%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Disbury</a>, was killed in action before the legislation took effect. The Conservatives supported this legislation, though they later cast aspersions on it by suggesting that of the Liberals re-elected, two had never left Canada. A second piece of election legislation provided for two special MLAs to be elected by the 38,000 Albertans serving overseas; the Conservatives protested that two MLAs was not sufficient for such a large number of voters, especially since Clearwater by this time had only 116 eligible voters.

After a sedate election that the Liberals won by a slightly reduced majority, Sifton announced his resignation as Premier to enter federal politics. Sifton's 1917 victory would be the Liberals' last: his successor, <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Charles Stewart</a>, would lose the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201921">1921 election</a> to the newly-political UFA. In Thomas's estimation, Sifton would have faced a similar fate in 1917 if the UFA had run candidates then.

The <a href="Conscription%20Crisis%20of%201917">Conscription Crisis of 1917</a> divided the Liberal Party of Canada, and this division extended into the provincial camp. Federal Liberal leader Laurier opposed Prime Minister Borden's proposal to implement wartime <a href="conscription">conscription</a>, a stand which many Liberals, especially those outside <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a>, denounced as unpatriotic. Borden reached out to these Liberals to propose a <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a>, to be led by him and to include Conservatives and pro-conscription Liberals. Clifford Sifton was a major broker of the resulting deal and, when the question of a suitable Alberta representative in the cabinet came up, Arthur Sifton was a natural choice. In 1914, he had announced Alberta's willingness to sacrifice "its last dollar and its last man", and was a staunch supporter of conscription. He had agreed by August 1917 to join the <a href="Unionist%20Party%20%28Canada%29">Unionist</a> government, and resigned as Premier in October.

Although he was only 58 at the time of joining government, his health was suffering. He was short of energy and required a car to transport him even the several hundred metres from his Ottawa residence to the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons of Canada</a>. Because of this, he was given relatively undemanding portfolios: Minister of Customs and Inland Revenue, Minister of Public Works, and Secretary of State. Hall has called him among the least visible of Borden's ministers. Because of his health and his short tenure in each position, he made very little impact. Despite this, Sifton was highly regarded by his colleagues. Borden himself later stated "there was no one in whose judgment I placed firmer reliance". Sifton was appointed to the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Imperial Privy Council</a> in the 1920 New Year Honours, entitling him to the style "The Right Honourable".

Sifton was one of four Canadian delegates to the <a href="Paris%20Peace%20Conference%2C%201919">Paris Peace Conference of 1919</a>, along with Borden, <a href="Charles%20Doherty">Charles Doherty</a>, and <a href="George%20Eulas%20Foster">George Eulas Foster</a>. There, he acted as vice chair of the Commission on Ports, Waterways, and Railways, and served on the Commission on Aerial Navigation. In these capacities he argued for Canada to be treated as an independent state at a time when its foreign policy was still managed by the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>. On June 28, 1919, Arthur Sifton was one of two Canadians to sign the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Versailles">Treaty of Versailles</a>.

In January 1921, Sifton became ill and took leave from his duties for a few days. Although his recovery seemed imminent, his condition suddenly worsened. He died at his home on January 21 at the age of 62. Borden mourned the loss of "a public servant of the highest ability and of the most conspicuous patriotism". He was buried in Ottawa's <a href="Beechwood%20Cemetery">Beechwood Cemetery</a>.

His public papers are in the Canadian archives, with some legal papers in a legal collection in Alberta, and others mixed in with those of his brother Clifford.

Alexander Cameron Rutherford

Alexander Cameron Rutherford, (February 2, 1857 – June 11, 1941) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the first <a href="premier%20of%20Alberta">premier of Alberta</a> from 1905 to 1910. Born in <a href="Ormond%2C%20Ontario">Ormond, Ontario</a>, he studied and practised law in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> before moving with his family to the <a href="North-West%20Territories">North-West Territories</a> in 1895. Here he began his political career, winning in his third attempt a seat in the <a href="North-West%20Legislative%20Assembly">North-West Legislative Assembly</a>. In keeping with the territorial custom Rutherford ran as an <a href="independent%20%28politician%29">independent</a>, though he generally supported the territorial administration of Premier <a href="Frederick%20W.%20A.%20G.%20Haultain">Frederick W. A. G. Haultain</a>. At the federal level, however, Rutherford was a <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal</a>.

In 1905, Alberta Lieutenant Governor <a href="George%20Bulyea">George Bulyea</a> asked Rutherford to form the new province's first government. As premier, his first task was to win a workable majority in the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a>, which he did in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201905">1905 provincial election</a>. His second was to provide the apparatus of provincial government: his government established everything from <a href="speed%20limit">speed limit</a>s to a provincial court system. The legislature also controversially, and with Rutherford's support, selected <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> over rival <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a> as the provincial capital. Calgarians' bruised feelings were not salved when the government located the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a>, a project dear to the Premier's heart, in his hometown of <a href="Strathcona%2C%20Alberta">Strathcona</a>, just across the <a href="North%20Saskatchewan%20River">North Saskatchewan River</a> from Edmonton.

The government was faced with labour unrest in the <a href="coal%20mining">coal mining</a> industry, which it resolved by establishing a commission to examine the problem. It also set up a provincial government telephone network—<a href="Alberta%20Government%20Telephones">Alberta Government Telephones</a>—at great expense, and tried to encourage the development of new railways. It was in pursuit of this last objective that the Rutherford government found itself embroiled in scandal. Early in 1910, <a href="William%20Henry%20Cushing">William Henry Cushing</a>'s resignation as Minister of Public Works precipitated the <a href="Alberta%20and%20Great%20Waterways%20Railway%20scandal">Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal</a>, which turned many of Rutherford's Liberals against his government. Eventually, pressure from many party figures forced Rutherford to resign. He kept his seat in the legislature after resigning as premier, but was defeated in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201913">1913 election</a> by <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Conservative</a> <a href="Herbert%20Crawford">Herbert Crawford</a>.

After leaving politics, Rutherford continued his law practice and his involvement with a wide range of community groups. Most importantly, he became <a href="List%20of%20Chancellors%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Alberta">chancellor of the University of Alberta</a>, whose earlier founding had been a personal project. He died of a heart attack June 11, 1941. A University of Alberta library, an Edmonton elementary school, and <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a>'s <a href="Mount%20Rutherford">Mount Rutherford</a> are named in his honour. Additionally, his home, <a href="Rutherford%20House">Rutherford House</a>, was opened as a museum in 1973.

Alexander Rutherford was born February 2, 1857, near <a href="Ormond%2C%20Ontario">Ormond</a>, <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> on his family's dairy farm. His parents, James (1817–1891) and Elspet "Elizabeth" (1818–1901) Cameron Rutherford, had immigrated from <a href="Scotland">Scotland</a> two years previous. They joined the <a href="Baptist%20Church">Baptist Church</a>, and his father joined the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal Party of Canada</a> and served for a time on the <a href="Osgoode%2C%20Ontario">Osgoode</a> village council. Rutherford attended public school locally and, after rejecting dairy farming as a vocation, enrolled in a <a href="Metcalfe%2C%20Ontario">Metcalfe</a> high school. After graduating in 1874, he attended the <a href="Canadian%20Literary%20Institute">Canadian Literary Institute</a>, a Baptist college in <a href="Woodstock%2C%20Ontario">Woodstock</a>. He graduated from there in 1876, and taught for a year in Osgoode.

Next he moved to <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> to study arts and law at <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a>. He was awarded degrees in both in 1881, and joined the <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> law firm of Scott, McTavish and McCracken where he was <a href="articled%20clerk">articled</a> for four years under the tutelage of <a href="Richard%20William%20Scott">Richard William Scott</a>. Called to the Ontario bar in 1885, he became a junior partner in the firm of Hodgins, Kidd and Rutherford with responsibility for its <a href="Kemptville%2C%20Ontario">Kemptville</a> office for ten years. He also established a moneylending business there.

During this time, his social circle grew to include <a href="William%20Cameron%20Edwards">William Cameron Edwards</a>. Through Edwards, Rutherford was introduced to the Birkett family, which included former <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> <a href="Thomas%20Birkett">Thomas Birkett</a>. Rutherford married Birkett's niece, Mattie Birkett, in December 1888. The couple had three children: Cecil (born in 1890), Hazel (born in 1893), and Marjorie (born in 1903, but died sixteen months later). Rutherford had a traditional view of gender roles, and was happy to leave most child-rearing responsibilities to his wife.

In November 1886 Rutherford visited the Canadian West for the first time when he travelled to <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a> to investigate the disappearance of his cousin. The <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> left a great impression on him, as did the coastal climate which he found "very agreeable". He visited again in the summer of 1894, when he took the <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a> across the prairies. Upon arriving in <a href="Strathcona%2C%20Alberta">South Edmonton</a>, he was excited by its growth potential and pleased to find that the dry air relieved his <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>. He resolved to settle there, and did so one year later, bringing his reluctant wife and his children, who arrived by train June 10, 1895. Within ten days of their arrival, Rutherford had opened a law office, purchased four lots of land, and contracted local builder Hugh McCurdy to build him a house. In July the family moved into their new four-room house, built on a single storey. In 1896 Rutherford became the town's only lawyer, as his competition, Mervyn Mackenzie, had moved to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>.

Rutherford quickly became deeply involved in the community. Among the roles he acquired during his first three years in the <a href="District%20of%20Alberta">District of Alberta</a> were President of the newly formed South Edmonton Football Club, secretary-treasurer of the South Edmonton School Board, president of the South Edmonton Athletic Association, vice president of the South Edmonton Literary Institute, auditor of the South Edmonton Agricultural Society, and worthy master of the Acacia Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted <a href="freemasonry">Masons</a>. He later added to this the title of secretary of the Edmonton District Butter and Cheese Manufacturing Association. He was an early advocate for the incorporation of South Edmonton, hitherto an <a href="unincorporated%20community">unincorporated community</a>. When incorporation came in 1899—as the Town of <a href="Strathcona%2C%20Alberta">Strathcona</a>—Rutherford became the new town's secretary-treasurer (after acting as returning officer in its first election).

Throughout this period, he practised law, from 1899 with <a href="Frederick%20C.%20Jamieson">Frederick C. Jamieson</a> as his partner, who later was elected as a <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Conservative</a> member of the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">MLA</a>. He employed single women as secretaries in an era when clerical workers were predominantly male, and defended a <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20of%20the%20Americas">First Nations person</a> accused of murder, at a time when most lawyers refused such cases. As their practice grew, he and Jamieson also engaged in <a href="credit%20%28finance%29">moneylending</a>. Besides his law practice, Rutherford was a successful <a href="real%20estate">real estate</a> investor, and also owned an interest in <a href="gold%20mining">gold mining</a> equipment situated on the <a href="North%20Saskatchewan%20River">North Saskatchewan River</a>.

In 1896, <a href="Frank%20Oliver%20%28politician%29">Frank Oliver</a>, who had represented <a href="Edmonton%20%28N.W.T.%20electoral%20district%29">Edmonton</a> in the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Northwest%20Territories">Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories</a> since 1888, resigned to pursue a career in federal politics. Several Strathcona residents urged Rutherford to run for Oliver's old seat in the ensuing <a href="by-election">by-election</a>. Though he was originally reluctant, he agreed to stand after a 300-signature <a href="petition">petition</a> urging his candidacy was presented to him. His only opponent was former <a href="Mayor%20of%20Edmonton">Edmonton mayor</a> <a href="Matthew%20McCauley%20%28politician%29">Matthew McCauley</a> who, like Rutherford, ran as an <a href="independent%20%28politician%29">independent</a>. Rutherford campaigned on a platform of improved roads, resource development, simplification of territorial ordinances, and—in what would become a theme of his political career—increased educational funding. McCauley won the election, but Rutherford received more than forty percent of the vote.

During the <a href="Northwest%20Territories%20general%20election%2C%201898">1898 territorial election</a>, Rutherford again challenged the now-incumbent McCauley. His defeat of two years previous still fresh in his mind, his platform this time included a call for a <a href="redistribution%20%28election%29">redrawing</a> of the territory's electoral boundaries; he believed that the current Edmonton <a href="electoral%20district%20%28Canada%29">riding</a> was <a href="gerrymander">gerrymander</a>ed in McCauley's favour. He also repeated his past calls for improved roads and advocated increased taxation on the railroads. He pledged "independent support" for the non-partisan administration of Premier <a href="Frederick%20Haultain">Frederick Haultain</a>, and supported that administration's call for the creation of a <a href="Province%20of%20Buffalo">single province</a> from the territories following the 1901 <a href="census">census</a>. Rutherford criticized McCauley's past record, accusing him of silence on issues that were of concern to his constituents. Despite this, McCauley won again, albeit by a reduced margin.

Rutherford was at last successful in the <a href="Northwest%20Territories%20general%20election%2C%201902">1902 election</a>, when he ran in the newly created riding of <a href="Strathcona%20%28N.W.T.%20electoral%20district%29">Strathcona</a>. His 1902 platform was similar to his 1898 platform and supported Haultain, though this time he supported a two-province integration of the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a> into <a href="Canadian%20Confederation">Confederation</a>, rather than Haultain's preferred one-province approach, on the grounds that a single province would be so large as to be ungovernable. It at first looked as though he would run unopposed; however, at the last minute local lawyer Nelson D. Mills publicly accused Rutherford of being not a true independent, but a dyed-in-the-wool Haultain supporter, and announced that he would run against him. Rutherford was supported by most of Strathcona's most prominent residents, including his law partner Jamieson and his future rival <a href="John%20R.%20Boyle">John R. Boyle</a>, and won an easy victory.

Rutherford served in the <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20the%20Northwest%20Territories">Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories</a> until Alberta became a province in 1905. During his tenure, he was elected deputy <a href="speaker%20%28politics%29">speaker</a> and sat on standing committees for libraries, municipal law, and education. His legislative efforts included successful attempts to extend the boundaries of the Town of Strathcona and to empower it to borrow for construction of public works. He was considered a possible member of Haultain's <a href="Executive%20Council%20%28Canada%29">executive council</a>, likely in the post of Commissioner of Public Works, but the post instead went to <a href="George%20Bulyea">George Bulyea</a>. He joined many of his fellow <a href="Member%20of%20the%20Legislative%20Assembly">MLA</a>s in continuing to advocate for provincial status, finding that the limitations on a territory's means to raise revenue prevented the Northwest Territories from meeting its obligations.

Though Rutherford supported Haultain's vision of non-partisan territorial administration, federally he was an avowed <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Canada">Liberal</a>. In 1900, he was elected president of the Strathcona Liberal association, and was a delegate to the convention that nominated Oliver as the party's candidate in <a href="Alberta%20%28Provisional%20District%29">Alberta</a> for the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201900">1900 federal election</a>. He subsequently campaigned for Oliver in his successful re-election attempt. When the new federal constituency of <a href="Strathcona%20%28electoral%20district%29">Strathcona</a> was formed in advance of the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201904">1904 election</a>, Rutherford was urged to accept the Liberal nomination, but demurred. <a href="Peter%20Talbot%20%28politician%29">Peter Talbot</a> was selected instead and, supported by Rutherford, was elected.

In February 1905, the federal government of <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> Sir <a href="Wilfrid%20Laurier">Wilfrid Laurier</a> introduced legislation to create two new provinces—<a href="Alberta">Alberta</a> and <a href="Saskatchewan">Saskatchewan</a>—from the Northwest Territories. Though Haultain wanted the new provinces to be governed on the same non-partisan basis as the Territories had been, it was expected that the Liberal Laurier would recommend a Liberal to serve as <a href="Lieutenant-Governor%20%28Canada%29">Lieutenant-Governor</a>, and it was further assumed that the Lieutenant-Governor would call on a Liberal to form the new province's first government. Oliver was the province's most prominent Liberal, but had just been named federal Minister of the Interior, and was not interested in leaving Ottawa. Talbot was Laurier's preferred candidate, but he expected to be appointed to the <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senate</a> and found the prospect more congenial than serving as Premier of Alberta. Both men supported Rutherford, though neither was enthusiastic about doing so. In August, Bulyea was appointed Alberta's first Lieutenant-Governor and later that month the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Alberta">Alberta Liberals</a> selected Rutherford as their first leader. A final barrier was removed a few days later when Haultain, who was a <a href="Conservative%20Party%20of%20Canada%20%28historical%29">Conservative</a> federally but who was thought to be a potential leader of a <a href="coalition%20government">coalition government</a>, announced that he would stay in <a href="Regina%2C%20Saskatchewan">Regina</a> to lead the Saskatchewan Conservatives. On September 2, Bulyea asked Rutherford to form the first government of Alberta.

After accepting the position of premier, Rutherford selected a geographically diverse cabinet on September 6: <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a>'s <a href="Charles%20Wilson%20Cross">Charles Wilson Cross</a> as Attorney-General, <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>'s <a href="William%20Henry%20Cushing">William Henry Cushing</a> as Minister of Public Works, <a href="Medicine%20Hat">Medicine Hat</a>'s <a href="William%20Finlay">William Finlay</a> as Minister of Agriculture and Provincial Secretary, and <a href="Lethbridge">Lethbridge</a>'s <a href="Leverett%20DeVeber">George DeVeber</a> as Minister without Portfolio. Rutherford kept for himself the positions of Provincial Treasurer and Minister of Education.

Rutherford was Premier, but had not yet faced the people in an election and did not yet have a legislature to which he could propose legislation. Elections for the first <a href="Legislative%20Assembly%20of%20Alberta">Legislative Assembly of Alberta</a> were accordingly fixed for November 9. The <a href="Progressive%20Conservative%20Association%20of%20Alberta">Conservatives</a>, the young province's only other political party, had already selected <a href="R.%20B.%20Bennett">R. B. Bennett</a> as their leader. Bennett attacked the terms under which Alberta had been made a province, especially the clauses that left control of its lands and natural resources in the hands of the federal government and required the continued provincial funding of <a href="separate%20school">separate school</a>s. He pointed out that Canada's older provinces had control of their own natural resources and that education was a provincial responsibility under the <a href="British%20North%20America%20Act">British North America Act</a>. The Liberals responded to these criticisms by highlighting the financial compensation the province received from the federal government in exchange for control of its natural resources, which amounted to $375,000 per year. They further suggested that Conservative concern for control of lands was due to their desire to make favourable land concessions to the unpopular <a href="Canadian%20Pacific%20Railway">Canadian Pacific Railway</a>, which had historically been friendly with the Conservatives, and for whom Bennett had acted as solicitor.
Besides the Conservatives' ties to the CPR, Rutherford's Liberals enjoyed the incumbent's advantage of controlling the levers of <a href="patronage">patronage</a>, and the election's result was never really in doubt. Before the election, Talbot predicted that the government would win 18 of the province's 25 seats. Immediately after the election it appeared that the Liberals had won 21; when all the votes had been counted they had won 23 seats to the Conservatives' two. Bennett himself was defeated in his <a href="Calgary%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Calgary riding</a>. When the outcome was clear, the people of Strathcona feted Rutherford with a torchlight procession and bonfire.

One of the most contentious issues facing the newly elected government was the decision of the province's capital city. The federal legislation creating the province had fixed <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> as the provisional capital, much to the chagrin of <a href="Calgary">Calgary</a>. Neither party had taken a position on the divisive question during the campaign, but selecting a permanent capital was high on the list of the new legislature's orders of business. Calgary's case was made most enthusiastically by Minister of Public Works Cushing, Edmonton's by Attorney-General Cross. <a href="Banff%2C%20Alberta">Banff</a> and <a href="Red%20Deer%2C%20Alberta">Red Deer</a> were also possibilities, but motions to select each failed to find seconders. In the end, Edmonton was designated by a vote of sixteen members—including Rutherford—to eight.

A personal priority of Rutherford had been the establishment of a university. Though the "<a href="Edmonton%20Bulletin">Edmonton Bulletin</a>" opined that it would be unfair "that the people of the Province should be taxed for the special benefit of four per cent that they may be able to attach the cognomen of B.A. or M.A. to their names and flaunt the vanity of such over the taxpayer, who has to pay for it", Rutherford proceeded quickly. He was concerned that delay might result in the creation of denominational colleges, striking a blow to his dream of a high quality non-sectarian system of post-secondary education. A bill establishing the University was passed by the legislature, but left the government to decide the location. Calgary felt that, having lost the fight to be provincial capital, it could expect the university to be established there, and was not pleased a year later when the government announced the founding of the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a> in Rutherford's hometown of Strathcona.

While these regionally charged issues attracted much attention, they were far from the government's only initiatives during the legislature's first session. In 1906 it passed a series of acts dealing with the organization and administration of the new provincial government and incorporated the cities of <a href="Lethbridge">Lethbridge</a>, <a href="Medicine%20Hat">Medicine Hat</a>, and <a href="Wetaskiwin">Wetaskiwin</a>. It also established a <a href="speed%20limit">speed limit</a> of for motorized vehicles and set up a regime for mine inspection. Perhaps most significantly, it set up a court system, with <a href="Arthur%20Lewis%20Sifton">Arthur Lewis Sifton</a> as the province's first Chief Justice.

Though the founding of the University of Alberta was the centrepiece of Rutherford's educational policy, his activity as Minister of Education extended well beyond it. In the first year of Alberta's existence, 140 new schools were established, and a <a href="normal%20school">normal school</a> was set up in Calgary to train teachers. Rutherford put great emphasis on the creation of English-language schools in the large portions of the province occupied primarily by central- and eastern-European immigrants. The immigrants themselves were often unable to speak English, and the provision of these schools for their children was a major factor in their rapid assimilation into Albertan society. They were also in lieu of separate religious schools for groups such as <a href="Mennonites">Mennonites</a>; while the continued existence of <a href="Roman%20Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> separate schools was mandated by the terms of Alberta's admission into Confederation, the government's policy was otherwise to encourage a unified and secular public school system. Rutherford also introduced free school texts in the province, though he was criticized for commissioning the texts from a <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> publisher (which printed them in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>) rather than locally.

The winter of 1906–07 was the coldest in Alberta history; this was exacerbated by a shortage of coal. One cause of this shortage was the strained relationship between coal miners and mine operators in the province. At the beginning of April 1907 the Canada West Coal and Coke Company <a href="lockout%20%28industry%29">locked out</a> the miners from its mine near <a href="Taber%2C%20Alberta">Taber</a>. The same company was also facing a work stoppage at its mine in the <a href="Crow%27s%20Nest%20Pass">Crow's Nest Pass</a>, where miners were refusing to sign a new contract. The problem spread, until by April 22 all 3,400 miners working for member-companies of the Western Coal Operators' Association were off work. Miners' demands included increased wages, a reduction in working hours to eight per day (from ten), the posting of mine inspection reports, the isolated storage of explosives, the use of non-freezing explosives, and semi-monthly rather than monthly pay; the mine operators objected to this last point on the basis that many miners did not report to work the day after payday, and it was thus desirable to keep paydays to a minimum.

Rutherford's government appointed a commission in February, but it was not until May that it met. It consisted of Chief Justice <a href="Arthur%20Sifton">Arthur Sifton</a>, mining executive Lewis Stockett, and miners' union executive William Haysom. It began taking evidence in July. In the meantime, a May agreement saw most miners return to work at increased rates of pay; coal supply promptly increased, as did its price. In August, the commission released its recommendations, which included a prohibition on children under 16 working in mines, the posting of inspectors' reports, mandatory bath houses at mine sites, and improved ventilation inspection. It also recommended that Albertans keep a supply of coal on hand during the summer for winter use. The commission was silent on wages (other than to say that these should not be fixed by legislation), the operation of <a href="company%20store">company store</a>s (a sore point among the miners), and the <a href="Incorporation%20%28business%29">incorporation</a> of miners' unions, which was recommended by mine management but opposed by the unions.

The committee also made no recommendation about working hours, but Rutherford's government legislated an <a href="eight-hour%20day">eight-hour day</a> anyway. As well, Rutherford's government also passed <a href="workers%27%20compensation">workers' compensation</a> legislation designed to make such compensation automatic, rather than requiring the injured worker to sue his employer. Labour representatives criticized the bill for failing to impose fines on negligent employers and for limiting construction workers' eligibility under the program to injuries sustained while working on buildings more than in height, as well as for its exemption of casual labourers. It also viewed the maximum payout of $1,500 as inadequate. In response to these concerns, the maximum was increased to $1,800 and the minimum building height reduced to . In response to farmers' concerns, farm labourers were made exempt from the bill entirely.

Rutherford's relationship with organized labour was never easy. Historian L.G. Thomas argued that there was little indication that Rutherford had any interest in courting the labour vote. In 1908, <a href="Labour%20parties%20and%20candidates%20in%20Canada">Labour</a> candidate <a href="Donald%20McNabb">Donald McNabb</a> was elected in a <a href="Lethbridge%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Lethbridge</a> by-election; the riding had previously been held by a Liberal. McNabb was the first Labour MLA elected in Alberta (he was defeated in his 1909 re-election bid).

Rutherford's Liberals self-identified as the party of free enterprise, in contrast to the public ownership-supporting Conservatives. Despite this, they made a limited number of large-scale forays into government operation of utilities, the most notable of which was the creation of <a href="Alberta%20Government%20Telephones">Alberta Government Telephones</a>. In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies. Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies. The largest of this latter group was the <a href="Bell%20Canada">Bell Telephone Company</a>, which held a <a href="monopoly">monopoly</a> over service in Calgary. Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907. The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.

Alberta's public telephone system was financed by debt, which was unusual for a government like Rutherford's that was generally committed to the principle of "<a href="PAYGO">pay as you go</a>". Rutherford's stated rationale was that the cost of such a large capital project shouldn't be borne by a single generation and that incurring debt to finance a corresponding asset was, in contrast to operating <a href="Government%20budget%20deficit">deficit</a>s, acceptable. Though the move was popular at the time, it would prove not to be a financially astute one: by focusing on areas neglected by existing companies, the government was entering into the most expensive and least profitable fields of telecommunication. These problems would not come to fruition until Rutherford had left office, however; in the short-term, the government's involvement in the telephone business helped it to a sweeping victory in the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201909">1909 election</a>, in which the Liberals won 37 of 41 seats in the newly expanded legislature.

Of equal profile was Rutherford's government's management of the province's railways. Alberta's early years were optimistic ones, which manifested itself in a pronounced enthusiasm for the construction of new railway lines. Every town wanted to be a railway centre, and the government had great confidence in the ability of the free market to provide low freight rates to the province's farmers provided sufficient charters were issued to competing companies. The legislature passed government-sponsored legislation setting out a framework for new railways in 1907, but interest from private firms in actually building the lines was limited. In the face of public demand and support by legislators of all parties for as rapid as possible an expansion of the province's lines, the government offered <a href="loan%20guarantees">loan guarantees</a> to several companies in exchange for commitments to build lines. Rutherford justified this in part by his conviction that railways needed to expand along with population, rather than having railway expansion follow population growth as would be the case without government intervention. The Conservatives argued that this strategy didn't go far enough, and called for direct government ownership.

While most public works issues were handled by Public Works Minister Cushing, following the 1909 election Rutherford named himself as the province's first Minister of Railways.

When the legislature met for the first time after the 1909 election, things seemed to be going well for Rutherford and his government. He controlled a huge majority, albeit slightly reduced from the 1905 election, and enjoyed widespread popularity. His government had achieved significant success in setting up a new province, and this success looked poised to continue. Early in this new legislative session, however, two signs of trouble appeared: Liberal backbencher <a href="John%20R.%20Boyle">John R. Boyle</a> began to ask questions about the agreement between the government and the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company, and Cushing resigned from cabinet over his views of this same agreement.

The Alberta and Great Waterways Railway was one of several companies that had been granted charters and assistance by the legislature to build new railways in the province. The government support that it received was more generous than that received by more established railways, such as the <a href="Grand%20Trunk%20Pacific%20Railway">Grand Trunk Pacific Railway</a> and the <a href="Canadian%20Northern%20Railway">Canadian Northern Railway</a>. Boyle, Cushing, and Bennett alleged favouritism or ineptitude by Rutherford and his government, and pointed to the sale of government-guaranteed bonds in support of the company as further evidence. Because of the high interest rate they paid, the bonds were sold at above <a href="par%20value">par value</a>, but the government only received par for them, leaving the company to pocket the difference.

Boyle sponsored a <a href="motion%20of%20non-confidence">motion of non-confidence</a> against the government. Despite enjoying the support of twelve Liberals, including Cushing, the motion was defeated and the government upheld. Rutherford attempted to quell the controversy by calling a <a href="royal%20commission">royal commission</a>, but pressure from many Liberals, including Bulyea, led him to resign May 26, 1910; he was replaced by <a href="Arthur%20Sifton">Arthur Sifton</a>, hitherto the province's chief judge. In November, the royal commission issued its report. It found that the evidence did not show a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> on Rutherford's part, but the majority report was nevertheless highly critical of the former Premier. A minority report was much kinder, avowing perfect satisfaction with Rutherford's version of events.

Before the <a href="Canadian%20federal%20election%2C%201911">1911 federal election</a>, several local Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver asked Rutherford to run against him in <a href="Strathcona%20%28electoral%20district%29">Strathcona</a>. Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly—Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross, who he viewed as a rival for dominance of the Liberal party in Alberta, and his Edmonton Bulletin had taken the side of the dissidents during the railway scandal. A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate, though Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting. Before this meeting came to pass, however, Rutherford abruptly withdrew. Historian Douglas Babcock suggested that this was due to the Conservatives' nomination of <a href="William%20Antrobus%20Griesbach">William Antrobus Griesbach</a>, dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude their opposing him. Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford had been asked to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund, and had balked. Rutherford himself cited a desire to avoid <a href="vote%20splitting">splitting the vote</a> on <a href="Reciprocity%20%28Canadian%20politics%29">reciprocity</a>, which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed. Whatever the reason, for Rutherford's standing aloof from the election, Oliver was nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.

After resigning as Premier, Rutherford continued to sit as a Liberal MLA. He commanded the loyalty of many Liberals who had supported his government through the Alberta and Great Waterways issue, though this faction began increasingly to see Cross as its real leader. Rutherford opposed the Sifton government's decision to confiscate the Alberta and Great Waterways bond money and revoke its charter, and in 1913 was one of only two Liberals to support a non-confidence motion against the government (Cross had by this time joined the Sifton cabinet, which placated most members of the Cross-Rutherford faction). In the <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201913">1913 election</a>, Rutherford was again nominated as the Liberal candidate in <a href="Edmonton%20South%20%28provincial%20electoral%20district%29">Edmonton South</a> (Strathcona had been amalgamated into Edmonton in 1912), despite pledging opposition to the Sifton government and offering to campaign around the province for the Conservatives if they agreed not to run a candidate against him. At the nomination meeting, he stated that he was "not running as a Sifton candidate" and was "a good independent candidate ... and a good Liberal too". Despite his opposition to the government, the Conservatives declined his offer of support and nominated <a href="Herbert%20Crawford">Herbert Crawford</a> to run against him. After a vigorous campaign, Crawford defeated Rutherford by fewer than 250 votes. Cross lobbied Prime Minister Laurier for Rutherford to be appointed to the <a href="Senate%20of%20Canada">Senate</a>. This was unsuccessful, but Rutherford was made <a href="King%27s%20Counsel">King's Counsel</a> shortly after his electoral defeat.

Rutherford took a strong line against the Sifton government and was nominated as Conservative candidate for the 1917 provincial election but stood down after being named as Alberta director of the National Service (conscription). (EB, Nov. 6, 1916)

In <a href="Alberta%20general%20election%2C%201921">that year's provincial election</a>, he campaigned actively for the Conservatives, including for Crawford, the man who had defeated him eight years earlier. Rutherford continued to call himself a Liberal, but criticized the incumbent administration for the growth of the provincial debt and for letting the party fall into disarray. Calling the <a href="Charles%20Stewart%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">Charles Stewart</a>-led government "rotten" and holding a grudge against cabinet minister John R. Boyle in particular, he offered voters the slogan "get rid of the barnacles and the <a href="John%20R.%20Boyle">Boyle</a>s", a homonymic reference to the parasitic growth on the side of a ship. He may have been thrilled to see the Liberal government fall in the election, but probably less so when he saw that the triumphant <a href="United%20Farmers%20of%20Alberta">United Farmers of Alberta</a> had also whittled the Conservatives down to only one seat.

Once out of politics, Rutherford returned to his law practice. His partnership with Jamieson saw partners come and go. Rutherford divided his time between the original Strathcona office and the Edmonton office he opened in 1910; his practice focussed on <a href="contract">contract</a>s, <a href="real%20estate">real estate</a>, <a href="will%20%28law%29">wills</a> and <a href="estate%20%28law%29">estates</a>, and <a href="incorporation%20%28business%29">incorporation</a>s. In 1923, Rutherford's son Cecil joined the firm along with Stanley Harwood McCuaig, who in 1919 would marry Rutherford's daughter Hazel. In 1925, Jamieson left the partnership to establish his own firm. In 1939, McCuaig did the same. Cecil's partnership with his father continued until the latter's death.

Besides his work as a lawyer, Alexander Rutherford was involved in a number of business enterprises. He was President of the Edmonton Mortgage Corporation, and Vice President and solicitor of the Great Western Garment Company. This latter enterprise, which Rutherford co-founded, was a great success: established in 1911 with eight seamstresses, it had quadrupled in size within a year. During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, the Great Western Garment Company made military uniforms and was reputed to be the largest garment operation in the British Empire. It was acquired by <a href="Levi%20Strauss%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">Levi Strauss & Co.</a> in 1961, but continued to manufacture garments in Edmonton until 2004.

Rutherford also acted as director of the Canada National Fire Insurance Company, the Imperial Canadian Trust Company, the Great West Permanent Loan Company, and the Monarch Life Assurance Company.

Education was a personal priority of Rutherford's, as evidenced by his retention of the office of Education Minister for his entire time as Premier and by his enthusiastic work in founding the <a href="University%20of%20Alberta">University of Alberta</a>. In 1911 he was elected by Alberta's university graduates to the University of Alberta Senate, responsible for the institution's academic affairs. In 1912 he established the Rutherford Gold Medal in English for the senior year honours English student with the highest standing; the prize still exists today as the Rutherford Memorial Medal in English. In 1912, with the University's first graduating class, Rutherford instituted a tradition of inviting convocating students to his house for tea; this tradition would last for twenty-six years.

Convocation was not the only reason that students visited Rutherford's home: he had a wealth of both knowledge and books on Canadian subjects, and welcomed students to consult his private library. This library eventually expanded beyond the room in his mansion devoted to it, to encompass the house's den, maid's sitting room, and garage as well. After his death, the collection was donated and sold to the University's library system; it was described in 1967 as "still the most important rare collection in the library".

Rutherford remained on the university senate until 1927, <a href="Chancellors%20of%20the%20University%20of%20Alberta">when he was elected Chancellor</a>. The position was the titular head of the university, and its primary duty was presiding over convocations. According to Rutherford biographer Douglas Babcock, this was the honour that Rutherford prized most. He was acclaimed to the position every four years until his death. It has been estimated that he awarded degrees to more than five thousand students. His final convocation, however, was marred by controversy: in 1941, a committee of the university senate recommended awarding an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary degree</a> to Premier <a href="William%20Aberhart">William Aberhart</a>. Aberhart was pleased, and happily accepted University President <a href="William%20Alexander%20Robb%20Kerr">William Alexander Robb Kerr</a>'s invitation to deliver the commencement address at convocation. However, a week prior to convocation the full senate—responsible for all university academic affairs—met, and voted against awarding Aberhart a degree. Aberhart rescinded his acceptance of Kerr's invitation (and later removed the senate's authority—except, ironically, the authority to award honorary degrees) and Kerr resigned in protest. Rutherford was mortified, but presided over convocation nonetheless.

Rutherford remained active in a wide range of community organizations well after his departure from politics. He was a <a href="deacon">deacon</a> in his church until well into his dotage, was a member of the <a href="World%20YWCA">Young Women's Christian Association</a> advisory board from 1913 until his death, was Edmonton's first exalted ruler of the <a href="Benevolent%20and%20Protective%20Order%20of%20Elks">Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks</a> and spent three years as the grand exalted ruler of the Elk Order of Canada. During <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> he was Alberta director of the National Service Commission, which oversaw <a href="conscription">conscription</a> from 1916 until 1918, and in 1916 was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 194th Highland Battalion of the <a href="Canadian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Canadian Expeditionary Force</a>. Rutherford served on the Loan Advisory Committee of the Soldier Settlement Board after the war, was President of the Alberta Historical Society (which had been created by his government) from 1919 until his death, was elected President of the McGill University Alumni Association of Alberta in 1922, and spent the last years of his life as honorary president of the Canadian Authors Association. He was also a member of the Northern Alberta Pioneers and Old-Timers Association, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Colonial Institute of London, and the <a href="freemasonry">Masons</a>. He continued to <a href="curling">curl</a> and played <a href="tennis">tennis</a> into his late fifties, and took up <a href="golf">golf</a> at the age of sixty-four, becoming a charter member of the Mayfair Golf and Country Club. He received honorary doctorates of laws from four universities: McGill, the University of Alberta, <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a>, and the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a>.
In 1911, the Rutherfords built a new house adjacent to the University of Alberta campus. Rutherford named it "Archnacarry", after his <a href="Achnacarry%2C%20Scotland">ancestral homeland</a>. It is now known as <a href="Rutherford%20House">Rutherford House</a>, and serves as a museum. He made several trips to the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and was invited to attend the <a href="coronation%20of%20King%20George%20VI%20and%20Queen%20Elizabeth">coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth</a>, but had to return to Canada before the event. On December 19, 1938, the Rutherfords celebrated their fiftieth <a href="wedding%20anniversary">wedding anniversary</a>; tributes and well-wishes arrived from across Canada.

Besides his <a href="bronchitis">bronchitis</a>, Rutherford developed <a href="diabetes">diabetes</a> in later years. His wife monitored his sugar intake, though when they were apart Rutherford sometimes took less care than she would have liked him to. In 1938, possibly as a result of diabetes, he suffered a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> that left him paralyzed and mute. He learned to walk again and with the help of a grade one reader got his speech back. September 13, 1940, Mattie Rutherford died of cancer. Less than a year later, June 11, 1941, Rutherford suffered a fatal <a href="heart%20attack">heart attack</a> while in hospital for <a href="insulin">insulin</a> treatment. He was 84 years old. Alexander Rutherford was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton, alongside his family. His name was attached to many institutions both during his life and after: Rutherford Elementary School in Edmonton was established in 1911 and the University of Alberta's Rutherford Library in 1951. In 1954, a mountain in <a href="Jasper%20National%20Park">Jasper National Park</a> was named <a href="Mount%20Rutherford">Mount Rutherford</a>. In 1980, the government of Alberta created the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship, which awards more than $20 million annually to high school students selected on the basis of a minimum of a 75% average. The top ten students receiving Alexander Rutherford scholarships are recognized as 'Rutherford Scholars', and are presented with an additional scholarship and plaque.

Rutherford's policy legacy is mixed. L. G. Thomas concludes that he was a weak leader, unable to dominate the ambitions of his lieutenants and with very little skill at debate. Despite this, he recognizes the Rutherford government's legacy of province building. Douglas Babcock suggests that Rutherford, while himself honourable, left himself at the mercy of unscrupulous men who ultimately ruined his political career. Bennett, Rutherford's rival and later Prime Minister, concurred with this assessment, calling Rutherford "a gentleman of the old school ... not equipped by experience or temperament for the rough and tumble of western politics". There is general agreement that Rutherford's greatest legacy, and the one in which he took the most pride, lies in his contributions to Alberta's education. As <a href="Mount%20Royal%20College">Mount Royal College</a> historian Patricia Roome concluded her chapter on Rutherford in a book about Alberta's first twelve premiers, "Rutherford's educational contribution remains his ultimate legacy to Albertans."

European storm petrel

The European storm petrel, British storm petrel or just storm petrel ("Hydrobates pelagicus") is a <a href="seabird">seabird</a> in the <a href="northern%20storm%20petrel">northern storm petrel</a> <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, Hydrobatidae. It is the <a href="monotypic%20taxon">only member</a> of the genus "Hydrobates". The small, square-tailed bird is entirely black except for a broad white rump and a white band on the underwings, and it has a fluttering, bat-like flight. The large majority of the population breeds on islands off the coasts of Europe, with the greatest numbers in the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a>, United Kingdom, Ireland and Iceland. The Mediterranean population is a separate subspecies, but is inseparable at sea from its Atlantic relatives; its strongholds are <a href="Filfla">Filfla</a> Island (Malta), <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>.

The storm petrel nests in crevices and burrows, sometimes shared with other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on bare soil. The adults share the lengthy <a href="egg%20incubation">incubation</a> and both feed the chick, which is not normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, spending the <a href="Northern%20Hemisphere">northern hemisphere</a> winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid and <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a> while pattering on the sea's surface, and can find oily edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird's stomach to an oily orange liquid which is regurgitated when the chick is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the storm petrel has a chattering call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight, and the male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.

The storm petrel cannot survive on islands where land mammals such as rats and cats have been introduced, and it suffers natural predation from <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="skua">skua</a>s, <a href="owl">owl</a>s and <a href="falcon">falcon</a>s. Although the population may be declining slightly, this petrel is classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a> due to its high total numbers. Its presence in rough weather at sea has led to various mariners' superstitions, and, by analogy, to its use as a symbol by revolutionary and <a href="anarchy">anarchist</a> groups.

The <a href="storm%20petrel">storm petrel</a>s, Hydrobatidae, are one of the four major <a href="family%20%28biology%29">families</a> of the <a href="Procellariiformes">Procellariiformes</a> or "tubenoses", an <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> of <a href="seabird">seabird</a>s that also includes the <a href="albatross">albatross</a>es, the <a href="Procellariidae">Procellariidae</a>, and the <a href="diving%20petrel">diving petrel</a>s. The family is an ancient group of small species which is thought to have <a href="divergent%20evolution">diverged</a> early from the rest of the tubenoses; the supporting fossil record is poor, with specimens from California dating back only to the <a href="Late%20Miocene">Late Miocene</a> (11.6–5.3 million years ago). The Hydrobatidae are often divided into two subfamilies, the mainly <a href="Southern%20Hemisphere">southern hemisphere</a> Oceanitinae and the northern Hydrobatinae; <a href="Cytochrome%20b">cytochrome "b"</a> <a href="Nucleic%20acid%20sequence">DNA sequence</a> analysis suggests that these might be full families. The European storm petrel is the only member of the genus "Hydrobates", the remainder of the Hydrobatinae being placed in "<a href="Oceanodroma">Oceanodroma</a>", although the <a href="least%20storm%20petrel">least storm petrel</a> is sometimes separated as the sole member of "Halocyptena". The relationships within the Hydrobatinae are complex and uncertain, and it has been suggested that all the members of the subfamily could be subsumed into an enlarged "Hydrobates".

The storm petrel was first described from by <a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in his "Systema naturae" in 1758 as "Procellaria pelagica". It was moved to the genus "Hydrobates" by <a href="Friedrich%20Boie">Friedrich Boie</a> in 1822. "Petrel", first recorded in 1602, is a corruption of "pitteral", referring to the bird's pitter-pattering across the water. The suggestion that the word refers to <a href="Saint%20Peter">St Peter</a> walking on the waves is a later invention. "Storm" arises from seamen's association of this bird with bad weather. In English, the name of the species was written as "stormy petrel" by some 19th-century authors.

The <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">scientific name</a> derives from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a>; "Hydrobates" is from "hudro", water, and "bates", walker, and "pelagicus" is from "pelagikos", of the sea. There are two recognised <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, the North Atlantic <a href="Subspecies%23Nominotypical%20subspecies%20and%20subspecies%20autonyms">nominate subspecies</a>, "H. p. pelagicus" (Linnaeus, 1758), and the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean</a> "H. p. melitensis" (<a href="Antonio%20Schembri%20%28ornithologist%29">Schembri</a>, 1843). Although there is some <a href="gene">gene</a>tic support for classifying the southern form as a separate species, the <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> is not considered sufficiently different from that of the nominate subspecies to justify a split.

The storm petrel is a small bird, in length with a wingspan. It weighs , with an average of . It is square-tailed and has all-black <a href="plumage">plumage</a> except for a snow-white rump that extends to the sides of the tail base and a broad white band on the underwings. Juveniles in fresh plumage can also show a narrow white bar on the upperwing. The plumage becomes dark brown rather than black as it becomes worn. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although in the Mediterranean subspecies, at least, most captured birds can be sexed using a formula which involves multiplying the wing length by the length of the white rump band; females are slightly larger and have a longer white rump than males. The Mediterranean subspecies has longer wings and a heavier bill on average than the nominate form, but neither sex nor subspecies can be determined by observation at sea.

<a href="moulting">Moult</a> is prolonged in all tubenoses, since they must maintain an ability to fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage after those further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced moulting in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.

The storm petrel's large nasal <a href="olfactory%20bulb">olfactory bulb</a>s facilitate a keen sense of smell, and the birds themselves have a distinctive musty aroma which can help researchers to locate breeding colonies. Individual petrels recognise their own body scent and can use it to locate their nest in the dark.

The flight is weak-looking and resembles that of a bat, with fluttering interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the <a href="Wilson%27s%20storm%20petrel">Wilson's storm petrel</a>, do not look as if they are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its <a href="tarsus%20%28skeleton%29">tarsi</a>; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.

The European storm petrel can be distinguished from related <a href="Western%20Palaearctic">Western Palaearctic</a> species by the white bar on its underwing and its distinctive fluttering flight. Compared to <a href="Leach%27s%20storm%20petrel">Leach's storm petrel</a>, <a href="band-rumped%20storm%20petrel">band-rumped storm petrel</a>, and the recently described <a href="Monteiro%27s%20storm%20petrel">Monteiro's storm petrel</a>, it is also smaller, darker, shorter-winged and has a square tail. Wilson's storm petrel lacks an underwing bar, and has long legs with the feet visible beyond the tail.

In its display flight, the storm petrel gives a call consisting of eight or more repetitions of a fast "ter-CHICK" sounds ending in a <a href="trill%20%28music%29">trill</a> (rapid alternation of notes). This chattering, staccato call is highly variable in pitch, stress and length. Both sexes make the call, which is used as an advertisement for a mate, for pair recognition, and in the nuptial flight. The details of the vocalisation vary geographically, including between the Atlantic and Mediterranean populations, and birds recognise calls from their own breeding area. The chatter-call of the Mediterranean subspecies is distinctive. It has the first two notes running into each other, and the final element is sometimes doubled. The storm petrel is usually silent at sea, but sometimes gives the chattering call. A purring song "arrr-r-r-r-r-r-r… " ending with a sharp "chikka" is given in the burrow by the male only; it was described by <a href="Charles%20Oldham%20%28naturalist%29">Charles Oldham</a> as "like a fairy being sick". Other vocalisations include a fast "wick-wick-wick", sometimes given in flight, and an "up-CHERRK" alarm which resembles the chatter-call. Chicks give a whistling "pee-pee-pee" call when being fed, and a faster version of this vocalisation is used by adults and young to signal distress.

Storm petrels breed only in the Western Palaearctic on islands off the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts of Europe. The largest colonies are in the <a href="Faroe%20Islands">Faroe Islands</a> (150,000-400,000 pairs), United Kingdom (20,000-150,000), Ireland (50,000-100,000) and Iceland (50,000-100,000), with smaller breeding areas off Norway, Malta, Spain, the <a href="Canary%20Islands">Canary Islands</a>, Italy, France and Greece. The strongholds of the "melitensis" subspecies are the island of <a href="Filfla">Filfla</a> (Malta), <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> and the <a href="Balearic%20Islands">Balearic Islands</a>, with smaller sites elsewhere in the Mediterranean. This latter form also breeds in North Africa; definitely in Tunisia, probably in Algeria and possibly in Morocco. Because of its nocturnal habits and the problems of accessing some of the small islands on which it breeds, the distribution is poorly known. A colony was discovered as recently as 2009, on <a href="Lampedusa">Lampedusa</a>. The storm petrel has been recorded as a vagrant in several European countries as far east as the Ukraine, in the <a href="Guinea%20%28region%29">Guinea region</a> of West Africa, and in Turkey, Israel, Lebanon, and the US. Although there were no North American records for more than 30 years after the first in 1970, this bird has been more or less annual in small numbers since 2003.

The storm petrel breeds on exposed and usually uninhabited islands which it visits only at night. It otherwise frequents mid-depth waters away from the coastal zone, but not over the ocean deeps. In the breeding season, it is mainly found between the 10–25 °C July <a href="Isotherm%20%28contour%20line%29">isotherms</a>. In Europe, it is rarely seen from land except in autumn storms.

The storm petrel is <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, spending the northern hemisphere winter mainly in cool waters off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, south to <a href="latitude">latitude</a> 38°S and east to <a href="KwaZulu-Natal">KwaZulu-Natal</a>. Some birds stay north of the equator in the seas adjoining Mauritania and <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20Oro">Rio de Oro</a>, and a few remain near the breeding islands, especially in the Mediterranean. It is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season, although it is described as regularly seen from land in West Africa. Young birds do not return to the breeding colonies until their second or third year. Birds mostly head south from the breeding islands between September and November, reaching West Africa by mid-November and the south Atlantic by the end of the year. The return passage starts in April, with late records from the tropics and further south probably representing sub-adult birds that will not breed that year.

The storm petrel is sexually mature at age 4–5 years, with the Mediterranean subspecies typically breeding a year earlier than the Atlantic form. Breeding happens in <a href="colony%20%28biology%29">colonies</a> and normally begins in late May or June. Pairs have a repeated nocturnal display flight in which the male chases the female, the chase being accompanied by flight calls. Some near-adult birds may pair up and occupy a hole at the same time, prior to breeding in the following year.

Storm petrels normally nest in crevices between or under rocks, or burrow in the soil. When they make their own tunnels, they loosen the earth with their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of <a href="Atlantic%20puffin">Atlantic puffin</a>s and <a href="Manx%20shearwater">Manx shearwater</a>s are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.

The nest tunnel is long and across, with a slightly narrower entrance. The nest chamber is typically unlined, although pairs may bring in some grass, <a href="bracken">bracken</a> or seaweed. Although the storm petrel is generally non-territorial when breeding, a pair will defend the nest chamber itself after the eggs have been laid.

The <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> is a single egg, usually pure white, sometimes with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are <a href="egg%20incubation">incubated</a> by both parents for 38–50 days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three days at a time on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are <a href="altricial">altricial</a> and covered with silver-grey down, and are fed by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50 days, the chicks are fed less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks <a href="fledge">fledge</a> about 56–86 days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.

Tubenoses have smaller egg clutches and much longer and more variable incubation and fledging times than <a href="passerine">passerine</a>s with similarly sized eggs, resembling <a href="swift">swift</a>s in these developmental factors. Tubenoses and swifts have generally secure nest sites, but their food sources are unreliable, whereas passerines are vulnerable in the nest but food is usually plentiful. In the particular case of the storm petrel, it has a body temperature perhaps 3 °C lower than other small birds, and this may also contribute to the lengthy incubation.

The adult petrel's annual death rate is 12–13%, and the typical life span is 11 years. Longevity records established from <a href="bird%20ringing">bird ringing</a> recoveries include a bird aged 31 years 11 months 9 days, and another aged more than 33 years.

The storm petrel normally flies within of the water surface and typically feeds by picking items off the sea as it patters over the surface. Birds have been observed diving for food to a depth of not more than . and it is claimed, using indirect measurements, that the Mediterranean subspecies reaches depths of up to ). A bird may range up to over the course of two or three days in search of food. Although the bird usually feeds during the day, in the breeding season petrels will often feed at night close to the shore.

The typical prey consists of surface organisms such as small fish, <a href="squid">squid</a>, <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s and <a href="jellyfish">jellyfish</a>. The storm petrel will also eat offal and oily food, often located by smell, and will follow ships. In the Atlantic, more than half the food items are <a href="zooplankton">zooplankton</a> and the fish caught include small <a href="Atlantic%20herring">herring</a> and <a href="European%20sprat">sprats</a>; whale carcasses are scavenged where available. During digestion, the plankton is quickly converted to an oily orange liquid that owes its colour to <a href="carotenoid">carotenoid</a>s. Larger prey items take longer to digest. The oil, rich in <a href="vitamin%20A">vitamin A</a>, is produced by a large gland in the stomach. The Mediterranean subspecies' diet is mainly fish, particularly <a href="Gymnammodytes%20cicerelus">Mediterranean sand eels</a>. Petrels also catch <a href="mysida">opossum shrimps</a> from waters close to the colony. <a href="Bluefin%20tuna">Bluefin tuna</a> farms are exploited on the Maltese island of Filfla; birds from the large local colony feed on the unwashed food fed to the farmed tuna, a mixture of fish, squid and prawns which produces a sizeable oily slick. Small numbers of insects are caught near breeding colonies, and some plant material, including <a href="flowering%20plant">angiosperm</a> seeds and <a href="sorrel">sorrel</a>, has been found in the stomach contents. A study on Leach's storm petrel, which consumes similar items, showed that the petrels were snipping pieces off plant leaves in flight, but it could not be confirmed that this was in the course of catching insects. Nasal glands remove excess salt from seawater consumed by the petrel as a concentrated solution excreted through the nostrils.

Petrels can be attracted to boats with "<a href="chumming">chum</a>", a malodorous mixture typically containing fish heads, bones and offal, with added fish oil and <a href="popcorn">popcorn</a> to aid flotation. An apparently empty ocean will soon fill with hundreds of birds attracted by the smell. The attraction of the fishy odour is sometimes enhanced by the addition of <a href="dimethyl%20sulfide">dimethylsulphide</a> (DMS) a chemical also naturally produced by some <a href="plankton">plankton</a>ic organisms, although there are doubts about the safety of this possible <a href="carcinogen">carcinogen</a>.

Adults and young are vulnerable to predation at the breeding colonies, their only defence being to spit oil. Petrels cannot breed on islands where rats have been introduced, and feral cats frequently kill these birds on <a href="Foula">Foula</a> in the <a href="Shetland%20Islands">Shetland Islands</a>. The <a href="American%20mink">American mink</a>, a non-native species in Europe, is a strong swimmer, and can colonise islands up to from the mainland. Natural predators of petrels and other seabirds include skuas and large gulls. The <a href="yellow-legged%20gull">yellow-legged gull</a> is a particular problem in the Mediterranean, and <a href="great%20skua">great skua</a>s were estimated to kill 7,500 petrels a year on <a href="St%20Kilda%2C%20Scotland">St Kilda</a>, an unsustainable number. Some <a href="great%20black-backed%20gull">great black-backed gull</a>s on the Atlantic islands specialise in taking seabird chicks at night, and <a href="peregrine%20falcon">peregrine falcon</a>s hunt adults at sea. Localised predators include <a href="Eleonora%27s%20falcon">Eleonora's falcon</a> on the <a href="Columbretes%20Islands">Columbretes Islands</a> and the nocturnal <a href="barn%20owl">barn owl</a> on the Balearics; a few owls can wipe out a colony. The <a href="little%20owl">little owl</a> is also a predator of both adults and young where it occurs.

<a href="Feather%20mite">Feather mite</a>s of at least two species have been found on the storm petrel, with "<a href="Halipeurus%20pelagicus">Halipeurus pelagicus</a>" occurring at much higher densities than "<a href="Philoceanus%20robertsi">Philoceanus robertsi</a>". The <a href="flea">flea</a> "<a href="Xenopsylla%20gratiosa">Xenopsylla gratiosa</a>" and <a href="Dermanyssidae">dermanyssid</a> <a href="mite">mite</a>s are commonly found, with lower numbers of <a href="tick">tick</a>s. These blood-sucking parasites slow the growth rate of nestlings and may affect their survival rate.

Storm petrels seem to be largely free of <a href="haematozoa">blood parasites</a>, even when in close proximity to carrier species such as the yellow-legged gull. It has been suggested that seabird species with long incubation periods and long lives have well-developed immune systems that prevent serious blood parasitism.

The European population of the storm petrel has been estimated at 430,000–510,000 breeding pairs or 1,290,000–1,530,000 individual birds and makes up 95% of the world total numbers. The population estimate includes about 11,000 to 16,000 breeding pairs of the Mediterranean subspecies. It is very difficult to accurately determine Storm Petrel populations. The main method used is listening for responses to playback calls at burrow entrances, but infra-red filming may also be an option. 

Although this species' population now appears to be declining, the decrease is not rapid or large enough to trigger conservation vulnerability criteria. Given its high numbers, this petrel is therefore classified by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> as being of <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>. The perceived decline may be due increased predation from gulls, skuas and introduced mammals. Eradication of rats protects seabird colonies and may enable recolonisation of islands cleared of rodents. Predation of cave-nesting petrels in the Balearics by yellow-legged gulls is restricted to relatively few individual gulls specialising in this prey item; this means that the problems can be controlled by selective culling and the provision of plastic nest boxes.

Because it feeds in flight, the storm petrel is less affected by <a href="oil%20spill">oil pollution</a> than other seabirds, and may be able to use its good sense of smell to avoid slicks, although a large spill near a breeding colony could have serious consequences.

Its association with storms makes the storm petrel a bird of bad omen to mariners; they are said to either foretell or cause bad weather. A more prosaic explanation of their appearance in rough weather is that, like most oceanic seabirds, they rely on the winds to support them in flight and just sit on the water surface when becalmed. The birds were sometimes thought to be the souls of perished sailors, and killing a petrel was believed to bring bad luck. The petrel's reputation led to the old name of "witch", although the commonest of the folk names is Mother Carey's Chicken, a name also used for storm petrels in general in the UK and USA from at least 1767. This is believed to be a corruption of "mater cara" ("dear mother", the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin Mary</a>), a reference to the supernatural <a href="Mother%20Carey">Mother Carey</a>, or a superstitious modification of an earlier "Mother Mary's Chicken" to reduce the potency of the religious name. The Mother Carey character appears a number of times in literature. In the <a href="C.%20Fox%20Smith">Cicely Fox Smith</a> poem "Mother Carey", she calls old sailors to return to the sea, but in <a href="John%20Masefield">John Masefield</a>'s poem of the same name she is seen as a wrecker of ships. She appears as a fairy in <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>'s "<a href="The%20Water-Babies%2C%20A%20Fairy%20Tale%20for%20a%20Land%20Baby">The Water Babies</a>" and is depicted in one of <a href="Jessie%20Willcox%20Smith">Jessie Willcox Smith</a>'s illustrations for the book.

The association of the storm petrel with turbulent weather has led to its use as a metaphor for revolutionary views, the <a href="epithet">epithet</a> "stormy petrel" being applied by various authors to characters as disparate as <a href="Roman%20Republic">Roman</a> <a href="tribune">tribune</a> <a href="Publius%20Clodius%20Pulcher">Publius Clodius Pulcher</a>, a <a href="Presbyterian">Presbyterian</a> minister in the early Carolinas, an Afghan governor, or an <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> politician.

A 1901 poem by Russian writer <a href="Maxim%20Gorky">Maxim Gorky</a> is invariably titled in English as "<a href="The%20Song%20of%20the%20Stormy%20Petrel">The Song of the Stormy Petrel</a>", although that may not be a perfectly accurate translation of the Russian title "Песня о Буревестнике", because "Буревестник" (the name of the bird in Russian) translates to the English general term "storm bird". The poem was called "the battle anthem of the revolution", and earned Gorky the nickname "The Storm Petrel of the Revolution".

Various <a href="Insurrectionary%20anarchism">revolutionary anarchist</a> groups adopted the bird's name, either as a group identifier, as in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>, or for their publications. "The Stormy Petrel" ("Burevestnik") was the title of the magazine of the <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Russia">Anarchist Communist Federation in Russia</a> around the time of the <a href="Revolution%20of%201905">1905 revolution</a>, and is still an imprint of the London group of the <a href="Anarchist%20Federation%20%28Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">Anarchist Federation (Britain and Ireland)</a>. To honor Gorky and his work, the name "Burevestnik" was bestowed on a variety of institutions, locations, and products in the USSR.

Pallas's leaf warbler

The Pallas's leaf warbler or Pallas's warbler ("Phylloscopus proregulus") is a <a href="bird">bird</a> that breeds in mountain forests from southern <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> east to northern <a href="Mongolia">Mongolia</a> and <a href="northeast%20China">northeast China</a>. It is named for German <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a>, who first formally described it. This <a href="leaf%20warbler">leaf warbler</a> is strongly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a>, wintering mainly in <a href="south%20China">south China</a> and adjacent areas of <a href="southeast%20Asia">southeast Asia</a>, although in recent decades increasing numbers have been found in Europe in autumn.

Pallas's leaf warbler is one of the smallest Eurasian <a href="warbler">warbler</a>s, with a relatively large head and short tail. It has greenish upperparts and white underparts, a lemon-yellow rump, and yellow double wingbars, <a href="supercilium">supercilia</a> and central <a href="crown%20%28anatomy%29">crown</a> stripe. It is similar in appearance to several other Asian warblers, including some that were formerly considered to be its <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, although its distinctive <a href="bird%20vocalization">vocalisations</a> aid identification.

The female builds a <a href="Bird%20nest%23Cup">cup nest</a> in a tree or bush, and <a href="Egg%20incubation%23Avian%20incubation">incubates</a> the four to six eggs, which <a href="hatchling">hatch</a> after 12–13 days. The chicks are fed mainly by the female and <a href="fledge">fledge</a> when they are 12–14 days old; both parents then bring food for about a week. Pallas's leaf warbler is <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a>, feeding on the adults, <a href="larva">larva</a>e and <a href="pupa">pupa</a> of small <a href="insect">insect</a>s and <a href="spider">spider</a>s. Birds forage in bushes and trees, picking items from leaves or catching prey in short flights or while hovering. The Pallas's leaf warbler has a large range, and its numbers are believed to be stable. It therefore is evaluated as of "<a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a>" by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN).

The English name of Pallas's leaf warbler commemorates the German <a href="zoology">zoologist</a> <a href="Peter%20Simon%20Pallas">Peter Simon Pallas</a>, who found it on the <a href="Ingoda%20River">Ingoda River</a> in <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a> in May 1772. He named the new <a href="species">species</a> as "Motacilla proregulus" when he finally published his findings in 1811. The current <a href="genus">genus</a> name "Phylloscopus" is from <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "phullon", "leaf", and "skopos", "seeker" (from "skopeo", "to watch"). The specific "proregulus" is from Greek "pro", "close to", and the name "regulus", referring to the similar-looking <a href="goldcrest">goldcrest</a>, "Regulus regulus".

First described by German zoologist <a href="Friedrich%20Boie">Friedrich Boie</a> in 1826, the genus "Phylloscopus" comprises about 50 species of small <a href="insectivore">insectivorous</a> Old World woodland warblers that are either greenish or brown above and yellowish, white or buff below. The genus was formerly part of the <a href="Old%20World%20warbler">Old World warbler</a> family Sylvidae, but has now been split off as a separate family, the <a href="Phylloscopidae">Phylloscopidae</a>.

Within the genus, Pallas's leaf warbler is one of a group of similar tiny Asiatic species characterised by a yellow rump, a strong <a href="supercilium">supercilium</a> (stripe over the eye), double wing bars and a stripe on the crown of the head, once separated as the genus "Abrornis" but currently retained in "Phylloscopus".

Pallas's leaf warbler was itself formerly treated as a complex of several <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a>, with the <a href="Subspecies%23Nominotypical%20subspecies%20and%20subspecies%20autonyms">nominate form</a> "P. p. proregulus" breeding in northern Asia, and other subspecies breeding much further south at high altitudes in the mountains from the western <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a> east to western China (<a href="Yunnan">Yunnan</a> and north to <a href="Gansu">Gansu</a> and <a href="Hebei">Hebei</a>).

Although nineteenth-century field naturalists such as <a href="Gilbert%20White">Gilbert White</a> and <a href="William%20Edwin%20Brooks">William Edwin Brooks</a> had noted the importance of calls in separating often very similar-looking leaf warblers, for many years their views were not always accepted by the ornithological establishment. More recently, vocalisations have become increasingly important in taxonomy. In the case of the former subspecies of Pallas's leaf warbler, even though they differ only slightly in <a href="plumage">plumage</a>, the southern forms are very distinctive vocally. Their songs and calls differ from those of the nominate race, and <a href="DNA">DNA</a> analysis from 2006 has confirmed these forms to be sufficiently distinct that they are now treated as separate species, leaving Pallas's leaf warbler as a <a href="monotypic%20taxon">monotypic taxon</a>. The split species are:


Of these, "Phylloscopus chloronotus forresti" is possibly also a separate species, but further analysis is required to confirm this. The breeding ranges of the Gansu leaf warbler and the Chinese leaf warbler overlap in southern Gansu, but the species are separated <a href="ecology">ecologically</a>: the Gansu leaf warbler is found in taller forest habitats and the Chinese leaf warbler uses lower, often scrubby habitats. "Lemon-rumped warbler" was sometimes used as synonym for Pallas's leaf warbler before the species' split. Pallas's leaf warbler appears to have diverged from the Chinese leaf warbler 4.1–5.5 million years ago, and from its other former subspecies about 1.7–3.2 million years ago.

Pallas's leaf warbler is one of the smallest warblers, with a large head and short tail. At long and in weight, it is slightly smaller than a <a href="yellow-browed%20warbler">yellow-browed warbler</a> and barely any larger than a goldcrest. It has greenish upperparts and white underparts, but is very striking, with prominent pale yellow double wingbars on the wing <a href="covert%20feather">covert feather</a>s, bold yellow supercilia and central crown stripe, and a lemon-yellow rump. The bill is blackish-brown with a yellowish tinge to the cutting edges and the base of the lower <a href="mandible">mandible</a>, the <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">iris</a> is brown, and the legs are brown with a green or greyish tinge. Although the yellow rump is obvious when a bird is low in vegetation or hovering, it can otherwise be hard to see.

In Asia, Pallas's leaf warbler can be distinguished from its former subspecies by its yellower head stripes, wingbars and throat as well as its different vocalisations. Other yellow-rumped Asiatic warblers resemble Pallas's; <a href="buff-barred%20warbler">buff-barred</a> and <a href="Brooks%27s%20leaf%20warbler">Brooks's leaf warbler</a>s are larger, much duller green above and less strongly marked, and their wing bars are buff and white respectively, not yellow. <a href="Ashy-throated%20warbler">Ashy-throated warbler</a> has grey head markings, face and throat, and pale yellow underparts.

The sexes of Pallas's leaf warbler have similar plumage, but non-breeding birds are somewhat brighter green above and have broad, bright fringes to their <a href="flight%20feather">flight feather</a>s. Juveniles are like the adults, but have a brown tinge to the upperparts, greyish-white underparts and a duller supercilium. Adults have a complete post-breeding <a href="moulting">moult</a> in August or September before migrating south. Juveniles and pre-breeding adults have a partial moult in March or April, replacing all the body plumage and some tail feathers.

The song of Pallas's leaf warbler is delivered from a concealed perch near the top of a tall tree. It is strong and prolonged, with a medley of whistles, "tirrit-tirrt-tirrit-terchee-choo-choo-chee-chee-chee" or similar, with some phrases reminiscent of a <a href="Atlantic%20canary">canary</a>, and interspersed <a href="trill%20%28music%29">trills</a>. It lasts 2–4 seconds and may be heard in the winter quarters as well as from breeding birds. The call is a short, soft "dju-ee". In contrast, the former subspecies have quite different songs, with sustained rattles for several seconds, or sometimes minutes. Their calls are typically sharp and monosyllabic.

Pallas's leaf warbler breeds in <a href="conifer">conifer</a>ous <a href="taiga">taiga</a> forests including <a href="fir">fir</a>, <a href="spruce">spruce</a>, <a href="pine">pine</a> and <a href="larch">larch</a>, or in mixed forest with <a href="rhododendron">rhododendron</a>, <a href="Quercus%20semecarpifolia">karshu oak</a> and a high percentage of conifers. In southern Russia, it was found breeding at up to . In winter, it uses a wider range of habitats, including broadleaf forest and scrub as well as conifers, and can be found in river valleys down to .

Pallas's leaf warbler breeds in Siberia from the <a href="Altai%20Mountains">Altai Mountains</a> east to the <a href="Sea%20of%20Okhotsk">Sea of Okhotsk</a>, northern Mongolia, <a href="northeast%20China">northeast China</a> and possibly <a href="North%20Korea">North Korea</a>. It is strongly <a href="bird%20migration">migratory</a> and winters mainly in subtropical <a href="south%20China">south China</a>, northern <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a> and elsewhere in northeastern <a href="Indochina">Indochina</a>. It is rare but annual in <a href="Japan">Japan</a>.

Pallas's leaf warbler now occurs regularly in Europe in autumn. The first known European record was shot in 1829 in <a href="Dalmatia">Dalmatia</a>, now Croatia, but <a href="John%20Gould">John Gould</a>, who formally described it, did not realise the species had already been discovered in Asia, and named it as the "Dalmatian Regulus", "Regulus modestus". German <a href="ornithologist">ornithologist</a> <a href="Heinrich%20G%C3%A4tke">Heinrich Gätke</a>, who moved to the then-British island of <a href="Heligoland">Heligoland</a> in 1837 and stayed there for some fifty years, subsequently showed that several Asiatic species, including an occasional Pallas's leaf warbler, were regularly found there in autumn.

In the far west of Europe, the UK's first Pallas's leaf warbler was shot in 1896, although it was not until 1951 that the second was found. Thereafter, this species became increasingly common, ceasing to be a national rarity at the end of 1990. In 2003, for example, 313 were recorded in Britain. Pallas's leaf warbler also occurs at least annually in Sweden, Finland and Denmark.

Most Pallas's leaf warblers found in Europe are first-year birds, and several reasons for the large increase in numbers in autumn have been proposed. In the past, these warblers were widely considered to be <a href="vagrancy%20%28biology%29">vagrants</a> or <a href="Reverse%20migration%20%28birds%29">reverse migrants</a>, but were more recently thought to be undertaking a regular migration, taking advantage of the mild <a href="oceanic%20climate">oceanic climate</a> on the western fringes of Europe for overwintering. A flaw in that theory is that many birds should winter in Spain, particularly in the northwest, but Pallas's leaf warbler is rare in that country and tends to occur in the east. Spanish ornithologist Eduardo de Juana has therefore proposed that once the warblers reach northwest Europe, they then reorientate to a south easterly direction.

Outside Europe, Pallas's leaf warbler has been recorded as a vagrant in <a href="north%20Africa">north Africa</a> (Tunisia and Morocco), <a href="western%20Asia">western Asia</a> (Israel, Turkey and Iran), <a href="central%20Asia">central Asia</a> (Uzbekistan and Tajikistan), <a href="southeast%20Asia">southeast Asia</a> (Bangladesh and Taiwan), and <a href="Alaska">Alaska</a>.

Pallas's leaf warbler is not wary but its unobtrusive <a href="arboreal">arboreal</a> lifestyle makes it difficult to observe, particularly in thick foliage. It is constantly in motion, and often hovers briefly like a goldcrest, although more frequently, and may sometimes hang upside-down.

Nesting is from June to July, with eggs laid from mid-June. The nest is built by the female in a conifer, usually next to the trunk at above ground, sometimes in a bush. It is a round or elliptical cup made from twigs, leaves and other vegetation and lined with finer material including feathers, hair or fine grasses. Four to six blue-grey flecked white eggs are laid and incubated by the female. They hatch after 12–13 days, with the chicks <a href="fledge">fledging</a> when 12–14 days old. They are fed mainly by the female while in the nest, but by both parents for about a week after fledging. In the south of the range, a pair may sometimes raise a second brood. The breeding territory in central Siberia is usually , infrequently as much as .

Pallas's leaf warbler, as with other members of its genus, is a host of the <a href="oriental%20cuckoo">oriental cuckoo</a>, a <a href="brood%20parasite">brood parasite</a>. The cuckoo's egg is similar in appearance, though larger, to those of the host species.

Like its relatives, Pallas's leaf warbler is insectivorous, feeding on the adults, <a href="larva">larva</a>e and <a href="pupa">pupa</a> of small insects including <a href="fly">flies</a>, <a href="moth">moth</a>s and <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s; <a href="spider">spider</a>s are also taken. Birds forage in bushes and trees, picking items from leaves or catching prey in short flights or while hovering. When not breeding, they may join <a href="mixed-species%20foraging%20flock">mixed-species foraging flock</a>s together with <a href="tit%20%28bird%29">tits</a>, <a href="goldcrest">goldcrest</a>s and other <a href="Old%20World%20warbler">warblers</a>. In Asia, accompanying species may also include <a href="white-eye">white-eye</a>s, <a href="minivet">minivet</a>s and <a href="Old%20World%20babbler">babblers</a>.

The Pallas's leaf warbler has a large range, and although global population trends have not been quantified, numbers are believed to be stable. This species does not approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the <a href="IUCN%20Red%20List">IUCN Red List</a> (that is, declining more than 30 percent in ten years or three generations). For these reasons, it is evaluated as of "<a href="Least-concern%20species">least concern</a>" by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">IUCN</a>.

Pallas's leaf warbler is widespread, common and locally abundant in Russia and northeast China. Breeding densities of up to 35–50 pairs/km (90–130 pairs/mi) have been recorded in southeast Russia, with only slightly lower figures in Siberia. It is locally common in parts of its wintering grounds in southeast Asia.

Francis Nash

Francis Nash (October 7, 1777) was a <a href="brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">brigadier general</a> in the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> during the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>. Prior to the war, he was a lawyer, public official, and politician in <a href="Hillsborough%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hillsborough, North Carolina</a>, and was heavily involved in opposing the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Regulation">Regulator movement</a>, an uprising of settlers in the North Carolina <a href="Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29">piedmont</a> between 1765 and 1771. Nash was also involved in North Carolina politics, representing Hillsborough on several occasions in the colonial <a href="Province%20of%20North%20Carolina">North Carolina General Assembly</a>.

Nash quickly became engaged in revolutionary activities, and served as a delegate to the first three Patriot <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress">provincial congresses</a>. In 1775, he was named lieutenant colonel of the <a href="1st%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">1st North Carolina Regiment</a> under Colonel <a href="James%20Moore%20%28Continental%20Army%20officer%29">James Moore</a>, and served briefly in the <a href="Southern%20theater%20of%20the%20American%20Revolutionary%20War">southern theater</a> of the Revolutionary War before being ordered north. Nash was made a brigadier general in 1777 upon Moore's death, and given command of the North Carolina brigade of the Continental Army under General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>. He led North Carolina's soldiers in the <a href="Philadelphia%20campaign">Philadelphia campaign</a>, but was wounded at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Battle of Germantown</a> on October 4, 1777, and died several days later. Nash was one of ten <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriot</a> generals to die from wounds received in combat between 1775 and 1781. He is honored by several city and county names, including those of <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, <a href="Nashville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Nashville, North Carolina</a>, and <a href="Nash%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Nash County, North Carolina</a>.

Nash was born around 1742 in <a href="Amelia%20County%2C%20Virginia">Amelia County, Virginia</a> (in an area that would later become <a href="Prince%20Edward%20County%2C%20Virginia">Prince Edward County</a>) to John and Ann Owen Nash. His parents were originally from <a href="Wales">Wales</a>, and several of his seven siblings, including at least one brother, were born there. One of Nash's brothers was <a href="Abner%20Nash">Abner Nash</a>, who later became a statesman in North Carolina.
By 1763, Francis Nash had moved along with Abner to Childsburgh, which later became <a href="Hillsborough%2C%20North%20Carolina">Hillsborough</a>. There Francis started a law practice, and became a clerk of court in 1763, a position which paid an annual stipend of £100 sterling. The Nash brothers also owned substantial property in the town, and established a mill on the <a href="Eno%20River">Eno River</a>, while Francis invested in a local store. From 1764 to 1765, he served his first term in the <a href="North%20Carolina%20General%20Assembly%23History">North Carolina Assembly</a> representing <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Orange County</a>.

In 1770, Nash married Sarah Moore, the daughter of colonial jurist Maurice Moore, niece of <a href="James%20Moore%20%28Continental%20Army%20officer%29">James Moore</a>, and sister of future <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States Supreme Court</a> <a href="Alfred%20Moore">Justice Alfred Moore</a>. Their union produced two daughters: Ann, who died as a child, and Sarah, who went on to marry John Waddell, the son of North Carolina colonial soldier <a href="Hugh%20Waddell%20%28general%29">Hugh Waddell</a>. Sarah was the grandmother to <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> <a href="blockade%20runner">blockade runner</a> <a href="James%20Iredell%20Waddell">James Iredell Waddell</a>. Francis Nash had two children out of wedlock, one of whom some scholars identify as a son also named Francis Nash, possibly born in 1770 or 1771. The mother of one of the children was reported as Hillsborough <a href="barmaid">barmaid</a> Ruth Jackson. Francis Nash the elder provided Jackson with property west of Hillsborough, and several slaves.

Nash showed an interest in military affairs while living in Hillsborough, and received informal military training from a retired English soldier living there. He worked his way up through the Orange County militia ranks until he eventually became its commanding colonel. During the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Regulation">War of the Regulation</a>, in 1768, he ordered the militia to put down several riots incited by the Regulators, but the militiamen were sympathetic towards the rioters and refused. Nash entered into a pact with others including <a href="Edmund%20Fanning%20%28colonial%20administrator%29">Edmund Fanning</a>, <a href="Adlai%20Osborne">Adlai Osborne</a>, and future governor <a href="Alexander%20Martin">Alexander Martin</a>, to protect one another's property against Regulator threats, but the parties to that agreement lived at great distances from each other, rendering the pact ineffective.

Along with Fanning, who was a personal friend, Nash was accused of extorting money from Hillsborough's residents. Regulator leaders attempted to have Nash tried for corruption, but the charges against him were dismissed. In September 1770, a group of Regulators took control of Hillsborough, forcing Nash and other public officials to flee for fear of bodily harm. Nash subsequently fought alongside Governor <a href="William%20Tryon">William Tryon</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alamance">Battle of Alamance</a> against the Regulator militia. He served in the "Lower House" of the colonial Assembly in 1771 and from 1773 to 1775 as a representative for Hillsborough.

In 1774, Royal Governor <a href="Josiah%20Martin">Josiah Martin</a> postponed the scheduled convening of the colonial Assembly to prevent the North Carolina Assembly from selecting delegates to the proposed <a href="Continental%20Congress">Continental Congress</a>, which was to begin in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> in September. In response, members of the Assembly, many of whom would later become <a href="Patriot%20%28American%20Revolution%29">Patriot</a> supporters, convened the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress%23First%20Provincial%20Congress">First North Carolina Provincial Congress</a> in August 1774. Nash and his brother, Abner, were both elected to that body, along with 69 other North Carolinians, which then selected delegates to the Continental Congress. Governor Martin condemned the Provincial Congress as an extra-legal body not permitted to assemble and represent the people of North Carolina. In an attempt to quash its work, the Governor called the colonial Assembly to convene on April 5, 1775, but the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress%23Second%20Provincial%20Congress">Second North Carolina Provincial Congress</a> met in a session several hours before the Assembly was set to open and many of the congressional delegates, including Nash, voted to support the work of the Continental and Provincial Congresses. In response, Martin dissolved the Assembly. The Royal government would never again call an Assembly to session in North Carolina.

In 1775, Nash served in the <a href="North%20Carolina%20Provincial%20Congress%23Third%20Provincial%20Congress">Third North Carolina Provincial Congress</a>, which organized eight regiments of soldiers on instructions from the Continental Congress. Later that year, the Provincial Congress appointed Nash lieutenant colonel of the <a href="1st%20North%20Carolina%20Regiment">1st North Carolina Regiment</a> under the command of then-colonel James Moore. In November, the 1st North Carolina was formally integrated into the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> organization. Nash served as an officer under Moore during the maneuvers that led up to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Moore%27s%20Creek%20Bridge">Battle of Moore's Creek Bridge</a> in February 1776 but, like Moore, did not participate in the battle, arriving after its conclusion.

During April 1776, Nash was promoted to colonel to replace Moore, who had been promoted to brigadier general. Nash took part in the expedition to aid <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a> in 1776, which culminated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sullivan%27s%20Island">Battle of Sullivan's Island</a>. Immediately prior to that engagement, Nash had been ordered by Major General <a href="Charles%20Lee%20%28general%29">Charles Lee</a>, commander of the Southern Department, to relieve <a href="William%20Moultrie">William Moultrie</a>'s South Carolina troops on <a href="Sullivan%27s%20Island%2C%20South%20Carolina">Sullivan's Island</a>, but the British assault prevented that relief. Moultrie would go on to successfully defend the island from a much larger British force, while Nash's unit guarded the unfinished rear of <a href="Fort%20Moultrie">Fort Sullivan</a>.

Nash returned with his regiment to North Carolina in anticipation of joining General <a href="George%20Washington">George Washington</a>'s army in the north, but fears of British and Indian attacks in Georgia prevented any such action, and caused Nash to remain in his home state. On February 5, 1777, he was promoted to brigadier general by the Continental Congress. He was also tasked with recruiting more soldiers from the western part of the state, but was forced to abandon that task after James Moore's death on April 15, 1777. Nash was then placed in command of the North Carolina brigade. Although fellow North Carolinian <a href="Robert%20Howe%20%28Continental%20Army%20officer%29">Robert Howe</a>'s commission as a brigadier general predated Nash's, Howe had been made commander of the <a href="Departments%20of%20the%20Continental%20Army%23Southern%20Department">Southern Department</a> of the Continental Army, and he was forced to remain in command of the troops defending South Carolina. Nash marched north to join Washington's army and commanded all nine North Carolina Continental Army regiments at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brandywine">Battle of Brandywine</a>.

After the British captured Philadelphia on September 26, 1777, Washington took to the offensive and struck at the main part of the British Army near Philadelphia in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Germantown">Battle of Germantown</a> on October 4. Initially, the North Carolina brigade was intended to serve in the Continental Army's reserve but Washington, out of a desire to defend his flank, ordered Nash into action. Nash was commanding a fighting retreat, slowly moving his unit backwards to stall the British advance, when he was mortally wounded by a cannonball that struck him in the hip and killed his horse. The same cannonball killed Major James Witherspoon, son of <a href="John%20Witherspoon">John Witherspoon</a>, the president of <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> and a signer of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>. Nash may have also been blinded by a musket ball that struck him in the head. <a href="Thomas%20Paine">Thomas Paine</a>, who saw him taken off the battlefield, later stated that Nash's wounds had made him unrecognizable.

Nash was treated by Washington's personal physician, <a href="James%20Craik">James Craik</a>, who could not stem his bleeding, which was reported to have fully soaked through two mattresses. Nash succumbed to his wounds on October 7 at a private residence near <a href="Kulpsville%2C%20Pennsylvania">Kulpsville, Pennsylvania</a>. His final words are alleged to have been "From the first dawn of the Revolution I have been ever on the side of liberty and my country". He was buried in the Towamencin Mennonite Meetinghouse Cemetery in <a href="Towamencin%20Township%2C%20Pennsylvania">Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania</a>, on October 9, 1777, along with other officers who had perished at Germantown. Most of the Continental Army's senior officers, including Washington himself, attended the funeral service. Nash's friend and colleague Alexander Martin, who later became Governor of the State of North Carolina and who had witnessed Nash's wounding, later composed a funeral poem in the fallen general's honor.

Nash was one of ten Patriot generals who died during the American Revolutionary War. After his death, on April 29, 1784, Congress awarded his heirs a land grant representing 84 months of Continental Army service, which exceeded Nash's actual service time. <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a> (originally called "<a href="Fort%20Nashborough">Fort Nashborough</a>"), <a href="Nashville%2C%20North%20Carolina">Nashville, North Carolina</a>, and <a href="Nash%20County%2C%20North%20Carolina">Nash County, North Carolina</a>, are named in his honor. In 1906, a stone arch was erected on the grounds of <a href="Guilford%20Courthouse%20National%20Military%20Park">Guilford Courthouse National Military Park</a> in Nash's honor, but it was demolished in 1937. Nash's home in Hillsborough is now known as the <a href="Nash-Hooper%20House">Nash-Hooper House</a>, as it was purchased by <a href="William%20Hooper">William Hooper</a>, a signatory to the Declaration of Independence, after Nash's death. In 1938, a historical marker was placed near the house commemorating Nash's life and service. The Nash-Hooper House was declared a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1971. It is located in the <a href="Hillsborough%20Historic%20District">Hillsborough Historic District</a>.

Mother India

Mother India is a <a href="List%20of%20Bollywood%20films%20of%201957">1957</a> Indian <a href="epic%20film">epic</a> <a href="Drama%20%28film%20and%20television%29">drama</a> film, directed by <a href="Mehboob%20Khan">Mehboob Khan</a> and starring <a href="Nargis">Nargis</a>, <a href="Sunil%20Dutt">Sunil Dutt</a>, <a href="Rajendra%20Kumar">Rajendra Kumar</a>, and <a href="Raaj%20Kumar">Raaj Kumar</a>. A remake of Khan's earlier film "<a href="Aurat%20%281940%20film%29">Aurat</a>" (1940), it is the story of a poverty-stricken village woman named Radha (Nargis), who in the absence of her husband, struggles to raise her sons and survive against a cunning money-lender amidst many troubles. Despite her hardships, she sets a goddess-like moral example of an ideal Indian woman.

The title of the film was chosen to counter American author <a href="Katherine%20Mayo">Katherine Mayo</a>'s 1927 <a href="polemical">polemical</a> book "<a href="Mother%20India%20%28book%29">Mother India</a>", which vilified Indian culture. Allusions to <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythology</a> are abundant in the film, and its lead character has been seen as a <a href="metonymy">metonymic</a> representation of a Hindu woman who reflects high moral values and the concept of what it means to be a mother to society through self-sacrifice. "Mother India" metaphorically represents India as a nation in the aftermath of <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">independence</a>, and alludes to a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building. While some authors treat Radha as the symbol of women empowerment, others see her cast in female stereotypes. The film was shot in Mumbai's <a href="Mehboob%20Studios">Mehboob Studios</a> and in the villages of <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>, <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a>, and <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> states. The music by <a href="Naushad">Naushad</a> introduced <a href="Western%20classical%20music">Western classical music</a> and Hollywood-style orchestra to Hindi cinema.

The film was the most expensive Hindi cinema (<a href="Bollywood">Bollywood</a>) production and earned the highest revenue for any Indian film at that time. Adjusted for inflation, "Mother India" still ranks among the all-time Indian <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films%2C%20adjusted%20for%20inflation">box office hits</a>. It was released in India amid fanfare in October or November 1957, and had several high-profile screenings, including one at the capital, New Delhi, attended by the country's president and prime minister. "Mother India" became a definitive cultural classic and is regarded as one of the best films in Indian and world cinema. It was <a href="List%20of%20Indian%20submissions%20for%20the%20Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">India's first submission</a> for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a> in 1958, where it got the nomination and lost the award by just one vote. The film won the <a href="Discontinued%20and%20Intermittent%20National%20Film%20Awards%23All%20India%20Certificate%20of%20Merit">All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film</a>, the <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Film%20Award">Filmfare Best Film Award</a> for 1957, and Nargis and Khan won the Best Actress and Best Director awards respectively.

The film is set in 1957, the present day at the time of the shooting. When construction of an irrigation canal to the village is completed, Radha (<a href="Nargis">Nargis</a>), considered to be the "mother" of the village, is asked to inaugurate the canal. She remembers her past when she was newly married.

The wedding between Radha and Shamu (<a href="Raaj%20Kumar">Raaj Kumar</a>) is paid for by Radha's mother-in-law, who borrows the money from the moneylender Sukhilala (<a href="Kanhaiyalal%20%28actor%29">Kanhaiyalal</a>). The conditions of the loan are disputed, but the village elders decide in favour of the moneylender, after which Shamu and Radha are forced to pay three quarters of their crop as interest on the loan of 500 (valued at about <a href="US%24">US$</a>105 in 1957). While Shamu works to bring more of their rocky land into use, his arms are crushed by a boulder. Ashamed of his helplessness (being without arms), and humiliated by Sukhilala for living on the earnings of his wife, Shamu decides that he is of no use to his family and permanently leaves Radha and their three sons, walking to his own probable death by starvation. Soon after, Radha's youngest son and her mother-in-law died. A severe storm and the resulting flood destroys houses in the village and ruins the harvest. Sukhilala offers to save Radha and her sons if she trades her body to him for food. Radha vehemently refused his offer but had to also lose her infant (her fourth son) to the atrocities of the storm. Although the villagers begin initially to evacuate the village, they decide to stay and rebuild it, persuaded by Radha.

Several years later, Radha's two surviving children, Birju (<a href="Sunil%20Dutt">Sunil Dutt</a>) and Ramu (<a href="Rajendra%20Kumar">Rajendra Kumar</a>), are young men. Birju, embittered since childhood by the demands of Sukhilala, takes out his frustrations by pestering the village girls, especially Sukhilala's daughter, Rupa. Ramu, by contrast, has a calmer temperament and is married soon after. Birju's anger finally becomes dangerous and, after being provoked, he attacks Sukhilala and his daughter and steals Radha's "kangan" (marriage bracelets) that were pawned with Sukhilala. He is chased out of the village and becomes a bandit. Radha promises Sukhilala that she will not let Birju cause harm to Sukhilala's family. On Rupa's wedding day, Birju returns with his gang of bandits to exact his revenge. He kills Sukhilala and kidnaps Rupa. When he tries to flee the village on his horse, Radha, his mother, shoots him. He dies in her arms. The film returns to 1957; Radha opens the gate of the canal and its reddish water flows into the fields.


The title "Mother India" was inspired by American author <a href="Katherine%20Mayo">Katherine Mayo</a>'s 1927 <a href="polemical">polemical</a> book <a href="Mother%20India%20%28book%29">of the same name</a>, in which she attacked Indian society, religion and culture. Written against the Indian demands for self-rule and independence from <a href="British%20Raj">British rule</a>, the book pointed to the treatment of India's women, the <a href="Dalit">untouchables</a>, animals, dirt, and the character of its nationalistic politicians. Mayo singled out the rampant and fatally weakening sexuality of its males to be at the core of all problems, leading to masturbation, rape, homosexuality, prostitution, venereal diseases, and, most importantly, premature sexual intercourse and maternity. The book created an outrage across India, and it was burned along with her effigy. It was criticised by <a href="Mahatma%20Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> as a "report of a drain inspector sent out with the one purpose of opening and examining the drains of the country to be reported upon". The book prompted over fifty angry books and pamphlets to be published to highlight Mayo's errors and false perception of Indian society, which had become a powerful influence on the American people's view of India.

Mehboob Khan had the idea for the film and the title as early as 1952, five years after <a href="Independence%20of%20India">India's independence</a>; in October that year, he approached the import authorities of the Indian government to seek permission for importing <a href="Film%20stock">raw stocks</a> for the film. In 1955, the ministries of <a href="Ministry%20of%20External%20Affairs%20%28India%29">External Affairs</a> and <a href="Ministry%20of%20Information%20and%20Broadcasting%20%28India%29">Information-and-Broadcasting</a> learned of the title of the forthcoming film and demanded that the director send them the script for review, suspicious that it was based on the book and thus a possible threat to national interest. The film team dispatched the script along with a two-page letter on 17 September 1955 saying:

Khan was inspired by American author <a href="Pearl%20S.%20Buck">Pearl S. Buck</a> and her books "<a href="The%20Good%20Earth">The Good Earth</a>" (1931) and "<a href="The%20Mother%20%281934%20novel%29">The Mother</a>" (1934); he also saw the film "<a href="The%20Good%20Earth%20%28film%29">The Good Earth</a>" (1937), directed by <a href="Sidney%20Franklin%20%28director%29">Sidney Franklin</a>. "The Mother" chronicled the life of a Chinese woman, including her married life and lonely struggle after being abandoned by her husband. Aspects of "Mother India", such as moneylenders, toiling on land, and rearing children through hardship were part of the story. Khan originally drew upon these influences in making his 1940 film "<a href="Aurat%20%281940%20film%29">Aurat</a>", the original version of "Mother India". Khan bought the rights of "Aurat" from the production company National Studios for 35,000 (valued at about US$7,350 in 1957). Stylistic elements of "Mother India" show similarities with <a href="Vsevolod%20Pudovkin">Vsevolod Pudovkin</a>'s Soviet silent film "<a href="Mother%20%281926%20film%29">Mother</a>" (1926); "<a href="Our%20Daily%20Bread%20%281934%20film%29">Our Daily Bread</a>" (1934), directed by <a href="King%20Vidor">King Vidor</a>; and films of <a href="Alexander%20Dovzhenko">Alexander Dovzhenko</a>. Certain imagery in the film, such as "happy farmers, sickles in their hand, smiling from behind ripening crops", resemble posters by Soviet <a href="constructivism%20%28art%29">constructivist</a> artists.

The script of "Aurat" was devised by <a href="Wajahat%20Mirza">Wajahat Mirza</a>, based upon a story by <a href="Babubhai%20Mehta">Babubhai Mehta</a>. For "Mother India", it was reworked by Mirza and the young screenwriter <a href="S.%20Ali%20Raza">S. Ali Raza</a>. Apart from Mehboob Khan, Mirza and Raza, prominent screenwriters <a href="Aghajani%20Kashmeri">Aghajani Kashmeri</a>, <a href="Zia%20Sarhadi">Zia Sarhadi</a>, <a href="Akhtar%20Mirza">Akhtar Mirza</a>, music director Naushad, assistant director Chimankant Desai and many others were consulted. The dialogue, reworked by Mirza and Raza, is a blend of <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, vernacular <a href="Hindi">Hindi</a>, and its literary counterpart. As Mirza and Raza were from the <a href="Urdu%20literature">Urdu literary</a> tradition, they wrote the dialogues in <a href="Urdu%20script">Urdu script</a>.

The script was intentionally written in a way that promoted the empowerment of women in Indian society (including the power to resist sexual advances) and the maintenance of a sense of moral dignity and purpose as individuals; this was contrary to what Mayo had claimed in her book. These themes, present in "Aurat", were further developed with a strong sense of nationalism and nation-building, using characters personifying abstract qualities such as "beauty and goodness, wealth and power, poverty and exploitation, and community spirit".

Nargis was the director's first choice for the role of Radha, and despite only being aged 26 at the time, she played the role of the new wife, young single mother and an aged mother of two sons. Nargis—the reigning queen of Hindi cinema at the time—had started her career in a leading role with Khan's "<a href="Taqdeer%20%281943%20film%29">Taqdeer</a>" (1943) and acted under his direction in "<a href="Humayun%20%28film%29">Humayun</a>" (1945) and "<a href="Andaz%20%281949%20film%29">Andaz</a>" (1949). "Mother India" is generally regarded as Nargis's best performance and was her last major film before retirement after marriage.

Khan had wanted to cast <a href="Sabu%20Dastagir">Sabu Dastagir</a>, a Hollywood star of Indian origin, as Birju. Dastagir travelled to India from Los Angeles, stayed in a hotel in <a href="Mumbai">Mumbai</a> (then known as Bombay) and received a retainer. However, delays and obstacles in beginning shooting and getting a work permit for Dastagir led to his dismissal from the project. <a href="Dilip%20Kumar">Dilip Kumar</a>, an established actor in the Hindi film industry, had originally expressed an interest in playing Birju, which Khan found agreeable; Dilip Kumar agreed to play Shamu as well. However, Nargis objected that the public would not accept their casting as mother and son because she had done several romantic films alongside him. Sunil Dutt—with the experience of just one film—was finally cast, after Mukri, a comedian in the film, introduced him to Khan. <a href="Sajid%20Khan">Sajid Khan</a>, the actor who portrayed the young Birju, was unknown at the time, and was from a poor family from the Mumbai slums. Sajid's salary in the film was 750. He was later adopted by Mehboob Khan. Subsequently, Raaj Kumar was cast as Shamu and Rajendra Kumar as Ramu. "Mother India" was the first successful film and a turning point in the careers of Dutt, Raaj Kumar and Rajendra Kumar.

Before <a href="principal%20photography">principal photography</a> began, Nargis and Raaj Kumar familiarised themselves with farming practices such as ploughing the fields, reaping and sowing, and cotton picking. The extras in the song and dance sequences of the film were from local dance groups in villages where the shooting took place instead of the usual ones from Mumbai.

The initial filming for "Mother India" began unexpectedly, even before the script and cast were finalised. In 1955, parts of <a href="Uttar%20Pradesh">Uttar Pradesh</a> suffered from major flooding. Cinematographer <a href="Faredoon%20Irani">Faredoon Irani</a> travelled to flood-afflicted districts to shoot generic flood scenes. The scheduled principal photography started in 1955 with a budget of 20–25 <a href="lakh">lakh</a> (approximately US$420,000–525,000 in 1957). However, the budget increased to 35–40 lakh (approximately US$735,000–840,000 in 1957) by the end of the filming because of the outdoor sessions and cast and crew's salaries. This budget, a record at the time, was surpassed by "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>" in 1960.
Several indoor scenes for the film were shot in 1956 at <a href="Mehboob%20Studios">Mehboob Studios</a> in <a href="Bandra">Bandra</a>, Mumbai. Khan and Irani attempted to shoot frequently on location to make the film as realistic as possible. Locations included various villages in <a href="Maharashtra">Maharashtra</a>, <a href="Gujarat">Gujarat</a> (Maharashtra and Gujarat together formed <a href="Bombay%20State">Bombay State</a> then) and Uttar Pradesh. The film was shot in <a href="35mm">35mm</a>. Contemporary cinematographer <a href="Anil%20Mehta">Anil Mehta</a> has noted the mastery of Irani's cinematic techniques in shooting the film, including his "intricate tracks and pans, the detailed <a href="mise%20en%20sc%C3%A8ne">mise en scène</a> patterns Irani conceived, even for brief shots—in the studios as well as on location". The film took about three years to make, from early organisation, planning, and scripting to completion of filming. In a November 1956 interview, Nargis described the film shoot and her role as the most demanding of her career. "Mother India" was shot in <a href="Gevacolor">Gevacolor</a>, later converted to <a href="Technicolor">Technicolor</a>. It was shot mostly using the <a href="sync%20sound">sync sound</a> technique, which was common at the time; some scenes were dubbed.

For shooting the flood scene, a farmer agreed to flood of his land. In the exodus scene following the flood, 300 bullock carts, 200 farmers and many horses, tractors and ploughs were used. Gayatri Chatterjee writes about the popular belief that all these were made available by villagers without reimbursement, in her book. However, account ledgers of the production revealed that the villagers were paid. There was a protracted scene in the film in which Radha runs between burning haystacks in search for her son Birju, a renegade bandit, who was hiding there. The fire scene was shot in the Umra area of <a href="Surat">Surat</a>, Gujarat, by burning bales of hay. Nargis and Dutt acted in the fire scene without doubles. On 1 March 1957, an accident occurred during the fire scene when the wind direction changed and the fire grew out of control, trapping Nargis. She was saved by Dutt, who quickly grabbed a blanket, plunged inside, and rescued her. Shooting halted temporarily as both had sustained injuries. Dutt was hospitalised for the burns and Nargis helped nurse him, at Khan's place in <a href="Billimora">Billimora</a>. Nargis—a popular actress at the time—fell in love with Dutt, who was in early stages of his film career and played her son in the film; they married on 11 March 1958. Nargis wished to marry soon after the film, but Khan protested that real-life marriage of the onscreen mother-son would be disastrous for the film. Owing to their relationship, Nargis also found it difficult to perform a scene where she beat Dutt with a <a href="Fighting%20stick">lathi</a>.

Various authors identify the character of Radha with <a href="Hindu%20mythology">Hindu mythological</a> goddesses and characters, such as <a href="Radha">Radha</a> (the lover of the god <a href="Krishna">Krishna</a>, personifying love and romance), <a href="Sita">Sita</a> (the divine heroine of the <a href="Hindu%20epic">Hindu epic</a> "<a href="Ramayana">Ramayana</a>", personifying high moral value), <a href="Savitri%20and%20Satyavan">Savitri</a> (representing great morality and loyalty to husband), <a href="Draupadi">Draupadi</a> (personifying duty and morality), <a href="Bh%C5%ABmi">Dharti-mata</a> (<a href="mother%20goddess">earth-mother</a> goddess) and <a href="Lakshmi">Lakshmi</a> (Hindu goddess of prosperity). Besides these gentle goddesses, the character of Radha has shades of more ferocious warrior goddesses such as <a href="Durga">Durga</a> and <a href="Kali">Kali</a>. Film scholars have compared the mild-mannered, obedient son Ramu with the god <a href="Rama">Rama</a> of the epic "Ramayana", and the romantic outlaw Birju—a name of Krishna—with the god Krishna, known for his transgressions. Shamu (another name of Krishna), Radha's husband who leaves her, is also equated with Krishna, who left his lover Radha in mythological accounts. The title "Mother India" and Radha's character are described to be allusions not only to the <a href="Devi">Hindu Mother Goddess</a>, but also to <a href="Bharat%20Mata">Bharat Mata</a> (literally "Mother India"), the national personification of India, generally represented as a Hindu goddess.

According to professor Nalini Natarajan of the <a href="University%20of%20Puerto%20Rico">University of Puerto Rico</a>, Nargis's Mother India is a <a href="Metonymy">metonymic</a> representation of a Hindu woman, reflecting high Hindu values, with virtuous morality and motherly self-sacrifice. Film scholar Jyotika Virdi wrote that "Mother India" could also be seen as a metaphor of the trinity of mother, God, and a dynamic nation. Vijay Mishra, in his 2002 book "Bollywood Cinema: Temples of Desire", opined that the Mother India figure is an icon in several respects—being associated with a goddess, her function as a wife, as a lover, and even compromising her femininity at the end of the film by playing the role of <a href="Vishnu">Vishnu</a> the Preserver and <a href="Shiva">Shiva</a> the Destroyer, masculine gods.

According to Indian film scholars Gokulsing and Dissanayake, while aspiring to traditional Hindu values, the character of Mother India also represents the changing role of the mother in Indian cinema and society in that the mother is not always subservient or dependent on her husband, refining the relationship to the male gender or patriarchal social structures. The "<a href="New%20Internationalist">New Internationalist</a>" said in a 1999 review that Radha transforms from a submissive wife to an independent mother, thereby breaking female stereotypes in Hindi film. In contrast, in a 2012 article in the newspaper "<a href="The%20Hindu">The Hindu</a>", author Tarini Sridharan has pointed out themes such as upholding female chastity, wifely devotion and saintly motherhood that reinforce gender stereotypes. While the action of sacrificing motherhood to uphold a woman's dignity is termed as feminist by some, other authors see it as an attempt of a community woman to protect the patriarchal village structure, that esteems "<a href="Izzat%20%28honor%29">izzat</a>" (honour) of women. A promotional pamphlet to introduce the social context of the film to western audiences described Indian women as being "an altar in India", and that Indians "measure the virtue of their race by the chastity of their women", and that "Indian mothers are the nucleus around which revolve the tradition and culture of ages."

In a 2002 review in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", film critic <a href="Dave%20Kehr">Dave Kehr</a> compares the film with "<a href="Stella%20Dallas%20%281937%20film%29">Stella Dallas</a>" (1937) for the thematic similarity of the series of sacrifices made by the female lead, and with "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" (1939) as an epic mirroring social upheavals. Film critic <a href="Mark%20Cousins%20%28film%20critic%29">Mark Cousins</a> and author Tejaswini Ganti agree that the film is the "Gone with the Wind" of Indian cinema.
The term "Mother India" has been defined as "a common icon for the emergent Indian nation in the early 20th century in both colonialist and nationalist discourse". Many authors, including Gayatri Chatterjee, author of <a href="https%3A//books.google.com/books/about/Mother_India.html%3Fid%3DFvAKAQAAMAAJ">"Mother India" (2002)</a>, interpret the film as an <a href="allegory">allegory</a> signifying patriotism and the changing situation in the newly independent nation, and how India was functioning without British authority. It echoes the tale of a modern India, liberating itself from "feudal and colonial oppression". The film, an archetypal nationalistic picture, is symbolic in that it demonstrated the euphoria of "Mother India" in a nation that had only been independent for 10 years, and it had a long-lasting cultural impact upon the Indian people. Film scholar Saibal Chatterjee considers "Mother India" a "mirror of independent India", highlighting problems of a nascent nation, including rural exploitation of farmers by money-lenders, in a dramatic fashion understandable to the common viewer. It also represents the agrarian poverty and hardship of the people at the time. The red water that flows from the canal irrigating the green fields at the end of the film is seen by Chatterjee as a metaphor to represent the blood of Indians in the struggle for independence, flowing to nourish a new free India. The canal is described by Virdi to signal the imminent end of the feudal order. However, despite Radha's struggle against feudal oppression depicted in the film, her action of stopping the rebellious Birju and upholding status quo—the feudal and patriarchal order—is seen as "regressive" by various authors.

In a study of media and popular culture in South Asia, author Mahasveta Barua draws a parallel between the film's metaphorical representation of the mother as nation, and the metonymic identification with India that <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>, India's only woman prime minister, sought and tried for during her tenure (1966–77, and 1980–84). In his book "Terrorism, Media, Liberation", John David Slocum argues that like <a href="Satyajit%20Ray">Satyajit Ray</a>'s classic masterpiece "<a href="Pather%20Panchali">Pather Panchali</a>" (1955), Khan's "Mother India" has "vied for alternative definitions of Indianness". However, he emphasises that the film is an overt mythologising and feminising of the nation in which Indian audiences have used their imagination to define it in the nationalistic context, given that in reality the storyline is about a poverty-stricken peasant from northern India, rather than a true ideal of a modernising, powerful nation.

The Radha–Birju relationship is described to have "<a href="Oedipus%20complex">Oedipal elements</a>" by many authors; Virdi has argued that in her chastity, Radha channels her sexual desires into maternal love for her sons who effectively become "substitute erotic subjects". Mishra opines that the crushing of the arms of Radha's husband and the mellowness of the older son symbolise <a href="castration">castration</a>, which is in contrast with the rebellion of Birju, identified with sexual potency. Birju's obsession with his mother's bracelets is an expression of his oedipal longings, according to Chakravarty. Rachel Dwyer, Professor of Indian Cultures and Cinema at <a href="SOAS">SOAS</a>, describes how "suspiciously smoothly" the Oedipal elements fit into the film and the off-screen romance between Nargis and Dutt, playing mother and son in the film. Radha's actions at the end of the film in shooting her own son was a breaking of traditional mother–son relationship to safeguard morality, according to author William Van der Heide. Virdi points out that this brought ambiguity to the mother figure who acts as a sacrificing provider and also as a destroyer, annihilating her own son, something rare in Hindi cinema. She interprets Birju's sexual advances on a village girl (which is <a href="incest">incest</a> in north Indian village culture) as being a substitute in the plot for the incestuous mother–son relationship and his death at the end as a punishment for violation of the taboo.

Authors such as Eshun and Woods state that Radha and Ramu are the archetypal champions of virtue in battling hardship and injustice, while Birju is a mischievous child who becomes the anarchist whose uncontrollable rebellion destroys order. Mishra has noted that although Radha upholds "<a href="Dharma">Dharma</a>" (the natural law or order) in the film, it is Birju who achieves identification from the spectators; in his rebellion lies the agenda of political action that will usher social change. Mishra notes that due to such conflicting ideas, the film is very much conforming, and yet "defiantly subversive".

Film scholar Vijay Mishra has pointed out the presence of the "highly syncretic hyphenated Hindu–Muslim nature" of Bollywood in the film. Parama Roy has interpreted that Nargis's legendary status as the titular "Mother India" is due to Hinduisation of the role and her real-life marriage with a Hindu; she is, according to Roy, scripted as a renouncer of Muslim separatism in the film. Mishra has found metacritical value in <a href="Salman%20Rushdie">Salman Rushdie</a>'s commentary on the film in his novel "<a href="The%20Moor%27s%20Last%20Sigh">The Moor's Last Sigh</a>" (1995) in which Rushdie describes:

The production team had planned to release "Mother India" to commemorate the tenth <a href="Independence%20Day%20%28India%29">anniversary of India's independence</a> on 15 August 1957, but the film was released over two months later. It premiered at the <a href="Liberty%20Cinema">Liberty Cinema</a> in Mumbai on 25 October 1957, during <a href="Diwali">Diwali</a>; it ran continuously at Liberty for over a year. It was released in <a href="Kolkata">Kolkata</a> (then called Calcutta) the same day and in <a href="Delhi">Delhi</a> a week later. It had reached all regions of India by the end of November. Government ministers and other officials were invited to the premieres, and a special screening was held in <a href="Rashtrapati%20Bhavan">Rashtrapati Bhavan</a> (the presidential quarter) in New Delhi on 23 October 1957; the event was attended by President <a href="Rajendra%20Prasad">Rajendra Prasad</a>, Prime Minister <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru">Jawaharlal Nehru</a> and his daughter <a href="Indira%20Gandhi">Indira Gandhi</a>. Chief Minister of West Bengal <a href="Bidhan%20Chandra%20Roy">Bidhan Chandra Roy</a> and Governor <a href="Padmaja%20Naidu">Padmaja Naidu</a> attended a screening in Kolkata. Impressed with the film's nationalistic message, Chief Minister of Bombay State <a href="Morarji%20Desai">Morarji Desai</a> granted it exemption from the entertainment tax in the state.

No reliable data is available on the box office earnings of "Mother India". It was in continuous distribution in theatres in India until the mid-1990s. There was a renewed interest in the film in the 1970s causing an upsurge in ticket sales. According to Chatterjee, it did exceptionally good business in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, <a href="Karnataka">Karnataka</a> (then called Mysore State) and Maharashtra. Film trade websites provide estimates of its business. <a href="Box%20Office%20India">Box Office India</a> gave the film's <a href="Entertainment%20tax">net collection</a> as and its gross as , the highest for an Indian film up until "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>" (1960), while estimating that "Mother India"s inflation-adjusted net would be equivalent to in January 2008. Box Office India later estimated in 2017 that "Mother India" had over 100million footfalls at the domestic box office, making it one of the <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Indian%20films">highest-grossing Indian films</a> of all time when adjusted for inflation. The film's success led Khan to name his next film "<a href="Son%20of%20India%20%281962%20film%29">Son of India</a>". Released in 1962, it was not well received.

"Mother India" was dubbed in several European languages including Spanish, French and Russian; it did substantial business in Greece, Spain and Russia and was released in the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Eastern Bloc</a> countries. Technicolor arranged one screening of the film in Paris on 30 June 1958, under the name "Les bracelets d'or" ("The Gold Bracelets"). It did minimal business in Paris, but fared better in <a href="French%20colonial%20empire">French colonies</a>. It was successful in the Latin American countries of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. "Mother India" was also acclaimed across the <a href="Arab%20world">Arab world</a>, in the Middle East, parts of Southeast Asia, and North Africa and continued to be shown in countries such as Algeria at least ten years after its release. It was released in the US on 9 July 1959 to lukewarm response, and the UK release in 1961 was also a commercial failure. The initial international version with English subtitles was 40 minutes shorter than the Indian release.

As of 2013, "Mother India" is available on DVD in <a href="DVD%20region%20code">all regions</a> <a href="NTSC">NTSC</a> format, distributed by the <a href="Eros%20International">Eros Entertainment</a>.

<a href="Baburao%20Patel">Baburao Patel</a> of the film magazine "Filmindia" (December 1957) described "Mother India" after its release as "the greatest picture produced in India" and wrote that no other actress would have been able to perform the role as well as Nargis. A review in "<a href="Monthly%20Film%20Bulletin">Monthly Film Bulletin</a>" in 1958 remarked that audiences in UK should be grateful that the international version was shortened by 40 minutes, and termed it a "rag-bag <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a>". After its US release in 1959, Irene Thirer reviewed the film in the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" in which she praised its "striking dramatic appeal", but feared it might not be accepted by American audiences due to cultural differences. In a 1976 article in the journal "Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review", author Michael Gallagher found the film "an amazing mixture of political allegory and cheap musical, a cross between the impressiveness of <a href="Sergei%20Eisenstein">Eisenstein</a> and the banality of "<a href="Show%20Boat">Show Boat</a>"". The "<a href="New%20Internationalist">New Internationalist</a>" in 1999 found Nargis's acting "exemplary", and noted "a clever interplay—artistically and politically—between the traditional and the radical" evident in "Mother India".

In a 2002 article in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", film critic <a href="J.%20Hoberman">J. Hoberman</a> described the film as "an outrageous "<a href="Masala%20%28film%20genre%29">masala</a>" of apparently discordant elements." He characterised it as a mixture of "indigenous versions of Soviet-style tractor-opera, Italian neo-realism, Hollywood kiddie-cuteness, a dozen Technicolor musical numbers, and, most significantly, a metaphoric overlay of pop Hinduism." Hoberman criticised the acting as "broad", and also wrote about the "vaguely left-wing" nationalist overtone of the film. Author <a href="Phil%20Hall%20%28US%20writer%29">Phill Hall</a>, writing for "<a href="Film%20Threat">Film Threat</a>" in 2002, described the film as exceptionally sluggish and one-dimensional, and lampooned it saying "it takes the strongest of constitutions to endure this film without entertaining notions of matricide." Jonathan Romney in his 2002 report in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" observed the earth-mother Radha as "India's answer to <a href="Anna%20Magnani">Anna Magnani</a>" and the film as "an all-out exercise in ideological myth-making." "<a href="Women%27s%20Feature%20Service">Women's Feature Service</a>", in a 2007 article, noted "Mother India" as "one of the most outstanding films of the post-Independence era." Ziya Us Salam of "The Hindu" wrote in her 2010 report: "Mehboob was able to blend the individual with the universal, thereby enhancing the film's appeal without compromising on its sensitivity."

"Mother India", its star Nargis, and the director Khan received many awards and nominations. Nargis won the <a href="Filmfare%20Best%20Actress%20Award">Filmfare Best Actress Award</a> in 1958 and became the first Indian to receive the Best Actress award at the <a href="Karlovy%20Vary%20International%20Film%20Festival">Karlovy Vary International Film Festival</a> in present-day <a href="Czech%20Republic">Czech Republic</a>. "Mother India" won the <a href="Filmfare%20Award%20for%20Best%20Film">Filmfare Award for Best Film</a> and scooped several other Filmfare awards including Best Director for Khan, Best Cinematographer for Faredoon Irani, and Best Sound for R. Kaushik. In 1958, the film became <a href="List%20of%20Indian%20submissions%20for%20Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">India's first submission</a> for the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a> and was <a href="List%20of%20Indian%20films%20nominated%20for%20the%20Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">chosen as one of the five nominations for the category</a>. The international version, 120 minutes long, was sent for the Oscars. Additionally, this version had English subtitles, and dropped Mehboob Productions' logo, which featured the Communist <a href="hammer%20and%20sickle">hammer and sickle</a>, to appease the Academy. The 120-minute version was later distributed in the US and UK by <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. The film came close to winning the Academy Award, but lost to <a href="Federico%20Fellini">Federico Fellini</a>'s "<a href="Nights%20of%20Cabiria">Nights of Cabiria</a>" by a single vote. Khan was utterly disappointed at not winning the award. "He had seen the other films in the fray and believed "Mother India" was far superior to them" recalled Sunil Dutt years later. It also won two awards at the <a href="5th%20National%20Film%20Awards">5th National Film Awards</a> in 1957: an <a href="Discontinued%20and%20Intermittent%20National%20Film%20Awards%23All%20India%20Certificate%20of%20Merit">All India Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film</a> and <a href="National%20Film%20Award%20for%20Best%20Feature%20Film%20in%20Hindi">Certificate of Merit for Best Feature Film in Hindi</a>.

The score and soundtrack for "Mother India" was composed by <a href="Naushad">Naushad</a>. Mehboob Khan had worked on eight films with Naushad and developed a rapport with him. The lyrics were by <a href="Shakeel%20Badayuni">Shakeel Badayuni</a>. The soundtrack consists of 12 songs and features vocals by <a href="Mohammed%20Rafi">Mohammed Rafi</a>, <a href="Shamshad%20Begum">Shamshad Begum</a>, <a href="Lata%20Mangeshkar">Lata Mangeshkar</a>, and <a href="Manna%20Dey">Manna Dey</a>. It was not particularly well received upon release, and critics said it did not match the high pitch and quality of the film. However, its later reception has been more positive: the soundtrack made Planet Bollywood's list of "100 Greatest Bollywood Soundtracks Ever", compiled in the 2000s. The review gave the album 7.5 stars out of 10.

"Mother India" is the earliest example of a Hindi film containing Western classical music and Hollywood-style orchestra. An example is a <a href="Coda%20%28music%29">coda</a> during the scene in which Birju runs away from his mother and rejects her. It features a powerful symphonic orchestra with strings, <a href="Woodwind%20instrument">woodwinds</a> and trumpets. This orchestral music contains extensive <a href="chromaticism">chromaticism</a>, <a href="diminished%20seventh">diminished seventh</a>s, and <a href="augmented%20scale">augmented scale</a>s. It also features violin <a href="tremolo">tremolo</a>s. Anne Morcom writes in "Hindi Film Songs and the Cinema" that the piece is unmelodic and "profoundly disturbing". This use of a western-style orchestra in Indian cinema influenced many later films, such as "Mughal-e-Azam" (1960), which features similar <a href="Dissonance%20%28music%29">dissonant</a> orchestral music to create atmosphere at tense moments. The song "Holi Aayi Re Kanhai", sung by Shamshad Begum, has been cited as a typical Hindi film song which is written for and sung by a female singer, with an emotional charge that appeals to a mass audience.

"Mother India" has been described as "perhaps India's most revered film", a "cinematic epic", a "flag-bearer of Hindi cinema and a legend in its own right", Mehboob Khan's "<a href="Masterpiece">magnum opus</a>" and an "all-time blockbuster", which ranks highly among India's <a href="List%20of%20highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films%23Highest-grossing%20Bollywood%20films%20throughout%20history">most successful films</a>. It was in continuous distribution, being played in theatres for more than three decades; the record ended in the mid-1990s with the advent of satellite television and a change in Indian film-viewing habits. "Mother India" belongs to only a small collection of films, including "<a href="Kismet%20%281943%20film%29">Kismet</a>" (1943), "<a href="Mughal-e-Azam">Mughal-e-Azam</a>" (1960), "<a href="Sholay">Sholay</a>" (1975) "<a href="Hum%20Aapke%20Hain%20Koun..%21">Hum Aapke Hain Koun..!</a>" (1994), and "<a href="Dilwale%20Dulhania%20Le%20Jayenge">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</a>" (1995) which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance. It is also among the only three Indian films to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film (the others being "<a href="Salaam%20Bombay%21">Salaam Bombay!</a>" and "<a href="Lagaan">Lagaan</a>"). The "<a href="Hindustan%20Times">Hindustan Times</a>" (in 2007) identifies the "film's pungent social references" which are "too harsh to be sold at a profit today. But this heartrending tale filled Indians with hope and pride then." The film was remade in the <a href="Telugu%20language">Telugu language</a> as "Bangaru Talli" in 1971, and in <a href="Tamil%20language">Tamil</a> as "<a href="Punniya%20Boomi">Punniya Boomi</a>" in 1978. 

"Mother India" is ranked No. 80 in "<a href="Empire%20%28film%20magazine%29">Empire</a>" magazine's "The 100 Best Films of World Cinema" in 2010. It is listed among the only three <a href="Bollywood">Hindi films</a> in the book "<a href="1001%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BMovies%20You%20Must%20See%20Before%20You%20Die">1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die</a>" (the others being "<a href="Dilwale%20Dulhania%20Le%20Jayenge">Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge</a>" and "<a href="Deewaar">Deewaar</a>"). Film critic <a href="Anupama%20Chopra">Anupama Chopra</a> included it in her list of top 100 films in world cinema. In 2005, <a href="Indiatimes">Indiatimes Movies</a> ranked the film amongst the "Top 25 Must See Bollywood Films". It was ranked third in the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>'s 2002 poll of "Top 10 Indian Films". It was also included in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">TIME</a>"s list of the best Bollywood classics in 2010, and in <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a>'s list of the "100 greatest Indian films of all time" in 2013. The film was premiered in the "Cannes Classics" section of the <a href="2004%20Cannes%20Film%20Festival">2004 Cannes Film Festival</a>.

<a href="Rajeev%20Masand">Rajeev Masand</a> of <a href="CNN-IBN">CNN-IBN</a> notes that "Mother India" "didn't just put India on the world map, it also defined Hindi cinema for decades that followed." Film critic Dave Kehr agrees that it influenced Indian films for the next 50 years. A 1983 <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> documentary on Hindi cinema describes the film as setting a benchmark in Indian cinema. The shooting stance of Nargis at the end of the film is one of the all-time iconic images of Hindi cinema. Other iconic scenes include Radha pulling the plough through the field (see film poster at the top) and feeding <a href="chapati">chapati</a>s to her two sons as they pull the plough. The "Hindustan Times" states that Nargis symbolised mothers in "which all the mothers [in later films] had the same clichéd roles to play. Representing both motherhood and Mother Earth, who also nurtures and occasionally punishes, Nargis immortalised the Indian mother on celluloid." The film pioneered the portrayal of two morally opposed brothers personifying good and evil, which became a repeated motif in Hindi films, including "<a href="Gunga%20Jumna">Gunga Jumna</a>" (1961) and "<a href="Deewaar">Deewaar</a>" (1975). The rebellious Birju also inspired the "angry young man" stock character that arose in 1970s Hindi cinema. According to scholar Brigitte Schulze, "Mother India" played a key role in shaping the young <a href="Republic%20of%20India">Republic of India</a>'s national identity in its early years following <a href="Indian%20independence%20movement">independence</a> from the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>, due to how the film was able to successfully convey a sense of <a href="Indian%20nationalism">Indian nationalism</a> to the urban and rural masses.

To Autumn

"To Autumn" is a <a href="poetry">poem</a> by English <a href="Romanticism">Romantic</a> poet <a href="John%20Keats">John Keats</a> (31 October 1795 – 23 February 1821). The work was composed on 19 September 1819 and published in 1820 in a volume of Keats's poetry that included "<a href="Lamia%20%28poem%29">Lamia</a>" and "<a href="The%20Eve%20of%20St.%20Agnes">The Eve of St. Agnes</a>". "To Autumn" is the final work in a group of poems known as <a href="John%20Keats%27s%201819%20odes">Keats's "1819 odes"</a>. Although personal problems left him little time to devote to poetry in 1819, he composed "To Autumn" after a walk near <a href="Winchester%2C%20Hampshire">Winchester</a> one autumnal evening. The work marks the end of his poetic career, as he needed to earn money and could no longer devote himself to the lifestyle of a poet. A little over a year following the publication of "To Autumn", Keats died in <a href="Rome%2C%20Italy">Rome</a>.

The poem has three eleven-line <a href="stanza">stanza</a>s which describe a progression through the season, from the late maturation of the crops to the harvest and to the last days of autumn when winter is nearing. The imagery is richly achieved through the <a href="personification">personification</a> of Autumn, and the description of its bounty, its sights and sounds. It has parallels in the work of English landscape artists, with Keats himself describing the fields of stubble that he saw on his walk as being like that in a painting.

The work has been interpreted as a meditation on death; as an <a href="allegory">allegory</a> of artistic creation; as Keats's response to the <a href="Peterloo%20Massacre">Peterloo Massacre</a>, which took place in the same year; and as an expression of <a href="nationalism">nationalist</a> sentiment. One of the most <a href="anthology">anthologised</a> English <a href="lyric%20poem">lyric poem</a>s, "To Autumn" has been regarded by critics as one of the most perfect short poems in the English language.

During the spring of 1819, Keats wrote many of his major odes: "<a href="Ode%20on%20a%20Grecian%20Urn">Ode on a Grecian Urn</a>", "<a href="Ode%20on%20Indolence">Ode on Indolence</a>", "<a href="Ode%20on%20Melancholy">Ode on Melancholy</a>", "<a href="Ode%20to%20a%20Nightingale">Ode to a Nightingale</a>", and "<a href="Ode%20to%20Psyche">Ode to Psyche</a>". After the month of May, he began to pursue other forms of poetry, including the verse tragedy "Otho the Great" in collaboration with friend and roommate Charles Brown, the second half of "Lamia", and a return to his unfinished epic "<a href="Hyperion%20%28poem%29">Hyperion</a>". His efforts from spring until autumn were dedicated completely to a career in poetry, alternating between writing long and short poems, and setting himself a goal to compose more than fifty lines of verse each day. In his free time he also read works as varied as <a href="Robert%20Burton%20%28scholar%29">Robert Burton</a>'s "<a href="Anatomy%20of%20Melancholy">Anatomy of Melancholy</a>", <a href="Thomas%20Chatterton">Thomas Chatterton</a>'s poetry, and <a href="James%20Henry%20Leigh%20Hunt">Leigh Hunt</a>'s essays.

Although Keats managed to write many poems in 1819, he was suffering from a multitude of financial troubles throughout the year, including concerns over his brother, George, who, after emigrating to America, was badly in need of money. Despite these distractions, on 19 September 1819 he found time to write "To Autumn". The poem marks the final moment of his career as a poet. No longer able to afford to devote his time to the composition of poems, he began working on more lucrative projects. Keats's declining health and personal responsibilities also raised obstacles to his continuing poetic efforts.

On 19 September 1819, Keats walked near Winchester along the <a href="River%20Itchen%2C%20Hampshire">River Itchen</a>. In a letter to his friend John Hamilton Reynolds written on 21 September, Keats described the impression the scene had made upon him and its influence on the composition of "To Autumn": "How beautiful the season is now – How fine the air. A temperate sharpness about it [...] I never lik'd stubble fields so much as now [...] Somehow a stubble plain looks warm – in the same way that some pictures look warm – this struck me so much in my sunday's walk that I composed upon it." Not everything on Keats's mind at the time was bright; the poet knew in September that he would have to finally abandon "Hyperion". Thus, in the letter that he wrote to Reynolds, Keats also included a note saying that he abandoned his long poem. Keats did not send "To Autumn" to Reynolds, but did include the poem within a letter to Richard Woodhouse, Keats's publisher and friend, and dated it on the same day.

The poem was revised and included in Keats's 1820 collection of poetry titled "Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems". Although the publishers Taylor and Hessey feared the kind of bad reviews that had plagued Keats's 1818 edition of "<a href="Endymion%20%28poem%29">Endymion</a>", they were willing to publish the collection after the removal of any potentially controversial poems to ensure that there would be no politically motivated reviews that could give the volume a bad reputation.

"To Autumn" describes, in its three stanzas, three different aspects of the season: its fruitfulness, its labour and its ultimate decline. Through the stanzas there is a progression from early autumn to mid autumn and then to the heralding of winter. Parallel to this, the poem depicts the day turning from morning to afternoon and into dusk. These progressions are joined with a shift from the tactile sense to that of sight and then of sound, creating a three-part symmetry which is not present in Keats's other odes.

As the poem progresses, Autumn is represented <a href="metaphor">metaphor</a>ically as one who conspires, who ripens fruit, who harvests, who makes music. The first stanza of the poem represents Autumn as involved with the promotion of natural processes, growth and ultimate maturation, two forces in opposition in nature, but together creating the impression that the season will not end. In this stanza the fruits are still ripening and the buds still opening in the warm weather. Stuart Sperry says that Keats emphasises the tactile sense here, suggested by the imagery of growth and gentle motion: swelling, bending and plumping.

In the second stanza Autumn is <a href="Personification">personified</a> as a harvester, to be seen by the viewer in various guises performing labouring tasks essential to the provision of food for the coming year. There is a lack of definitive action, all motion being gentle. Autumn is not depicted as actually harvesting but as seated, resting or watching. In lines 14–15 the personification of Autumn is as an exhausted labourer. Near the end of the stanza, the steadiness of the gleaner in lines 19–20 again emphasises a motionlessness within the poem. The progression through the day is revealed in actions that are all suggestive of the drowsiness of afternoon: the harvested grain is being winnowed, the harvester is asleep or returning home, the last drops issue from the cider press.

The last stanza contrasts Autumn's sounds with those of Spring. The sounds that are presented are not only those of Autumn but essentially the gentle sounds of the evening. Gnats wail and lambs bleat in the dusk. As night approaches within the final moments of the song, death is slowly approaching alongside the end of the year. The full-grown lambs, like the grapes, gourds and hazel nuts, will be harvested for the winter. The twittering swallows gather for departure, leaving the fields bare. The whistling red-breast and the chirping cricket are the common sounds of winter. The references to Spring, the growing lambs and the migrating swallows remind the reader that the seasons are a cycle, widening the scope of this stanza from a single season to life in general.

Of all of Keats's poems, "To Autumn", with its catalogue of concrete images, most closely describes a paradise as realized on earth while also focusing on archetypal symbols connected with the season. Within the poem, autumn represents growth, maturation and finally an approaching death. There is a fulfilling union between the ideal and the real.

Scholars have noted a number of literary influences on "To Autumn", from <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Georgics">Georgics</a>", to <a href="Edmund%20Spenser">Edmund Spenser</a>'s "Mutability Cantos", to the language of Thomas Chatterton, to <a href="Samuel%20Taylor%20Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>'s "<a href="Frost%20at%20Midnight">Frost at Midnight</a>", to an essay on autumn by Leigh Hunt, which Keats had recently read.

"To Autumn" is thematically connected to other odes that Keats wrote in 1819. For example, in his "Ode to Melancholy" a major theme is the acceptance of the process of life. When this theme appears later in "To Autumn", however, it is with a difference. This time the figure of the poet disappears, and there is no exhortation of an imaginary reader. There are no open conflicts, and "dramatic debate, protest, and qualification are absent". In process there is a harmony between the finality of death and hints of renewal of life in the cycle of the seasons, paralleled by the renewal of a single day.

Critics have tended to emphasize different aspects of the process. Some have focused on renewal; <a href="Walter%20Jackson%20Bate">Walter Jackson Bate</a> points to the theme of each stanza including "its contrary" idea, here death implying, though only indirectly, the renewal of life. Also, noted by both Bate and Jennifer Wagner, the structure of the verse reinforces the sense of something to come; the placing of the couplet before the end of each stanza creates a feeling of suspension, highlighting the theme of continuation.

Others, like <a href="Harold%20Bloom">Harold Bloom</a>, have emphasized the "exhausted landscape", the completion, the finality of death, although "Winter descends here as a man might hope to die, with a natural sweetness". If death in itself is final, here it comes with a lightness, a softness, also pointing to "an acceptance of process beyond the possibility of grief." The progress of growth is no longer necessary; maturation is complete, and life and death are in harmony. The rich description of the cycle of the seasons enables the reader to feel a belonging "to something larger than the self", as James O'Rourke expresses it, but the cycle comes to an end each year, analogous to the ending of single life. O'Rourke suggests that something of a fear of that ending is subtly implied at the end of the poem, although, unlike the other great odes, in this poem the person of the poet is entirely submerged, so there is at most a faint hint of Keats's own possible fear.

According to <a href="Helen%20Vendler">Helen Vendler</a>, "To Autumn" may be seen as an allegory of artistic creation. As the farmer processes the fruits of the soil into what sustains the human body, so the artist processes the experience of life into a symbolic structure that may sustain the human spirit. This process involves an element of self-sacrifice by the artist, analogous to the living grain's being sacrificed for human consumption. In "To Autumn", as a result of this process, the "rhythms" of the harvesting "artist-goddess" "permeate the whole world until all visual, tactile, and kinetic presence is transubstantiated into Apollonian music for the ear," the sounds of the poem itself.

In a 1979 essay, <a href="Jerome%20McGann">Jerome McGann</a> argued that while the poem was indirectly influenced by historical events, Keats had deliberately ignored the political landscape of 1819. Countering this view, Andrew Bennett, Nicholas Roe and others focused on what they believed were political allusions actually present in the poem, Roe arguing for a direct connection to the <a href="Peterloo%20Massacre">Peterloo Massacre</a> of 1819. Later, Paul Fry argued against McGann's stance when he pointed out, "It scarcely seems pertinent to say that 'To Autumn' is therefore an evasion of social violence when it is so clearly an encounter with death itself [...] it is not a politically encoded escape from history reflecting the coerced betrayal [...] of its author's radicalism. McGann thinks to rescue Keats from the imputation of political naïveté by saying that he was a radical browbeaten into quietism".

More recently, in 2012, a specific probable location of the cornfield that inspired Keats was discussed in an article by <a href="Richard%20Marggraf%20Turley">Richard Marggraf Turley</a>, Jayne Archer and Howard Thomas, which draws upon new archival evidence. Traditionally, the water-meadows south of Winchester, along which Keats took daily leisurely walks, were assumed to have provided the sights and sounds of his ode. Marggraf Turley, Archer and Thomas argue that the ode was more directly inspired by Keats's visit to St Giles's Hill—site of a new cornfield—at the eastern extremity of the market city. The land, previously a copse, had recently been turned over to food production to take advantage of high bread prices. This new topography, the authors argue, enables us to see hitherto unsuspected dimensions to Keats's engagement with contemporary politics in particular as they pertained to the management of food production and supply, wages and productivity.

In his 1999 study of the effect on British literature of the diseases and climates of the colonies, Alan Bewell read "the landscape of 'To Autumn as "a kind of biomedical allegory of the coming into being of English climatic space out of its dangerous geographical alternatives." Britain's colonial reach over the previous century and a half had exposed the mother country to foreign diseases and awareness of the dangers of extreme tropical climates. Keats, with medical training, having suffered chronic illness himself, and influenced like his contemporaries by "colonial medical discourse", was deeply aware of this threat.

According to Bewell, the landscape of "To Autumn" presents the temperate climate of rural England as a healthful alternative to disease-ridden foreign environments. Though the "clammy" aspect of "fever", the excessive ripeness associated with tropical climates, intrude into the poem, these elements, less prominent than in Keats's earlier poetry, are counterbalanced by the dry, crisp autumnal air of rural England. In presenting the particularly English elements of this environment, Keats was also influenced by contemporary poet and essayist Leigh Hunt, who had recently written of the arrival of autumn with its "migration of birds", "finished harvest", "cyder [...] making" and migration of "the swallows", as well as by English landscape painting and the "pure" English idiom of the poetry of Thomas Chatterton.

In "To Autumn", Bewell argues, Keats was at once voicing "a very personal expression of desire for health" and constructing a "myth of a national environment". This "political" element in the poem, Bewell points out, has also been suggested by <a href="Geoffrey%20Hartman">Geoffrey Hartman</a>, who expounded a view of "To Autumn" as "an ideological poem whose form expresses a national idea".

Thomas McFarland, on the other hand, in 2000 cautioned against overemphasizing the "political, social, or historical readings" of the poem, which distract from its "consummate surface and bloom". Most important about "To Autumn" is its concentration of imagery and allusion in its evocation of nature, conveying an "interpenetration of livingness and dyingness as contained in the very nature of autumn".

"To Autumn" is a poem of three stanzas, each of eleven lines. Like others of Keats's odes written in 1819, the structure is that of an <a href="Ode%23English%20ode">odal hymn</a>, having three clearly defined sections corresponding to the Classical divisions of <a href="strophe">strophe</a>, <a href="antistrophe">antistrophe</a>, and <a href="epode">epode</a>. The stanzas differ from those of the other odes through use of eleven lines rather than ten, and have a <a href="couplet">couplet</a> placed before the concluding line of each stanza.

"To Autumn" employs poetical techniques which Keats had perfected in the five poems written in the Spring of the same year, but departs from them in some aspects, dispensing with the <a href="narrator">narrator</a> and dealing with more concrete concepts. There is no dramatic movement in "To Autumn" as there is in many earlier poems; the poem progresses in its focus while showing little change in the objects it is focusing on. There is, in the words of Walter Jackson Bate, "a union of process and stasis", "energy caught in repose", an effect that Keats himself termed "stationing". At the beginning of the third stanza he employs the dramatic <a href="Ubi%20sunt">Ubi sunt</a> device associated with a sense of melancholy, and questions the personified subject: ""Where are the songs of Spring?""

Like the other odes, "To Autumn" is written in <a href="iambic%20pentameter">iambic pentameter</a> (but greatly modified from the very beginning) with five stressed syllables to a line, each usually preceded by an unstressed syllable. Keats varies this form by the employment of Augustan inversion, sometimes using a stressed syllable followed by an unstressed syllable at the beginning of a line, including the first: ""Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness""; and employing <a href="spondee">spondee</a>s in which two stressed syllables are placed together at the beginnings of both the following stanzas, adding emphasis to the questions that are asked: ""Who hath not seen thee..."", ""Where are the songs...?""

The <a href="rhyme">rhyme</a> of "To Autumn" follows a pattern of starting each stanza with an <a href="Sonnet%23English%20%28Shakespearean%29%20sonnet">ABAB pattern</a> which is followed by <a href="rhyme%20scheme">rhyme scheme</a> of CDEDCCE in the first verse and CDECDDE in the second and third stanzas. In each case, there is a couplet before the final line. Some of the language of "To Autumn" resembles phrases found in earlier poems with similarities to "<a href="Endymion%20%28poem%29">Endymion</a>", "<a href="Sleep%20and%20Poetry">Sleep and Poetry</a>", and "Calidore". Keats characteristically uses <a href="syllable">monosyllabic words</a> such as ""...how to load and bless with fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run."" The words are weighted by the emphasis of <a href="bilabial%20consonants">bilabial consonants</a> (b, m, p), with lines like ""...for Summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells."" There is also an emphasis on <a href="vowel%20length%23Long%20vowels%20in%20English">long vowels</a> which control the flow of the poem, giving it a slow measured pace: ""...while barred clouds bloom the soft dying day"".

Between the manuscript version and the published version of "To Autumn" Keats tightened the language of the poem. One of Keats's changes emphasised by critics is the change in line 17 of "Drows'd with red poppies" to "Drows'd with the fume of poppies", which emphasises the sense of smell instead of sight. The later edition relies more on <a href="passive%20voice">passive</a>, <a href="participle">past participles</a>, as apparent in the change of "While a gold cloud" in line 25 to "While barred clouds". Other changes involve the strengthening of phrases, especially within the transformation of the phrase in line 13 "whoever seeks for thee may find" into "whoever seeks abroad may find". Many of the lines within the second stanza were completely rewritten, especially those which did not fit into a rhyme scheme. Some of the minor changes involved adding punctuation missing from the original manuscript copy and altering capitalisation.

Critical and scholarly praise has been unanimous in declaring "To Autumn" one of the most perfect poems in the English language. <a href="Algernon%20Charles%20Swinburne">A.C. Swinburne</a> placed it with "Ode on a Grecian Urn" as "the nearest to absolute perfection" of Keats's odes; <a href="Aileen%20Ward">Aileen Ward</a> declared it "Keats's most perfect and untroubled poem"; and <a href="Douglas%20Bush">Douglas Bush</a> has stated that the poem is "flawless in structure, texture, tone, and rhythm"; Walter Evert, in 1965, stated that "To Autumn" is "the only perfect poem that Keats ever wrote – and if this should seem to take from him some measure of credit for his extraordinary enrichment of the English poetic tradition, I would quickly add that I am thinking of absolute perfection in whole poems, in which every part is wholly relevant to and consistent in effect with every other part."

Early reviews of "To Autumn" focused on it as part of Keats's collection of poems "Lamia, Isabella, the Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems". An anonymous critic in the July 1820 "Monthly Review" claimed, "this writer is very rich both in imagination and fancy; and even a superabundance of the latter faculty is displayed in his lines 'On Autumn,' which bring the reality of nature more before our eyes than almost any description that we remember. [...] If we did not fear that, young as is Mr K., his peculiarities are fixed beyond all the power of criticism to remove, we would exhort him to become somewhat less strikingly original,—to be less fond of the folly of too new or too old phrases,—and to believe that poetry does not consist in either the one or the other." Josiah Conder in the September 1820 "Eclectic Review" mentioned, "One naturally turns first to the shorter pieces, in order to taste the flavour of the poetry. The following ode to Autumn is no unfavourable specimen." An anonymous reviewer in "The Edinburgh Magazine" for October 1820 added to a discussion of some of Keats's longer poems the afterthought that "The ode to 'Fancy,' and the ode to 'Autumn,' also have great merit."

Although, after Keats's death, recognition of the merits of his poetry came slowly, by mid century, despite widespread <a href="Victorian%20morality">Victorian</a> disapproval of the alleged "weakness" of his character and the view often advanced "that Keats's work represented mere sensuality without substance", some of his poems began to find an appreciative audience, including "To Autumn". In an 1844 essay on Keats's poetry in the "Dumfries Herald", George Gilfillian placed "To Autumn" among "the finest of Keats' smaller pieces". In an 1851 lecture, David Macbeth Moir acclaimed "four exquisite odes,—'To a Nightingale,' 'To a Grecian Urn,' 'To Melancholy,' and 'To Autumn,'—all so pregnant with deep thought, so picturesque in their limning, and so suggestive." In 1865, <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> singled out the "indefinable delicacy, charm, and perfection of [...] Keats's [touch] in his Autumn". John Dennis, in an 1883 work about great poets, wrote that "the 'Ode to Autumn', ripe with the glory of the season it describes—must ever have a place among the most precious gems of lyrical poetry." The 1888 Britannica declared, "Of these [odes] perhaps the two nearest to absolute perfection, to the triumphant achievement and accomplishment of the very utmost beauty possible to human words, may be that to Autumn and that on a Grecian Urn".

At the turn of the 20th century, a 1904 analysis of great poetry by Stephen Gwynn claimed, "above and before all [of Keats's poems are] the three odes, "To a Nightingale", "On a Grecian Urn", and "To Autumn". Among these odes criticism can hardly choose; in each of them the whole magic of poetry seems to be contained." <a href="Sidney%20Colvin">Sidney Colvin</a>, in his 1917 biography, pointed out that "the ode "To Autumn" [...] opens up no such far-reaching avenues to the mind and soul of the reader as the odes "To a Grecian Urn", "To a Nightingale", or "On Melancholy", but in execution is more complete and faultless than any of them." Following this in a 1934 analysis of Romantic poetry, Margaret Sherwood stated that the poem was "a perfect expression of the phase of primitive feeling and dim thought in regard to earth processes when these are passing into a thought of personality."

Harold Bloom, in 1961, described "To Autumn" as "the most perfect shorter poem in the English language." Following this, Walter Jackson Bate, in 1963, claimed that "[...] each generation has found it one of the most nearly perfect poems in English." Later, in 1973, Stuart Sperry wrote, To Autumn' succeeds through its acceptance of an order innate in our experience – the natural rhythm of the seasons. It is a poem that, without ever stating it, inevitably suggests the truth of 'ripeness is all' by developing, with a richness of profundity of implication, the simple perception that ripeness is fall." In 1981, <a href="William%20Walsh%20%28academic%29">William Walsh</a> argued that "Among the major Odes [...] no one has questioned the place and supremacy of 'To Autumn', in which we see wholly realized, powerfully embodied in art, the complete maturity so earnestly laboured at in Keats's life, so persuasively argued about in his letters." Literary critic and academic Helen Vendler, in 1988, declared that "in the ode 'To Autumn,' Keats finds his most comprehensive and adequate symbol for the social value of art."

In 1997, Andrew Motion summarised the critical view on "To Autumn": "it has often been called Keats's 'most ... untroubled poem' [...] To register the full force of its achievement, its tensions have to be felt as potent and demanding." Following in 1998, <a href="M.%20H.%20Abrams">M. H. Abrams</a> explained, To Autumn' was the last work of artistic consequence that Keats completed [...] he achieved this celebratory poem, with its calm acquiescence to time, transience and mortality, at a time when he was possessed by a premonition [...] that he had himself less than two years to live". James Chandler, also in 1998, pointed out that "If "To Autumn" is his greatest piece of writing, as has so often been said, it is because in it he arguably set himself the most ambitious challenge of his brief career and managed to meet it." Timothy Corrigan, in 2000, claimed that To Autumn' may be, as other critics have pointed out, his greatest achievement in its ability [...] to redeem the English vernacular as the casual expression of everyday experience, becoming in this his most exterior poem even in all its bucolic charm." In the same year, Thomas McFarland placed "To Autumn" with "Ode to a Nightingale", "Ode on a Grecian Urn", "The Eve of St. Agnes" and "Hyperion" as Keats's greatest achievement, together elevating Keats "high in the ranks of the supreme makers of world literature". In 2008, Stanley Plumly wrote, "history, posterity, immortality are seeing 'Ode to a Nightingale,' 'Ode on a Grecian Urn,' and 'To Autumn' as three of the most anthologized lyric poems of tragic vision in English."

Rhabdomyolysis

Rhabdomyolysis is a condition in which damaged <a href="skeletal%20muscle">skeletal muscle</a> breaks down rapidly. Symptoms may include <a href="myalgia">muscle pains</a>, weakness, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, and <a href="mental%20confusion">confusion</a>. There may be tea-colored urine or an <a href="arrythmia">irregular heartbeat</a>. Some of the muscle breakdown products, such as the protein <a href="myoglobin">myoglobin</a>, are harmful to the <a href="kidney">kidney</a>s and may lead to <a href="acute%20kidney%20injury">kidney failure</a>.
The muscle damage is most often the result of a <a href="Crush%20syndrome">crush injury</a>, strenuous exercise, <a href="Pharmaceutical%20drug">medications</a>, or <a href="Substance%20abuse">drug abuse</a>. Other causes include <a href="infection">infection</a>s, <a href="electrical%20injury">electrical injury</a>, <a href="heat%20stroke">heat stroke</a>, prolonged immobilization, <a href="limb%20ischemia">lack of blood flow to a limb</a>, or <a href="snake%20bite">snake bite</a>s. Some people have <a href="Heredity">inherited</a> muscle conditions that increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis. The diagnosis is supported by a <a href="urine%20test%20strip">urine test strip</a> which is positive for "blood" but the urine contains no <a href="red%20blood%20cells">red blood cells</a> when examined with a <a href="microscope">microscope</a>. <a href="Blood%20test">Blood test</a>s show a <a href="creatine%20kinase">creatine kinase</a> greater than 1,000 U/L, with severe disease being above 5,000 U/L.
The mainstay of treatment is large quantities of <a href="intravenous">intravenous</a> fluids. Other treatments may include <a href="dialysis">dialysis</a> or <a href="hemofiltration">hemofiltration</a> in more severe cases. Once urine output is established <a href="sodium%20bicarbonate">sodium bicarbonate</a> and <a href="mannitol">mannitol</a> are commonly used but they are poorly supported by the evidence. Outcomes are generally good if treated early. Complications may include <a href="hyperkalemia">high blood potassium</a>, <a href="hypocalcemia">low blood calcium</a>, <a href="disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">disseminated intravascular coagulation</a>, and <a href="compartment%20syndrome">compartment syndrome</a>.
Rhabdomyolysis occurs in about 26,000 people a year in the United States. While the condition has been commented on throughout history, the first modern description was following an earthquake in 1908. Important discoveries as to its mechanism were made during <a href="The%20Blitz">the Blitz of London</a> in 1941. It is a significant problem for those injured in <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>s and relief efforts for such <a href="disaster">disaster</a>s often include medical teams equipped to treat survivors with rhabdomyolysis.

The symptoms of rhabdomyolysis depend on its severity and whether kidney failure develops. Milder forms may not cause any muscle symptoms, and the diagnosis is based on abnormal <a href="blood%20test">blood test</a>s in the context of other problems. More severe rhabdomyolysis is characterized by <a href="Myalgia">muscle pain</a>, tenderness, <a href="Muscle%20weakness">weakness</a> and <a href="edema">swelling</a> of the affected muscles. If the swelling is very rapid, as may happen after someone is released from under a collapsed building, the movement of fluid from the bloodstream into damaged muscle may cause <a href="hypotension">low blood pressure</a> and <a href="shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a>. Other symptoms are <a href="nonspecific%20symptom">nonspecific</a> and result either from the consequences of muscle tissue breakdown or from the condition that originally led to the muscle breakdown. Release of the components of muscle tissue into the bloodstream causes <a href="electrolyte">electrolyte</a> disturbances, which can lead to <a href="nausea">nausea</a>, <a href="vomiting">vomiting</a>, <a href="mental%20confusion">confusion</a>, <a href="coma">coma</a> or <a href="cardiac%20arrhythmia">abnormal heart rate and rhythm</a>. The urine may be dark, often described as "tea-colored", due to the presence of <a href="myoglobin">myoglobin</a>. Damage to the kidneys may give rise to <a href="oliguria">decreased</a> or <a href="anuria">absent urine production</a>, usually 12 to 24 hours after the initial muscle damage.

Swelling of damaged muscle occasionally leads to <a href="compartment%20syndrome">compartment syndrome</a>—compression of surrounding tissues, such as nerves and <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s, in the same <a href="fascial%20compartment">fascial compartment</a>—leading to the loss of blood supply and damage or loss of function in the part(s) of the body supplied by these structures. Symptoms of this complication include pain or reduced sensation in the affected limb. A second recognized complication is <a href="disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">disseminated intravascular coagulation</a> (DIC), a severe disruption in <a href="coagulation">blood clotting</a> that may lead to uncontrollable bleeding.

Any form of muscle damage of sufficient severity can cause rhabdomyolysis. Multiple causes can be present simultaneously in one person. Some have an underlying muscle condition, usually hereditary in nature, that makes them more prone to rhabdomyolysis.

Recurrent rhabdomyolysis may result from intrinsic muscle enzyme deficiencies, which are usually inherited and often appear during childhood. Many structural muscle diseases feature episodes of rhabdomyolysis that are triggered by exercise, <a href="General%20anaesthesia">general anesthesia</a> or any of the other causes of rhabdomyolysis listed above. Inherited muscle disorders and infections together cause the majority of rhabdomyolysis in children.

The following hereditary disorders of the muscle energy supply may cause recurrent and usually exertional rhabdomyolysis:

Damage to skeletal muscle may take various forms. Crush and other physical injuries cause damage to <a href="myocyte">muscle cells</a> directly or interfere with blood supply, while non-physical causes interfere with muscle cell <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>. When damaged, muscle tissue rapidly fills with fluid from the bloodstream, including <a href="sodium">sodium ions</a>. The swelling itself may lead to destruction of muscle cells, but those cells that survive are subject to various disruptions that lead to rise in intracellular calcium ions; the accumulation of calcium outside the <a href="sarcoplasmic%20reticulum">sarcoplasmic reticulum</a> leads to continuous <a href="muscle%20contraction">muscle contraction</a> and depletion of <a href="Adenosine%20triphosphate">ATP</a>, the main carrier of energy in the cell. ATP depletion can itself lead to uncontrolled calcium influx. The persistent contraction of the muscle cell leads to breakdown of intracellular proteins and disintegration of the cell.

<a href="Neutrophil%20granulocyte">Neutrophil granulocyte</a>s—the most abundant type of <a href="white%20blood%20cell">white blood cell</a>—enter the muscle tissue, producing an <a href="inflammation">inflammatory</a> reaction and releasing <a href="reactive%20oxygen%20species">reactive oxygen species</a>, particularly after crush injury. Crush syndrome may also cause <a href="reperfusion%20injury">reperfusion injury</a> when blood flow to decompressed muscle is suddenly restored.

The swollen, inflamed muscle may directly compress structures in the same <a href="fascial%20compartment">fascial compartment</a>, causing <a href="compartment%20syndrome">compartment syndrome</a>. The swelling may also further compromise blood supply into the area. Finally, destroyed muscle cells release potassium ions, <a href="phosphate">phosphate</a> ions, the <a href="heme">heme</a>-containing protein <a href="myoglobin">myoglobin</a>, the <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> <a href="creatine%20kinase">creatine kinase</a> and <a href="uric%20acid">uric acid</a> (a breakdown product of <a href="purine">purine</a>s from <a href="DNA">DNA</a>) into the blood. Activation of the coagulation system may precipitate <a href="disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">disseminated intravascular coagulation</a>. <a href="Hyperkalemia">High potassium levels</a> may lead to potentially fatal <a href="Cardiac%20dysrhythmia">disruptions in heart rhythm</a>. Phosphate binds to calcium from the circulation, leading to <a href="hypocalcemia">low calcium levels in the blood</a>.

Rhabdomyolysis may cause kidney failure by several mechanisms. The most important is the accumulation of myoglobin in the <a href="Nephron%23Renal%20tubule">kidney tubules</a>. Normally, the blood protein <a href="haptoglobin">haptoglobin</a> binds circulating myoglobin and other heme-containing substances, but in rhabdomyolysis the quantity of myoglobin exceeds the binding capacity of haptoglobin. <a href="Myoglobinuria">Myoglobinuria</a>, the presence of myoglobin in the urine, occurs when the level in <a href="blood%20plasma">plasma</a> exceeds 0.5–1.5 <a href="gram%20per%20litre">mg/dl</a>; once plasma levels reach 100 mg/dl, the concentration in the urine becomes sufficient for it to be visibly discolored and corresponds with the destruction of about 200 grams of muscle. As the kidneys reabsorb more water from the <a href="wikt%3Afiltrate">filtrate</a>, myoglobin interacts with <a href="Tamm-Horsfall%20protein">Tamm–Horsfall protein</a> in the <a href="nephron">nephron</a> to form <a href="Urinary%20cast">casts</a> (solid aggregates) that obstruct the normal flow of fluid; the condition is worsened further by high levels of uric acid and acidification of the filtrate, which increase cast formation. Iron released from the heme generates reactive oxygen species, damaging the kidney cells. In addition to the myoglobinuria, two other mechanisms contribute to kidney impairment: low blood pressure leads to <a href="vasoconstriction">constriction of the blood vessels</a> and therefore a relative lack of blood flow to the kidney, and finally uric acid may form crystals in the tubules of the kidneys, causing obstruction. Together, these processes lead to <a href="acute%20tubular%20necrosis">acute tubular necrosis</a>, the destruction of the cells of tubules. <a href="Glomerular%20filtration%20rate">Glomerular filtration rate</a> falls and the kidney is unable to perform its normal excretory functions. This causes disruption of electrolyte regulation, leading to a further rise in potassium levels, and interferes with <a href="vitamin%20D">vitamin D</a> processing, further worsening the low calcium levels.

A diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis may be suspected in anyone who has suffered trauma, crush injury or prolonged immobilization, but it may also be identified at a later stage due to deteriorating kidney function (abnormally raised or increasing <a href="creatinine">creatinine</a> and <a href="Blood%20urea%20nitrogen">urea</a> levels, falling urine output) or reddish-brown discoloration of the urine.

The most reliable test in the diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis is the level of <a href="creatine%20kinase">creatine kinase</a> (CK) in the blood. This enzyme is released by damaged muscle, and levels above 1000 U/L (5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)) indicate rhabdomyolysis. More than 5,000 U/L indicates severe disease but depending on the extent of the rhabdomyolysis, concentrations up to 100,000 <a href="enzyme%20unit">U</a>/l are not unusual. CK concentrations rise steadily for 12 hours after the original muscle injury, remain elevated for 1–3 days and then fall gradually. Initial and peak CK levels have a linear relationship with the risk of acute kidney failure: the higher the CK, the more likely it is that kidney damage will occur. There is no specific concentration of CK above which kidney impairment definitely occurs; concentrations below 20,000 U/l are unlikely to be associated with a risk of kidney impairment, unless there are other contributing risk factors. Mild rises without kidney impairment are referred to as "hyperCKemia". Myoglobin has a short half-life, and is therefore less useful as a diagnostic test in the later stages. Its detection in blood or urine is associated with a higher risk of kidney impairment. Despite this, use of urine myoglobin measurement is not supported by evidence as it lacks <a href="Sensitivity%20and%20specificity">specificity</a> and the research studying its utility is of poor quality.

Elevated concentrations of the enzyme <a href="lactate%20dehydrogenase">lactate dehydrogenase</a> (LDH) may be detected. Other markers of muscle damage, such as <a href="aldolase">aldolase</a>, <a href="troponin">troponin</a>, <a href="Carbonic%20anhydrase%20III%2C%20muscle%20specific">carbonic anhydrase type 3</a> and <a href="Heart-type%20fatty%20acid%20binding%20protein">fatty acid-binding protein</a> (FABP), are mainly used in chronic muscle diseases. The <a href="transaminase">transaminase</a>s, enzymes abundant in both liver and muscle tissue, are also usually increased; this can lead to the condition being confused with acute liver injury, at least in the early stages. The incidence of actual acute liver injury is 25% in people with non-traumatic rhabdomyolysis; the mechanism for this is uncertain.

<a href="Hyperkalemia">High potassium levels</a> tend to be a feature of severe rhabdomyolysis. <a href="Electrocardiography">Electrocardiography</a> (ECG) may show whether the elevated potassium levels are affecting the conduction system of the heart, as suggested by the presence of <a href="T%20wave">T wave</a> changes or broadening of the <a href="QRS%20complex">QRS complex</a>. Low <a href="calcium%20in%20biology">calcium</a> levels may be present in the initial stage due to binding of free calcium to damaged muscle cells.

As detectable levels of <a href="myoglobinemia">myoglobinemia</a> and <a href="myoglobinuria">myoglobinuria</a> occur, <a href="blood%20test">blood test</a>s and <a href="clinical%20urine%20tests">urine test</a>s may show elevated levels of myoglobin. For example, a <a href="urine%20test%20strip">urine test strip</a> may reveal a positive result for "blood", even though no <a href="red%20blood%20cell">red blood cell</a>s can be identified on <a href="microscopy">microscopy</a> of the urine; this occurs because the reagent on the test strip reacts with myoglobin. The same phenomenon may happen in conditions that lead to <a href="hemolysis">hemolysis</a>, the destruction of red blood cells; in hemolysis the <a href="blood%20serum">blood serum</a> is also visibly discolored, while in rhabdomyolysis it is normal. If kidney damage has occurred, microscopy of the urine also reveals <a href="urinary%20cast">urinary cast</a>s that appear pigmented and granular.

<a href="Compartment%20syndrome">Compartment syndrome</a> is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no <a href="diagnostic%20test">diagnostic test</a> conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct measurement of the pressure in a fascial compartment, and the difference between this pressure and the blood pressure, may be used to assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.

<a href="Disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</a>, another complication of rhabdomyolysis and other forms of critical illness, may be suspected on the basis of unexpected bleeding or abnormalities in hematological tests, such as a decreasing <a href="platelet">platelet</a> count or prolongation of the <a href="prothrombin%20time">prothrombin time</a>. The diagnosis can be confirmed with standard blood tests for DIC, such as <a href="D-dimer">D-dimer</a>.

If an underlying muscle disease is suspected, for instance if there is no obvious explanation or there have been multiple episodes, it may be necessary to perform further investigations. During an attack, low levels of <a href="carnitine">carnitine</a> in the blood and high levels of acylcarnitine in blood and urine may indicate a lipid metabolism defect, but these abnormalities revert to normal during convalescence. Other tests may be used at that stage to demonstrate these disorders. Disorders of <a href="glycolysis">glycolysis</a> can be detected by various means, including the measurement of <a href="lactic%20acid">lactate</a> after exercise; a failure of the lactate to rise may be indicative of a disorder in glycolysis, while an exaggerated response is typical of <a href="mitochondrial%20disease">mitochondrial disease</a>s. <a href="Electromyography">Electromyography</a> (EMG) may show particular patterns in specific muscle diseases; for instance, <a href="Glycogen%20storage%20disease%20type%20V">McArdle's disease</a> and <a href="phosphofructokinase%20deficiency">phosphofructokinase deficiency</a> show a phenomenon called "cramp-like contracture". There are genetic tests available for many of the hereditary muscle conditions that predispose to myoglobinuria and rhabdomyolysis.

<a href="Muscle%20biopsy">Muscle biopsy</a> can be useful if an episode of rhabdomyolysis is thought to be the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of <a href="necrosis">cell death</a> or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several weeks or months. The <a href="Histopathology">histopathological</a> appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by "ragged red fibers". Biopsy sites may be identified by <a href="medical%20imaging">medical imaging</a>, such as <a href="magnetic%20resonance%20imaging">magnetic resonance imaging</a>, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.

The main goal of treatment is to treat shock and preserve kidney function. Initially this is done through the administration of generous amounts of <a href="intravenous%20fluid">intravenous fluid</a>s, usually <a href="Saline%20%28medicine%29">isotonic saline</a> (0.9% <a href="weight%20per%20volume">weight per volume</a> <a href="sodium%20chloride">sodium chloride</a> solution). In victims of crush syndrome, it is recommended to administer intravenous fluids even before they are extracted from collapsed structures. This will ensure sufficient circulating volume to deal with the muscle cell swelling (which typically commences when blood supply is restored), and to prevent the deposition of myoglobin in the kidneys. Amounts of 6 to 12 liters over 24 hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300 ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of <a href="heart%20failure">heart failure</a>.

While many sources recommend additional intravenous agents to reduce damage to the kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. <a href="Mannitol">Mannitol</a> acts by <a href="osmosis">osmosis</a> to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies and there is a risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of <a href="bicarbonate">bicarbonate</a> to the intravenous fluids may alleviate <a href="acidosis">acidosis</a> (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more <a href="alkaline">alkaline</a> to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. <a href="Furosemide">Furosemide</a>, a <a href="loop%20diuretic">loop diuretic</a>, is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.

In the initial stages, electrolyte levels are often abnormal and require correction. High potassium levels can be life-threatening, and respond to increased urine production and renal replacement therapy (see below). <a href="Hyperkalemia%23Treatment">Temporary measures</a> include the administration of calcium to protect against cardiac complications, <a href="insulin">insulin</a> or <a href="salbutamol">salbutamol</a> to redistribute potassium into cells, and infusions of bicarbonate solution.

Calcium levels initially tend to be low, but as the situation improves calcium is released from where it has precipitated with phosphate, and vitamin D production resumes, leading to <a href="hypercalcemia">hypercalcemia</a> (abnormally high calcium levels). This "overshoot" occurs in 20–30% of those people who have developed kidney failure.

Kidney dysfunction typically develops 1–2 days after the initial muscle damage. If supportive treatment is inadequate to manage this, <a href="renal%20replacement%20therapy">renal replacement therapy</a> (RRT) may be required. RRT removes excess potassium, acid and phosphate that accumulate when the kidneys are unable to function normally and is required until kidney function is regained.

Three main modalities of RRT are available: <a href="hemodialysis">hemodialysis</a>, <a href="hemofiltration">continuous hemofiltration</a> and <a href="peritoneal%20dialysis">peritoneal dialysis</a>. The former two require access to the bloodstream (a <a href="dialysis%20catheter">dialysis catheter</a>), while peritoneal dialysis is achieved by instilling fluid into the abdominal cavity and later draining it. Hemodialysis, which is normally done several times a week in <a href="chronic%20kidney%20disease">chronic kidney disease</a>, is often required on a daily basis in rhabdomyolysis. Its advantage over continuous hemofiltration is that one machine can be used multiple times a day, and that continuous administration of <a href="anticoagulant">anticoagulant</a> drugs is not necessary. Hemofiltration is more effective at removing large molecules from the bloodstream, such as myoglobin, but this does not seem to confer any particular benefit. Peritoneal dialysis may be difficult to administer in someone with severe abdominal injury, and it may be less effective than the other modalities.

<a href="Compartment%20syndrome">Compartment syndrome</a> is treated with surgery to relieve the pressure inside the muscle compartment and reduce the risk of compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. <a href="Fasciotomy">Fasciotomy</a> is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring <a href="debridement">debridement</a> (removal of non-viable tissue) and <a href="skin%20grafting">skin grafting</a> in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.

<a href="Disseminated%20intravascular%20coagulation">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</a> generally resolves when the underlying causes are treated, but <a href="supportive%20treatment">supportive measures</a> are often required. For instance, if the <a href="thrombocytopenia">platelet count drops</a> significantly and there is resultant bleeding, platelets may be administered.

The prognosis depends on the underlying cause and whether any complications occur. Rhabdomyolysis complicated by acute kidney impairment in patients with traumatic injury may have a <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> of 20%. Admission to the intensive care unit is associated with a mortality of 22% in the absence of acute kidney injury, and 59% if kidney impairment occurs. Most people who have sustained kidney impairment due to rhabdomyolysis fully recover their kidney function.

The exact number of cases of rhabdomyolysis is difficult to establish, because different definitions have been used. In 1995, hospitals in the U.S. reported 26,000 cases of rhabdomyolysis. Up to 85% of people with major traumatic injuries will experience some degree of rhabdomyolysis. Of those with rhabdomyolysis, 10–50% develop acute kidney injury. The risk is higher in people with a history of illicit drug use, alcohol misuse or trauma when compared to muscle diseases, and it is particularly high if multiple contributing factors occur together. Rhabdomyolysis accounts for 7–10% of all cases of acute kidney injury in the U.S.

Crush injuries are common in major disasters, especially in earthquakes. The aftermath of the <a href="1988%20Spitak%20earthquake">1988 Spitak earthquake</a> prompted the establishment, in 1995, of the Renal Disaster Relief Task Force, a working group of the <a href="International%20Society%20of%20Nephrology">International Society of Nephrology</a> (a worldwide body of kidney experts). Its volunteer doctors and nurses assisted for the first time in the <a href="1999%20%C4%B0zmit%20earthquake">1999 İzmit earthquake</a> in <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, where 17,480 people died, 5392 were hospitalized and 477 received dialysis, with positive results. Treatment units are generally established outside the immediate disaster area, as <a href="aftershock">aftershock</a>s could potentially injure or kill staff and make equipment unusable.

Acute exertional rhabdomyolysis happens in 2% to 40% of people going through basic training for the United States military. In 2012, the United States military reported 402 cases.

The Bible may contain an early account of rhabdomyolysis. In , the Pentateuch says that the Jews demanded meat while traveling in the desert; God sent quail in response to the complaints, and people ate large quantities of quail meat. A plague then broke out, killing numerous people. Rhabdomyolysis after consuming quail was described in more recent times and called "<a href="coturnism">coturnism</a>" (after "<a href="Coturnix">Coturnix</a>", the main quail genus). Migrating quail consume large amounts of <a href="Conium">hemlock</a>, a known cause of rhabdomyolysis.

In modern times, early reports from the <a href="1908%20Messina%20earthquake">1908 Messina earthquake</a> and World War I on kidney failure after injury were followed by studies by London physicians <a href="Eric%20Bywaters">Eric Bywaters</a> and <a href="Desmond%20Beall">Desmond Beall</a>, working at the <a href="Royal%20Postgraduate%20Medical%20School">Royal Postgraduate Medical School</a> and the <a href="National%20Institute%20for%20Medical%20Research">National Institute for Medical Research</a>, on four victims of <a href="The%20Blitz">The Blitz</a> in 1941. Myoglobin was demonstrated in the urine of victims by <a href="spectroscopy">spectroscopy</a>, and it was noted that the kidneys of victims resembled those of patients who had <a href="hemoglobinuria">hemoglobinuria</a> (hemoglobin rather than myoglobin being the cause of the kidney damage). In 1944 Bywaters demonstrated experimentally that the kidney failure was mainly caused by myoglobin. Already during the war, teams of doctors traveled to bombed areas to provide medical support, chiefly with intravenous fluids, as dialysis was not yet available. The prognosis of acute kidney failure improved markedly when dialysis was added to supportive treatment, which first happened during the 1950–1953 <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>.

The word "rhabdomyolysis" () uses the <a href="classical%20compound">combining forms</a> "<a href="wikt%3Arhabdo-%23Prefix">rhabdo-</a>" + "<a href="wikt%3Amyo-%23Prefix">myo-</a>" + "<a href="wikt%3A-lysis%23Suffix">-lysis</a>", yielding "striated muscle breakdown".

Rhabdomyolysis is recognized in horses. Horses can develop a number of muscle disorders, many of which may progress to rhabdomyolysis. Of these, some cause isolated attacks of rhabdomyolysis (e.g., dietary deficiency in <a href="vitamin%20E">vitamin E</a> and <a href="selenium">selenium</a>, poisoning associated with pasture or agricultural poisons such as <a href="organophosphate">organophosphate</a>s), while others predispose to exertional rhabdomyolysis (e.g., the hereditary condition <a href="equine%20polysaccharide%20storage%20myopathy">equine polysaccharide storage myopathy</a>). 5–10% of <a href="thoroughbred">thoroughbred</a> horses and some <a href="standardbred">standardbred</a> horses suffer from the condition <a href="equine%20exertional%20rhabdomyolysis">equine exertional rhabdomyolysis</a>; no specific cause has been identified, but an underlying muscle calcium regulation disorder is suspected.

Rhabdomyolysis affecting horses may also occur in outbreaks; these have been reported in many European countries, and later in Canada, Australia, and the United States. It has been referred to as "atypical myopathy" or "myoglobinuria of unknown etiology". No single cause has yet been found, but various mechanisms have been proposed, and a seasonal pattern has been observed. Very high creatine kinase levels are detected, and mortality from this condition is 89%.

Deinonychus

Deinonychus ( ; from , 'terrible' and , genitive 'claw') is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="carnivore">carnivorous</a> <a href="Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurid</a> <a href="coelurosauria">coelurosauria</a>n <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> with one described species, Deinonychus antirrhopus. This species, which could grow up to long, lived during the early <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a>, about 115–108 million <a href="year">year</a>s ago (from the mid-<a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> to early <a href="Albian">Albian</a> <a href="Stage%20%28stratigraphy%29">stages</a>). Fossils have been recovered from the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a>s of <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, and <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, in rocks of the <a href="Cloverly%20Formation">Cloverly Formation</a>, <a href="Cedar%20Mountain%20Formation">Cedar Mountain Formation</a> and <a href="Antlers%20Formation">Antlers Formation</a>, though teeth that may belong to "Deinonychus" have been found much farther east in <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>.

<a href="Paleontology">Paleontologist</a> <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a>'s study of "Deinonychus" in the late 1960s revolutionized the way scientists thought about dinosaurs, leading to the "<a href="dinosaur%20renaissance">dinosaur renaissance</a>" and igniting the debate on whether dinosaurs were <a href="endotherm">warm-blooded</a> or <a href="ectotherm">cold-blooded</a>. Before this, the popular conception of dinosaurs had been one of plodding, reptilian giants. Ostrom noted the small body, sleek, horizontal posture, <a href="ratite">ratite</a>-like spine, and especially the enlarged raptorial claws on the feet, which suggested an active, agile predator.

"Terrible claw" refers to the unusually large, sickle-shaped talon on the second toe of each hind foot. The fossil YPM 5205 preserves a large, strongly curved <a href="ungual">ungual</a>. In life, archosaurs have a horny sheath over this bone, which extends the length. Ostrom looked at crocodile and bird claws and reconstructed the claw for YPM 5205 as over long. The species name "antirrhopus" means "counter balance", which refers to Ostrom's idea about the function of the tail. As in other dromaeosaurids, the tail vertebrae have a series of ossified tendons and super-elongated bone <a href="Process%20%28anatomy%29">processes</a>. These features seemed to make the tail into a stiff counterbalance, but a fossil of the very closely related "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor mongoliensis</a>" ("IGM" 100/986) has an articulated tail skeleton that is curved laterally in a long S-shape. This suggests that, in life, the tail could bend to the sides with a high degree of flexibility. In both the Cloverly and Antlers formations, "Deinonychus" remains have been found closely associated with those of the ornithopod "<a href="Tenontosaurus">Tenontosaurus</a>". Teeth discovered associated with "Tenontosaurus" specimens imply they were hunted, or at least scavenged upon, by "Deinonychus".

Based on the few fully mature specimens, "Deinonychus" could reach in length, with a skull length of , a hip height of and a weight of , though there is a higher estimate of . The skull was equipped with powerful jaws lined with around seventy curved, blade-like teeth. Studies of the skull have progressed a great deal over the decades. Ostrom reconstructed the partial, imperfectly preserved skulls that he had as triangular, broad, and fairly similar to "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>". Additional "Deinonychus" skull material and closely related species found with good three-dimensional preservation show that the palate was more vaulted than Ostrom thought, making the snout far narrower, while the <a href="Jugal%20bone">jugals</a> flared broadly, giving greater stereoscopic vision. The skull of "Deinonychus" was different from that of "Velociraptor", however, in that it had a more robust skull roof, like that of "<a href="Dromaeosaurus">Dromaeosaurus</a>", and did not have the depressed nasals of "Velociraptor". Both the skull and the lower jaw had <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestra</a>e (skull openings) which reduced the weight of the skull. In "Deinonychus", the <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a>, a skull opening between the eye and nostril, was particularly large.

"Deinonychus" possessed large "hands" (<a href="Manus%20%28anatomy%29">manus</a>) with three claws on each forelimb. The first digit was shortest and the second was longest. Each hind foot bore a sickle-shaped claw on the second digit, which was probably used during predation.

No skin impressions have ever been found in association with fossils of "Deinonychus". Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that the <a href="Dromaeosauridae">Dromaeosauridae</a>, including "Deinonychus", had feathers. The genus "<a href="Microraptor">Microraptor</a>" is both older geologically and more primitive phylogenetically than "Deinonychus", and within the same family. Multiple fossils of "<a href="Microraptor">Microraptor</a>" preserve pennaceous, vaned feathers like those of modern birds on the arms, legs, and tail, along with covert and contour feathers. "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>" is geologically younger than "Deinonychus", but even more closely related (within the subfamily velociraptorinae, see Classification, below). A specimen of "Velociraptor" has been found with quill knobs on the ulna. Quill knobs are where the follicular ligaments attached, and are a direct indicator of feathers of modern aspect.

Fossilized remains of "Deinonychus" have been recovered from the <a href="Cloverly%20Formation">Cloverly Formation</a> of <a href="Montana">Montana</a> and <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a> and in the roughly contemporary <a href="Antlers%20Formation">Antlers Formation</a> of <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, in <a href="North%20America">North America</a>. The Cloverly formation has been dated to the late <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> through early <a href="Albian">Albian</a> stages of the early <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a>, about 115 to 108 Ma. Additionally, teeth found in the <a href="Arundel%20Formation">Arundel Clay Facies</a> (mid-Aptian), of the <a href="Potomac%20Group">Potomac Formation</a> on the <a href="Atlantic%20Coastal%20Plain">Atlantic Coastal Plain</a> of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> may be assigned to the genus.

The first remains were uncovered in 1931 in southern <a href="Montana">Montana</a> near the town of <a href="Billings%2C%20Montana">Billings</a>. The team leader, paleontologist <a href="Barnum%20Brown">Barnum Brown</a>, was primarily concerned with excavating and preparing the remains of the <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a> dinosaur "<a href="Tenontosaurus">Tenontosaurus</a>", but in his field report from the dig site to the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a>, he reported the discovery of a small carnivorous dinosaur close to a "Tenontosaurus" skeleton, "but encased in lime difficult to prepare." He informally called the animal "Daptosaurus agilis" and made preparations for describing it and having the skeleton, specimen AMNH 3015, put on display, but never finished this work. Brown brought back from the Cloverly Formation the skeleton of a smaller theropod with seemingly oversized teeth that he informally named "Megadontosaurus". <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a>, reviewing this material decades later, realized that the teeth came from "Deinonychus", but the skeleton came from a completely different animal. He named this skeleton "<a href="Microvenator">Microvenator</a>".

A little more than thirty years later, in August 1964, paleontologist John Ostrom led an expedition from <a href="Yale%20University">Yale</a>'s <a href="Peabody%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">Peabody Museum of Natural History</a> which discovered more skeletal material near <a href="Bridger%2C%20Montana">Bridger</a>. Expeditions during the following two summers uncovered more than 1,000 bones, among which were at least three individuals. Since the association between the various recovered bones was weak, making the exact number of individual animals represented impossible to determine properly, the <a href="Type%20%28biology%29">type</a> specimen (YPM 5205) of "Deinonychus" was restricted to the complete left foot and partial right foot that definitely belonged to the same individual. The remaining specimens were catalogued in fifty separate entries at Yale's Peabody Museum although they could have been from as few as three individuals.

Later study by Ostrom and Grant E. Meyer analyzed their own material as well as Brown's "Daptosaurus" in detail and found them to be the same species. Ostrom first published his findings in February 1969, giving all the referred remains the new name of "Deinonychus antirrhopus". The <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> ""antirrhopus"", from Greek ἀντίρροπος, means "counterbalancing" and refers to the likely purpose of a stiffened tail. In July 1969, Ostrom published a very extensive <a href="monograph">monograph</a> on "Deinonychus".

Though a myriad of bones was available by 1969, many important ones were missing or hard to interpret. There were few postorbital skull elements, no femurs, no sacrum, no furcula or sternum, missing vertebrae, and (Ostrom thought) only a tiny fragment of a coracoid. Ostrom's skeletal reconstruction of "Deinonychus" included a very unusual pelvic bone—a pubis that was trapezoidal and flat, unlike that of other theropods, but which was the same length as the ischium and which was found right next to it.

In 1974, Ostrom published another monograph on the shoulder of "Deinonychus" in which he realized that the pubis that he had described was actually a coracoid—a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of "Deinonychus", MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of "Deinonychus". This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.

A skeleton of "Deinonychus", including bones from the original (and most complete) AMNH 3015 specimen, can be seen on display at the American Museum of Natural History, with another specimen (MCZ 4371) on display at the <a href="Museum%20of%20Comparative%20Zoology">Museum of Comparative Zoology</a> at <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a>. The American Museum and Harvard specimens are from a different locality than the Yale specimens. Even these two skeletal mounts are lacking elements, including the sterna, sternal ribs, furcula, and gastralia.

Even after all Ostrom's work, several small blocks of lime-encased material remained unprepared in storage at the American Museum. These consisted mostly of isolated bones and bone fragments, including the original matrix, or surrounding rock in which the specimens were initially buried. An examination of these unprepared blocks by Gerald Grellet-Tinner and Peter Makovicky in 2000 revealed an interesting, overlooked feature. Several long, thin bones identified on the blocks as ossified tendons (structures that helped stiffen the tail of "Deinonychus") turned out to actually represent <a href="Gastralium">gastralia</a> (abdominal ribs). More significantly, a large number of previously unnoticed fossilized eggshells were discovered in the rock matrix that had surrounded the original "Deinonychus" specimen.

In a subsequent, more detailed report, on the eggshells, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky concluded that the <a href="egg">egg</a> almost certainly belonged to "Deinonychus", representing the first dromaeosaurid egg to be identified. Moreover, the external surface of one eggshell was found in close contact with the gastralia suggesting that "Deinonychus" might have <a href="Egg%20incubation">brooded</a> its eggs. This implies that "Deinonychus" used body heat transfer as a mechanism for egg incubation, and indicates an <a href="endotherm">endotherm</a>y similar to modern birds. Further study by Gregory Erickson and colleagues finds that this individual was 13 or 14 years old at death and its growth had plateaued. Unlike other theropods in their study of specimens found associated with eggs or nests, it had finished growing at the time of its death.

Ostrom's description of "Deinonychus" in 1969 has been described as the most important single discovery of dinosaur paleontology in the mid-20th century. The discovery of this clearly active, agile predator did much to change the scientific (and popular) conception of dinosaurs and opened the door to speculation that some dinosaurs may have been <a href="warm-blooded">warm-blooded</a>. This development has been termed the <a href="dinosaur%20renaissance">dinosaur renaissance</a>. Several years later, Ostrom noted similarities between the forefeet of "Deinonychus" and that of birds, an observation which led him to revive the hypothesis that birds are descended from dinosaurs. Forty years later, this idea is almost universally accepted.

Because of its extremely bird-like anatomy and close relationship to other dromaeosaurids, paleontologists hypothesize that "Deinonychus" was probably covered in feathers. Clear fossil evidence of modern avian-style feathers exists for several related dromaeosaurids, including "Velociraptor" and "Microraptor", though no direct evidence is yet known for "Deinonychus" itself. When conducting studies of such areas as the range of motion in the forelimbs, paleontologists like Phil Senter have taken the likely presence of <a href="Flight%20feather%23Remiges">wing feathers</a> (as present in all known dromaeosaurs with skin impressions) into consideration.

"Deinonychus antirrhopus" is one of the best-known <a href="Dromaeosauridae">dromaeosaurid</a> species, and is a close relative of the smaller "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>", which is found in younger, Late Cretaceous-age rock formations in Central Asia. The <a href="clade">clade</a> they form is called Velociraptorinae. The subfamily name Velociraptorinae was first coined by <a href="Rinchen%20Barsbold">Rinchen Barsbold</a> in 1983 and originally contained the single genus "Velociraptor". Later, <a href="Philip%20J.%20Currie">Phil Currie</a> included most of the dromaeosaurids. Two Late Cretaceous genera, "<a href="Tsaagan">Tsaagan</a>" from Mongolia and the North American "<a href="Saurornitholestes">Saurornitholestes</a>", may also be close relatives, but the latter is poorly known and hard to classify. "Velociraptor" and its allies are regarded as using their claws more than their skulls as killing tools, as opposed to dromaeosaurines like "<a href="Dromaeosaurus">Dromaeosaurus</a>", which have stockier skulls. <a href="Phylogenetics">Phylogenetically</a>, the dromaeosaurids represent one of the non-avialan dinosaur groups most closely related to birds. The cladogram below follows a 2015 analysis by paleontologists Robert DePalma, David Burnham, Larry Martin, Peter Larson, and Robert Bakker, using updated data from the Theropod Working Group.

"Deinonychus" teeth found in association with fossils of the <a href="ornithopod">ornithopod</a> dinosaur "Tenontosaurus" are quite common in the Cloverly Formation. Two quarries have been discovered that preserve fairly complete "Deinonychus" fossils near "Tenontosaurus" fossils. The first, the Yale quarry in the Cloverly of Montana, includes numerous teeth, four adult "Deinonychus" and one juvenile "Deinonychus". The association of this number of "Deinonychus" <a href="skeleton">skeleton</a>s in a single quarry suggests that "Deinonychus" may have fed on that animal, and perhaps hunted it. Ostrom and Maxwell have even used this information to speculate that "Deinonychus" might have lived and hunted in packs. The second such quarry is from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma. The site contains six partial skeletons of "Tenontosaurus" of various sizes, along with one partial skeleton and many teeth of "Deinonychus". One tenontosaur humerus even bears what might be "Deinonychus" tooth marks. Brinkman "et al." (1998) point out that "Deinonychus" had an adult mass of 70–100 kilograms, whereas adult tenontosaurs were 1–4 metric tons. A solitary "Deinonychus" could not kill an adult tenontosaur, suggesting that pack hunting is possible.

A 2007 study by Roach and Brinkman has called into question the cooperative pack hunting behavior of "Deinonychus", based on what is known of modern carnivore hunting and the <a href="taphonomy">taphonomy</a> of tenontosaur sites. Modern <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>s (<a href="bird">bird</a>s and <a href="crocodile">crocodile</a>s) and <a href="Komodo%20dragon">Komodo dragon</a>s typically display little cooperative hunting; instead, they are usually either solitary hunters, or are drawn to previously killed carcasses, where much conflict occurs between individuals of the same species. For example, in situations where groups of Komodo dragons are eating together, the largest individuals eat first and will attack smaller Komodos that attempt to feed; if the smaller animal is killed, it is <a href="cannibalism%20%28zoology%29">cannibalized</a>. When this information is applied to the tenontosaur sites, it appears that what is found is consistent with "Deinonychus" having a Komodo or crocodile-like feeding strategy. "Deinonychus" skeletal remains found at these sites are from subadults, with missing parts consistent with having been eaten by other "Deinonychus". On the other hand, a paper by Li "et al." describes track sites with similar foot spacing and parallel trackways, implying gregarious packing behavior instead of uncoordinated feeding behavior. It should also be noted that contrary to the claim crocodilians do not hunt cooperatively, they have actually been observed to hunt cooperatively, meaning that the notion of infighting, competition for food and cannibalism ruling out cooperative feeding may actually be a false dichotomy.

In 2011, Denver Fowler and colleagues suggested a new method by which "Deinonychus" and other dromaeosaurs may have captured and restrained prey. This model, known as the "raptor prey restraint" (RPR) model of predation, proposes that "Deinonychus" killed its prey in a manner very similar to extant <a href="Accipitridae">accipitrid</a> <a href="bird%20of%20prey">birds of prey</a>: by leaping onto its quarry, pinning it under its body weight, and gripping it tightly with the large, sickle-shaped claws. Like accipitrids, the dromaeosaur would then begin to feed on the animal while still alive, until it eventually died from blood loss and organ failure. This proposal is based primarily on comparisons between the morphology and proportions of the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs to several groups of extant birds of prey with known predatory behaviors. Fowler found that the feet and legs of dromaeosaurs most closely resemble those of <a href="eagle">eagle</a>s and <a href="hawk">hawk</a>s, especially in terms of having an enlarged second claw and a similar range of grasping motion. However, the short <a href="Tarsometatarsus">metatarsus</a> and foot strength would have been more similar to that of <a href="owl">owl</a>s. The RPR method of predation would be consistent with other aspects of "Deinonychus"'s anatomy, such as their unusual jaw and arm morphology. The arms were likely covered in long feathers, and may have been used as flapping stabilizers for balance while atop struggling prey, along with the stiff counterbalancing tail. Its jaws, thought to have had a comparatively weak bite force, might be used for saw motion bites, like the modern Komodo dragon which also has a weak bite force, to finish off its prey if its kicks were not powerful enough.

Bite force estimates for "Deinonychus" were first produced in 2005, based on reconstructed jaw musculature. This study concluded that "Deinonychus" likely had a maximum bite force only 15% that of the modern <a href="American%20alligator">American alligator</a>. A 2010 study by Paul Gignac and colleagues attempted to estimate the bite force based directly on newly discovered "Deinonychus" tooth puncture marks in the bones of a "Tenontosaurus". These puncture marks came from a large individual, and provided the first evidence that large "Deinonychus" could bite through bone. Using the tooth marks, Gignac's team were able to determine that the bite force of "Deinonychus" was significantly higher than earlier studies had estimated by biomechanical studies alone. They found the bite force of "Deinonychus" to be between 4,100 and 8,200 <a href="Newton%20%28unit%29">newtons</a>, greater than living carnivorous mammals including the <a href="hyena">hyena</a>, and equivalent to a similarly sized alligator.

Gignac and colleagues also noted, however, that bone puncture marks from "Deinonychus" are relatively rare, and unlike larger theropods with many known puncture marks like "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>", "Deinonychus" probably did not frequently bite through or eat bone. Instead, they probably used their high bite force in defense or prey capture, rather than feeding.

Despite being the most distinctive feature of "Deinonychus", the shape and curvature of the <a href="sickle">sickle</a> claw varies between specimens. The type specimen described by Ostrom in 1969 has a strongly curved sickle claw, while a newer specimen described in 1976 had a claw with much weaker curvature, more similar in profile with the 'normal' claws on the remaining toes. Ostrom suggested that this difference in the size and shape of the sickle claws could be due to individual, sexual, or age-related variation, but admitted he could not be sure.

There is anatomical and trackway evidence that this talon was held up off the ground while the dinosaur walked on the third and fourth toes.

Ostrom suggested that "Deinonychus" could kick with the sickle claw to cut and slash at its prey. Some researchers even suggested that the talon was used to disembowel large <a href="ceratopsia">ceratopsia</a>n dinosaurs. Other studies have suggested that the sickle claws were not used to slash but rather to deliver small stabs to the victim. In 2005, Manning and colleagues ran tests on a robotic replica that precisely matched the anatomy of "Deinonychus" and "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>", and used hydraulic rams to make the robot strike a pig carcass. In these tests, the talons made only shallow punctures and could not cut or slash. The authors suggested that the talons would have been more effective in climbing than in dealing killing blows.

Ostrom compared "Deinonychus" to the <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a> and <a href="cassowary">cassowary</a>. He noted that the bird species can inflict serious injury with the large claw on the second toe. The cassowary has claws up to long. Ostrom cited Gilliard (1958) in saying that they can sever an arm or disembowel a man. Kofron (1999 and 2003) studied 241 documented cassowary attacks and found that one human and two dogs had been killed, but no evidence that cassowaries can disembowel or dismember other animals. Cassowaries use their claws to defend themselves, to attack threatening animals, and in agonistic displays such as the Bowed Threat Display. The <a href="seriema">seriema</a> also has an enlarged second toe claw, and uses it to tear apart small prey items for swallowing. In 2011, a study suggested that the sickle claw would likely have been used to pin down prey while biting it, rather than as a slashing weapon.

Biomechanical studies by <a href="Kenneth%20Carpenter">Ken Carpenter</a> in 2002 confirmed that the most likely function of the forelimbs in predation was grasping, as their great lengths would have permitted longer reach than for most other theropods. The rather large and elongated <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>, indicating powerful muscles in the forelimbs, further strengthened this interpretation. Carpenter's biomechanical studies using bone casts also showed that "Deinonychus" could not fold its arms against its body like a bird ("avian folding"), contrary to what was inferred from the earlier 1985 descriptions by <a href="Jacques%20Gauthier">Jacques Gauthier</a> and <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> in 1988.

Studies by Phil Senter in 2006 indicated that "Deinonychus" forelimbs could be used not only for grasping, but also for clutching objects towards the chest. If "Deinonychus" had feathered fingers and wings, the feathers would have limited the range of motion of the forelimbs to some degree. For example, when "Deinonychus" extended its arm forward, the 'palm' of the hand automatically rotated to an upward-facing position. This would have caused one wing to block the other if both forelimbs were extended at the same time, leading Senter to conclude that clutching objects to the chest would have only been accomplished with one arm at a time. The function of the fingers would also have been limited by feathers; for example, only the third digit of the hand could have been employed in activities such as probing crevices for small prey items, and only in a position perpendicular to the main wing. Alan Gishlick, in a 2001 study of "Deinonychus" forelimb mechanics, found that even if large wing feathers were present, the grasping ability of the hand would not have been significantly hindered; rather, grasping would have been accomplished perpendicular to the wing, and objects likely would have been held by both hands simultaneously in a "bear hug" fashion, findings which have been supported by the later forelimb studies by Carpenter and Senter. In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 43 hand bones and 52 foot bones referred to "Deinonychus" were examined for signs of <a href="stress%20fracture">stress fracture</a>; none were found. The second phalanx of the second toe in the specimen YPM 5205 has a healed fracture.

Parsons and Parsons have shown that juvenile and sub-adult specimens of "Deinonychus" display some morphological differences from the adults. For instance, the arms of the younger specimens were proportionally longer than those of the adults, a possible indication of difference in behavior between young and adults. Another example of this could be the function of the pedal claws. Parsons and Parsons have suggested that the claw curvature (which Ostrom [1976] had already shown was different between specimens) maybe was greater for juvenile "Deinonychus", as this could help it climb in trees, and that the claws became straighter as the animal became older and started to live solely on the ground. This was based on the hypothesis that some small dromaeosaurids used their pedal claws for climbing. In a 2015 paper, they reported after further analysis of immature fossils that the open and mobile nature of the shoulder joint might have meant that young "Deinonychus" were capable of some form of flight.

Dromaeosaurids, especially "Deinonychus", are often depicted as unusually fast-running animals in the popular media, and Ostrom himself speculated that "Deinonychus" was fleet-footed in his original description. However, when first described, a complete leg of "Deinonychus" had not been found, and Ostrom's speculation about the length of the <a href="femur">femur</a> (upper leg bone) later proved to have been an overestimate. In a later study, Ostrom noted that the <a href="ratio">ratio</a> of the femur to the <a href="tibia">tibia</a> (lower leg bone) is not as important in determining speed as the relative length of the foot and lower leg. In modern fleet-footed birds, like the <a href="ostrich">ostrich</a>, the foot-tibia ratio is .95. In unusually fast-running dinosaurs, like "<a href="Struthiomimus">Struthiomimus</a>", the ratio is .68, but in "Deinonychus" the ratio is .48. Ostrom stated that the "only reasonable conclusion" is that "Deinonychus", while far from slow-moving, was not particularly fast compared to other dinosaurs, and certainly not as fast as modern flightless birds.

The low foot to lower leg ratio in "Deinonychus" is due partly to an unusually short <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a> (upper foot bones). The ratio is actually larger in smaller individuals than in larger ones. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus may be related to the function of the sickle claw, and used the fact that it appears to get shorter as individuals aged as support for this. He interpreted all these features—the short second toe with enlarged claw, short metatarsus, etc.—as support for the use of the hind leg as an offensive weapon, where the sickle claw would strike downwards and backwards, and the leg pulled back and down at the same time, slashing and tearing at the prey. Ostrom suggested that the short metatarsus reduced overall stress on the leg bones during such an attack, and interpreted the unusual arrangement of muscle attachments in the "Deinonychus" leg as support for his idea that a different set of muscles was used in the predatory stroke than in walking or running. Therefore, Ostrom concluded that the legs of "Deinonychus" represented a balance between running adaptations needed for an agile predator, and stress-reducing features to compensate for its unique foot weapon.

In his 1981 study of Canadian dinosaur footprints, Richard Kool produced rough walking speed estimates based on several trackways made by different species in the <a href="Gething%20Formation">Gething Formation</a> of <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>. Kool estimated one of these trackways, representing the <a href="Ichnotaxon">ichnospecies</a> "Irenichnites gracilis" (which may have been made by "Deinonychus"), to have a walking speed of 10.1 kilometers per hour (6 miles per hour).

The identification, in 2000, of a probable "Deinonychus" egg associated with one of the original specimens allowed comparison with other theropod dinosaurs in terms of egg structure, nesting, and reproduction. In their 2006 examination of the specimen, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky examined the possibility that the dromaeosaurid had been feeding on the egg, or that the egg fragments had been associated with the "Deinonychus" skeleton by coincidence. They dismissed the idea that the egg had been a meal for the theropod, noting that the fragments were sandwiched between the belly ribs and forelimb bones, making it impossible that they represented contents of the animal's stomach. In addition, the manner in which the egg had been crushed and fragmented indicated that it had been intact at the time of burial, and was broken by the fossilization process. The idea that the egg was randomly associated with the dinosaur was also found to be unlikely; the bones surrounding the egg had not been scattered or disarticulated, but remained fairly intact relative to their positions in life, indicating that the area around and including the egg was not disturbed during preservation. The fact that these bones were belly ribs (<a href="gastralium">gastralia</a>), which are very rarely found articulated, supported this interpretation. All the evidence, according to Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky, indicates that the egg was intact beneath the body of the "Deinonychus" when it was buried. It is possible that this represents brooding or nesting behavior in "Deinonychus" similar to that seen in the related <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a>s and <a href="oviraptorid">oviraptorid</a>s, or that the egg was in fact inside the <a href="oviduct">oviduct</a> when the animal died.

Examination of the "Deinonychus" egg's microstructure confirms that it belonged to a theropod, since it shares characteristics with other known theropod eggs and shows dissimilarities with <a href="ornithischia">ornithischia</a>n and <a href="sauropod">sauropod</a> eggs. Compared to other <a href="maniraptora">maniraptora</a>n theropods, the egg of "Deinonychus" is more similar to those of <a href="oviraptorid">oviraptorid</a>s than to those of <a href="troodontid">troodontid</a>s, despite studies that show the latter are more closely related to dromaeosaurids like "Deinonychus". While the egg was too badly crushed to accurately determine its size, Grellet-Tinner and Makovicky estimated a diameter of about 7 cm (2.7 in) based on the width of the pelvic canal through which the egg had to have passed. This size is similar to the 7.2 cm diameter of the largest "<a href="Citipati%20%28dinosaur%29">Citipati</a>" (an oviraptorid) eggs; "Citipati" and "Deinonychus" also shared the same overall body size, supporting this estimate. Additionally, the thicknesses of "Citipati" and "Deinonychus" eggshells are almost identical, and since shell thickness correlates with egg volume, this further supports the idea that the eggs of these two animals were about the same size.

A study published in November, 2018 by Norell, Yang and Wiemann "et al.," indicates that "Deinonychus" laid blue eggs, likely to camouflage them as well as creating open nests. The study also indicates that "Deinonychus" and other dinosaurs that created open nests likely represent an origin of color in modern bird eggs as an adaptation both for recognition and camouflage against predators.

Geological evidence suggests that "Deinonychus" inhabited a <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a> or <a href="swamp">swamp</a>like habitat. The paleoenvironment of both the upper Cloverly Formation and the <a href="Antlers%20Formation">Antlers Formation</a>, in which remains of "Deinonychus" have been found, consisted of tropical or sub-tropical forests, <a href="River%20delta">deltas</a> and lagoons, not unlike today's <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a>.
Other animals "Deinonychus" shared its world with include herbivorous dinosaurs such as the armored "<a href="Sauropelta">Sauropelta</a>" and the ornithopods "<a href="Zephyrosaurus">Zephyrosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Tenontosaurus">Tenontosaurus</a>". In Oklahoma, the ecosystem of "Deinonychus" also included the large theropod "<a href="Acrocanthosaurus">Acrocanthosaurus</a>", the huge sauropod "<a href="Sauroposeidon">Sauroposeidon</a>", the crocodilians "<a href="Goniopholis">Goniopholis</a>" and "<a href="Paluxysuchus">Paluxysuchus</a>", and the <a href="gar">gar</a> "<a href="Lepisosteus">Lepisosteus</a>". If the teeth found in Maryland are those of "Deinonychus", then its neighbors would include "<a href="Astrodon">Astrodon</a>" and a nodosaur (called "<a href="Priconodon">Priconodon</a>") only known from teeth. The middle portion of the Cloverly Formation ranges in age from 115 ± 10 Ma near the base to 108.5 ± 0.2 Ma near the top.

"Deinonychus" were featured prominently in both the 1990 and 1995 novels "<a href="Jurassic%20Park%20%28novel%29">Jurassic Park</a>" and "<a href="The%20Lost%20World%20%28Crichton%20novel%29">The Lost World</a>" by <a href="Michael%20Crichton">Michael Crichton</a> and the <a href="Jurassic%20Park">film adaptations</a>, directed by <a href="Steven%20Spielberg">Steven Spielberg</a>. However, Crichton ultimately chose to use the name "<a href="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a>" for these dinosaurs, rather than "Deinonychus". Crichton had met with <a href="John%20Ostrom">John Ostrom</a> several times during the writing process to discuss details of the possible range of behaviors and life appearance of "Deinonychus". Crichton at one point apologetically told Ostrom that he had decided to use the name "Velociraptor" in place of "Deinonychus" for his book, because he felt the former name was "more dramatic". Despite this, according to Ostrom, Crichton stated that the "Velociraptor" of the novel was based on "Deinonychus" in almost every detail, and that only the name had been changed. The "Jurassic Park" filmmakers followed suit, designing the film's models based almost entirely on "Deinonychus" instead of the actual "Velociraptor", and they reportedly requested all of Ostrom's published papers on "Deinonychus" during production. As a result, they portrayed the film's dinosaurs with the size, proportions, and snout shape of "Deinonychus".
