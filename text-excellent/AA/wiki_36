Jack Hobbs

Sir John Berry Hobbs (16 December 1882 – 21 December 1963), always known as Jack Hobbs, was an English <a href="Professional%20sports">professional</a> <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played for <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> from 1905 to 1934 and for <a href="England%20national%20cricket%20team">England</a> in 61 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> between 1908 and 1930. 

Known as "The Master", he is universally regarded by experts as one of the greatest batsmen in the entire history of cricket. He is the leading run-scorer and <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>-maker in <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a>, with 61,760 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> and 199 centuries. A right-handed batsman and an occasional right-arm medium pace <a href="bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowler</a>, Hobbs also excelled as a fielder, particularly in the position of <a href="cover%20point">cover point</a>.

Born into poverty in 1882, Hobbs wished from an early age to pursue a career in cricket. His early batting was undistinguished, but a sudden improvement in 1901 brought him to the attention of local teams. In 1903 he successfully applied to join Surrey, with the support of England batsman <a href="Tom%20Hayward">Tom Hayward</a>. His reputation grew and when he qualified to play for Surrey, he scored 88 on his first-class debut and a century in his next game. Over the following seasons, he established himself as a successful county player and in 1908 made his Test debut for England, scoring 83 in his first innings. After some mixed early performances for England, Hobbs' success against <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South African</a> <a href="googly">googly</a> bowlers made his place secure, and by 1911–12, when he scored three centuries in the Test series against <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australia</a>, critics judged him the world's best batsman. In county cricket, he developed an attacking, dynamic style of play and was very successful up until 1914. After serving in the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> during the First World War, he maintained his reputation when cricket resumed in 1919, but his career was threatened by <a href="appendicitis">appendicitis</a>, which caused him to miss most of the 1921 season. When he returned, he was a more cautious batsman and used a safer style of play. Subsequently, he became more consistent and scored prolifically in both Test and domestic cricket until his retirement. In this period, he played some of his most acclaimed innings.

Hobbs' success was based on fast footwork, technical ability to play many different shots well, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen%20or%20openers">opening batsman</a>, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and <a href="Andy%20Sandham">Andy Sandham</a> for Surrey and with <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a> and <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a> for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket, in terms of average partnership, in Test history. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.

Hobbs was very close to Ada, his wife of 56 years; the pair were able to live comfortably in later life through Hobbs' substantial wage from Surrey, his commercial endorsements, and the proceeds of the sporting goods shop he opened in 1921 and ran for the rest of his life. After his cricketing retirement, he also worked in journalism. <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Knighthood">Knighted</a> in 1953, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured, he spent his later years nursing his wife. He died, aged 81, a few months after her in 1963.

Hobbs was born in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> on 16 December 1882, the first of 12 children to John Cooper Hobbs, a <a href="slater">slater</a>, and his wife Flora Matilda Berry. Hobbs was raised in a poor, run-down area of the city, and he spent most of his childhood in near-poverty. Hobbs senior, a lover of cricket, changed his career to become a professional cricketer, and in 1889 was appointed <a href="groundsman">groundsman</a> and umpire at <a href="Jesus%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Jesus College</a>.

From an early age, Hobbs played cricket whenever he could. His first games were played in the streets near his house. He was educated at a <a href="St%20Matthew%27s%20Primary%20School">primary school</a> affiliated with his local <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> church, St Matthew's, and moved in 1891 to York Street Boys' School, a fee-paying establishment; Hobbs later admitted to being a poor scholar but was successful at sports. He played cricket regularly for the St Matthew's choir team and the York Street school team, and during holidays helped his father at Jesus College. In his final year at York Street, to supplement the family budget, Hobbs took a job working before school hours in the domestic service of a private house. On leaving school in 1895, he worked as an <a href="Courier">errand boy</a> until his father's connections at the university secured him a summer job as a college servant, chiefly assisting the cricket team. Aged 16, Hobbs became an apprentice gas fitter, and practised cricket on <a href="Parker%27s%20Piece">Parker's Piece</a>, an open area of common land in Cambridge, in his spare time. He played for various local clubs but did not initially stand out as a cricketer: although better than most other Cambridge batsmen, no coaches or major teams approached him, and his batting gave little indication of the success which came later.

Hobbs' breakthrough came in 1901. His batting improved throughout the season, during which he scored 102 for Ainsworth against the Cambridge Liberals, his first <a href="Century%20%28cricket%29">century</a>. At the end of the season, he was included in a Cambridge XI, a team chosen from the best local cricketers, to play a prestigious match against a team of professional cricketers brought by the Cambridge-born <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> cricketer <a href="Tom%20Hayward">Tom Hayward</a>. Hobbs' overall record was unremarkable, but at the end of the season he was invited to play as an <a href="Amateur%20status%20in%20first-class%20cricket">amateur</a> for <a href="Cambridgeshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridgeshire</a>; he achieved little in his appearances.

Early in 1902, Hobbs was appointed as assistant to the professional cricket coach at <a href="Bedford%20School">Bedford School</a>, working as a groundsman and bowling in the nets. In late August, he returned to Cambridge to play as a professional for the first time. For a fee of ten <a href="Shilling%20%28British%20coin%29">shillings</a>, Hobbs appeared for a team from the nearby town of <a href="Royston%2C%20Hertfordshire">Royston</a> against <a href="Hertfordshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hertfordshire</a> Club and Ground and scored 119 runs. His success delighted his family and made him a local celebrity. Hobbs' father, who had helped to arrange his appearance in the match, died from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> a week later. Despite local fund-raising efforts for the bereaved family, Hobbs senior's death left his wife and children facing great financial hardship. Francis Hutt, a former friend and colleague of the father, contacted <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex County Cricket Club</a> to request a trial for Hobbs. That county never replied—Hobbs later scored his maiden first-class century against them—but Hutt was more successful when he asked Hayward to look at Hobbs with a view to recommending him to Surrey. Consequently, in late 1902, Hobbs batted on Parker's Piece against Hayward and <a href="Bill%20Reeves">Bill Reeves</a>, an Essex cricketer born in Cambridge, impressing Hayward in the process. In the winter of 1902–03 Hobbs assumed his father's duties as groundsman at Jesus College.

Hobbs was summoned to Surrey for a trial in April 1903, and subsequently offered a contract with the ground staff at <a href="the%20Oval">the Oval</a> on a basic wage during the season of 30 shillings a week. Hobbs could not immediately play for Surrey owing to the qualification rules in place at the time for the <a href="County%20Championship">County Championship</a>—a player had to be born in a county or to have lived there for two years in order to represent it. To achieve qualification, he moved to the Surrey area of London. Around this time he played <a href="Association%20football">football</a> for local teams as a <a href="Forward%20%28association%20football%29">forward</a> with some success, but struggled financially during the winter months and found it hard to find employment.

While qualifying, Hobbs played for Surrey's Colts side and for the Club and Ground Eleven, both of which were teams for young cricketers. Although he made some substantial scores, according to his biographer, <a href="Leo%20McKinstry">Leo McKinstry</a>, "just as he had done for much of his early life, [Hobbs] performed satisfactorily without doing anything startling". In the 1903 season he scored 480 runs at an <a href="Batting%20average%23Cricket">average</a> of 34.29, as well as taking 19 wickets as his bowling improved. The following season, Hobbs played only for the Club and Ground, increased his average to 43.90, and impressed people connected with the Surrey county side. His sudden improvement brought about a temporary return to the Cambridgeshire team, for which he remained qualified by birth. His batting was praised, particularly when he scored 195 and 129 in two matches against Hertfordshire. In total, he scored 696 runs in 13 innings for Cambridgeshire, averaging 58.00.

By the start of the 1905 season, Hobbs had qualified for Surrey and was already being noted as a player of promise. At the time, Surrey needed an <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opening batsman</a> to partner Tom Hayward. Although Hobbs had rarely opened the batting, he was selected as Hayward's opening partner for Surrey's first game of the season. He made his debut on 24 April 1905 against a team representing the "Gentlemen of England"; after scoring 18 runs in the first innings, he scored a rapid 88 in the second before rain ensured the match was drawn. The Surrey team and committee were impressed, and Hobbs retained his place for the club's opening County Championship match against Essex. When he scored 155 runs in around three hours during Surrey's second innings, the Surrey captain <a href="Harry%20Primrose%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Rosebery">Lord Dalmeny</a> awarded Hobbs his <a href="Cap%20%28sport%29%23Cricket">County Cap</a>. Over the following weeks, Hobbs scored consistently, hitting another century against Essex and 94 runs against the touring Australian cricket team. But a combination of fatigue from continuous cricket and the pressure of first-class cricket adversely affected his form, and he struggled for the remainder of the season even as the county tried various measures to help him. In first-class cricket that season, Hobbs scored 1,317 runs at an average of 25.82, including two centuries and four other scores over fifty, to finish ninth in the Surrey batting averages. As an occasional <a href="Fast%20bowling%23Categorisation%20of%20fast%20bowling">medium-paced</a> bowler, he took six wickets. Reviewing Surrey's season, "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" singled Hobbs out for attention, praising his early-season form; it suggested that he was the best professional batsman Surrey had found for a long time. "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" noted that, while performing well, Hobbs had fallen short of the standards suggested by his start.

After a winter of practice, Hobbs displayed greater consistency in 1906. Displaying a wider range of shots, he scored four centuries, including another against Essex, and established an effective <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Opening%20batsmen">opening partnership</a> with Hayward. Between his debut and Hayward's retirement in 1914, the pair shared 40 opening partnerships in excess of 100 runs. Hobbs was generally the junior partner, and was overawed by Hayward, to the extent that he did not feel confident enough to invite him to his wedding. Hayward influenced Hobbs' mental approach, particularly his running between the wickets, but the pair were dissimilar in style. In all first-class cricket in 1906, Hobbs scored 1,913 runs at an average of 40.70 with a highest score of 162, placing him second in the Surrey averages. "Wisden" praised his improved fielding and commented that he was "one of the best professional bats of the year". Hobbs made further advances in 1907. Unusually frequent rain during the season—"Wisden" described the season as the wettest ever—meant that pitches often favoured bowlers. After a poor start, Hobbs successfully adapted to the conditions, and scored consistently well. In June, he and Hayward shared four century opening partnerships in one week. Hobbs scored four centuries in total and by the end of the season had scored 2,135 runs, averaging 37.45. He was one of only three men to pass 2,000 runs; he was second to Hayward in the Surrey averages, and eighth nationally. His performances brought him to the attention of the <a href="Marylebone%20Cricket%20Club">Marylebone Cricket Club</a> (MCC) selectors, and he was chosen for the Players in the prestigious <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Gentlemen v Players</a> matches in July, although he scored few runs in either game.

Hobbs was selected to tour Australia in the 1907–08 season with an MCC team, given his opportunity by the unavailability of several leading players. Throughout the outward voyage, Hobbs was severely affected by sea-sickness, a condition which afflicted him on sea voyages throughout his life; in later tours, he travelled overland as far as possible to reduce his time on ships. Consequently, he missed the first two games of the tour against the Australian state teams. His appearances were further limited by the reluctance of the MCC captain, <a href="Arthur%20Jones%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Jones</a>, to select him. He played in only two of the early matches, failing on both occasions, and was left out of the team for the first Test match. After England lost the game, Hobbs was chosen for the second Test. Hobbs made his Test debut on 1 January 1908 at <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>. Opening the England batting on the second day, Hobbs scored 83 runs in 182 minutes. Eventually, England needed 282 to win and did so by one wicket; Hobbs scored 28. He retained his place for the rest of the series. In the fourth match, he scored 57 on a pitch badly affected by rain; by adopting a policy of attacking the bowling he hit ten <a href="Boundary%20%28cricket%29">fours</a>. He concluded his series with an innings of 72 in the final game, but could not prevent a third successive English defeat—the home side won the five-match series 4–1. He scored 302 runs in the Tests at an average of 43.14. In other first-class matches, he scored centuries against <a href="Tasmania%20cricket%20team">Tasmania</a> and <a href="Victoria%20cricket%20team">Victoria</a>, totalling 876 runs at 41.71.

Hobbs scored fewer runs in 1908, despite better conditions for batting. Even so, he scored 81 in the Gentlemen v Players game, achieved a batting average over 40 in the County Championship and scored six centuries for Surrey. In all first-class games, Hobbs scored 1,904 runs at 37.33. For his achievements that season, Hobbs was chosen as one of "Wisden's" <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>. The citation noted that "at the present time there is perhaps no better professional batsman in England except Hayward and <a href="Johnny%20Tyldesley">Tyldesley</a>".

Hobbs began the 1909 season with a succession of large scores, including a double century in one match and two separate centuries in another. Such form placed him in contention for a place in the England team to play Australia that year, despite the English batting strength. But the England captain, <a href="Archie%20MacLaren">Archie MacLaren</a>, was unconvinced that Hobbs possessed the required quality. The Surrey captain and England selector <a href="H.%20D.%20G.%20Leveson%20Gower">H. D. G. Leveson Gower</a> persuaded the committee to include Hobbs in the squad, then convinced a reluctant MacLaren to play him in the team. In the first Test, played at <a href="Edgbaston%20Cricket%20Ground">Edgbaston</a>, Hobbs opened the batting with MacLaren but was dismissed from the first ball he received. The match was a low-scoring one, and Australia set England 105 runs to win. Hobbs, this time opening the batting with <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a>, hit 62 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> and England passed the target without losing a wicket. England lost the next two matches, and Hobbs was unsuccessful, with a top-score of 30 in four innings. A badly injured finger meant that he missed the remainder of the Test series; in three games, he scored 132 runs at an average of 26.40. England lost the series when the remaining two matches were drawn. Hobbs struggled to regain his form when he recovered; he averaged 40.65 for the season, but of the 2,114 first-class runs he scored, nearly half came in the first month of the season.

Hobbs accepted an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. The cricketing conditions were challenging: matches were played on matting pitches, unfamiliar to English players, and the South African <a href="googly">googly</a> bowlers had previously troubled most leading English batsmen, provoking debate over how batsmen could combat the new delivery. The MCC captain, Leveson Gower, selected <a href="Wilfred%20Rhodes">Wilfred Rhodes</a> to open the batting with Hobbs for the first Test. Rhodes, a defensively-minded batsman who excelled at taking quick singles, had begun his career as a bowler who batted down the <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">order</a>. He steadily improved his batting, eventually becoming an opening batsman. Hobbs and Rhodes, between 1910 and 1921, opened the batting 36 times for England and shared eight century partnerships; their average of 61.31 runs per opening partnership remains the second highest in Test history. In other first-class cricket, they shared a further five century opening partnerships. Their association was notable for effective running; the pair developed such an unusually good understanding that they were able to run without calling to each other. They scored <a href="Single%20%28cricket%29">singles</a> by pushing the ball just past nearby fielders and running quickly. Critics believed that they raised the art of running to a new level.

This tactic developed from the first day that Hobbs and Rhodes batted together in the first Test; they added 159 runs for the first wicket. Hobbs scored 89 in the first innings and 35 in the second, and while England lost narrowly, he appeared much more comfortable than the other English batsmen against the googly. Hobbs and Rhodes shared a partnership of 207 in the tour match following the Test, in which Hobbs scored 163. England also lost the second Test, but Hobbs scored 53 and 70, sharing two substantial opening partnerships with Rhodes. The failure of the other batsmen, defeated by the googly bowlers, caused consternation in the English press. As England had few effective pace bowlers on the tour, Hobbs opened the bowling in the first two Tests, as well as the batting. In the third Test, he scored 93 not out to guide England to a three-wicket victory. However, the series was lost when England were defeated in the fourth match; Hobbs scored 0 and 1, the only time in his Test career that he failed to reach double figures in either innings, and his worst match return in first-class cricket. In the final game of the series, he scored his first Test hundred, opening the batting and sharing a partnership of 221 with Rhodes which was a record at the time for the first wicket in Test matches. Hobbs scored 187, an innings praised by "Wisden" for its "brilliancy". In this match he once more opened the bowling, dismissing <a href="Reggie%20Schwarz">Reggie Schwarz</a>, his only Test wicket. England won the match by nine wickets and the series finished 3–2 against them. Hobbs scored 1,124 first-class runs at an average of 66.11 on the tour, while in the Test matches, he scored 539 runs at 67.37. None of the other English batsmen came close to matching his success against the googly, and by the end of the series, critics were beginning to describe him as the world's leading batsman. "Wisden" commented: "Beyond everything else from the English point of view the feature of the trip was the superb batting of Hobbs, who easily adapted himself to the matting wickets and scored from the famous googly bowlers with amazing skill and facility. When they came home the other members of the team could not say too much in his praise."

Fatigue from the South African tour affected Hobbs in 1910. He scored 1,982 runs at an average of 33.03, the lowest average of his career apart from his first season. More effective during 1911, after a long rest during the winter, Hobbs was consistently successful in a hot, dry summer which produced good batting pitches. He played few large innings, but was very effective in high-pressure games, and scored 2,376 runs at 41.68. Bowling more frequently than in other seasons, Hobbs took 28 first-class wickets. Against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>, Hobbs bowled throughout the second innings to take seven wickets for 56 runs, the best figures of his career.

Hobbs was an automatic selection for the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201911%E2%80%9312">MCC tour of Australia</a> in the winter of 1911–12. During the first Test, which Australia won by 146 runs, Hobbs scored 63 in the first innings, although by his own admission he did not play well. Rhodes was in the team, but did not open the batting owing to his poor form; Hobbs opened with <a href="Septimus%20Kinneir">Septimus Kinneir</a>. England recovered to win the second Test; after bowling Australia out for 184 and taking a first-innings lead of 81, the visiting team eventually faced a target of 219 to win. Hobbs and Rhodes, restored to the opening position, began with a partnership of 57. Hobbs scored 126 not out, his first century against Australia, and scored particularly well from the bowling of <a href="Ranji%20Hordern">H. V. "Ranji" Hordern</a>, a googly bowler who had taken 12 wickets in the first Test. "Wisden" commented that Hobbs "played one of the finest innings of his life", and England won by eight wickets. Australia were once more bowled out for a low score in the third Test; this time Hobbs and Rhodes added 147 for the first wicket and Hobbs scored 187. England reached a total of 501 and won the match by seven wickets.
Having established a lead in the series, England began the fourth Test by bowling Australia out for 191. At the end of the first day, Hobbs and Rhodes had scored 54 together, and the next day they took their partnership for the first wicket to 323, setting a new record for the highest partnership for any wicket in Test matches. Their partnership remained an overall Test record for 22 years and the highest for the first wicket until 1948. As of 2016, this remains England's highest opening partnership against Australia. The pair scored easily from the bowling but faced criticism for slow batting. Even so, Hobbs reached a century in 133 minutes and proceeded to play more aggressively afterwards. He was finally dismissed for 178. England reached a total of 589 and bowled Australia out for 173 to win the match by an innings and regain <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a>. England also won the final Test to take the series 4–1; Hobbs scored 32 and 45, sharing a partnership of 76 with Rhodes in the second innings. Hobbs ended the series with an aggregate of 662 runs at an average of 82.75, setting a new record number of runs for an individual batsman in a Test series. His average was far greater than any other batsman on either team, and the tour established him as the world's best batsman. In addition, he <a href="Run%20out">ran out</a> 15 batsmen while fielding at <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">cover point</a>. The Australians did not dare run when he fielded the ball for fear of the speed of his throw. In all first-class matches, Hobbs scored 943 runs at 55.47.

The 1912 season was unusually wet, which resulted in some very difficult pitches for batting. "Wisden" remarked that Hobbs did not bat particularly well for Surrey. The press criticised him for trying to score too quickly and losing his wicket in the process. During the summer, both Australia and South Africa toured England, taking part in the <a href="1912%20Triangular%20Tournament">Triangular Tournament</a>. Hobbs made a slow start to the competition when he was bowled in the first over in England's opening match, and his form was uncertain in the early part of the season. However, he scored a century against Australia at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a> on a very difficult batting pitch in England's second game, sharing a partnership of 112 with Rhodes. He continued with scores of 55 and 68 in the next two games against South Africa, and his batting was praised by the press; for the first time, in the "Times", he was referred to as "a great master". South Africa were defeated in five of their six games (the other was drawn). As the first two games between England and Australia were drawn, the final match was designated as the deciding match for the tournament. Hobbs and Rhodes opened with 107, and Hobbs scored 66. These runs were crucial and England won the game by 244 runs. Hobbs had the best batting average for the summer from all three teams; he averaged 40.75 against South Africa and 56.00 against Australia. In all first-class cricket his aggregate was 2,042 runs at 37.81.

In 1913, batting in a more controlled fashion, Hobbs scored 2,605 runs at an average of 50.09, placing him second in the national averages. He continued to score quickly, twice scoring 100 runs before lunch on the first day of a match; against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>, he and Hayward shared an opening partnership of 313 in 190 minutes. In the winter of 1913–14, the MCC sent a strong team to South Africa. The opposition team lacked effective players, and England won the five-Test series 4–0, mainly as a result of the bowling of <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a>. Hobbs scored 443 runs at an average of 63.28 in the series; he did not score a century, but accumulated scores of 82, 92 and 97, while he and Rhodes shared two century opening partnerships and another of 92. Hobbs adopted a cautious approach, and "Wisden" noted that he was "not quite so brilliant as in England" but said that he was "an absolute master on matting wickets [pitches]." In all first-class matches, he scored 1,489 runs at 74.45.

After a slow start to the 1914 season, Hobbs recorded a string of centuries, including a score of 226, his highest at that time. The looming First World War overshadowed much of the season. Cricket initially continued once the war began, but as the Oval had been requisitioned by the military, Hobbs' <a href="Benefit%20%28sports%29">benefit match</a> was moved from the Oval to Lord's. This move, and the public's preoccupation with the war, consigned the game to a financial failure; in total Hobbs' benefit raised £657, lower than most benefits and far less than usually raised for cricketers of Hobbs' standing. The Surrey committee agreed to give him another benefit when the war concluded. Hobbs scored his 11th century of the season before public pressure terminated the cricket season. During the winter, the MCC declared Surrey as County Champions; although the war prevented the completion of all the matches, Surrey led comfortably enough for the other counties not to object. This was the only time in Hobbs' career that Surrey were champions. In all first-class games in 1914, he scored 2,697 runs at 58.63. As the war began, Hobbs reputation was at its peak; he was described by "Wisden" as "one of the greatest bats of his generation". McKinstry states that during the season: "With his free-scoring method, [Hobbs] had dazzled in a way that he was never to do again."

Unlike many other cricketers, Hobbs did not immediately join the army, but worked in a munitions factory, possibly as a clerk. Writing later, Hobbs related that he was criticised for not joining up, but suggested he did not realise how serious the war would be, and was conscious of the need to care for his family. From March 1915 he found extra work as coach at <a href="Westminster%20School">Westminster School</a>, and in May began to play on Saturdays as a professional for <a href="Idle%2C%20West%20Yorkshire">Idle</a> in the <a href="Bradford%20Cricket%20League">Bradford Cricket League</a>. The continuation of competitive cricket in Bradford, when all other such cricket had ceased, was controversial. Several clubs hired top-class professionals and matches became very popular. Although his arrival was eagerly anticipated, Hobbs never reached the expected heights, averaging 36.63 throughout the 1915 season. But his signing provoked an angry exchange of correspondence between the <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> president <a href="Martin%20Hawke%2C%207th%20Baron%20Hawke">Lord Hawke</a>, who was highly critical of the employment of professionals, and John Booth, the president of the Bradford League. Hobbs never publicly commented on the matter, but was instrumental in recruiting <a href="Frank%20Woolley">Frank Woolley</a> to play in the league. He continued to play for Idle in 1916, and was more successful, scoring 790 runs at 52.60 and taking 65 wickets at 6.27. But his <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23World%20War%20I">conscription</a> after the season into the <a href="Royal%20Flying%20Corps">Royal Flying Corps</a> ended his regular cricket in the league.

Hobbs joined the Corps in October 1916 as an <a href="Aircraftman">air mechanic</a> and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; at first he had time to appear in charity cricket matches and in several games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined <a href="No.%20110%20Squadron%20RAF">110 Squadron</a> which remained in England despite plans to send it to France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.

When first-class cricket resumed in 1919, Surrey awarded Hobbs a five-year contract worth £400 a year. During the season, he began to open the batting with <a href="Andy%20Sandham">Andy Sandham</a>, who succeeded to Hayward's position as Hobbs' partner; in the following years, the pair established an effective partnership. In total, they shared 66 century opening partnerships and averaged over 50 for the first wicket. Like Hobbs' other successful partnerships, this one was based on quick running. Sandham, even when successful, was often overshadowed by his partner; on one occasion, Sandham scored a century but the headlines were reserved for Hobbs' <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a>. Sandham usually played the subordinate role and Hobbs took most of the bowling.

Hobbs made a good start to the 1919 season and, despite a brief spell of failure through over-aggression, batted consistently. He scored a double century for Surrey against a touring <a href="Australian%20Imperial%20Forces%20cricket%20team">Australian Imperial Forces cricket team</a> and centuries in each of the three Gentlemen v Players matches—the only player ever to do so in one season. His rescheduled benefit match raised £1,670, money he used to open a sports shop in London. The shop was successful and he ran it until just before his death. The additional income gave him considerable financial independence. In total that year, Hobbs scored 2,594 runs in first-class matches, more than anyone else, at an average of 60.32. After a winter working in his shop, his good form continued into 1920. Four of his eleven first-class centuries came in consecutive innings in June, and he totalled 2,827 runs at 58.89. He also took five wickets for 21 runs against Warwickshire, and his 17 wickets at an average of 11.82 placed him at the top of the Surrey bowling averages.

Hobbs toured Australia with the MCC during the 1920–21 season, under the captaincy of <a href="Johnny%20Douglas">J. W. H. T. Douglas</a>, when Australia won every match of the five-Test series. He was one of the few English successes. He scored two centuries in the opening three first-class games, and in the first Test top-scored in both England innings with 49 and 59. In the second Test, he scored 122 on a difficult pitch which had been affected by rain. "Wisden" commented that this was "from the English point of view, the finest innings of the tour". He also scored a century in defeat in the third Test, hitting 123 in the final innings as England failed to score 489 to win the game. He did not pass 50 again in the series; after a failure on the fourth Test, he tore a thigh muscle batting in a game before the final Test. Persuaded by Douglas to play anyway, he scored 40 and 34 but struggled to field effectively. One unsuccessful attempt to chase the ball caused some of the crowd to jeer him, which led to controversy when two amateur members of the team, <a href="Percy%20Fender">Percy Fender</a> and <a href="Rockley%20Wilson">Rockley Wilson</a>, wrote scathingly about the incident. Hobbs scored a total of 924 first-class runs on the tour, at an average of 51.33; in Test matches, he scored 505 runs at 50.50. Although he and Rhodes resumed their opening partnership, apart from in the first Test, when <a href="C.%20A.%20G.%20Russell">C. A. G. Russell</a> partnered Hobbs, they could not replicate their former successes, and shared only one stand worth more than fifty.

Hobbs played just five first-class matches in 1921, when Australia toured England. In his opening first-class game, he played against the touring team, but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia. He missed the opening two Tests, but once recovered, scored a century for Surrey; as England trailed 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose him for the third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. On the first day of the match, he had to leave the field, and after a day of rest the pain worsened. He consulted <a href="Berkeley%20Moynihan%2C%201st%20Baron%20Moynihan">Sir Berkley Moynihan</a>, a prominent surgeon based in Leeds, who diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day. In the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. He missed the rest of the season.

Hobbs returned to cricket in 1922 and batted effectively throughout the first months of the season, scoring 10 first-class centuries in total. One of the centuries came in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, in which he captained the Players team for the first time. Towards the end of the season, his form faded owing to the lingering effects of his illness and operation the previous year. "Wisden" observed that he frequently tired during longer innings and often tried to get out soon after reaching three figures; this habit of giving up his innings continued throughout the remainder of his career. The season also marked a turning point in his batting approach where he preferred to score more slowly and take fewer risks, in contrast to his adventurous pre-war tactics. Second in the national batting averages for 1922, he scored 2,552 runs at an average of 62.24, but declined an invitation to tour South Africa that winter with the MCC. Less successful during the wet 1923 season, Hobbs failed on many occasions and was unsuccessful in both Gentlemen v Players games. He was still struggling with the after-effects of his operation and "Wisden" noticed he once more tried to score too quickly early in an innings. However, against <a href="Somerset%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Somerset</a>, he scored the 100th century of his first-class career, the third man to reach the landmark after <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a> and Hayward. Overall in the season, he scored 2,087 runs at 37.95.

Hobbs signed a new contract worth £440 a season before the 1924 season. His form recovered to the extent that his biographer, <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a>, described it as the beginning of "his quite phenomenal second lease of cricketing life". Batting conditions were good throughout the summer and Hobbs' opening partnership with Sandham for Surrey began to approach its peak of effectiveness. Hobbs also established an opening partnership with Yorkshire's <a href="Herbert%20Sutcliffe">Herbert Sutcliffe</a>; the pair had opened together briefly in previous seasons and were chosen to open in a Test trial early in 1924, beginning a six-year Test association. They were often successful in difficult batting conditions; Hobbs, generally the dominant partner, usually faced more of the bowling. By the time of his retirement, they had opened the batting 38 times in Tests, shared 15 century opening partnerships, and added 3,249 runs together; their average partnership was 87.81, the highest in all Tests for a pair of opening batsmen as of 2016. In all first-class matches, they had added 100 for the first wicket 26 times and had an average partnership of over 77. As with Hobbs' other partnerships, they ran well between the wickets, and established a particular reputation for reliability; according to McKinstry, they became an "English institution". The cricket writer <a href="Gerald%20Howat">Gerald Howat</a> suggests that Hobbs and Sutcliffe' became almost a synonym for English stability."

Following their success in the 1924 trial match, Hobbs and Sutcliffe were selected for the England team to play the first Test against South Africa. When England batted first, the pair added 136 for the first wicket; Hobbs, playing a Test innings in England for the first time since 1912, scored 76. England won the match by a large margin. In the second Test, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 268 runs for the first wicket; Hobbs scored 211, his highest Test score. At the time, the innings was the highest played at Lord's in a Test and equalled the highest in a Test match in England. England scored 531 for the loss of two wickets and won the match by an innings. Having initially declined an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC in the coming winter, Hobbs was left out of the team for the fourth Test. After the MCC accepted his request to allow his wife Ada to accompany him—the wives of professionals were not usually permitted to tour—he changed his mind, and was added to the England team for the fifth Test. In the series, he scored 355 runs at an average of 71.00, while in all first-class matches he totalled 2,094 runs at 58.16. He finished second in the national averages, and the cricket press noted that, although Hobbs scored more slowly and in less spectacular fashion than previously, he batted in a safer, secure style which was more successful in terms of run-scoring.

The MCC team which <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201924%E2%80%9325">toured Australia</a> under the captaincy of <a href="Arthur%20Gilligan">Arthur Gilligan</a> in 1924–25 lost the Test series 4–1, but critics thought the winning margin flattered the host country. Between them in the Test matches, Hobbs and Sutcliffe scored seven centuries and shared four opening partnerships which passed 100 runs. Hobbs began the tour well, and scored consistently in the matches before the Tests. In the first Test, in reply to Australia's first innings of 450, Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened with 157 runs. Hobbs went on to his seventh century against Australia, beating the previous record number in England-Australia Tests by <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>. Australia eventually set England a target of 605 runs. Hobbs and Sutcliffe shared their second century opening partnership of the game, but England lost by 193 runs. During the match, Hobbs became the leading run-scorer in Test cricket, passing the previous record of 3,412 runs set by <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a> in 1912. In the second Test, Australia scored 600 during the opening two days. In reply, Hobbs and Sutcliffe batted throughout the third day without being separated, scoring 283. They concentrated on defence but both men reached centuries, and the press praised their achievements. Even so, Australia won the game by 81 runs, and in the aftermath of the defeat, <a href="Cecil%20Parkin">Cecil Parkin</a>, a former Test bowler and vocal critic of Gilligan's captaincy, wrote a newspaper article suggesting that Hobbs should assume the leadership of the side. This suggestion provoked a reaction from Lord Hawke—"Pray God, no professional will ever captain England"—and subsequent press debate over the idea of Hobbs as captain. In reality, Hobbs had no desire to captain England.

Australia once more batted first in the third Test, scoring 489. For tactical reasons, Hobbs did not open the batting but scored 119 and shared another century partnership with Sutcliffe. Wet weather altered the course of the match and, despite an opening partnership of 63 between Hobbs and Sutcliffe, Australia won by 11 runs. The opening batsmen shared their fourth century partnership of the series in the fourth Test as England won by an innings, but Australia won the final match to win the series 4–1 and in a heavy defeat, Hobbs failed in both innings. In the series, he scored 573 runs at an average of 63.66, and made two half-centuries in addition to his three hundreds. Critics in Australia and England once more recognised him as the leading batsman in the world. Hobbs and Sutcliffe far outscored the remaining MCC batsmen and "Wisden" judged that with better support from other batsmen they could have won the series. In all games, Hobbs scored 865 first-class runs at 54.06.

Hobbs was particularly successful in 1925. Early in the season a string of centuries, including a run of four in consecutive innings, made him the first batman to reach 1,000 runs that season and brought him close to Grace's record of 126 first-class hundreds. He scored the 125th century of his career against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> on 20 July, but amid intense press and public interest, Hobbs lost form through a combination of anxiety and fatigue. He continued to score well, but could not reach three figures in an innings—after one innings of 54, a newspaper headline proclaimed that "Hobbs Fails Again". It was not until 15 August, against Somerset, that Hobbs scored 101 to reach the landmark, an achievement praised and feted throughout the country over the following weeks. On the final day of the match, Hobbs scored another century to become the outright record holder. He ended his season with an innings of 266 in a Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival, his highest to date and the best score made in the Gentlemen v Players series, and 104 for the Rest of England against Yorkshire, the County Champions. In total, he scored 16 centuries—setting a record for most centuries in a season—and totalled 3,024 runs at an average of 70.32 to top the national averages for the first time. Following his successful season, Hobbs was in great demand. He attended several functions in his honour but rejected offers to appear on stage, in film and to stand as a <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal</a> parliamentary candidate.
Hobbs was given a third benefit by Surrey in 1926 which raised £2,670. Further recognition came when he and Rhodes joined the England selection committee for the Ashes series to be played that summer; for professional cricketers to serve as England selectors was unprecedented. Hobbs began the season well, and after the first Test, which was badly affected by rain, he remained in form by scoring 261 against Oxford University, sharing an opening partnership of 428 with Sandham; this remained a Surrey first wicket record as of 2016. In the drawn second Test, he and Sutcliffe shared an opening stand of 182. Hobbs scored 119 but was criticised for slowing down later in his innings, leading to accusations that he was more concerned with reaching three figures than batting for the team. The third Test was also drawn. England followed on in the face of a large Australian total, but Hobbs and Sutcliffe opened the second innings with a partnership of 156 and Hobbs scored 88 as the game was saved. During the fourth Test, he temporarily assumed the captaincy when <a href="Arthur%20Carr%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Carr</a> withdrew from the match owing to illness; Hobbs became the first professional to captain England at home. The selectors and players on both teams believed Hobbs performed well tactically. He scored 74 in England's innings, but heavy rain ensured a fourth successive draw.

As everything depended on the <a href="Fifth%20Test%2C%201926%20Ashes%20series">final game</a>, the <a href="International%20Cricket%20Council">Imperial Cricket Conference</a> agreed that the match be played to a finish. Carr was replaced as captain by <a href="Percy%20Chapman">Percy Chapman</a>, a decision which proved controversial in the press; Rhodes was also recalled to the team, aged 48. Amid huge public interest, the match was evenly balanced at the end of the second day when England began their second innings. Overnight rain seriously damaged the pitch before the third morning and few critics—including members of the home team—expected England to score many runs. But Hobbs and Sutcliffe, who had scored 49 on the second evening, began to bat confidently before the effects of a hot sun drying a damp pitch made batting even more hazardous. Concentrating on defence, but scoring whenever possible, the pair added 172 in total. Immediately after reaching 100, Hobbs was out and received a prolonged ovation from the crowd. Many critics believed that, given the conditions, match situation and pressure, this was his greatest innings. England built up a large lead and bowled Australia out to win the Ashes. Late in the season, Hobbs made the highest score of his career, 316 not out for Surrey against Middlesex at Lord's, establishing a record individual innings for Lord's which survived until 1990. In total, Hobbs scored 2,949 runs at 77.60, including 12 centuries, to be placed first in the national batting averages.

Hobbs missed a large part of the 1927 season with a combination of illness and injury. In between his absences, he performed well, although he was left out of the Gentlemen v Players match. He scored 1,641 runs at 52.93, including seven centuries. He began the 1928 season with four centuries in the first month, but another leg injury kept him out of cricket for six weeks. When he recovered, he was selected in the last two of the three Tests against the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>, playing their first Test series. In his first game, he and Sutcliffe shared a century partnership; in the third, Hobbs scored 159, having opened with a 155-run partnership with Sutcliffe. England won the series 3–0. Hobbs maintained his batting form until the end of the season; he finished second in the batting averages, scoring 2,542 runs at an average of 82.00 and hitting 12 centuries. Critics believed he remained unsurpassed among English batsmen.

Hobbs toured Australia for a final time as a player <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201928%E2%80%9329">in 1928–29</a> as part of a strong MCC team, and despite substantial scores in early games, did not bat well. He made little contribution to England's victories in the first two Tests, and some critics noticed a decline in his batting, a judgement reinforced when he was out to a poorly-chosen shot in the first innings of the third Test for 20. Australia were able to build up a substantial lead, and overnight rain before the sixth day of the match made them likely winners. England needed 332 to win, but on a pitch growing more difficult as it dried, a total of 100 was considered unlikely. Hobbs and Sutcliffe survived to add 105 for the first wicket; observers praised their technique against the turning ball, although the Australian bowlers were criticised for ineffective tactics. Hobbs was out for 49; at his suggestion, <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a> came in to bat next, and England reached the end of the day having lost just one wicket for a score of 199. Next day, the team won the game to take a 3–0 lead in the series with two to play and ensure they retained the Ashes. In the fourth Test, Hobbs scored 74 and shared a partnership of 143 with Sutcliffe as England won by 12 runs; in the final game, won by Australia, he scored 142 on the first day, his final Test century and 12th against Australia. Scoring his hundred at the age of 46 years 82 days, he remained as of 2016 the oldest player to score a Test century. In first-class games on the tour, Hobbs scored 962 runs at 56.58. and 451 runs at 50.11 in the Tests.

Hobbs missed more cricket with injuries and illnesses in 1929; between 1926 and 1930, he missed more than a third of Surrey's matches. However, he scored heavily and compiled 2,263 runs at an average of 66.55 to lead the first-class averages. Unfit for the first two Tests <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201929">against South Africa</a>, he chose to miss the next two, and played in the final game, scoring 10 and 52. Critics observed a general slowing in Hobbs' scoring throughout the season, and he scored more often in singles than in his earlier years.

Hobbs began 1930 in good form, and, with Rhodes, was added to the selection panel again for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201930">Ashes series</a> that season. In the first Test, Hobbs scored 78 and 74; he top-scored in both innings, but failed in the next two Tests. Before the third and fourth Tests, feeling tired and concerned by his form, he offered to stand down but the other selectors declined his suggestion. When he batted in the fourth Test, he shared an opening partnership of 108 with Sutcliffe, their 11th century stand against Australia. After two hours batting, he was out for 31. With the series level at 1–1, the final Test was to be played to a finish, but before it began, Hobbs announced that it would be his last. Shortly after making the decision, he returned to form, scoring a century and passing, in his next game, W. G. Grace's record career-aggregate of 54,896 first-class runs. Before the deciding Test, the selectors sacked Percy Chapman as captain. The press speculated that Hobbs would replace him, but <a href="Bob%20Wyatt">Bob Wyatt</a> was chosen; Hobbs may have turned down an offer of the captaincy at the meeting of selectors. In the match, Hobbs scored 47 in the first innings. When he came out to bat in the second, in the face of a large Australian first-innings lead, Hobbs was given an ovation by the crowd and the Australian fielders gave him <a href="three%20cheers">three cheers</a>. Hobbs was moved by his reception but scored only nine runs before he was dismissed, and Australia won the match and series. In his final series, he scored 301 runs at 33.44. In 61 Tests, he had scored 5,410 runs at an average of 56.94. He retired as the leading run-scorer in Test matches, a record he held until it was passed by <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a> in 1937. Maintaining his form for the rest of the season, Hobbs scored 2,103 first-class runs in 1930 at 51.29.

During the winter of 1930–31, Hobbs and Sutcliffe joined a private team run by the <a href="Maharajkumar%20of%20Vizianagram">Maharajkumar of Vizianagram</a> which toured India and <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Ceylon</a>. Hobbs was very popular with the crowds, and scored 593 runs. These runs, and in particular the two centuries he scored, were to prove controversial. Hobbs never believed that the matches were, or should have been, of first-class status, but statisticians later judged them to be first-class. "Wisden" never recognised the centuries and so records his century total as 197. Other authorities give 199 centuries. Despite using a more limited batting technique, Hobbs remained successful in 1931. He played several representative matches and took part in the 150th century opening partnership of his career. In total, he scored 2,418 first-class runs in the season at 56.23. In 1932, despite missing several matches owing to injuries and fatigue, he scored 1,764 runs at 56.90, including centuries in each innings against Essex. According to Mason, this latter performance prompted <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a> to coin the nickname "The Master" for Hobbs. Hobbs scored 161 not out for the Players against the Gentlemen, his 16th century in the fixture, to pass the record total of <a href="WG%20Grace">WG Grace</a> for the Gentlemen.

Hobbs was partially involved in the <a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a> controversy in <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201932%E2%80%9333">Australia in 1932–33</a>. Late in the 1932 season, <a href="Bill%20Bowes">Bill Bowes</a> consistently bowled short-pitched deliveries against him in a match between Surrey and Yorkshire. Bowes was criticised in the press and particularly by <a href="Pelham%20Warner">Pelham Warner</a>, who was to manage the MCC team in Australia. Hobbs accompanied the team to Australia as a journalist, writing for the "<a href="News%20Chronicle">News Chronicle</a>" and "<a href="The%20Star%20%28London%29">The Star</a>", accompanied by his <a href="ghostwriter">ghostwriter</a> Jack Ingham. During the tour, Hobbs neither condemned Bodyline nor fully described the English tactics. Other sports journalists admired Hobbs but dismissed his writing as non-committal and "bland". However, once the tour had finished and he returned to England, Hobbs openly criticised the English tactics in newspaper columns and in a book he wrote about the tour. In 1933, playing less frequently, he scored 1,105 runs at 61.38, aged 50. After missing the first games with illness, he scored 221 against the <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201933">touring West Indian team</a>, to the acclaim of the press. He did not play every game, and the Surrey committee happily allowed him to choose which matches to play. More centuries followed later that season, which took him to 196 in his career, fuelling anticipation that he would reach 200 centuries. That winter he accompanied the MCC team in India as a journalist. Before the next season, Surrey installed new decorative gates at the main entrance to <a href="the%20Oval">the Oval</a> which were named after Hobbs in his honour. In 1934, he scored 624 runs at 36.70. After a solid start, he scored his final first-class century against Lancashire. After this he played irregularly, and his batting began to appear visibly uncomfortable. Hobbs realised his career was over: in February 1935, he announced his retirement. There were many tributes and a public dinner was held in his honour which was attended by many leading figures in cricket. In all first-class cricket, Hobbs scored 61,760 runs at an average of 50.70 according to <a href="ESPNcricinfo">ESPNcricinfo</a>. Later in 1935, Hobbs was made an honorary life member of Surrey.

For much of Hobbs' career, critics judged him to be the best batsman in the world. <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a> described him in 1963 as "a supreme master of his craft, and the undisputed head of his profession". <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> said that Hobbs was the first batsman to develop a technique to succeed consistently against googly bowlers, and that he mastered all types of bowling, all over the world and in a variety of conditions. Other critics have suggested that Hobbs moved the focus of batting from aesthetic off side shots to leg side play more suited to swing and googly bowling. Swanton wrote that Hobbs combined classical play with effective defence—including protecting the wickets using his <a href="pads">pads</a>—against the ball unexpectedly moving towards the stumps. His pad-play was controversial: it removed any possibility of dismissal but was regarded by some cricket authorities as negative and unsporting.

Many of his English contemporaries rated Hobbs superior to <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Donald Bradman</a>, often regarded as the greatest batsman in the history of cricket, on difficult pitches. In difficult batting conditions Hobbs batted with great success, and several of his most highly regarded innings came in such circumstances. Murphy suggests: "Before Bradman, he was the most consistent run-getter of all time, yet no one worried less about the sheer slog of carving out big scores." Hobbs frequently was out deliberately soon after reaching a century—roughly a quarter of his centuries were scores less than 110—and was not particularly interested in most statistics. An article in "Wisden" in 2000 stated: "He was never as dominant as Bradman; he never wanted to be. But his contemporaries were in awe of his ability to play supremely and at whim, whatever the conditions."
Hobbs' technique was based on strong forearms and good foot movement. <a href="R.%20C.%20Robertson-Glasgow">R. C. Robertson-Glasgow</a> suggested that "his footwork was, as near as is humanly possible, perfect. In every stroke, he moved into line with the ball with so little effort that he could bat for hours without over-taxing energy of mind or body." He played every type of shot—he did not have a "signature" shot like other batsmen, but selected his strokes effectively; according to <a href="Alec%20Kennedy">Alec Kennedy</a>, who bowled to Hobbs, it seemed that he could predict what the bowler would do. In contrast to many leading batsmen from his time, Hobbs preferred to play off the back foot as he believed it gave him more time to see the ball and adapt his shot. Capable of playing all the strokes, he hit the ball precisely between fielders and sometimes delayed his shot to make the ball travel more slowly and allow more time to run; he also ran well between the wickets. He liked to score his first run quickly when he came into bat, and he often looked to score quickly at the start of an innings, before the bowlers had settled; on occasion, Hobbs targeted the main bowling threats from the opposition in an attempt to neutralise them. Early in his career, mainly before the First World War, Hobbs was an aggressive, fast-scoring batsman who played many shots. After the war, he was more circumspect and adapted his technique to account for both his increased age, and the increased pressure and expectation from the public and teammates. He concentrated to a greater extent on batting for longer periods; many critics, including Hobbs himself, recognised the change and suggested that he was a better batsman before 1914. However, commentators also noted that he displayed greater certainty and control in this later period; Cardus wrote that "he scored his centuries effortlessly now; we hardly noted the making of them." This was the period in which he became known as "The Master", and he was more consistent than before the war. This was the time when the public regarded him with the most respect and affection; 98 of his centuries and 26,411 of his runs (at an average of 58.62) in first-class cricket were scored after he reached the age of 40.

Hobbs was an occasional medium-paced bowler who bowled a <a href="Good%20length%20ball">good length</a> and made the ball swing. Some critics judged him to be a potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing it would affect his batting. As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the <a href="Fielding%20%28cricket%29%23Fielding%20position%20names%20and%20locations">covers</a> and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a>. Contemporaries believed him to be one of the best cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting to the ball. They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out.

Although a professional—captains at the time were almost exclusively amateurs—the respect in which Hobbs was held meant that he was accepted as a captain. Many, but not all, critics considered him a competent tactician and leader. He regularly led the Players team against the Gentlemen and sometimes at Surrey in the absence of Percy Fender, but he was a reluctant captain. He disliked the responsibility and decision-making of leadership, and rarely even offered tactical advice.

Hobbs was twice selected as "Wisden's" Cricketer of the Year, in 1909 and 1926; only he and Pelham Warner have received this award twice. In 1963, <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> chose him as one of the best six cricketers of the previous 100 years, to mark "Wisden's" centenary. More recently, Hobbs was selected by a panel of experts in 2000 as one of five "Wisden" cricketers of the 20th century. In 2009, he was selected by cricket historians and writers as a member of England's all-time best team, and included in a similar team to represent the best players worldwide in the history of cricket. Hobbs' Test batting average of 56.94 remained as of 2016 the sixth best among batsmen to have passed 5,000 runs, despite a rise in the number of batsmen who average more than 50 since 2000. Among openers who have scored 5,000 Test runs, he has the third best average behind Sutcliffe and <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a>. He was comfortably the leading Test run-scorer during his career, and had the highest number of Test runs at the time of his retirement. Between 1910 and 1929, he averaged 65.55 in Test cricket.

Gideon Haigh suggests that Hobbs was a "spontaneous and original", trend-setting batsman who was not afraid to depart from orthodoxy. Gerald Howat notes that, aside from his batting achievements, "Hobbs's biographers and obituarists could strike no discordant note. He was a man of moral probity, religious conviction, and personal commitment. And he was humble enough to see himself as an ordinary person blessed with one extraordinary talent, which he put into its proper perspective. It was an attitude of mind which tempered the sternness of his approach with an engaging humour and a delight in playing practical jokes." Among his contemporaries, Hobbs was regarded as modest and kind, and never criticised other players. He avoided confrontation, although he was "quietly determined", according to "Wisden", and tried to avoid publicity. According to Fender, Hobbs "gave stature" to the profession of cricket. Modern critics have expressed some reservations: some have pointed out that his batting average, although high, has been surpassed by others, and that among his many centuries, few were as large as other players managed. However, others contend that his impact on the game, his achievement in showing that professionals could bat as freely and stylishly as amateurs, and his kindness place him among the top cricketers of all time. "Wisden" described him in 2000: "More than anyone else, he lifted the status and dignity of the English professional cricketer." In summing up his place in history, it said: "He was not an artist, like some of his predecessors, nor yet a scientist, like some of the moderns; he was perhaps the supreme craftsman."

In 1900, Hobbs met Ada Ellen Gates, a cobbler's daughter, at an evening church service held in St Matthew's, Cambridge. The progress of their relationship was slowed by Hobbs' shyness and devotion to cricket, but the pair eventually married on 26 September 1906 at the church in which they met. They planned to keep the event quiet, but it was reported in the press and the couple received gifts and messages from Hobbs' Surrey team-mates. Hobbs so disliked being separated from his wife during cricket tours that in later years she often accompanied the team overseas. They had four children: Jack, born in 1907, Leonard in 1909, Vera in 1913 and Ivor in 1914.

Hobbs and his wife lived in rented property for the first years of their marriage. His earnings placed them roughly in the bracket of <a href="lower%20middle%20class">lower middle class</a> according to McKinstry: although considerably more prosperous than he had been during his childhood, the family were not initially financially comfortable. Hobbs' wages increased as his reputation grew, so that by 1913 he was earning £375 annually (equivalent to about £32,000 in 2018), placing his family within the bracket of the London <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a>. After several years of moving from one property to another, he was able to buy his own house in 1913, in <a href="Clapham%20Common">Clapham Common</a>, then a comfortable and prosperous area of London. By the middle of the 1920s, cricket in England was extremely popular and the best players were nationally famous. Hobbs was the biggest cricket star of them all and a combination of his cricket earnings (estimated to be around £780 each year), the income from his sporting goods business, product endorsement—he was one of the first cricketers to benefit from lending his name to commercial products—and ghostwritten books and articles made him comparatively wealthy. According to McKinstry, his annual earnings probably reached £1,500 a year by 1925, more than an experienced doctor could earn at the time. Consequently, in 1928 the family moved to a large house in private grounds, and Hobbs was able to send his children to private schools. He had achieved greater financial independence than most contemporary cricketers, but was always first concerned to give his wife and children the security lacking from his own childhood.

Following his retirement from cricket in 1934, Hobbs continued to work as a journalist, first with Jack Ingham then with Jimmy Bolton as his ghostwriters. He accompanied the MCC team to Australia in 1936–37 and published four books which sold well in the 1930s. In addition, he produced two ghostwritten autobiographies, but generally avoided self-publicity or controversy. He continued to work at his sports shop and he and Ada moved home several times. By the mid-1930s, his wife was becoming mentally and physically frail. Hobbs supported several charities in his spare time and continued to play cricket at club and charity level.

During the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>, Hobbs served in the <a href="Home%20Guard%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Home Guard</a> at <a href="New%20Malden">New Malden</a>. In 1946, Hobbs became the first professional to be elected to the Surrey committee. The same year, he and his wife moved to <a href="Hove">Hove</a>, following several years of health concerns and worries over his business and children. Ada's health continued to deteriorate, and the couple spent some time in South Africa in an attempt to aid her recuperation.

In 1953, Hobbs was <a href="Orders%2C%20decorations%2C%20and%20medals%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Knighthood">knighted</a>, the first professional cricketer to be so honoured. He was reluctant to accept it and only did so when convinced that it was an honour to all professional cricketers, not just himself. In the same year, <a href="John%20Arlott">John Arlott</a> formed the "Master's Club", a group of Hobbs' admirers who met regularly to celebrate him. Hobbs remained active into the 1960s, including working in his shop. By the late 1950s, Ada was wheelchair-bound and Hobbs spent most of his time caring for her. She died in March 1963. Hobbs' own health began to fail shortly afterwards and he died on 21 December 1963 at the age of 81. He left £19,445 in his will and was buried in Hove Cemetery. A memorial service was held at <a href="Southwark%20Cathedral">Southwark Cathedral</a> in February 1964.

Gwoyeu Romatzyh

Gwoyeu Romatzyh (<a href="pinyin">pinyin</a>: "Guóyǔ Luómǎzì", literally "National <a href="Language">Language</a> <a href="Romanization">Romanization</a>"), abbreviated GR, is a system for writing <a href="Standard%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> in the <a href="Latin%20alphabet">Latin alphabet</a>. The system was conceived by <a href="Yuen%20Ren%20Chao">Yuen Ren Chao</a> and developed by a group of <a href="linguistics">linguists</a> including Chao and <a href="Lin%20Yutang">Lin Yutang</a> from 1925 to 1926. Chao himself later published influential works in linguistics using GR. In addition a small number of other textbooks and dictionaries in GR were published in <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a> and overseas from 1942 to 2000.
GR is the better known of the two romanization systems which indicate the four <a href="Standard%20Chinese_phonology%23Tones">tones of Mandarin</a> by varying the spelling of syllables ("tonal spelling"). These tones are as fundamental to the Chinese language as vowels are to English; their presence <a href="Phoneme">lets speakers discriminate</a> between otherwise identical syllables and words. Other systems indicate the tones with either <a href="diacritic">diacritic</a>s (for example <a href="Pinyin">Pinyin</a>: "āi, ái, ǎi" and "ài") or numbers (<a href="Wade%E2%80%93Giles">Wade–Giles</a>: "ai, ai", etc.). GR spells the four tones of the same vowel, "ai", "air, "ae and "ay". These spellings, which follow specific <a href="Spelling%20in%20Gwoyeu%20Romatzyh%23Tonal%20rules">rules</a>, indicate the tones while retaining the pronunciation of the syllable "ai".

Chao claimed that, because GR embeds the tone of each syllable in its spelling, it may <a href="%23Language%20learning">help students to master Chinese tones</a>. One study of GR, however, found the opposite to be true. GR uses a complicated system of tonal spelling that obscures the basic relationship between spelling and tone; for example, the difference between tones 1 and 2 is variously indicated as "mha" vs. "ma", "ching" vs. "chyng", "chang" vs. "charng", etc. Although tonal spelling has been adopted as part of the normal romanization of a number of Asian languages (e.g. <a href="Hmong%20language">Hmong</a>), all such systems indicate different tones in a simple and consistent fashion by adding letters to the end of a syllable (e.g. in Hmong, "-b" indicates high tone, "-s" indicates low tone, "-j" indicates high-falling tone, etc.).

In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's official romanization system. GR was used to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from a small number of trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was its narrow basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to <a href="Pinyin">Pinyin</a> and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of <a href="Shaanxi">Shaanxi</a> ("shǎnxī", 陝西), which cannot be distinguished from <a href="Shanxi">Shanxi</a> ("shānxī", 山西) when written in pinyin without diacritics.

<a href="%23Tonal%20modifications">Tonal spelling</a>, Gwoyeu Romatzyh's most distinctive feature, was first suggested to Y.R. Chao by <a href="Lin%20Yutang">Lin Yutang</a>. By 1922 Chao had already established the main principles of GR.
The details of the system were developed in 1925–1926 by a group of five linguists, led by Chao and including Lin, under the auspices of the <a href="Mandarin%20Promotion%20Council">Preparatory Commission for the Unification of the National Language</a>. In 1928 GR was officially adopted by the government. GR was intended to be used alongside the existing <a href="Zhuyin">"Juhin" ("Zhùyīn")</a> phonetic symbols: hence the alternative name for GR, "Second Pattern of the National Alphabet." Both systems were used to indicate the revised standard of pronunciation in the new official "Vocabulary of National Pronunciation for Everyday Use" of 1932. The designers of GR had greater ambitions: their aim was complete reform of the script, using GR as a practical system of writing.
In the 1930s two shortlived attempts were made to teach GR to railway workers and peasants in <a href="Henan">Hénán</a> and <a href="Shandong">Shāndōng</a> provinces. Support for GR, being confined to a small number of trained linguists and Sinologists, "was distinguished more for its quality than its quantity." During this period GR faced increasing hostility because of the complexity of its tonal spelling. Conversely, Sinologist <a href="Bernhard%20Karlgren">Bernhard Karlgren</a> criticised GR for its lack of phonetic rigour. Ultimately, like the rival (toneless) system <a href="Latinxua%20Sinwenz">Latinxua Sinwenz</a>, GR failed to gain widespread support, principally because the "National" language was too narrowly based on <a href="Beijing%20dialect">Beijing speech</a>: "a sufficiently precise and strong language norm had not yet become a reality in China".

A vestigial use of GR can be seen in the official spelling of the first syllable of "Shaanxi" for <a href="Shaanxi">Shǎnxī</a> (陝西) province, to distinguish it from <a href="Shanxi">Shānxī</a> (山西) province, particularly in foreign-language text where the tone marks are often omitted. Some prominent Chinese have used GR to transliterate their names: for example the mathematician <a href="Shiing-Shen%20Chern">Shiing-Shen Chern</a>. The romanization system was changed by the government of the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> in 1958 to the current system used now in the country, and other foreign and international institutions, like the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>, the <a href="International%20Organization%20for%20Standardization">International Organization for Standardization</a>, and is widely used to teach <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> to foreign students: <a href="Hanyu%20Pinyin">Hanyu Pinyin</a>. Meanwhile, in the <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Republic of China</a> (Taiwan), GR survived until the 1970s as a pronunciation aid in monolingual dictionaries such as "Gwoyeu Tsyrdean [Guóyǔ Cídiǎn]" and "Tsyrhuey [Cíhuì]", but was officially replaced in 1986 by a modified form known as <a href="Mandarin%20Phonetic%20Symbols%20II">Mandarin Phonetic Symbols II</a>. The <a href="Warring%20States%20period">Warring States period</a> State of <a href="Wey%20%28state%29">Wey</a> () is often spelled as such to distinguish it from the more prominent state , which are both pronounced Wèi in Mandarin, but in <a href="Old%20Chinese">Old Chinese</a> it was probably /*ɢʷat-s/ and /*N-qʰuj-s/, respectively.

An important feature of GR, adopted from other precursors and later also adopted by <a href="Pinyin">Pinyin</a>, is the use of contrasting <a href="voice%20%28phonetics%29">unvoiced/voiced</a> pairs of consonants from Latin to represent <a href="aspiration%20%28phonetics%29">aspirated and unaspirated</a> sounds in Chinese. For example "b" and "p" represent and ("p" and "p‘" in Wade). Another distinctive feature of GR is the use of "j, ch," and "sh" to represent two different series of sounds. When followed by "i" these letters correspond to the <a href="alveolo-palatal%20consonant">alveolo-palatal</a> sounds (Pinyin "j, q," and "x"); otherwise they correspond to the <a href="retroflex%20consonant">retroflex</a> sounds (Pinyin "zh, ch," and "sh"). Readers used to Pinyin need to pay particular attention to these spellings: for example, GR "ju, jiu," and "jiou" correspond to Pinyin "zhu, ju," and "jiu" respectively.

GR orthography has these additional notable features:


By default, the basic GR spelling described above is used for Tone1 syllables. The basic form is then modified to indicate tones 2, 3 and 4. This is accomplished in one of three ways:


Wherever possible the concise first method is used. The following rules of thumb cover most cases.

Tone 1 (basic form)

Tone 2: i/u → y/w; or add -r

Tone 3: i/u → e/o; or double vowel

Tone 4: change/double final letter; or add -h

Neutral tone: precede with a dot (full stop)

Exception Syllables with an initial <a href="sonorant">sonorant</a> ("l-/m-/n-/r-") use the basic form for T2 rather than T1. In these syllables the (rarer) T1 is marked with "-h-" as the second letter. For example "mha" is T1 (mā), whereas "ma" is T2 (má). T3 and T4 are regular: "maa" ("mǎ") and "mah" ("mà").

An important principle of GR is that syllables which form words should be written together. This strikes speakers of European languages as obvious; but in Chinese the concept of "word" is not easy to pin down. The basic unit of speech is popularly thought to be the monosyllable represented by a <a href="Written%20Chinese%23Chinese%20characters%20%282%29">character</a> ( "tzyh", "zì"), which in most cases represents a meaningful syllable or <a href="morpheme">morpheme</a>, a smaller unit than the "linguistic word". Characters are written and printed with no spaces between words; yet in practice most <a href="Chinese%20language%23Grammar%20and%20morphology">Chinese words</a> consist of two-syllable compounds, and it was Chao's bold innovation in 1922 to reflect this in GR <a href="orthography">orthography</a> by grouping the appropriate syllables together into words. This represented a radical departure from hyphenated Wade–Giles forms such as "Kuo-yü Lo-ma-tzu" (the Wade spelling of GR).

Chao used GR in four influential works:

"Readings in Sayable Chinese" was written "to supply the advanced student of spoken Chinese with reading matter which he can actually use in his speech." It consists of three volumes of Chinese text with facing GR romanization. They contain some lively recorded dialogues, "Fragments of an autobiography," two plays and a translation of <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Through%20the%20Looking-Glass">Through the Looking-Glass</a> (Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii)". Two extracts from "Tzoou daw Jinqtz lii" with facing translations can be read online.

In 1942 <a href="Walter%20Simon%20%28sinologist%29">Walter Simon</a> introduced GR to English-speaking sinologists in a special pamphlet, "The New Official Chinese Latin Script". Over the remainder of the 1940s he published a series of textbooks and readers, as well as a Chinese-English Dictionary, all using GR. His son Harry Simon later went on to use GR in scholarly papers on Chinese linguistics.

In 1960 Y.C. Liu, a colleague of Walter Simon's at <a href="SOAS">SOAS</a>, published "Fifty Chinese Stories". These selections from <a href="Chinese%20classic%20texts">classical texts</a> were presented in both <a href="classical%20Chinese">classical</a> and modern Chinese, together with GR romanizations and <a href="Romanization%20of%20Japanese">romanized Japanese</a> versions prepared by Simon (by that time Professor <a href="Emeritus">Emeritus</a> of Chinese in the <a href="University%20of%20London">University of London</a>).

<a href="Lin%20Yutang">Lin Yutang</a>'s "<a href="Chinese-English%20Dictionary%20of%20Modern%20Usage">Chinese-English Dictionary of Modern Usage</a>" (1972) incorporated a number of innovative features, one of which was a simplified version of GR. Lin eliminated most of the spelling rules requiring substitution of vowels, as can be seen from his spelling "Guoryuu Romatzyh", in which the regular <a href="%23T2Rule">"-r" is used for T2</a> and a <a href="%23T3Rule">doubled vowel for T3</a>.

The first 3 issues of the "Shin Tarng" magazine (which would be "Xīn Táng" in Pinyin; published in 1982-1989) used a Simplified Romanisation ( ) based on Gwoyeu Romatzyh; the fourth edition, entitled Xin Talng, used Pinyin with Gwoyeu Romatzyh-like tone marking.

Chao believed that the benefit of GR was to make tonal differences more salient to learners:

For example, it may be easier to memorize the difference between GR "Beeijing" (the city) and "beyjiing" ("background") than the Pinyin versions "Běijīng" and "bèijǐng", where the tones seem to be almost an afterthought. One study conducted at the <a href="University%20of%20Oregon">University of Oregon</a> in 1991–1993, compared the results of using Pinyin and GR in teaching elementary level Chinese to two matched groups of students, and concluded that "GR did not lead to significantly greater accuracy in tonal production."

GR continues to be used by some teachers of Chinese. In 2000, the Princeton "Chinese Primer" series was published in both GR and Pinyin versions.

Here is an extract from Y.R. Chao's <a href="%23sayable">"Sayable Chinese"</a>. The topic is scholarly ("What is Sinology?"), but the style colloquial. The tonal spelling markers or "clues" are again highlighted using the same <a href="%23Tonal%20modifications">color-coding scheme</a> as above. Versions in <a href="%23chin">Chinese characters</a>, <a href="%23pin">Pinyin</a> and <a href="%23eng">English</a> are given below the GR text.

Happy Chandler

Albert Benjamin "Happy" Chandler Sr. (July 14, 1898 – June 15, 1991) was an American politician from the Commonwealth of <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. He represented the Commonwealth in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> and served as its <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Kentucky">44th and 49th governor</a>. Aside from his political positions, he also served as the second <a href="Commissioner%20of%20Baseball">Commissioner of Baseball</a> from 1945 to 1951 and was inducted into the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1982. His grandson, <a href="Ben%20Chandler">Ben Chandler</a>, later served as <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">congressman</a> for <a href="Kentucky%27s%206th%20congressional%20district">Kentucky's Sixth District</a>.

A multi-sport athlete during his college days at <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania College</a>, Chandler briefly considered a career in professional baseball before deciding to pursue a law degree. After graduation, he entered politics and was elected as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> to the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a> in 1928. Two years later, he was elected <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a>, serving under Governor <a href="Ruby%20Laffoon">Ruby Laffoon</a>. Chandler and Laffoon disagreed on the issue of instituting a state <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a> and when Chandler, the presiding officer in the state senate, worked to block the legislation, Laffoon's allies in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">General Assembly</a> stripped him of many of his statutory powers. The tax then passed by a narrow margin. Knowing that Laffoon would try to select his own successor at the Democratic nominating convention, Chandler waited until Laffoon left the state—leaving Chandler as acting governor—and called the legislature into session to enact a mandatory <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a> bill. The bill passed, and in the ensuing primary, Chandler defeated Laffoon's choice, <a href="Thomas%20Rhea">Thomas Rhea</a>. He then went on to defeat <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="King%20Swope">King Swope</a> by the largest margin of victory for a Kentucky gubernatorial race to that time. As governor, Chandler oversaw the repeal of the sales tax, replacing the lost revenue with new <a href="excise%20tax">excise tax</a>es and the state's first <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a>. He also enacted a major reorganization of state government, realizing significant savings for the state. He used these savings to pay off the state debt and improve the state's education and transportation systems.

Convinced that he was destined to become President of the United States, Chandler challenged <a href="Party%20leaders%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Senate">Senate Majority Leader</a> <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a> for his U.S. Senate seat in 1938. During the campaign, President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> came to the state to campaign for Barkley, and Chandler lost a close race. The following year, Kentucky's other senator, <a href="Marvel%20Mills%20Logan">Marvel Mills Logan</a>, died in office, and Chandler resigned as governor so his successor could appoint him to the vacant seat. A <a href="Fiscal%20conservatism">fiscal conservative</a> and disciple of <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>'s <a href="Harry%20F.%20Byrd">Harry F. Byrd</a>, Chandler opposed parts of Roosevelt's <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> and openly disagreed with the president's decision to prioritize <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European operations</a> in World War II over <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">the war in the Pacific</a>. In 1945, Chandler resigned his senate seat to succeed the late <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a> as commissioner of baseball. His most significant action as commissioner was the approval of <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a>'s contract with the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>, effectively <a href="Baseball%20color%20line">integrating</a> <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a>. He also established the first pension fund for Major League players, earning him the title "the players' commissioner". Baseball owners were upset with Chandler's governance, however, and did not renew his contract in 1951.

Following his term as commissioner, Chandler returned to Kentucky and won a second term as governor in 1955. The major accomplishments of his second term were enforcing the <a href="racial%20integration">racial integration</a> of the state's public schools and establishing a medical school at the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a> which was later named the <a href="Chandler%20Medical%20Center">Chandler Medical Center</a> in his honor. Following his second term as governor, his political influence began to wane as he made three more unsuccessful runs for governor in 1963, 1967, and 1971. His endorsement of dark-horse candidate <a href="Wallace%20G.%20Wilkinson">Wallace G. Wilkinson</a> was seen as critical to Wilkinson's successful gubernatorial campaign in 1988. Wilkinson later resisted calls to remove Chandler from the University of Kentucky board of trustees following Chandler's use of a racial epithet during a board meeting in 1988. In his retirement, Chandler made numerous public appearances and remained active in state politics and events. Chandler died a month before his ninety-third birthday; at the time, he was the oldest living former Kentucky governor as well as the earliest serving former governor.

Albert Benjamin Chandler was born in the farming community of <a href="Corydon%2C%20Kentucky">Corydon, Kentucky</a>, in 1898. He was the eldest child of Joseph Sweet and Callie (Saunders) Chandler. Chandler's father allegedly rescued his mother from an orphanage and married her when she was 15, but no record of their marriage has ever been found. In 1899, Chandler's brother Robert was born. Two years later, their mother, still in her teens and unable to cope with raising two young children, abandoned the family. She fled the state and left her sons with their father. In his autobiography, Chandler said that his mother's leaving them was his earliest memory. Years later, he sought his mother and found her living in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>. She had married again and he had three half-siblings. His full brother, Robert Chandler, died when he fell from a cherry tree when he was 13 years old.

Chandler was raised by his father and relatives, and by age 8, he virtually supported himself financially from his paper route and doing odd jobs in his community. In 1917, he graduated from Corydon High School, where he had been <a href="captain%20%28sports%29">captain</a> of the baseball and <a href="American%20football">football</a> teams. His father wanted him to study for the ministry, but Chandler instead entered Transylvania College (now <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a>) in <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a>. It was there that he received his lifelong nickname "Happy" because of his jovial nature. He paid for his education by doing chores for the local citizens. Chandler was captain of Transylvania's basketball and baseball teams and the <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> of the football team. He was a teammate of <a href="Dutch%20Meyer">Dutch Meyer</a>, a future member of the <a href="College%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">College Football Hall of Fame</a>. He also joined the <a href="Pi%20Kappa%20Alpha">Pi Kappa Alpha</a> fraternity and the <a href="Omicron%20Delta%20Kappa">Omicron Delta Kappa</a> honor society. In 1918, during World War I, the United States Army started a <a href="Reserve%20Officers%27%20Training%20Corps">Student Officers' Training Corps</a> at Transylvania, and Chandler began training to be an officer. The war ended before he was called to active duty.

In 1920, Chandler pitched a <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> for <a href="Grafton%2C%20North%20Dakota">Grafton, North Dakota</a>'s team in the Red River Valley League. He attended a professional baseball tryout in <a href="Saskatoon">Saskatoon</a> but did not make the team. He returned to Transylvania and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in June 1921. He then signed with the Class D baseball team the <a href="Lexington%20Reds">Lexington Reds</a>, where he was a teammate of future <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Famer</a> <a href="Earle%20Combs">Earle Combs</a>. Briefly considering a career in baseball, he finally decided to study law. He entered <a href="Harvard%20Law%20School">Harvard Law School</a> that same year, paying his way by coaching high school sports in <a href="Wellesley%2C%20Massachusetts">Wellesley, Massachusetts</a>. His former teammate <a href="Charlie%20Moran">Charlie Moran</a>, then coaching the <a href="Centre%20Praying%20Colonels%20football">Centre College Praying Colonels football team</a> in <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>, asked him to scout the national powerhouse <a href="Harvard%20Crimson%20football">Harvard Crimson</a>, an upcoming opponent for Centre. Chandler took copious notes for Moran, and <a href="1921%20Centre%20vs.%20Harvard%20football%20game">Centre defeated Harvard 6–0</a> in what is considered one of the greatest upsets in college football history.

After a year, Chandler was not able to afford Harvard. He returned to Kentucky and continued at the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky%20College%20of%20Law">University of Kentucky College of Law</a>, coaching high school sports in <a href="Versailles%2C%20Kentucky">Versailles</a> and served as the head coach of the women's basketball at the University of Kentucky in 1923. He was an assistant coach and scout for Charlie Moran at Centre, and he coached the freshman football team there. A member of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Coif">Order of the Coif</a>, he received his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree in 1924. He was admitted to the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> the following year and opened his law practice in Versailles.

On November 12, 1925, Chandler married Mildred Lucille Watkins, a teacher at the Margaret Hall School for Girls. They would have four children: Marcella, Mildred ("Mimi"), Albert Jr., and Joseph Daniel. Mimi Chandler played one of the four singing sisters in the 1944 film "<a href="And%20the%20Angels%20Sing">And the Angels Sing</a>", appearing with <a href="Dorothy%20Lamour">Dorothy Lamour</a>, <a href="Betty%20Hutton">Betty Hutton</a>, and <a href="Diana%20Lynn">Diana Lynn</a> before abandoning acting and working for the Kentucky Department of Tourism.

For the next five years, Chandler simultaneously practiced law, coached high school sports, and served as a scout for Centre. He joined numerous fraternal organizations, including the <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasons</a>, <a href="Shriners">Shriners</a>, <a href="Knights%20Templar%20%28Freemasonry%29">Knights Templar</a>, <a href="Forty%20and%20Eight%20veterans%20organization">Forty and Eight</a>, and <a href="Optimist%20International">Optimist International</a>.

Chandler entered politics when he was named chairman of the <a href="Woodford%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Woodford County</a> Democratic Committee. In 1928, he was appointed master commissioner of the Woodford County <a href="circuit%20court">circuit court</a>. The following year, he was elected as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> to represent the 22nd district in the <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">Kentucky Senate</a>. As a member of the Senate, he was part of a Democratic coalition that passed legislation to strip <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> Governor <a href="Flem%20D.%20Sampson">Flem D. Sampson</a> of many of his statutory powers.
As the 1931 gubernatorial election approached, Chandler and <a href="Prestonsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Prestonsburg</a> native Jack Howard were mentioned as candidates for lieutenant governor. <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">US Representative</a> <a href="Fred%20M.%20Vinson">Fred M. Vinson</a> backed Howard, a fellow <a href="Eastern%20Mountain%20Coal%20Fields">Eastern Kentuckian</a>, but <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a>es Billy Klair, <a href="Johnson%20N.%20Camden%20Jr.">Johnson N. Camden Jr.</a>, and <a href="Ben%20Johnson%20%28politician%29">Ben Johnson</a> supported Chandler. The support of another political boss, Mickey Brennan, gave Chandler the edge at the party's nominating convention. Democratic gubernatorial nominee <a href="Ruby%20Laffoon">Ruby Laffoon</a> also owed his selection to the machinations of the state's political bosses, notably his uncle, Representative <a href="Polk%20Laffoon">Polk Laffoon</a>. Problematically, Chandler was an ally of former Governor <a href="J.%20C.%20W.%20Beckham">J. C. W. Beckham</a>, "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier-Journal</a>" publisher <a href="Robert%20Worth%20Bingham">Robert Worth Bingham</a>, and <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a> Percy Haly, which put him at odds with Laffoon, a member of a Democratic faction that was headed by <a href="Russellville%2C%20Kentucky">Russellville</a> political boss <a href="Thomas%20Rhea">Thomas Rhea</a> and opposed to Beckham, Worth, and Haly. Despite the disharmony within the ticket, the worsening of the <a href="Great%20Depression%20in%20the%20United%20States">Great Depression</a> under Republican President <a href="Herbert%20Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> and Governor Sampson ensured a Democratic victory. Chandler was elected over John C. Worsham, by a vote of 426,247 to 353,573. In a break with precedent, Chandler set up an office on the executive floor of the <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Capitol">state capitol</a> and worked there full-time. Previous lieutenant governors had stayed in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a> only during legislative sessions, when they were charged with presiding over the State Senate.

Shortly after their election, the divide between Chandler and Laffoon widened over the issue of implementing a state <a href="sales%20tax">sales tax</a>. Laffoon favored the tax, but Chandler opposed it. As presiding officer of the State Senate, Chandler worked with <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">House Speaker</a> <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%2C%20Sr.">John Y. Brown, Sr.</a>, to block passage of the tax. In retaliation, Laffoon's allies in the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> stripped Chandler of some of his statutory power as lieutenant governor, and they were then able to pass the tax by a single vote in each house of the legislature.

Free from any constitutional duties during the time between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor, almost from the beginning of his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had made it clear that he favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss <a href="Earle%20C.%20Clements">Earle C. Clements</a> as his campaign manager. Hailing from <a href="Morganfield%2C%20Kentucky">Morganfield</a>, only a short distance from Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign, instead of Rhea's. Instead, by the virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.

Chandler feared that Laffoon, who controlled the State Democratic Central Committee, would attempt to handpick the Democratic gubernatorial nominee by calling a nominating convention instead of holding a <a href="primary%20election">primary election</a> and so Chandler used a bold move to circumvent Laffoon's ability to carry out such an action. Under the <a href="Kentucky%20Constitution">Kentucky Constitution</a>, Chandler became acting governor whenever Laffoon left the state. When Laffoon traveled to meet with President <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, on February 6, 1935, Chandler used his authority to call the legislature into session to consider a bill that required each party's gubernatorial candidates to be chosen by a primary, rather than a nominating convention. Laffoon returned to the state the next day and challenged Chandler's authority to make the call, but Chandler's actions would be validated by the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> on February 26.

Laffoon knew that the primary bill would be widely supported in the General Assembly since both the legislators and their constituents had grown to distrust party nominating conventions. Accordingly, he proposed a bill enacting a mandatory two-stage primary in which a <a href="two-round%20system">runoff election</a> would be held between the top two candidates in the first round. Historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> maintained that Laffoon expected his rival faction to nominate the aging Beckham to oppose Rhea and that Laffoon hoped that a two-stage primary would wear Beckham down. Journalist John Ed Pearce, however, contends that Beckham had already declined to become a candidate, citing his own ill health and that of his son, before the special session convened. Whatever the case, the legislature passed the bill that Laffoon proposed.

After Beckham declined to run for governor, the anti-Laffoon faction supported Chandler against Rhea. During the primary campaign, Chandler seized upon the unpopular sales tax, labeling Rhea "Sales Tax Tom" and calling on the electorate to redeem the state from "Ruby, Rhea, and Ruin." In the first round of the primary, Rhea garnered 203,010 votes to Chandler's 189,575. Frederick A. Wallis received 38,410 votes, and Elam Huddleston received 15,501. The votes for Wallis and Huddleston meant that neither Rhea nor Chandler had achieved a majority, which triggered the runoff primary. Both Wallis and Huddleston backed Chandler in the runoff, and Chandler defeated Rhea, by a vote of 260,573 to 234,124, to secure the nomination.
Chandler promised to repeal the unpopular sales tax, lower the <a href="gasoline%20tax">gasoline tax</a>, oppose any increase in property taxes, and end the common practice of assessing state employees a percentage of their salaries to be used for campaign activities. Infuriated by their loss, Laffoon and his allies abandoned the party and supported the Republican nominee, <a href="King%20Swope">King Swope</a>. Policy-wise, there were few differences between the two, and personal attacks were employed by both sides. Swope's reputation as a stern judge contrasted sharply with Chandler's charisma, and Chandler used that to his advantage by dubbing Swope "his majesty." When Chandler touted his service during World War I, Laffoon's <a href="adjutant%20general">adjutant general</a> <a href="Henry%20Denhardt">Henry Denhardt</a> countered by pointing out that Chandler had been only a cadet in training and never had engaged in active service in the war. Ultimately, the campaign turned on the failed presidential administration of the Republican ex-president Hoover and that of the sitting president, the Democratic Roosevelt. Chandler defeated Swope by a vote of 556,262 to 461,104 in the general election. The 95,000-vote margin of victory was then the largest ever recorded in a Kentucky gubernatorial election, and at only 37, Chandler was the youngest governor of any US state.

One of Chandler's first acts as governor was to secure the repeal of the sales tax passed under Laffoon. He also successfully lobbied the legislature to abolish the two-round primary, in favor of a single primary for future elections. Knowing that he would need to raise revenue to offset the repeal of the sales tax and bring the state's expenditures in line with its income, Chandler appointed a commission headed by ex-Governor Beckham to draft suggested budgetary legislation. Knowing that <a href="lobbyist">lobbyist</a>s hostile to the suggestions would likely try to encourage legislative gridlock until the constitutionally-mandated end of the 60-day session, Chandler asked his allies in the General Assembly to adjourn after 39 days to allow him to call a special legislative session that would not be time-limited and could entertain only the agenda he specified. Legislators obliged this request.

Acting on recommendations from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost revenue from the sales tax by raising <a href="excise%20tax">excise tax</a>es, particularly the tax on <a href="whiskey">whiskey</a>, which was made possible by the state's repeal of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition</a>, in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first <a href="income%20tax">income tax</a> during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government and by reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22.

Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more power in the hands of the governor and accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting the act.

Chandler used the savings realized from his reorganization of government to eliminate the state's budget deficit and to pay off most of the state's debt. That brought about further savings by eliminating debt service costs, which were applied to improvements in the state's infrastructure and educational institutions. Chandler allocated funds for free textbooks for the state's school children, created a teacher's pension fund, and provided extensive funding for the state's colleges and universities. Because segregation prevented blacks from attending graduate school in the state, Chandler secured an allocation of $5,000 annually to help blacks attend out-of-state graduate schools. He stopped short of desegregating the state's universities, however, and told a group of black and white educators that "it is not wise to educate the white and colored in the same school in the South. It is not prepared for it yet."

In 1939, he appointed the first woman trustee on the University of Kentucky Board of Trustees, Georgia M. Blazer of Ashland. She served from 1939 to 1960.

In 1936, Chandler urged implementation of the state's first rural roads program and development of electrical infrastructure with assistance from the federal <a href="Rural%20Electrification%20Act">Rural Electrification Act</a>. He implemented an old-age assistance program authorized by an earlier constitutional amendment, and in 1938, he proposed another amendment that would add dependent children and needy blind people to the state's assistance rolls. He increased funding to the state's hospitals and asylums, and he personally aided with the evacuation of the Frankfort Penitentiary during the <a href="Ohio%20River%20flood%20of%201937">Ohio River flood of 1937</a>. Following the flood, Chandler convinced the legislature to construct the new <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Reformatory">Kentucky State Reformatory</a>, at <a href="La%20Grange%2C%20Kentucky">La Grange</a>.

Generally a friend of <a href="trade%20union">organized labor</a>, Chandler supported miners' efforts to unionize, organized the state Department of Industrial Relations, and prohibited mine operators from being appointed as deputy sheriffs. He also endorsed the proposed <a href="Child%20Labor%20Amendment">Child Labor Amendment</a> to the <a href="US%20Constitution">US Constitution</a> and secured passage of a state anti-child-labor law that had been defeated twice in the state legislature by overwhelming margins. However, he opposed <a href="closed%20shop">closed shop</a>s and <a href="sitdown%20strike">sitdown strike</a>s, and he used the <a href="Kentucky%20National%20Guard">Kentucky National Guard</a> to quell labor-related violence in <a href="Harlan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Harlan County</a>.

In the 1936 US Senate contest in Kentucky, incumbent Democrat <a href="Marvel%20Mills%20Logan">Marvel Mills Logan</a> was seen as vulnerable, and Chandler backed Democratic challenger J. C. W. Beckham in the Democratic primary. That endorsement drew the ire of Chandler's former ally, Democratic Representative John Y. Brown, Sr., who believed that in exchange for his support of Chandler in the 1935 gubernatorial race, Chandler would support him in the senatorial contest. An embittered Brown entered the race anyway, and the votes that he pulled from Beckham likely allowed Logan to retain the seat. Brown remained Chandler's political enemy for the rest of his political career.

In 1936, Chandler was awarded an <a href="honorary%20degree">honorary</a> <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> degree from the University of Kentucky. The following year, <a href="Harvard%20University">Harvard University</a> awarded him the same degree.

Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937. With J. C. W. Beckham aging (he would die in 1940), Chandler moved to fill the leadership void in the faction. He soon came to believe he was destined to become President of the United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the <a href="US%20Supreme%20Court">US Supreme Court</a>, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The death of Justice <a href="George%20Sutherland">George Sutherland</a> in January 1938 gave President <a href="Franklin%20Roosevelt">Franklin Roosevelt</a> the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices (Logan was 63), and Kentucky's senior senator, <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a>, recommended <a href="Solicitor%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Solicitor General</a> <a href="Stanley%20Forman%20Reed">Stanley Forman Reed</a> for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.

Eager to augment his power and angered by the refusal of Roosevelt and Barkley to accept his suggestion of appointing Logan to the Supreme Court, Chandler did not attend a long-planned dinner in Barkley's honor on January 22, 1938. Instead, he held an event of his own at <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>'s exclusive Pendennis Club and alluded to his intentions of challenging Barkley during the upcoming Democratic senatorial primary. Barkley officially announced his re-election bid the following day. The death of another federal judge on January 26 provided a second opportunity for Roosevelt to appoint Senator Logan to a judgeship and appease Chandler, but Logan refused to consider the appointment. Following a January 31 meeting in <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>, between Roosevelt and Chandler, in which Roosevelt urged Chandler to put his senatorial ambitions on hold, Chandler was encouraged by his political mentor, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>'s <a href="Harry%20F.%20Byrd">Harry F. Byrd</a>, to challenge Barkley. Chandler heeded Byrd's advice by making an official announcement of his candidacy on February 23, 1938, in <a href="Newport%2C%20Kentucky">Newport, Kentucky</a>.
Barkley, who had been recently chosen as <a href="Senate%20Majority%20Leader">Senate Majority Leader</a> by a single vote, was a strong supporter of Roosevelt and the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>. Chandler identified with the more conservative southern Democrats, who wary of Roosevelt and his New Deal, sought to gain control of the party ahead of the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201940">1940 presidential election</a>. Because Roosevelt was very popular in Kentucky, Chandler was put in the awkward position of expressing personal support of the president and opposing his handpicked leader in the Senate and his New Deal legislation. In April, polls showed Barkley ahead of Chandler by a 2-to-1 margin, and the May 3 primary victory of Florida Senator <a href="Claude%20Pepper">Claude Pepper</a>, who supported the New Deal, finally persuaded Chandler to abandon his attacks of the program.

In late May 1938, Chandler's campaign manager publicly claimed that federal relief agencies, especially the <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a>, were openly working for Barkley's re-election. Although the WPA administrator in Kentucky denied the charges, veteran reporter <a href="Thomas%20Lunsford%20Stokes">Thomas Lunsford Stokes</a> launched an investigation of the agency's activities in the state and eventually raised 22 charges of political corruption in a series of eight articles, covering the Barkley-Chandler campaign. Federal WPA administrator <a href="Harry%20Hopkins">Harry Hopkins</a> claimed an internal investigation of the agency refuted all but two of Stokes' charges, but Stokes was awarded the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize%20for%20Reporting">Pulitzer Prize for Reporting</a> in 1939 for his investigation. In the wake of the investigation Congress passed the <a href="Hatch%20Act%20of%201939">Hatch Act of 1939</a> to limit the WPA's involvement in future elections.

The negative effects of the investigation on Barkley's campaign were minimal because of Chandler's own use of his gubernatorial power and patronage on behalf of his own campaign. Dan Talbott, one of Chandler's chief political advisors, encouraged supervisors of state workers to take punitive action against employees who made "pessimistic expressions" on Chandler's chances in the primary. Furthermore, Chandler initiated a rural road-building project in the state, employing loyal supporters to construct and maintain the new roads. State workers who supported Chandler were employed to deliver pension checks to the state's elderly citizens, and Talbott did not deny charges that the workers threatened to withhold the checks if the recipients did not pledge their support to Chandler.

Roosevelt personally visited Kentucky to campaign on Barkley's behalf on July 8, 1938. As governor of the state, Chandler was on hand to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in <a href="Covington%2C%20Kentucky">Covington</a>. Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley in the back seat of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to <a href="Latonia%20Race%20Track">Latonia Race Track</a>, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley but remained friendly with Chandler. After Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him but downplayed or ignored critical remarks.

Late in the campaign, Chandler fell ill with chills, stomach pains, and a high fever. After first claiming the symptoms were similar to those that he had experienced a year earlier, Chandler later described his malady as "intestinal poisoning." His doctor announced that Chandler, Dan Talbott, and a state police officer had all been sickened after drinking "poisoned water" that had been provided to Chandler for a radio address. Chandler maintained that someone from the Barkley campaign had tried to poison him, but the charge never gained much credence with the press or the electorate. Barkley frequently mocked it on the campaign trail by first accepting a glass of water offered to him and then shuddering and rejecting it. He pointed out to audiences that it was the young Chandler and not Barkley who had broken down first under the strain of the grueling campaign.

With Chandler ally Robert Bingham no longer at its helm, "The Courier-Journal" supported Barkley, and organized labor, a key Chandler supporter in 1935, also threw its support to Barkley. Former Chandler ally John Y. Brown, Sr., also took an active part in the Barkley campaign. Ultimately, Barkley defeated Chandler by a vote of 294,391 (56%) to 223,149 (42.6%). The remaining 1.4% of the vote was dividing among minor candidates. Chandler's 70,872-vote loss was the worst loss for a primary candidate in state history.

On October 9, 1939, following the death of Senator Logan, Chandler resigned as governor, elevating Lieutenant Governor <a href="Keen%20Johnson">Keen Johnson</a> to the governorship. The following day, Johnson appointed Chandler to Logan's vacated seat in the Senate. In a special election to fill the remainder of the unexpired term, Chandler then first defeated <a href="Charles%20R.%20Farnsley">Charles R. Farnsley</a> in the Democratic primary and Republican Walter B. Smith by a vote of 561,151 to 401,812 in the November 5, 1940, general election. Although he never forgave Roosevelt for backing Barkley in the 1938 senatorial primary, he generally supported the Roosevelt administration except for parts of the New Deal.

Chandler's mentor, Harry F. Byrd, led a group of <a href="Southern%20United%20States">Southern</a> conservatives in the Senate, and through Byrd's influence, Chandler was appointed to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20Committee%20on%20Armed%20Services">Committee on Military Affairs</a>. In 1943, he was part of a five-person delegation from the Military Affairs Committee that traveled the world, inspecting US military bases. He vociferously disagreed with Roosevelt's decision to prioritize the <a href="European%20Theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">European Theatre</a> in World War II over the <a href="Asiatic-Pacific%20Theater">pacific Theatre</a>.

Chandler upset many in the black community by voting against an anti-<a href="lynching">lynching</a> bill soon after taking office. The bill levied fines against local governments and individual government officials in counties in which illegal lynchings had occurred. Of his vote against the bill, Chandler remarked, "I am against lynching by anybody and of anybody, black or white, but the present bill carries penalties on local officials and local subdivisions which I think are too severe." The bill passed in the House of Representatives but died in the Senate. Later, Chandler joined with Southern senators in opposing the repeal of <a href="poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll taxes</a>, which had been long used as a mechanism to prevent blacks from voting.

At the expiration of his partial term in 1942, Chandler faced a challenge from former ally John Y. Brown, Sr. in the Democratic primary. As a result of his votes on the anti-lynching bill and the poll tax repeal, the Louisville chapter of the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a> worked against his re-election effort. During the campaign, Brown accused Chandler of abusing his power, including of having a swimming pool installed at his home, in violation of the federal rationing provisions that had been implemented during World War II. Chandler invited the <a href="Truman%20Committee">Truman Committee</a> to investigate the installation of the pool and no violations of the federal rationing provisions were found. Chandler went on to defeat Brown and was easily re-elected in the general election over Republican Richard J. Colbert.

Chandler believed that he had enough support at the <a href="1944%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1944 Democratic National Convention</a> to be nominated as Roosevelt's running mate for <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201944">that year's presidential election</a>. The support failed to materialize, however, after the Kentucky delegation, Earle C. Clements in particular, refused to back his nomination. The convention nominated <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> as Roosevelt's running mate. Truman became president upon Roosevelt's death in 1945, and Chandler never forgave Clements for costing him the chance to be US President.

After the death of Baseball Commissioner <a href="Kenesaw%20Mountain%20Landis">Kenesaw Mountain Landis</a>, in November 1944, John O. Gottlieb, a friend of Chandler in the <a href="US%20War%20Department">US War Department</a>, suggested Chandler as a successor. Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the <a href="conscription%20in%20the%20United%20States">draft</a> during the war had decided that their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball's interests in <a href="Washington%2C%20D%20C">Washington, D C</a>. As a senator, Chandler had advocated on behalf of baseball during the war, which endeared him to the owners. Furthermore, the commissioner's $50,000 annual salary, about five times that of a US senator at the time, proved a significant enticement and so he agreed to be considered.

Other candidates being considered included <a href="National%20League">National League</a> President <a href="Ford%20Frick">Ford Frick</a>, <a href="Democratic%20National%20Committee">Democratic National Committee</a> Chairman <a href="Robert%20E.%20Hannegan">Robert E. Hannegan</a>, former <a href="United%20States%20Postmaster%20General">Postmaster General</a> <a href="James%20Farley">James Farley</a>, US Senator <a href="John%20W.%20Bricker">John W.

Vinson</a>, <a href="Ohio%20Governor">Ohio Governor</a> <a href="Frank%20Lausche">Frank Lausche</a>, and Undersecretary of War <a href="Robert%20P.%20Patterson">Robert P. Patterson</a>. After <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a> owner <a href="Warren%20Giles">Warren Giles</a> and <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a> owner <a href="Philip%20K.%20Wrigley">Philip K. Wrigley</a> raised strong opposition to Frick, who had been the frontrunner, <a href="New%20York%20Yankees">New York Yankees</a> co-owner <a href="Larry%20MacPhail">Larry MacPhail</a> began to advocate for Chandler. When the owners met in <a href="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, on April 24, 1945, to vote for a new commissioner, Chandler's name was not on the shortlist, which had Frick, Farley, Hannegan, Vinson, Lausche, and Patterson. None of the candidates received the required <a href="two-thirds%20majority">two-thirds majority</a>, and after lobbying by MacPhail and <a href="New%20York%20Giants%20%28NL%29">New York Giants</a> owner <a href="Horace%20Stoneham">Horace Stoneham</a>, the owners took an informal vote to see if anyone had the potential to be elected. Chandler's name appeared in the top three on each of the sixteen ballots. Encouraged, the owners then held another formal vote. After two ballots, Chandler received the necessary majority. A third vote was taken to make the choice unanimous.

Chandler remained in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner because he wanted to cast his vote on the <a href="Bretton%20Woods%20Conference">Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement</a> and the <a href="Charter%20of%20the%20United%20Nations">Charter of the United Nations</a>. He received only his Senate salary until his resignation on November 1, 1945, despite claims to the contrary by the press. Nevertheless, his delay in assuming the commissioner's job upset many team owners, as did his late arrival to Game 3 of the <a href="1945%20World%20Series">1945 World Series</a>, which rendered him unavailable to rule on whether the weather was clement enough to begin the game. Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting, but he had actually been at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.

Chandler's election was also met with disdain from much of the press in the Eastern United States, where most of baseball's teams resided at that time. His Southern drawl and his willingness to sing "<a href="My%20Old%20Kentucky%20Home">My Old Kentucky Home</a>" with very little encouragement led some sportswriters to opine that he was too undignified for the office. Others resented his folksy, political style, calling him "a preening politician," "the Kentucky windbag," and "a hand-shaking baby-kissing practitioner of the arts." Chandler further alienated the press by moving the commissioner's office to <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a> from <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> in 1946.

In early 1946, <a href="Jorge%20Pasquel">Jorge Pasquel</a> and his four brothers, who owned the <a href="Mexican%20League%20%28baseball%29">Mexican League</a>, siphoned campaign funds from the <a href="Mexican%20general%20election%2C%201946">upcoming Mexican presidential election</a> and used them to offer large salaries and signing bonuses to American baseball players. In some cases, the offers were triple the salaries being paid in the Major Leagues. Chandler deterred players from considering Mexican League offers by imposing a five-year ban from <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> to anyone who played in the Mexican League and did not return by April 1, 1946. In all, eighteen players played for the Mexican league despite the ban, including <a href="Mickey%20Owen">Mickey Owen</a>, <a href="Max%20Lanier">Max Lanier</a>, and <a href="Sal%20Maglie">Sal Maglie</a>. <a href="Vern%20Stephens">Vern Stephens</a> initially agreed to play in Mexico as well but returned before Chandler's deadline. <a href="Ted%20Williams">Ted Williams</a>, <a href="Stan%20Musial">Stan Musial</a>, and <a href="Phil%20Rizzuto">Phil Rizzuto</a> were also offered lucrative contracts and incentives, but all eventually declined to play in Mexico.

Shortly after the Mexican league incident, Robert Murphy, a former negotiator for the <a href="National%20Labor%20Relations%20Board">National Labor Relations Board</a>, attempted to organize the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a> into a <a href="guild">guild</a> for purposes of <a href="collective%20bargaining">collective bargaining</a>. Murphy decried the <a href="reserve%20clause">reserve clause</a> in player contracts, which gave team owners unlimited control over the player's services, and he demanded more rights for players, including the right of contract and the right of salary arbitration. Chandler worked with Pirates officials to avoid a threatened strike by the players. Part of Chandler's intervention included organizing a team of replacement players as a contingency plan; the team would have included <a href="Honus%20Wagner">Honus Wagner</a>, then 72.

The defections to the Mexican league and the threat of a strike by the Pirates prompted owners to form an advisory committee, chaired by Larry MacPhail, to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players. On August 27, 1946, the committee presented a draft a document outlining the changes. Language in the original draft admitted that baseball was operating as a monopoly and that racial bias was the sole reason for segregation in baseball. Baseball's attorneys stripped the controversial language from the version that was eventually adopted by the owners.

Days prior to Chandler's assumption of the commissionership, the <a href="Brooklyn%20Dodgers">Brooklyn Dodgers</a>' general manager, <a href="Branch%20Rickey">Branch Rickey</a>, had announced the signing of <a href="Jackie%20Robinson">Jackie Robinson</a> to a minor league contract with the <a href="Montreal%20Royals">Montreal Royals</a>, making him the first black to play for a Major League Baseball affiliate. The following year, Rickey transferred Robinson's contract from Montreal to Brooklyn, effectively breaking <a href="baseball%20color%20line">baseball's color line</a>. In a speech at <a href="Wilberforce%20University">Wilberforce University</a> in February 1948, Rickey recounted a secret meeting that had allegedly been held by baseball officials at the <a href="Renaissance%20Blackstone%20Hotel">Blackstone Hotel</a> in Chicago on August 28, 1946. At the meeting, Rickey claimed that Ford Frick disseminated a report that stated, "However well-intentioned, the use of Negro players would hazard all physical properties of baseball." According to Rickey, all 15 team owners except for him voted to endorse the report. Rickey claimed Frick meticulously collected all copies of the report at the end of the meeting to prevent them from being disseminated. Baseball historian Bill Marshall later wrote that the document and subsequent vote to which Rickey was referring was the advisory committee's initial draft of recommended reforms. Marshall further recorded that Rickey identified the meeting and the report shortly after his speech at Wilberforce and retracted his claim of 15–1 opposition to Robinson's entry into Major League Baseball.

Chandler, who was also allegedly at the meeting, made no public mention of it until a 1972 interview. In the interview, Chandler then corroborated the essentials of Rickey's story, but he placed the meeting at the <a href="Waldorf-Astoria%20Hotel">Waldorf-Astoria Hotel</a> in January 1947. He also recounted that later in 1947, Rickey came to his home in Kentucky to discuss the matter further. According to Chandler, Rickey professed that he would not move forward with Robinson's transfer unless he had Chandler's full support, which Chandler later pledged. Aside from Chandler's anecdote, which he frequently repeated after the 1972 interview, there is no evidence that his meeting with Rickey ever took place. Nevertheless, future baseball commissioner <a href="Bowie%20Kuhn">Bowie Kuhn</a> and "<a href="Washington%20Post">Washington Post</a>" sportswriter <a href="Bob%20Addie">Bob Addie</a> maintained that Robinson would not have played without Chandler's intervention.

That Chandler supported Robinson and the <a href="racial%20integration">racial integration</a> of baseball is evidenced by his actions during the 1947 season. First and foremost, as commissioner, Chandler had the power to void Robinson's contract, but he chose to approve it. Further, after extreme, race-based jeering at Robinson by the <a href="Philadelphia%20Phillies">Philadelphia Phillies</a> and their manager, <a href="Ben%20Chapman%20%28baseball%29">Ben Chapman</a>, Chandler threatened both the team and Chapman personally with disciplinary action for any future incidents of race-based taunting. Later that season, he decisively supported Ford Frick's decision to suspend indefinitely any members of the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> who followed through on their threat to strike against racial integration.

During the 1946 postseason, rumors began to swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was lobbying Brooklyn Dodgers manager <a href="Leo%20Durocher">Leo Durocher</a> to leave the Dodgers and manage the Yankees. The move angered Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who encouraged Chandler to begin an investigation into the gambling habits of Durocher and his associate, actor <a href="George%20Raft">George Raft</a>. In the offseason, Chandler and Durocher had a meeting; Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling. Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining a double standard, however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees–Dodgers preseason exhibition in <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, Cuba. MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches (<a href="Chuck%20Dressen">Chuck Dressen</a> and <a href="John%20Corriden">John Corriden</a>) as aides to Yankee manager <a href="Bucky%20Harris">Bucky Harris</a> while they were still employed by the Dodgers. Chandler suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $2,000 fines against MacPhail and the Yankees.

The Yankees–Dodgers feud continued in the New York newspapers throughout the offseason. Charges were levelled by both sides, including accusations that Durocher was a philanderer because of his alleged involvement with married actress <a href="Laraine%20Day">Laraine Day</a>, which ultimately resulted in Day's divorce. When Durocher subsequently married Day, a local Catholic priest declared that attending Dodgers games was a <a href="venial%20sin">venial sin</a>. Prompted in part by this declaration, Chandler suspended Durocher from baseball for a year, just days before <a href="Opening%20Day">Opening Day</a>, citing "conduct detrimental to baseball."

Also in 1947, Chandler sold the rights to broadcast the <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> on the radio for $475,000 and used the money from the contract to establish a pension fund for baseball players. In 1949, Chandler negotiated a seven-year contract with <a href="Gillette%20%28brand%29">Gillette</a> and the <a href="Mutual%20Broadcasting%20System">Mutual Broadcasting System</a> to broadcast the Series. Proceeds from the $4,370,000 deal went directly into the pension fund. The same two companies negotiated a six-year, $6 million contract to broadcast the Series on television in 1950. Again, Chandler directed the proceeds into the pension fund.

In 1949, <a href="Danny%20Gardella">Danny Gardella</a>, who had left the New York Giants for the Mexican League in 1946, filed suit against Major League Baseball, claiming Chandler's ban on players who went to the Mexican League had denied him a means of pursuing his livelihood. Gardella demanded $100,000 in damages from the suspension, and claimed that the award should be tripled because baseball was subject to federal antitrust laws. Similar suits were filed by Max Lanier and <a href="Fred%20Martin%20%28baseball%29">Fred Martin</a>, both of whom also played in Mexico. On June 2, 1949, a federal court refused to reinstate the three players pending their trials but urged for the antitrust issues to be adjudicated as soon as possible. Attempting to alleviate the legal pressure on Major League Baseball, Chandler lifted the bans on players who had gone to Mexico almost two years early. Lanier and Martin dropped their suits, but Gardella pursued his. After Gardella's lawyer publicly questioned Chandler in court about baseball's antitrust exemption for a day and a half in September 1949, baseball executives, including Chandler, agreed to settle Gardella's case for $60,000.

Chandler's contract as baseball commissioner was not due to expire until April 1952, but he asked for the owners to extend it in December 1949. The owners voted against offering the extension at that time but promised to reconsider the request in December 1950. The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against, leaving him three votes short of the necessary three-fourths majority. Chandler asked for the extension to be reconsidered at the owners' meeting on March 12, 1951, but the vote was again 9–7. Upset that his contract was not extended, Chandler resigned effective July 15, 1951.

In an interview with "<a href="The%20Sporting%20News">The Sporting News</a>" in August 1951, Chandler cited his decision to void a trade between the New York Yankees and <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> for outfielder <a href="Dick%20Wakefield">Dick Wakefield</a> as a major factor in his inability to secure a new contract. The Yankees traded Wakefield to the White Sox for cash, but Wakefield refused to report to the White Sox after a salary dispute, which led to a disagreement between the teams over who was responsible for his salary. Chandler voided the trade, making Wakefield's contract the Yankees' responsibility and angering their owner, <a href="Del%20Webb">Del Webb</a>. It was not until the 1970s that Chandler began to cite his involvement in the integration of baseball as a reason for his contract not being renewed. Historian John Paul Hill considers that to be unlikely, however, because two of Chandler's strongest allies, <a href="Connie%20Mack">Connie Mack</a> and <a href="Walter%20Briggs%2C%20Sr.">Walter Briggs, Sr.</a>, were ardently opposed to integration, and <a href="Bill%20DeWitt">Bill DeWitt</a>, the second owner in the American League to integrate, voted against him. Hill points to the Dick Wakefield dispute and Chandler's investigations of Del Webb and Cardinals owner <a href="Fred%20Saigh">Fred Saigh</a> involving their rumored connections to gambling interests to be more compelling reasons for Chandler's dismissal.

Following his tenure as baseball commissioner, Chandler returned to his law practice. He also engaged in farming and published a newspaper, "The Woodford Sun". The Kentucky Press Association and the Kentucky Broadcasting Association both named him Man of the Year. He continued his involvement in sports, presiding over the <a href="International%20Baseball%20Federation">International Baseball Conference</a> from 1952 to 1955.

Chandler remained involved in politics throughout his tenure as baseball commissioner. In 1948, he became the leader of the <a href="Dixiecrat">Dixiecrat</a> movement in Kentucky. He hosted Dixiecrat presidential candidate <a href="Strom%20Thurmond">Strom Thurmond</a> at his home when he visited the state but did not officially endorse Thurmond's campaign. By the time that he had permanently returned to the state in mid-1951, it was too late to influence the gubernatorial contest. He spent the next four years rebuilding his political base in preparation for another run at the office.

Twenty years after first holding the governorship, Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race in 1955, using the slogan "Be like your Pappy and vote for Happy." His opponents in the Democratic Party, led by senator and former Governor <a href="Earle%20C.%20Clements">Earle C. Clements</a> and sitting Governor <a href="Lawrence%20Wetherby">Lawrence Wetherby</a>, had difficulty finding a candidate to oppose him. The most likely choice, Lieutenant Governor <a href="Emerson%20Beauchamp">Emerson "Doc" Beauchamp</a>, was handicapped by his connections to political bosses in <a href="Logan%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Logan County</a>. Clements virtually handpicked a relatively unknown candidate, Kentucky Court of Appeals Judge <a href="Bert%20T.%20Combs">Bert T. Combs</a>. Because Combs, whom Chandler nicknamed "The Little Judge," had no record for Chandler to campaign against, Chandler portrayed him as a pawn of Clements and Wetherby, whom he derisively referred to as "Clementine" and "Wetherbine."

The inexperienced Combs did little to help his campaign. His first campaign speech, which he dryly read verbatim from his notes, included the candid admission that it might be necessary to re-institute the state sales tax to balance the budget. Following that speech, a disappointed observer remarked, "Combs opened and closed [his campaign] on the same night." That speech also gave Chandler his main issue for the campaign. He charged that Combs would raise taxes while promising that he would lower them as he had in his first term.

Chandler's strategy in the campaign was to launch an attack upon the Wetherby administration and, before the Clements-Wetherby-Combs faction could react to it, to launch a new one. He claimed that Wetherby had used the state's money frivolously by installing air conditioning in the <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Capitol">state capitol</a> and installing a $20,000 rug in his office. (An invoice showing that carpeting for the entire first floor of the capitol had cost one tenth that amount did not stop Chandler from repeating the claim, which he said "didn't hurt anybody, and people liked to hear it.") After a Wetherby administration official approved the purchase of African <a href="mahogany">mahogany</a> paneling for the governor's office, Chandler charged that Wetherby had gone "clear to Africa" to find paneling for his office and promised that, if elected, he would use good, honest Kentucky wood for decoration. He also denounced the construction of a turnpike connecting <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky">Elizabethtown</a> and <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a>, the state fairgrounds, and <a href="Freedom%20Hall">Freedom Hall</a> as unnecessary.

Chandler won the Democratic primary by 18,000 votes over Combs. In the general election, he defeated Republican <a href="Edwin%20R.%20Denney">Edwin R. Denney</a> by a vote of 451,647 to 322,671, then the largest margin of victory for a gubernatorial candidate in the state's history.

Soon after Chandler took office, it became clear that he could not fund the social programs initiated by Clements and Wetherby and Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue then being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, which had been initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. To deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956 and then called a special session in which he presented his budget proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46 million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut <a href="tax%20credits">tax credits</a>. It created a new 5 percent <a href="production%20tax">production tax</a> on whisky and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state <a href="gasoline%20tax">gasoline tax</a> for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised <a href="corporate%20tax">corporate tax</a> by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100 million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.

Although Democrats held a majority in both houses of the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to co-operate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers, like <a href="John%20B.%20Breckinridge">John B. Breckinridge</a>, who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, that group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term to pass many of his proposals, including his tax plan. Frequently, that meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.
During his campaign, Chandler had promised that he would fund a medical school at the University of Kentucky although the <a href="University%20of%20Louisville">University of Louisville</a> already had a medical school, which made a poll of state physicians show overwhelming opposition to the plan. Nevertheless, Chandler delivered on his promise by allocating $5 million to the establishment of what became known as the <a href="Chandler%20Medical%20Center">Albert B. Chandler Medical Center</a>. Chandler said that the establishment of the school was his proudest achievement as governor.

Just as when he had been baseball commissioner, Chandler faced the issue of racial integration during his second term as governor. Among his first actions upon his election was to issue an executive order, ensuring that blacks and whites would have equal access to the <a href="List%20of%20Kentucky%20state%20parks">state park system</a>. He publicly acknowledged the <a href="US%20Supreme%20Court">US Supreme Court</a>'s 1954 decision in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>" as the law of the land and promised to enforce it. The Kentucky Court of Appeals struck down Kentucky's Day Law, against integration, the following year. Some areas of the state resisted the change. Notably, in 1956, when nine black students in <a href="Sturgis%2C%20Kentucky">Sturgis, Kentucky</a>, attempted to enter the all-white Sturgis High School, they were blocked by 500 opponents of integration. On September 4, 1956, Chandler called out the National Guard, including a force of over 900 guardsmen and several <a href="M47%20Patton">M47 Patton</a> tanks, to disperse the crowd. The confrontation lasted a total of 18 days before the protesters peacefully dispersed. Shortly thereafter, Chandler took similar actions in response to a protest in the town of <a href="Clay%2C%20Kentucky">Clay</a>, which was resolved without violence also. Of his actions, Chandler remarked, "We regret it is necessary to use this means of guaranteeing equal rights to our citizens, but that we must do."

Still convinced that he was destined to become president, Chandler attended the <a href="1956%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1956 Democratic National Convention</a> in the hope of securing the party's presidential nomination. Despite being told by his advisors that the convention would nominate <a href="Adlai%20Stevenson%20II">Adlai Stevenson</a>, Chandler continued to seek the nomination but received only 36 1/2 votes. Following Stevenson's nomination, Chandler returned to Kentucky, bitterly disappointed. The death of Senator <a href="Alben%20Barkley">Alben Barkley</a> and the expiration of Senator Clements' term would make Kentucky elect two senators also in November 1956. Clements was seeking re-election, and the state Democratic committee chose Wetherby as the nominee for Barkley's seat. Chandler refused to use his office to support Stevenson, Clements or Wetherby, and Republicans <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, <a href="John%20Sherman%20Cooper">John Sherman Cooper</a>, and <a href="Thruston%20Ballard%20Morton">Thruston Ballard Morton</a> won the presidential and the senatorial races in the state.

In the 1959 gubernatorial primary, Chandler threw his support to Lieutenant Governor <a href="Harry%20Lee%20Waterfield">Harry Lee Waterfield</a>. The anti-Chandler forces eventually put forth Bert Combs as their nominee again.

Having learned from his previous campaign, Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign. According to Combs, Chandler had deposited the money in a bank in <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, but the money was lost when <a href="Fidel%20Castro">Fidel Castro</a> overthrew the government during the <a href="Cuban%20Revolution">Cuban Revolution</a>. Ultimately, Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 to 259,461.

Republicans nominated <a href="John%20M.%20Robsion%20Jr.">John M. Robsion Jr.</a> to oppose Combs, and when Democratic President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> came to <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah</a> to campaign for Combs, Chandler refused to welcome him to the state, a customary duty of the sitting governor. Instead, in a letter to Truman, Chandler launched a blistering attack on his party's nominees, called Combs a liar, and alleged that his running mate, <a href="Wilson%20W.%20Wyatt">Wilson W. Wyatt</a>, who had previously served in Truman's administration, had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found <a href="Americans%20for%20Democratic%20Action">Americans for Democratic Action</a>. Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.

In 1957, Chandler was one of ten inaugural members of the Kentucky Sports Hall of Fame. A <a href="vestryman">vestryman</a> at St. John's Church in Versailles, he was awarded the Bishop's Medal of the Episcopal Church in 1959. The same year, he received the Cross of Military Service from the <a href="United%20Daughters%20of%20the%20Confederacy">United Daughters of the Confederacy</a>. He served as a trustee of the Ty Cobb Foundation and Transylvania University. At the <a href="1960%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1960 Democratic National Convention</a>, he again sought the party's presidential nomination, as he considered that the front-runner, <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, was "a nice young fellow ... (but) too young for the nomination." Chandler proposed for him to be the presidential nominee, with Kennedy as the nominee for vice-president, but the convention chose Kennedy for president instead.

On January 3, 1962, Chandler opened a campaign headquarters in Frankfort, announcing his bid for an unprecedented third term as governor with the slogan "ABC [Albert Benjamin Chandler] in '63". His opponent in the primary was <a href="Ned%20Breathitt">Edward T. "Ned" Breathitt Jr.</a>, the choice of outgoing Governor Bert Combs. Chandler reverted to his familiar campaign themes, charging the Combs administration with wasting state funds in the construction of a <a href="floral%20clock%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">floral clock</a> at the state capitol and denouncing Combs for re-instituting the state sales tax. However, he found it very difficult to adapt to campaigning via television, an increasingly important medium, and his attacks mostly fell flat.

Breathitt enraged Chandler by charging that when Chandler was a senator, he had voted in favor of declaring World War II, but soon afterward, he had resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he voted in favor of the war declaration, he called <a href="US%20Secretary%20of%20War">US Secretary of War</a> <a href="Henry%20Stimson">Henry Stimson</a> and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said that Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, and then Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on the campaign trail.

Chandler lost to Breathitt in the primary by more than 60,000 votes, but his running mate, Harry Lee Waterfield, won the nomination for lieutenant governor. Journalist John Ed Pearce believed that the loss marked the demise of the Chandler wing of the Democratic Party in Kentucky, but Chandler himself remained somewhat influential.
In 1965, Chandler was named to the University of Kentucky Hall of Distinguished Alumni and became commissioner of the <a href="Continental%20Football%20League">Continental Football League</a> (CFL). Chandler resigned from his CFL position in 1966 after league trustees supported a proposal to allow players from the major professional American football leagues, which he had been told would not happen. He served as Democratic National Committeeman from Kentucky. Becoming somewhat of a <a href="perennial%20candidate">perennial candidate</a>, he unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1967 and 1971. After his loss in the 1967 Democratic primary, he endorsed Republican <a href="Louie%20B.%20Nunn">Louie B. Nunn</a>. After his election, Nunn appointed Chandler to the first of his three terms on the University of Kentucky's board of trustees.

In 1968, Chandler was given serious consideration as the vice-presidential running mate of <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a>'s former <a href="governor%20of%20Alabama">governor</a>, <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, in the latter's <a href="American%20Independent%20Party">American Independent Party</a> bid for president. Wallace instead turned to Air Force General <a href="Curtis%20LeMay">Curtis LeMay</a>. The ticket lost to <a href="Richard%20M.%20Nixon">Richard M. Nixon</a> and <a href="Spiro%20T.%20Agnew">Spiro T. Agnew</a>. Chandler said that he and Wallace had been unable to come to an agreement on their positions on racial matters.

In 1971, Chandler again entered the gubernatorial race, now as an <a href="independent%20politician">independent</a>, but he garnered only 39,493 votes, compared to 470,720 for eventual Democratic victor <a href="Wendell%20H.%20Ford">Wendell H. Ford</a>, and 412,653 for Republican challenger <a href="Tom%20Emberton">Tom Emberton</a>. Ford's successor, <a href="Julian%20Carroll">Julian Carroll</a>, again appointed Chandler to the University of Kentucky's board of trustees.

The Major League Baseball <a href="Veterans%20Committee">Veterans Committee</a> chose Chandler for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1982. In 1987, filmmaker <a href="Robby%20Henson">Robby Henson</a> profiled Chandler in a 30-minute documentary entitled "Roads Home: The Life and Times of A.B. 'Happy' Chandler".

Chandler endorsed dark horse candidate <a href="Wallace%20G.%20Wilkinson">Wallace G. Wilkinson</a> in the 1987 Democratic primary, and his endorsement was considered crucial to Wilkinson's victory in the race. After Wilkinson's election as governor, he restored Chandler's voting rights on the University of Kentucky's board of trustees. (In 1981, Governor <a href="John%20Y.%20Brown%20Jr.">John Y. Brown Jr.</a> had designated Chandler an "honorary," non-voting, member of the board.) While discussing the University of Kentucky's decision to dispose of its investments in <a href="South%20Africa">South Africa</a> at a meeting of the university's board of trustees on April 5, 1988, Chandler remarked, "You know <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>'s all <a href="nigger">nigger</a> now. There aren't any whites." The comment immediately drew calls for Chandler's resignation from the University Senate Council and the <a href="Student%20Government%20Association">Student Government Association</a>, and approximately 50 students marched on university president <a href="David%20Roselle">David Roselle</a>'s office demanding for Chandler to apologize or resign. Commenting on the controversy the next day, Chandler said, "I was raised in a small town in Western Kentucky. There were 400 whites and 400 blacks, and we called them niggers and they didn't mind. And I reverted temporarily, at least, to that expression, and of course, I wish I hadn't." That apology did not satisfy many, and 200 protesters marched onto the <a href="Kentucky%20State%20Capitol">State Capitol</a>, demanding for Wilkinson to remove Chandler from the board. Wilkinson refused to remove Chandler and urged the crowd to forgive him.

Chandler published his autobiography, "Heroes, Plain Folks, and Skunks", in 1989. In an interview with "<a href="The%20Kentucky%20Kernel">The Kentucky Kernel</a>", the University of Kentucky's student newspaper, Chandler was asked about his controversial comments the previous year, which were addressed in the book. Chandler reportedly told the paper, "I said most of the Zimbabweans were niggers and they are niggers." The comment sparked fresh protests and calls for Chandler's resignation. In response to the controversy, Chandler's personal assistant said, "He used the word again in explaining that it was not intended by him to be a racial slur" and called the "Kernel's" story "a complete and total distortion."

Chandler died in Versailles on June 15, 1991, and was buried in the churchyard of Pisgah Presbyterian Church near Versailles. Prior to his death, he had been the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame and was the longest-living former Kentucky governor.

Midshipman

A midshipman is an officer of the junior-most <a href="Military%20rank%23Subordinate/student%20officer">rank</a>, in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>, and many <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">Commonwealth</a> navies. Commonwealth countries which use the rank include <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Navy">Canada</a> (Naval Cadet), <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Australia</a>, <a href="Bangladesh%20Navy">Bangladesh</a>, <a href="Namibian%20Navy">Namibia</a>, <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Navy">New Zealand</a>, <a href="South%20African%20Navy">South Africa</a>, <a href="Indian%20Navy">India</a>, <a href="Pakistan%20Navy">Pakistan</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Singapore%20Navy">Singapore</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20Navy">Sri Lanka</a>, and <a href="Kenya%20Navy">Kenya</a>. 

In the 17th century, a midshipman was a <a href="Naval%20rating">rating</a> for an experienced seaman, and the word derives from the area aboard a ship, <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, either where the original rating worked on the ship, or where he was <a href="Berth%20%28sleeping%29">berthed</a>. Beginning in the 18th century, a commissioned officer candidate was rated as a midshipman, and the seaman rating began to slowly die out. By the <a href="Napoleonic%20era">Napoleonic era</a> (1793–1815), a midshipman was an apprentice officer who had previously served at least three years as a volunteer, officer's servant or able seaman, and was roughly equivalent to a present-day <a href="petty%20officer">petty officer</a> in rank and responsibilities. After serving at least three years as a midshipman or <a href="master%27s%20mate">master's mate</a>, he was eligible to take the examination for <a href="lieutenant%20%28navy%29">lieutenant</a>. Promotion to lieutenant was not automatic, and many midshipmen took positions as master's mates for an increase in pay and responsibility aboard ship. Midshipmen in the United States Navy were trained and served similarly to midshipmen in the Royal Navy, although unlike their counterparts in the Royal Navy, a midshipman was a <a href="warrant%20officer">warrant officer</a> rank until 1912.

During the 19th century, changes in the training of naval officers in both the Royal Navy and the United States Navy led to the replacement of apprenticeship aboard ships with formal schooling in a <a href="Military%20academy">naval college</a>. Midshipman began to mean an officer cadet at a naval college. Trainees now spent around four years in a college and two years at sea prior to promotion to commissioned officer rank. Between the mid-19th and mid-20th centuries, time at sea declined to less than a year as the entry age was increased from 12 to 18.

Ranks equivalent to midshipman exist in many other navies. Using US midshipman or pre-fleet board UK midshipman as the basis for comparison, the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior commissioned officer. Using post-fleet board UK midshipman for comparison, the rank would be the most junior commissioned officer in the rank structure, and similar to a US ensign in role and responsibility. In many <a href="Romance%20language">Romance language</a>s, the literal translation of the local term for "midshipman" into English is "Navy Guard", including the French "garde marine", Spanish "guardia marina", <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> "guarda-marinha", and <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> "guardiamarina". Today, these ranks all refer to naval cadets, but historically they were selected by the monarchy, and were trained mostly on land as soldiers.

The rank of midshipman originated during the <a href="Tudor%20period">Tudor</a> and <a href="Stuart%20period%20%28England%29">Stuart</a> eras, and originally referred to a post for an experienced seaman promoted from the ordinary deck hands, who worked in between the <a href="Main-mast">main</a> and <a href="mizzen%20mast">mizzen</a> masts and had more responsibility than an ordinary seaman, but was not a military officer or an officer in training. The first published use of the term midshipman was in 1662. The word derives from an area aboard a ship, <a href="amidships">amidships</a>, but it refers either to the location where midshipmen worked on the ship, or the location where midshipmen were <a href="Berth%20%28sleeping%29">berthed</a>.

By the 18th century, four types of midshipman existed: midshipman (original rating), <a href="midshipman%20extraordinary">midshipman extraordinary</a>, midshipman (apprentice officer), and <a href="midshipman%20ordinary">midshipman ordinary</a>. Some midshipmen were older men, and while most were officer candidates who failed to pass the lieutenant examination or were passed over for promotion, some members of the original rating served, as late as 1822, alongside apprentice officers without themselves aspiring to a commission. By 1794, all midshipmen were considered officer candidates, and the original rating was phased out.

Beginning in 1661, boys who aspired to become officers were sent by their families to serve on ships with a "letter of service" from the crown, and were paid at the same rate as midshipmen. The letter instructed the admirals and captains that the bearer was to be shown "such kindness as you shall judge fit for a gentleman, both in accommodating him in your ship and in furthering his improvement". Their official rating was <a href="volunteer-per-order">volunteer-per-order</a>, but they were often known as King's letter boys, to distinguish their higher social class from the original midshipman rating.

Beginning in 1677, Royal Navy regulations for promotion to lieutenant required service as a midshipman, and promotion to midshipman required some time at sea. By the Napoleonic era, the regulations required at least three years of services as a midshipman or <a href="master%27s%20mate">master's mate</a> and six years of total sea time. Sea time was earned in various ways, most boys served this period at sea in any lower rating, either as a servant of one of the ship's officers, a volunteer, or a seaman.

By the 1730s, the rating volunteer-per-order was phased out and replaced with a system where prospective midshipmen served as servants for officers. For example, a <a href="Captain%20%28naval%29">captain</a> was allowed four servants for every 100 men aboard his ship; many of these servants were young men destined to become officers.

In 1729, the Royal Naval Academy in <a href="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> – renamed the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Academy">Royal Naval College</a> in 1806 – was founded, for 40 students aged between 13 and 16, who would take three years to complete a course of study defined in an illustrated book, and would earn two years of sea time as part of their studies. The rating of midshipman-by-order, or midshipman ordinary, was used specifically for graduates of the Royal Naval College, to distinguish them from midshipmen who had served aboard ship, who were paid more. The school was unpopular in the Navy, because officers enjoyed the privilege of having servants and preferred the traditional method of training officers via apprenticeship.

In 1794, officers' servants were abolished and a new class of volunteers called 'volunteer class I' was created for boys between the ages of 11 and 13 who were considered future midshipmen and lived in the gunroom on a <a href="ship-of-the-line">ship-of-the-line</a> or with the midshipmen on a <a href="frigate">frigate</a> or smaller vessel. Volunteers were paid £6 per year. By 1816, the rating of midshipman ordinary was phased out, and all apprentice officers were rated as midshipmen.

In the 18th century Royal Navy, rank and position on board ship was defined by a mix of two hierarchies, an official hierarchy of ranks and a conventionally recognized social divide between <a href="gentlemen">gentlemen</a> and non-gentlemen. Boys aspiring for a commission were often called <a href="young%20gentlemen">young gentlemen</a> instead of their <a href="War%20substantive">substantive</a> rating to distinguish their higher social standing from the ordinary sailors. Generally, aboard most warships common seamen berthed in the <a href="gundeck">gundeck</a>, while officers were quartered at the stern. Occasionally, a midshipman would be posted aboard a ship in a lower rating such as <a href="able%20seaman">able seaman</a> but would eat and sleep with his social equals in the <a href="Cockpit%20%28sailing%29">cockpit</a>.

Approximately 50 percent of midshipmen were the sons of professional men, which included the sons of naval officers, and there were notable sailing families throughout the <a href="Age%20of%20Sail">Age of Sail</a>, such as the <a href="James%20Saumarez%2C%201st%20Baron%20de%20Saumarez">Saumarez</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Hood%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Hood">Hood</a>, and <a href="Sir%20Hyde%20Parker%2C%205th%20Baronet">Parker</a> families. The niceties of preferment and promotion made family connections an obvious advantage for prospective officers. Members of the <a href="peerage">peerage</a> and <a href="landed%20gentry">landed gentry</a> formed the next largest group, about 27 percent of officers. The numbers were smaller, but similarly, their connections gave them excellent prospects for promotion, and they had a considerable influence on the Royal Navy. A notable member of this group was Prince William, later <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Early%20life">William IV</a>, who served as a midshipman from 1780–1785. The rest were from commercial or <a href="working%20class">working class</a> backgrounds, and because of the advantages possessed by the nobility and professional sailors, their chances of promotion to lieutenant were slim.

Since most midshipmen were from the gentry or had family connections with sailing ships, many used their connections to have their names placed on a ship's books. The practice, known colloquially as "false muster" was common even though it was technically illegal and frowned upon. This allowed some boys to be promoted to midshipmen, or in some cases lieutenant, without having completed the required amount of time at sea. A notable example was <a href="Thomas%20Cochrane%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Dundonald">Thomas Cochrane</a>, whose uncle had him entered at the age of five; his name was carried on various ships until he was 18 and received his commission.

When <a href="Royal%20Navy%20uniforms%20of%20the%2018th%20and%2019th%20centuries">uniforms</a> were introduced in the Navy in 1748, midshipmen started wearing the same uniform as commissioned officers. They also began wearing their traditional badge of rank, a white patch of cloth with a gold button and a twist of white cord on each side of the coat collar. The uniform emphasized that midshipmen were gentlemen and officers under instruction.

Midshipmen were expected to work on the ship, but were also expected to learn navigation and seamanship. They were expected to have learned already, as able seamen and volunteers, to rig sails, other duties included keeping watch, relaying messages between decks, supervising <a href="Artillery%20battery%23Naval%20usage">gun batteries</a>, commanding small boats, and taking command of a sub-division of the ship's company under the supervision of one of the lieutenants. On smaller ships, midshipmen were instructed by a senior master's mate, often a <a href="passed%20midshipman">passed midshipman</a>, who taught them mathematics, navigation, and sailing lore. Larger ships would carry a <a href="schoolmaster">schoolmaster</a>, who was rated as a midshipman but usually was a civilian like the <a href="chaplain">chaplain</a>. Midshipmen were expected to keep detailed navigational logs, which were shown to the captain to assess their progress.
Prior to promotion to lieutenant, a commissioned officer candidate in the Royal Navy had to pass a formal examination. Officially, a prospective lieutenant was at least 19, and was expected to produce proof of his service, which would include certificates from his commanders and journals kept while a midshipman. However, most midshipmen aspired to take the <a href="Lieutenant%20%28U.S.%20Navy%29">lieutenant</a> examination at age 17 or 18, and the typical age of a midshipman was between 15 and 22. The candidate was summoned before a board of three captains and questioned about <a href="seamanship">seamanship</a>, <a href="navigation">navigation</a>, and <a href="discipline">discipline</a>. The board would ask questions such as: 
An enemy is observed; give orders for clearing your ship, and make all the necessary preparations for engaging.

Like the board, which might be an "ad hoc" affair, the actual exam questions were not standardized and their content depended mostly on individual captains. In seamanship, the candidate was expected to be able to <a href="Rope%20splicing">splice ropes</a>, <a href="Reefing">reef a sail</a>, <a href="Sailing">work a ship in sailing</a> and <a href="shift%20his%20tides">shift his tides</a>. In navigation, he was expected to be able to keep a reckoning of the ship's way by <a href="plane%20sailing">plane sailing</a>, to use <a href="Mercator%20projection">Mercator projection</a> maps and <a href="Navigation%23Celestial%20navigation">observation of the sun and stars</a> to determine the course and position of the ship, and to understand the <a href="Magnetic%20declination">variation of the compass</a>. He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an <a href="able%20seaman">able seaman</a> and midshipman.

Failure usually meant six more months of sea service before the examination could again be attempted. Some men never passed it. Successful completion made the midshipman a 'passed midshipman'. From the 18th century until the second half of the 19th century, a midshipman in the Royal Navy who passed the lieutenant's examination did not automatically receive a commission. Midshipmen with political connections were promoted first, while others would wait their turn on a roster. During wartime, when large numbers of ships and men might be lost in battle, most passed midshipman would be promoted in a year or two, but during peacetime the wait might be so long that the midshipman would eventually be considered too old and lose his chance for a commission.

Passed midshipmen awaiting promotion often elected to become master's mates, a high-ranking petty officer who assisted the <a href="Master%20%28naval%29">master</a> with his duties, served on watch as deputy to the lieutenants, and commanded small boats. A midshipman who became master's mate earned an increase in pay from £2 5s to £3 16s per month but initially reduced his chances at a commission because master's mates, along with masters, were assumed to have a working-class background. Over time, however, appointment to master's mate became considered a normal part of the path to a commission; the situation caused some confusion during the last part of the 18th century, when two parallel roles – master's mates trying to become masters, and former midshipmen working toward a commission – held the same title and responsibilities aboard ship.

By the first years of the 19th century, the term 'mate', without the prefix master's, was used for <a href="passed%20midshipman">passed midshipmen</a>, to distinguish them from master's mates who had not served as midshipmen. In 1824, the rating of master's assistant replaced master's mate, and mate continued to be used unofficially by passed midshipmen. These changes helped eliminate the confusion caused by the mingling of midshipmen in the navigator's branch. In 1838 a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a>, presided over by the <a href="Arthur%20Wellesley%2C%201st%20Duke%20of%20Wellington">Duke of Wellington</a>, recommended the institution of the rank of mate as an official step between midshipman and lieutenant. In 1861 mate was abolished in favor of <a href="sub-lieutenant">sub-lieutenant</a>.

When Congress created the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> in 1794, midshipman was listed as a rank of warrant officer in the <a href="Naval%20Act%20of%201794">Naval Act of 1794</a>, and they were appointed by the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President of the United States</a>. Midshipmen had similar duties and responsibilities as in the Royal Navy, and were typically young men between the age of 14 and 22 in training to become a naval officer. "Passed midshipman" was first used in 1819, and was an official rank of the US Navy.

During the long period of peace between 1815 and 1846 midshipmen had few opportunities for promotion, and their warrants were often obtained via <a href="patronage">patronage</a>. The poor quality of officer training in the US Navy became visible after the <a href="Somers%20Affair">Somers Affair</a>, an alleged <a href="mutiny">mutiny</a> aboard the training ship <a href="USS%20Somers%20%281842%29">USS "Somers"</a> in 1842, and the subsequent execution of midshipman <a href="Philip%20Spencer">Philip Spencer</a>. Spencer had gained his post aboard the "Somers" via the influence of his father, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">United States Secretary of War</a> <a href="John%20C.%20Spencer">John C. Spencer</a>.

The original <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Academy">Royal Naval College</a> closed in 1837, after which the only method for training midshipmen in the Royal Navy was aboard ships. In 1844 the rank of naval cadet was created, and to qualify as a midshipman a candidate had to be 14 years old, successfully pass an admiralty examination and have two years of service as a naval cadet or three years of service in the Navy. A decline in qualified officers prompted the Navy to order training in a ship at anchor for all cadets, which began in 1857 aboard <a href="HMS%20Illustrious%20%281803%29">HMS "Illustrious"</a>, which was replaced by <a href="HMS%20Britannia%20%281820%29">HMS "Britannia"</a> in 1859. "Britannia" was moved to <a href="Portland%20Harbour">Portland</a> in 1862, and to the present location of the <a href="Britannia%20Royal%20Naval%20College">Britannia Royal Naval College</a>, <a href="Dartmouth%2C%20Devon">Dartmouth</a> in 1863.

Beginning in the 1840s, the normal entry age for executive officer cadets, those destined to command ships and fleets, was between 12 and 13, and instruction consisted of two years of classroom training, during which time trainees were rated as naval cadets. Cadets who received a first-class passing grade in studies, seamanship and conduct on their final examination could receive a credit for up to a year of sea time, and could be rated as midshipmen immediately after passing out of the college. After passing out of the college, cadets served aboard a special training vessel for one year. Cadets were then rated as midshipmen, and served aboard the fleet another two years. Midshipmen lived in the gunroom, kept watches, and ran the ship's boats. They received instruction in navigation every day. After five total years of training and having reached the age of 19, the midshipmen were eligible to take the examination for lieutenant. After passing the examination for lieutenant, midshipmen were commissioned as sub-lieutenants, and were transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20College%2C%20Greenwich">Royal Naval College, Greenwich</a>, which opened in 1873 as the 'University of the Navy'.
Beginning in 1903, officer training of military and engineering students was reformed by the <a href="Selborne-Fisher%20scheme">Selborne-Fisher scheme</a>, and engineering and executive officer candidates began to enter the Navy in the same way, which was termed 'Common Entry'. Previously, engineer cadets had been trained separately at the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20Engineering%20College%23Keyham%20College">Royal Naval Engineering College, Keyham</a> which was closed in 1910. In 1903 a new preparatory college was opened at the <a href="Royal%20Naval%20College%2C%20Osborne">Royal Naval College, Osborne</a>, in part of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s favorite residence but not a favorite of her successor <a href="Edward%20VII%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Edward VII</a> who had donated it to the nation in 1902. Training initially consisted of two years at Osborne and two years at Dartmouth as cadets, later four years at Dartmouth, followed by approximately 3 years of sea duty as midshipmen prior to promotion to sub-lieutenant. In 1905, a new building was completed on shore to replace "Britannia", which was named Britannia Royal Naval College. In 1913, increasing demand for officers led to recruitment of 18-year-old graduates of <a href="Independent%20school%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">public school</a>s, which was called 'Special Entry', and was conducted separately from Selborne scheme cadets. Special entry cadets trained for approximately 6 months prior to service in the fleet as midshipmen. When <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> began in 1914, all the cadets at Dartmouth were quickly mobilized as midshipmen in the <a href="Reserve%20Fleet%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Reserve Fleet</a>. During the war, two midshipmen, <a href="George%20Leslie%20Drewry">George Drewry</a> and <a href="Wilfred%20St%20Aubyn%20Malleson">Wilfred Malleson</a> were awarded the <a href="Victoria%20Cross">Victoria Cross</a>, the highest award of the <a href="British%20Commonwealth">British Commonwealth</a> for gallantry, during the <a href="Landing%20at%20Cape%20Helles">Landing at Cape Helles</a>. After World War I ended, opposition to the Selborne-Fisher scheme led to re-segregating executive and engineering officers into separate branches, while common entry and special entry were maintained.

After <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> another series of reforms, influenced by the quality of officers produced by the special entry scheme and other nations' experience with training officer candidates in a university setting, were initiated to increase the quality of officers in the Navy. In 1949 the entry age was increased to 16, and by 1955 the entry age was increased to 18 and entry required a minimum of two <a href="A%20level">A level</a>s. After 1957 midshipmen no longer served in the fleet. In 1972, all cadets became midshipmen when the rank of cadet was abolished.

Congress formally authorized the establishment of the <a href="United%20States%20Military%20Academy">United States Military Academy</a> in 1802, but it took almost 50 years to approve a similar school for naval officers. One major reason for the delay was that Navy leaders preferred the apprenticeship system, citing famous officers such as <a href="Horatio%20Nelson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Nelson">Nelson</a> and the captains of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a> who did not attend a formal naval school. However, after the <a href="Somers%20Affair">Somers Affair</a>, officers realized that the system for training officers had to change to be more efficient.
<a href="George%20Bancroft">George Bancroft</a>, appointed <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> in 1845, decided to work outside of congressional approval and create a new academy for officers. He formed a council led by <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Perry">Commodore Perry</a> to create a new system for training officers, and turned the old <a href="Fort%20Severn">Fort Severn</a> at <a href="Annapolis">Annapolis</a> into a new institution which would be designated as the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> in 1851. Midshipmen studied at the Academy for four years and trained aboard ships each summer. Midshipman began to mean "passed midshipman" at this time, and a student at the Naval Academy was a cadet midshipman. The rank of <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29%23United%20States">ensign</a> was created in 1862, and passed midshipmen were promoted to ensign when vacancies occurred.

In 1865, the Department of Steam Enginery was created and cadet engineers were admitted to the Academy for the first time. In 1874, Congress changed the curriculum to include four years of classroom training and two years of sea duty aboard a regular vessel prior to examinations as warranted midshipmen. In 1882, Congress eliminated the distinction in training between engineer and naval cadets, and designated the student officers as naval cadets; the name reverted to midshipmen in 1902. By an act of Congress passed in 1903, two appointments as midshipmen were allowed for each <a href="United%20States%20Senate">senator</a>, <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">representative</a>, and <a href="Delegate%20%28United%20States%20Congress%29">delegate</a> in Congress, two for the <a href="District%20of%20Columbia">District of Columbia</a>, and five each year at large. In 1912, Congress authorized commissioning midshipmen as ensigns on graduation day, and ended the previously required two years of post-graduation sea service as warrant officers.

In 1930, the Naval Academy received <a href="Educational%20accreditation">accreditation</a> as an approved technological institution. In 1933, a new law enabled the Naval, Military, and Coast Guard Academies to award <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor of science degrees</a>, and the class of 1933 was the first to receive this degree and have it written in the diploma. In 1937, the superintendent of the Naval Academy was granted the authority to award bachelor of science degrees to all living graduates.

As <a href="Dominion">Dominion</a>s of the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a> formed their own navies during the 20th century, further countries began using the rank of midshipman. Today Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Pakistan, India, <a href="Republic%20of%20Singapore%20Navy">Singapore</a>, <a href="Sri%20Lanka%20Navy">Sri Lanka</a>, <a href="Bangladesh%20Navy">Bangladesh</a> and <a href="Kenya%20Navy">Kenya</a> use the rank. Prior to 1968 Canada also used the rank of midshipman, until the <a href="National%20Defence%20Act">National Defence Act</a> consolidated the Royal Canadian Navy with the Army and Air Force into a single military, called the Canadian Forces. As part of the act, the rank of midshipman was replaced with the rank of naval cadet.

In Royal Navy slang, a midshipman is sometimes referred to as a "snotty". Two popular stories give origins for the term: the first claims that it arose from a shortage of handkerchiefs among midshipmen, who would consequently use their sleeves to wipe their noses. Prince William, later <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%23Early%20life">William IV</a>, is sometimes cited as a notorious example of this practice among midshipmen. The other story claims that the three buttons formerly sewn onto midshipmen's jacket cuffs were placed there to prevent them from wiping their noses on their sleeves.

In the modern <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> a midshipman is the lowest rank of officer, and ranks with <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and <a href="pilot%20officer">pilot officer</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> and above all enlisted and <a href="warrant%20rank">warrant rank</a>s. A midshipman's rank insignia, which has changed little since <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic</a> times, is called a "turnback": a white patch of cloth with a gold button and a twist of white cord on each side of the coat collar.

Prospective officers must have at least five <a href="GCSE">GCSE</a>s, including English and maths, plus at least 72 (<a href="UCAS_Tariff%23New_tariff">new tariff</a>) <a href="UCAS">UCAS</a> points from at least two <a href="A%20levels">A levels</a> or other suitable qualifications (each qualification must be over 45 (old tariff) UCAS points). They must pass a two-and-a-half-day assessment, called the <a href="Admiralty%20Interview%20Board">Admiralty Interview Board</a>, and a medical examination. As of 2013, it is no longer the case that those joining the Navy as university graduates start as sub-lieutenants, with non-graduates joining as midshipmen. Graduates and non-graduates all start as midshipmen, and wait to be promoted at the same time.

General basic training (initial officer training) for Royal Navy officers takes place at the <a href="Britannia%20Royal%20Naval%20College">Britannia Royal Naval College</a>. Training takes up to a year depending on specialisation; all midshipmen participate in at least the first two terms, which are 14 weeks each. Until they have completed initial fleet training, both midshipmen and sub-lieutenants at Britannia Royal Naval College do not use their substantive ranks, but instead use the rank of <a href="officer%20cadet">officer cadet</a>.

During the first seven weeks of training, officer cadets learn militarization and sea sense, focusing on learning about the military environment, along with team and leadership skills. During the second seven weeks, officer cadets learn essential sea officer skills, including navigation and the marine environment, strategic studies, and basic sea survival. During the second term officer cadets spend 10 weeks in Initial Fleet Time, serving aboard capital warships as <a href="Naval%20rating">junior ratings</a>. Upon completion of Initial Fleet Time, officer cadets return to Dartmouth for four weeks to complete their final leadership assessment, the Maritime Leadership Exercise (MARL), and a week spent with different areas of the Royal Navy. If they have been successful, officers of all branches then pass out of the college.

Upon completion of initial officer training, university cadet entrants, engineering, logistics and flight specialization officer cadets move to their second phase of training elsewhere within the Royal Navy. <a href="Warfare%20Officer">Midshipmen specializing in warfare</a> remain at the college for the Initial Warfare Officer's Foundation course, which completes part of a <a href="foundation%20degree">foundation degree</a> in naval studies (equating to two thirds of a <a href="bachelor%27s%20degree">bachelor's degree</a>), on completion of initial professional training. Officers can complete degrees via distance learning with the <a href="Open%20University">Open University</a>, although completion is not required.

A midshipman in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Navy">Royal Australian Navy</a> (RAN) holds a commission, which is effective from the date of their appointment. Officer candidates enter the RAN at various ranks depending on previous experience or degree qualifications; graduates from a three-year course, non-degree qualified entrants, and sailor changeovers below the rank of leading seaman enter as midshipman.

On joining the RAN, midshipmen complete six months' initial officer training (New Entry Officers' Course) at the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Naval%20College">Royal Australian Naval College</a>. Following this all members serve six months in the fleet completing Primary Qualification (PQ) continuation training. Direct entry midshipmen continue their normal training and <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force%20Academy">Australian Defence Force Academy</a> (ADFA) entry midshipmen post to Canberra to study at the ADFA in their second year in the Navy. Midshipmen undertake an undergraduate degree over the course of three years, whilst also completing elements of their naval training. ADFA midshipmen are also undergraduate students of the <a href="University%20of%20New%20South%20Wales">University of New South Wales</a> (UNSW). When they graduate from UNSW at ADFA at the completion of their three- or four-year undergraduate program, they do so with a fully recognized degree from UNSW – the same degree received by graduates of UNSW's campus in Sydney. During Single Service Training (SST) at ADFA midshipmen have the opportunity to return to sea during the SST period as well as visiting <a href="Stone%20frigate">shore establishment</a>s for PQ related training.

In the <a href="Royal%20New%20Zealand%20Navy">Royal New Zealand Navy</a> (RNZN), midshipman is the lowest officer rank for officers under training and retained upon completion of initial training by those without a university degree. Unlike officer cadet ranks in the Army, midshipmen are treated as officers but do not hold a commission. The RNZN has approximately 60 midshipman in service a time.

Midshipman begin their career at Junior Officer Common Training, which lasts 23 weeks. After completing their initial training course, midshipmen serve aboard ships for a short time, followed by specialty training for 16 weeks. After approximately two years in the Navy, midshipmen are promoted to ensign. Officers who entered the service with a university degree are promoted to sub-lieutenant after completion of Junior Officer Common Training. Officers without a degree have the option of earning a university degree while serving in the Navy.

A midshipman in the <a href="South%20African%20Navy">South African Navy</a> (SAN) is an officer of the lowest rank. Officer candidates are citizens between the ages of 18 and 22, either in grade 12 or graduated from high school with an academic background in mathematics and science. Cadets initially spend a year training at the <a href="South%20African%20Naval%20College">South African Naval College</a> in <a href="Gordon%27s%20Bay">Gordon's Bay</a>, about 55 km southeast of <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, and upon graduation are commissioned as midshipmen. Midshipmen can then study for three more years at the <a href="South%20African%20Military%20Academy">South African Military Academy</a>, and upon graduation receive a B Mil degree from <a href="Stellenbosch%20University">Stellenbosch University</a>.

Midshipmen in the <a href="Indian%20Navy">Indian Navy</a> begin their career as cadets at the <a href="National%20Defence%20Academy%20%28India%29">National Defence Academy</a> or the <a href="Indian%20Naval%20Academy">Indian Naval Academy</a>, where they study for approximately three years. After graduation they receive a B Tech degree from <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru%20University">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a> and are assigned to training ships for one year. After six months aboard the training ship, the cadets are promoted to midshipman. At the end of their training midshipmen are examined by a board and are cleared for promotion to sub-lieutenant.

Cadets in the <a href="Pakistan%20Navy">Pakistan Navy</a> undertake an initial 18 months' training at the <a href="Pakistan%20Naval%20Academy">Pakistan Naval Academy</a>. They study humanities, engineering, professional and technical subjects. After passing out they are appointed midshipmen, and undertake another six months of training at sea. They are assigned to operations, weapons engineering, mechanical engineering, or logistics. After passing the final fleet examination, they are promoted to the rank of sub-lieutenant.

In the modern United States Navy a midshipman is classified as an officer of the line, though their exercise of authority is limited by their training status. Legally, midshipmen are a special grade of officer that ranks between the senior enlisted grade (E-9) and the lowest grade of <a href="Chief%20warrant%20officer%23United%20States%20Armed%20Forces">chief warrant officer</a> (W-2, <a href="Warrant%20Officer%20%28United%20States%29%23Navy">U. S. Navy</a> or <a href="Warrant%20Officer%20%28United%20States%29%23Coast%20Guard">U.S. Coast Guard</a>) or <a href="Warrant%20Officer%20%28United%20States%29%23Modern%20insignia%20and%20grades">warrant officer</a> (W-1), <a href="Warrant%20Officer%20%28United%20States%29%23Army">U. S. Army</a> or <a href="Warrant%20Officer%20%28United%20States%29%23Marine%20Corps">U. S. Marine Corps</a>.

Students at the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> (USNA) are appointed as midshipmen, United States Navy by the <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a>. Students in the <a href="Naval%20Reserve%20Officer%20Training%20Corps">Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps</a> (NROTC) are appointed as midshipmen, <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20Reserve">United States Navy Reserve</a> by the Secretary of the Navy. Students at the <a href="United%20States%20Merchant%20Marine%20Academy">United States Merchant Marine Academy</a> (USMMA) are appointed as midshipmen in the United States Navy Reserve. The student body at the USNA is the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy%23Rank%20structure">Brigade of Midshipmen</a> and the student body at the USMMA is the Regiment of Midshipmen.

Generally, a nomination from a member of Congress or the <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president</a> is required to receive an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. A nomination does not guarantee an appointment; in a typical year about 38% of nominees receive an appointment. Currently each member of Congress and the vice president can have five appointees attending the Naval Academy at any time. Other nomination sources include the secretary of the Navy, who may appoint 170 enlisted members of the regular and reserve Navy and Marine Corps to the Naval Academy each year, and the president may nominate an unlimited number of children of career military personnel for up to 100 appointments each year. Additionally, children of <a href="Medal%20of%20Honor">Medal of Honor</a> recipients and select cadets of JROTC Honor Unit with Distinction units do not need a nomination but need only qualify for admission. The United States Merchant Marine Academy only accepts nominations from members of Congress. There are no Presidential, Vice-Presidential, military-affiliated, JROTC-honor unit, ROTC or Unit Commander, or Medal of Honor nominations permitted to the USMMA.

Midshipmen at the US Naval Academy, US Merchant Marine Academy and in the NROTC wear <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy%23Uniforms">uniforms</a> that comply with standards established for commissioned officers of the Navy, with shoulder board and sleeve insignia varying by school year or midshipman officer rank as prescribed by Chapter 6 of Navy Uniform Regulations. Midshipmen wear gold fouled anchors as the primary insignia on caps and shoulder boards and gold plain anchors as collar insignia on <a href="Dress%20uniform">service dress</a> and <a href="full%20dress">full dress</a> uniforms. Marine option midshipmen in the NROTC wear gold <a href="Eagle%2C%20Globe%2C%20and%20Anchor">Eagle, Globe and Anchor</a> insignia in place of the anchor insignia worn by other midshipmen.

Midshipmen at the US Naval Academy study a core curriculum of engineering, natural sciences, the humanities, and social sciences and participate in a required "surface cruise" with an active vessel during the summer. Upon graduation, midshipmen are commissioned as <a href="Ensign%20%28rank%29">ensign</a>s in the Navy or <a href="Second%20lieutenant%23United_States">second lieutenant</a>s in the Marine Corps.

Midshipmen at the <a href="United%20States%20Merchant%20Marine%20Academy">United States Merchant Marine Academy</a> study a similar core curriculum, except they are split into deck (navigation oriented) and engineering programs. Additionally, they spend a year at sea working as cadets on U.S. flagged merchant ships, visiting ports around the world. At graduation they have two options: (1) a job in the maritime industry ashore or sailing aboard commercial vessels plus a naval reserve commission, or (2) an active-duty commission in any of the <a href="United%20States%20Uniformed%20Services">United States Uniformed Services</a> (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps Coast Guard, <a href="NOAA%20Commissioned%20Officer%20Corps">National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration</a>, or <a href="United%20States%20Public%20Health%20Service%20Commissioned%20Corps">United States Public Health Service</a>) as an ensign or second lieutenant.
Today, ranks equivalent to midshipman exist in many countries. Using U.S. midshipman or pre-fleet board UK midshipman as the basis for comparison, the equivalent rank would be a naval cadet in training to become a junior commissioned officer. Using post-fleet board UK midshipman for comparison, the rank would be the most junior commissioned officer in the rank structure, and similar to a U.S. ensign in role and responsibility.

The Dutch navy has since the early 17th century included a midshipman rank which literally means 'young gentleman' (); today, "adelborsten" train at the <a href="Royal%20Netherlands%20Naval%20College">Royal Netherlands Naval College</a> () for 3 years. Officer cadets in the German navy begin their training at the <a href="Naval%20Academy%20M%C3%BCrwik">Naval Academy Mürwik</a> () in <a href="Flensburg">Flensburg</a>-<a href="M%C3%BCrwik">Mürwik</a> holding enlisted ranks with the qualifier officer candidate (), abbreviated as OA. After about a year, they are promoted to "Seekadetten", equivalent to the <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a> (NCO) rank Mate (), and move to the <a href="University%20of%20the%20German%20Federal%20Armed%20Forces">University of the German Federal Armed Forces</a>. About nine months later, they are promoted to "Fähnrich zur See" rank, equivalent to the NCO rank Boatswain (). After 30 months of total training they are promoted to the final officer candidate rank, "Oberfähnrich zur See", equivalent to the NCO rank "Hauptbootsmann", and after about 4 years of total training graduate with a bachelor's degree.

In many romance languages, the literal translation of the local term for "midshipman" into English is "Navy Guard", including the French "garde-marine", Spanish "guardia marina", <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> "guarda-marinha", and <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a> "guardiamarina", and in most cases the term refers to the lowest ranking commissioned naval officer. The French rank of "garde de la marine" was established in 1670, when an office of the monarchy selected young gentlemen from the nobility to serve the King in the <a href="Gardes%20de%20la%20Marine">Gardes de la Marine</a>. The concept of the "Gardes" was borrowed from the various guards units within the <a href="Maison%20militaire%20du%20roi%20de%20France">Maison militaire du roi de France</a>. In 1686 these guards were organized into companies of cadets at the ports of <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, <a href="Rochefort%2C%20Charente-Maritime">Rochefort</a> and <a href="Toulon">Toulon</a>. Unlike midshipmen in the Royal Navy, the "Gardes" trained mostly on shore and focused on military drill and theory rather than practical skills in gunnery, navigation and seamanship. After the succession of the <a href="House%20of%20Bourbon">Bourbon</a> <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Spain">Philip V of Spain</a> to the Spanish throne, the French system of naval officer education spread to Spain. The Spanish navy created the rank of "guardia marina" in 1717, with the formation at Cadiz of the Royal Company of Midshipmen ().

By restricting the French officer corps to members of the nobility, there were not enough "Gardes" to man all of the ships during wartime. To fill the gaps, volunteers were temporarily recruited from the merchant service; they were allowed to hold permanent rank in the navy starting in 1763. These professional officers wore blue uniforms to distinguish them from the "Gardes de la Marine" who wore red uniforms. After the revolution, the royal connotations of the term "garde marine" led to its replacement with "aspirant" (officer cadet), and later "élèves de la Marine" (naval officer candidate). Contemporary French naval officer training still reflects this structure: students at the begin their first year as "", are promoted in their second year to "", and in their third year are commissioned as an acting sub-lieutenant (). In a modern French-English dictionary, "élève officier" translates to midshipman, but both the historical term "garde-marine" and the modern term for an officer candidate, "aspirant", are also equivalent to midshipman.

Chinese classifier

The modern <a href="varieties%20of%20Chinese">Chinese varieties</a> make frequent use of what are called <a href="classifier%20%28linguistics%29">classifier</a>s or <a href="measure%20word">measure word</a>s. One of the basic uses of classifiers is in <a href="noun%20phrase">phrases</a> in which a <a href="noun">noun</a> is qualified by a <a href="numeral%20%28linguistics%29">numeral</a>. When a phrase such as "one person" or "three books" is translated into Chinese, it is normally necessary to insert an appropriate classifier between the numeral and the noun. For example, in <a href="Standard%20Mandarin">Standard Mandarin</a>, the first of these phrases would be  "yí rén", where "yī" means "one", "rén" means "person", and "gè" is the required classifier. There are also other grammatical contexts in which classifiers are used, including after the <a href="demonstrative">demonstrative</a>s 这 (這) "zhè" ("this") and 那 "nà" ("that"); however, when a noun stands alone without any such qualifier, no classifier is needed. There are also various other uses of classifiers: for example, when placed after a noun rather than before it, or when repeated, a classifier signifies a plural or indefinite quantity.

The terms "classifier" and "measure word" are frequently used interchangeably (as equivalent to the Chinese term () "liàngcí", which literally means "measure word"). Sometimes, however, the two are distinguished, with "classifier" denoting a particle without any particular meaning of its own, as in the example above, and "measure word" denoting a word for a particular quantity or measurement of something, such as "drop", "cupful", or "liter". The latter type also includes certain words denoting lengths of time, units of currency, etc. These two types are alternatively called "count-classifier" and "mass-classifier", since the first type can only meaningfully be used with <a href="count%20noun">count noun</a>s, while the second is used particularly with <a href="mass%20noun">mass noun</a>s. However, the grammatical behavior of words of the two types is largely identical.

Most nouns have one or more particular classifiers associated with them, often depending on the nature of the things they denote. For example, many nouns denoting flat objects such as tables, papers, beds, and benches use the classifier  () "zhāng", whereas many long and thin objects use  () "tiáo". The total number of classifiers in Chinese may be put at anywhere from a few dozen to several hundred, depending on how they are counted. The classifier (), pronounced or in Mandarin, apart from being the standard classifier for many nouns, also serves as a "general classifier", which may often (but not always) be used in place of other classifiers; in informal and spoken language, native speakers tend to use this classifier far more than any other, even though they know which classifier is "correct" when asked. Mass-classifiers might be used with all sorts of nouns with which they make sense: for example,  "hé" ("box") may be used to denote boxes of objects, such as lightbulbs or books, even though those nouns would be used with their own appropriate count-classifiers if being counted as individual objects. Researchers have differing views as to how classifier–noun pairings arise: some regard them as being based on innate <a href="semantics">semantic</a> features of the noun (for example, all nouns denoting "long" objects take a certain classifier because of their inherent longness), while others see them as motivated more by analogy to <a href="Prototype%20theory">prototypical</a> pairings (for example, "dictionary" comes to take the same classifier as the more common word "book"). There is some variation in the pairings used, with speakers of <a href="Varieties%20of%20Chinese">different dialects</a> often using different classifiers for the same item. Some linguists have proposed that the use of classifier phrases may be guided less by grammar and more by stylistic or <a href="Pragmatics%20%28linguistics%29">pragmatic</a> concerns on the part of a speaker who may be trying to <a href="Focus%20%28linguistics%29">foreground</a> new or important information.

Many other languages of the <a href="Mainland%20Southeast%20Asia%20linguistic%20area">Mainland Southeast Asia linguistic area</a> exhibit similar classifier systems, leading to speculation about the origins of the Chinese system. Ancient classifier-like constructions, which used a repeated noun rather than a special classifier, are attested in <a href="Old%20Chinese">Old Chinese</a> as early as 1400 BCE, but true classifiers did not appear in these phrases until much later. Originally, classifiers and numbers came after the noun rather than before, and probably moved before the noun sometime after 500 BCE. The use of classifiers did not become a mandatory part of <a href="Old%20Chinese">Old Chinese</a> grammar until around 1100 CE. Some nouns became associated with specific classifiers earlier than others; the earliest probably being nouns that signified culturally valued items such as horses and poems. Many words that are classifiers today started out as full nouns; in some cases their meanings have been gradually <a href="Semantic%20bleaching">bleached</a> away so that they are now used only as classifiers.

In Chinese, a <a href="numeral%20%28linguistics%29">numeral</a> cannot usually quantify a <a href="noun">noun</a> by itself; instead, the language relies on <a href="classifier%20%28linguistics%29">classifier</a>s, commonly also referred to as <a href="measure%20word">measure word</a>s. When a noun is preceded by a number, a <a href="demonstrative">demonstrative</a> such as "this" or "that", or certain <a href="quantifier%20%28linguistics%29">quantifiers</a> such as "every", a classifier must normally be inserted before the noun. Thus, while English speakers say "one person" or "this person", <a href="Mandarin%20Chinese">Mandarin Chinese</a> speakers say  ("yí rén", one- person) or  ("zhè rén", this- person), respectively. If a noun is preceded by both a demonstrative and a number, the demonstrative comes first. (This is just as in English, e.g. "these three cats".) If an <a href="adjective">adjective</a> modifies the noun, it typically comes after the classifier and before the noun. The general structure of a classifier phrase is
demonstrative – number –  – adjective – noun

The tables below give examples of common types of classifier phrases. While most English nouns do not require classifiers or measure words (in English, both “five coffees” and “five cups of coffee” are grammatically correct), nearly all Chinese nouns do; thus, in the first table, phrases that have no classifier in English have one in Chinese.

On the other hand, when a noun is not counted or introduced with a demonstrative, a classifier is not necessary: for example, there is a classifier in  ("sān liàng chē", three- car, "three cars") but not in  ("wǒ-de chē", me-possessive car, "my car"). Furthermore, numbers and demonstratives are often not required in Chinese, so speakers may choose not to use one—and thus not to use a classifier. For example, to say "<a href="Zhang%20San">Zhangsan</a> turned into a tree", both  ("Zhāngsān biànchéng -le yì shù", Zhangsan become PAST one tree) and  ("Zhāngsān biànchéng -le shù", Zhangsan become PAST tree) are acceptable. The use of classifiers after demonstratives is in fact optional.

It is also possible for a classifier alone to qualify a noun, the numeral ("one") being omitted, as in 买马 "mǎi mǎ" "buy horse", i.e. "buy a horse".

In addition to their uses with numbers and demonstratives, classifiers have some other functions. A classifier placed after a noun expresses a plural or indefinite quantity of it. For example,  ("shū-", book-) means "the books" (e.g. on a shelf, or in a library), whereas the standard pre-nominal construction  ("yī shū", one- book) means "one book".

Many classifiers may be <a href="Reduplication">reduplicated</a> to mean "every". For example,  ("- rén", - person) signifies "every person".

Finally, a classifier used along with 一 ("yī", "one") and after a noun conveys a meaning close to "all of" or "the entire" or "a ___full of". The sentence  ("tiānkōng yī yún", sky one- cloud), meaning "the sky was full of clouds", uses the classifier  ("piàn", slice), which refers to the sky, not the clouds.

The vast majority of classifiers are those that count or classify nouns ("nominal classifiers", as in all the examples given so far, as opposed to <a href="%23Verbal%20classifiers">"verbal classifiers"</a>). These are further subdivided into "count-classifiers" and "mass-classifiers", described below. In everyday speech, people often use the term "measure word", or its literal Chinese equivalent  "liàngcí", to cover all Chinese count-classifiers and mass-classifiers, but the types of words grouped under this term are not all the same. Specifically, the various types of classifiers exhibit numerous differences in meaning, in the kinds of words they attach to, and in <a href="Syntax">syntactic</a> behavior.

Chinese has a large number of nominal classifiers; estimates of the number in Mandarin range from "several dozen" or "about 50", to over 900. The range is so large because some of these estimates include all types of classifiers while others include only count-classifiers, and because the idea of what constitutes a "classifier" <a href="%23other%20names">has changed over time</a>. Today, regular dictionaries include 120 to 150 classifiers; the 8822-word "Syllabus of Graded Words and Characters for Chinese Proficiency" () lists 81; and a 2009 list compiled by Gao Ming and Barbara Malt includes 126. The number of classifiers that are in everyday, informal use, however, may be lower: linguist <a href="Mary%20Erbaugh">Mary Erbaugh</a> has claimed that about two dozen "core classifiers" account for most classifier use. As a whole, though, the classifier system is so complex that specialized classifier dictionaries have been published.

Within the set of nominal classifiers, linguists generally draw a distinction between "count-classifiers" and "mass-classifiers". True "count-classifiers" are used for naming or counting a single <a href="count%20noun">count noun</a>, and have no direct translation in English; for example,  ("yì shū", one- book) can only be translated in English as "one book" or "a book". Furthermore, count-classifiers cannot be used with <a href="mass%20noun">mass noun</a>s: just as an English speaker cannot ordinarily say *"five muds", a Chinese speaker cannot say * ("wǔ nì", five- mud). For such mass nouns, one must use "mass-classifiers".

Mass-classifiers (true <a href="measure%20word">measure word</a>s) do not pick out inherent properties of an individual noun like count-classifiers do; rather, they lump nouns into countable units. Thus, mass-classifiers can generally be used with multiple types of nouns; for example, while the mass-classifier  ("hé", box) can be used to count boxes of lightbulbs ( "yì dēngpào", "one of lightbulbs") or of books ( "yì jiàocái", "one of textbooks"), each of these nouns must use a different count-classifier when being counted by itself ( "yì dēngpào" "one lightbulb"; vs.  "yì jiàocái" "one textbook"). While count-classifiers have no direct English translation, mass-classifiers often do: phrases with count-classifiers such as  ("yí rén", one- person) can only be translated as "one person" or "a person", whereas those with mass-classifiers such as  ("yì rén", one--person) can be translated as "a crowd of people". All languages, including English, have mass-classifiers, but count-classifiers are unique to certain "classifier languages", and are not a part of English grammar apart from a few exceptional cases such as head of livestock.

Within the range of mass-classifiers, authors have proposed subdivisions based on the manner in which a mass-classifier organizes the noun into countable units. One of these is "measurement units" (also called "standard measures"), which all languages must have in order to measure items; this category includes units such as kilometers, liters, or pounds (see <a href="List%20of%20Chinese%20classifiers%23Measurement%20units">list</a>). Like other classifiers, these can also stand without a noun; thus, for example,  ("bàng", pound) may appear as both  ("sān ròu", "three of meat") or just  ("sān ", "three ", never * "sān "). Units of currency behave similarly: for example, 十 ("shí ", "ten "), which is short for (for example) 十人民币 ("shí rénmínbì", "ten of <a href="renminbi">renminbi</a>"). Other proposed types of mass-classifiers include "collective" mass-classifiers, such as  ("yì rén", "a of people"), which group things less precisely; and "container" mass-classifiers which group things by containers they come in, as in  ("yì zhōu", "a of porridge") or  ("yì táng", "a of sugar").

The difference between count-classifiers and mass-classifiers can be described as one of quantifying versus categorizing: in other words, mass-classifiers "create" a unit by which to measure something (i.e. boxes, groups, chunks, pieces, etc.), whereas count-classifiers simply "name" an existing item. Most words can appear with both count-classifiers and mass-classifiers; for example, pizza can be described as both ("yì bǐsà", "one pizza", literally "one of pizza"), using a count-classifier, and as ("yí bǐsà", "one of pizza"), using a mass-classifier. In addition to these semantic differences, there are differences in the grammatical behaviors of count-classifiers and mass-classifiers; for example, mass-classifiers may be modified by a small set of adjectives (as in  "yí dà rén", "a big of people"), whereas count-classifiers usually may not (for example, * "yí dà rén" is never said for "a big person"; instead the adjective must modify the noun:  "yí dà rén"). Another difference is that count-classifiers may often be replaced by a "general" classifier (), "gè" with no apparent change in meaning, whereas mass-classifiers may not. Syntacticians <a href="Lisa%20Cheng%20%28linguist%29">Lisa Cheng</a> and Rint Sybesma propose that count-classifiers and mass-classifiers have different underlying syntactic structures, with count-classifiers forming "classifier phrases", and mass-classifiers being a sort of <a href="relative%20clause">relative clause</a> that only "looks" like a classifier phrase. The distinction between count-classifiers and mass-classifiers is often unclear, however, and other linguists have suggested that count-classifiers and mass-classifiers may not be fundamentally different. They posit that "count-classifier" and "mass-classifier" are the extremes of a continuum, with most classifiers falling somewhere in between.

There is a set of "<a href="List%20of%20Chinese%20classifiers%23Verbal%20classifiers">verbal classifiers</a>" used specifically for counting the number of times an action occurs, rather than counting a number of items; this set includes "cì", / "biàn", "huí", and "xià", which all roughly translate to "times". For example,  ("wǒ qù-guo sān Běijīng", I go-PAST three- Beijing, "I have been to Beijing three "). These words can also form compound classifiers with certain nouns, as in 人次 "rén cì" "person-time", which can be used to count (for example) visitors to a museum in a year (where visits by the same person on different occasions are counted separately).

Another type of verbal classifier indicates the tool or implement used to perform the action. An example is found in the sentence 他踢了我一脚 "tā tī le wǒ yī jiǎo" "he kicked me", or more literally "he kicked me one foot". The word 脚 "jiǎo", which usually serves as a simple noun meaning "foot", here functions as a verbal classifier reflecting the tool (namely the foot) used to perform the kicking action.

Different classifiers often correspond to different particular nouns. For example, books generally take the classifier  "běn", flat objects take  () "zhāng", animals take  () "zhī", machines take  "tái", large buildings and mountains take  "zuò", etc. Within these categories are further subdivisions—while most animals take  () "zhī", domestic animals take  () "tóu", long and flexible animals take  () "tiáo", and horses take  "pǐ". Likewise, while long things that are flexible (such as ropes) often take  () "tiáo", long things that are rigid (such as sticks) take  "gēn", unless they are also round (like pens or cigarettes), in which case in some dialects they take  "zhī". Classifiers also vary in how specific they are; some (such as  "duǒ" for flowers and other similarly clustered items) are generally only used with one type, whereas others (such as  () "tiáo" for long and flexible things, one-dimensional things, or abstract items like news reports) are much less restricted. Furthermore, there is not a one-to-one relationship between nouns and classifiers: the same noun may be paired with different classifiers in different situations. The specific factors that govern which classifiers are paired with which nouns have been a subject of debate among linguists.

While mass-classifiers do not necessarily bear any semantic relationship to the noun with which they are used (e.g. "box" and "book" are not related in meaning, but one can still say "a box of books"), count-classifiers do. The precise nature of that relationship, however, is not certain, since there is so much variability in how objects may be organized and categorized by classifiers. Accounts of the semantic relationship may be grouped loosely into "categorical" theories, which propose that count-classifiers are matched to objects solely on the basis of inherent features of those objects (such as length or size), and "prototypical" theories, which propose that people learn to match a count-classifier to a specific prototypical object and to other objects that are like that prototype.

The categorical, "<a href="Categories%20%28Aristotle%29">classical</a>" view of classifiers was that each classifier represents a category with a set of conditions; for example, the classifier  () "tiáo" would represent a category defined as all objects that meet the conditions of being long, thin, and one-dimensional—and nouns using that classifier must fit all the conditions with which the category is associated. Some common semantic categories into which count-classifiers have been claimed to organize nouns include the categories of shape (long, flat, or round), size (large or small), consistency (soft or hard), <a href="animacy">animacy</a> (human, animal, or object), and function (tools, vehicles, machines, etc.).

On the other hand, proponents of <a href="prototype%20theory">prototype theory</a> propose that count-classifiers may not have innate definitions, but are associated with a noun that is prototypical of that category, and nouns that have a "family resemblance" with the prototype noun will want to use the same classifier. For example, "horse" in Chinese uses the classifier  "pǐ", as in  ("sān mǎ", "three horses")—in modern Chinese the word has no meaning. Nevertheless, nouns denoting animals that look like horses will often also use this same classifier, and native speakers have been found to be more likely to use the classifier the closer an animal looks to a horse. Furthermore, words that do not meet the "criteria" of a semantic category may still use that category because of their <a href="association%20%28psychology%29">association</a> with a prototype. For example, the classifier  () "kē" is used for small round items, as in  ("yì zǐdàn", "one bullet"); when words like  ("yuánzǐdàn", "atomic bomb") were later introduced into the language they also used this classifier, even though they are not small and round—therefore, their classifier must have been assigned because of the words' association with the word for bullet, which acted as a "prototype". This is an example of "generalization" from prototypes: Erbaugh has proposed that when children learn count-classifiers, they go through stages, first learning a classifier-noun pair only (such as  " yú", -fish), then using that classifier with multiple nouns that are similar to the prototype (such as other types of fish), then finally using that set of nouns to generalize a semantic feature associated with the classifier (such as length and flexibility) so that the classifier can then be used with new words that the person encounters.

Some classifier-noun pairings are arbitrary, or at least appear to modern speakers to have no semantic motivation. For instance, the classifier  "bù" may be used for movies and novels, but also for cars and telephones. Some of this arbitrariness may be due to what linguist <a href="James%20Tai">James Tai</a> refers to as "fossilization", whereby a count-classifier loses its meaning through historical changes but remains paired with some nouns. For example, the classifier  "pǐ" used for horses is meaningless today, but in <a href="Classical%20Chinese">Classical Chinese</a> may have referred to a "team of two horses", a pair of horse skeletons, or the pairing between man and horse. Arbitrariness may also arise when a classifier is <a href="Loanword">borrowed</a>, along with its noun, from a dialect in which it has a clear meaning to one in which it does not. In both these cases, the use of the classifier is remembered more by association with certain "prototypical" nouns (such as "horse") rather than by understanding of semantic categories, and thus arbitrariness has been used as an argument in favor of the prototype theory of classifiers. Gao and Malt propose that both the category and prototype theories are correct: in their conception, some classifiers constitute "well-defined categories", others make "prototype categories", and still others are relatively arbitrary.

In addition to the numerous "specific" count-classifiers described above, Chinese has a "general" classifier (), pronounced "gè" in Mandarin. This classifier is used for people, some abstract concepts, and other words that do not have special classifiers (such as 汉堡包 "hànbǎobāo" "hamburger"), and may also be used as a replacement for a specific classifier such as  () "zhāng" or  () "tiáo", especially in informal speech. In Mandarin Chinese, it has been noted as early as the 1940s that the use of is increasing and that there is a general tendency towards replacing specific classifiers with it. Numerous studies have reported that both adults and children tend to use when they do not know the appropriate count-classifier, and even when they do but are speaking quickly or informally. The replacement of a specific classifier with the general is known as classifier "neutralization" ("" in Chinese, literally "classifier 个-ization"). This occurs especially often among children and <a href="Aphasia">aphasics</a> (individuals with damage to language-relevant areas of the brain), although normal speakers also neutralize frequently. It has been reported that most speakers know the appropriate classifiers for the words they are using and believe, when asked, that those classifiers are obligatory, but nevertheless use without even realizing it in actual speech. As a result, in everyday spoken Mandarin the general classifier is "hundreds of times more frequent" than the specialized ones.

Nevertheless, has not completely replaced other count-classifiers, and there are still many situations in which it would be inappropriate to substitute it for the required specific classifier. There may be specific patterns behind which classifier-noun pairs may be "neutralized" to use the general classifier, and which may not. Specifically, words that are most prototypical for their categories, such as "paper" for the category of nouns taking the "flat/square" classifier  () "zhāng", may be less likely to be said with a general classifier.

It is not the case that every noun is only associated with one classifier. Across dialects and speakers there is great variability in the way classifiers are used for the same words, and speakers often do not agree which classifier is best. For example, for cars some people use  "bù", others use  "tái", and still others use  () "liàng"; <a href="Standard%20Cantonese">Cantonese</a> uses  "gaa3". Even within a single dialect or a single speaker, the same noun may take different measure words depending on the style in which the person is speaking, or on different nuances the person wants to convey (for instance, measure words can reflect the speaker's judgment of or opinion about the object). An example of this is the word for person,  "rén", which uses the measure word  () "gè" normally, but uses the measure  "kǒu" when counting number of people in a household, and  "wèi" when being particularly polite or honorific, and  "míng" in formal, written contexts; likewise, a group of people may be referred to by massifiers as ("yì rén", "a of people") or ("yì rén", "a of people"): the first is neutral, whereas the second implies that the people are unruly or otherwise being judged poorly.

Some count-classifiers may also be used with nouns that they are not normally related to, for metaphorical effect, as in  ("yì fánnǎo", "a of worries/troubles"). Finally, a single word may have multiple count-classifiers that convey different meanings altogether—in fact, the choice of a classifier can even influence the meaning of a noun. By way of illustration,  "sān kè" means "three class periods" (as in "I have three classes today"), whereas  "sān kè" means "three courses" (as in "I signed up for three courses this semester"), even though the noun in each sentence is the same.

In research on classifier systems, and Chinese classifiers in particular, it has been asked why count-classifiers (as opposed to mass-classifiers) exist at all. Mass-classifiers are present in all languages since they are the only way to "count" mass nouns that are not naturally divided into units (as, for example, "three of mud" in English; *"three muds" is ungrammatical). On the other hand, count-classifiers are not inherently mandatory, and are absent from most languages. Furthermore, count-classifiers are used with an "unexpectedly low frequency"; in many settings, speakers avoid specific classifiers by just using a bare noun (without a number or demonstrative) or using the general classifier  "gè". Linguists and <a href="Linguistic%20typology">typologists</a> such as <a href="Joseph%20Greenberg">Joseph Greenberg</a> have suggested that specific count-classifiers are semantically "redundant", repeating information present within the noun. Count-classifiers can be used stylistically, though, and can also be used to clarify or limit a speaker's intended meaning when using a vague or ambiguous noun; for example, the noun  "kè" "class" can refer to courses in a semester or specific class periods during a day, depending on whether the classifier  () "mén" or  () "jié" is used.

One proposed explanation for the existence of count-classifiers is that they serve more of a cognitive purpose than a practical one: in other words, they provide a linguistic way for speakers to organize or categorize real objects. An alternative account is that they serve more of a <a href="discourse">discursive</a> and <a href="pragmatics%20%28linguistics%29">pragmatic</a> function (a communicative function when people interact) rather than an abstract function within the mind. Specifically, it has been proposed that count-classifiers might be used to mark new or unfamiliar objects within a discourse, to introduce major characters or items in a story or conversation, or to <a href="focus%20%28linguistics%29">foreground</a> important information and objects by making them bigger and more <a href="salience%20%28semiotics%29">salient</a>. In this way, count-classifiers might not serve an abstract grammatical or cognitive function, but may help in communication by making important information more noticeable and drawing attention to it.

<a href="Historical%20linguistics">Historical linguists</a> have found that phrases consisting of nouns and numbers went through several structural changes in <a href="Old%20Chinese">Old Chinese</a> and <a href="Middle%20Chinese">Middle Chinese</a> before classifiers appeared in them. The earliest forms may have been "Number – Noun", like English (i.e. "five horses"), and the less common "Noun – Number" ("horses five"), both of which are attested in the <a href="oracle%20bone%20script">oracle bone script</a>s of Pre-Archaic Chinese (circa 1400 BCE to 1000 BCE). The first constructions resembling classifier constructions were "Noun – Number – Noun" constructions, which were also extant in Pre-Archaic Chinese but less common than "Number – Noun". In these constructions, sometimes the first and second nouns were identical ("N1 – Number – N1", as in "horses five horses") and other times the second noun was different, but semantically related ("N1 – Number – N2"). According to some historical linguists, the "N2" in these constructions can be considered an early form of count-classifier and has even been called an "echo classifier"; this speculation is not universally agreed on, though. Although true count-classifiers had not appeared yet, mass-classifiers were common in this time, with constructions such as "wine – six – " (the word  "yǒu" represented a wine container) meaning "six "yǒu" of wine". Examples such as this suggest that mass-classifiers predate count-classifiers by several centuries, although they did not appear in the same word order as they do today.

It is from this type of structure that count-classifiers may have arisen, originally replacing the second noun (in structures where there was a noun rather than a mass-classifier) to yield "Noun – Number – Classifier". That is to say, constructions like "horses five horses" may have been replaced by ones like "horses five ", possibly for stylistic reasons such as avoiding repetition. Another reason for the appearance of count-classifiers may have been to avoid confusion or ambiguity that could have arisen from counting items using only mass-classifiers—i.e. to clarify when one is referring to a single item and when one is referring to a measure of items.

Historians agree that at some point in history the order of words in this construction shifted, putting the noun at the end rather than beginning, like in the present-day construction "Number – Classifier – Noun". According to historical linguist Alain Peyraube, the earliest occurrences of this construction (albeit with mass-classifiers, rather than count-classifiers) appear in the late portion of <a href="Old%20Chinese">Old Chinese</a> (500 BCE to 200 BCE). At this time, the "Number – Mass-classifier" portion of the "Noun – Number – Mass-classifier" construction was sometimes shifted in front of the noun. Peyraube speculates that this may have occurred because it was gradually reanalyzed as a <a href="modifier%20%28linguistics%29">modifier</a> (like an adjective) for the head noun, as opposed to a simple repetition as it originally was. Since Chinese generally places modifiers before modified, as does English, the shift may have been prompted by this reanalysis. By the early part of the <a href="Common%20Era">Common Era</a>, the nouns appearing in "classifier position" were beginning to lose their meaning and become true classifiers. Estimates of when classifiers underwent the most development vary: <a href="Wang%20Li%20%28linguist%29">Wang Li</a> claims their period of major development was during the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a> (206 BCE – 220 CE), whereas Liu Shiru estimates that it was the <a href="Southern%20and%20Northern%20Dynasties">Southern and Northern Dynasties</a> period (420 – 589 CE), and Peyraube chooses the <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a> (618 – 907 CE). Regardless of when they developed, Wang Lianqing claims that they did not become grammatically mandatory until sometime around the 11th century.

Classifier systems in many nearby languages and language groups (such as <a href="Vietnamese%20language">Vietnamese</a> and the <a href="Tai%20languages">Tai languages</a>) are very similar to the Chinese classifier system in both grammatical structure and the parameters along which some objects are grouped together. Thus, there has been some debate over which language family first developed classifiers and which ones then borrowed them—or whether classifier systems were native to all these languages and developed more through repeated <a href="language%20contact">language contact</a> throughout history.

Most modern count-classifiers are derived from words that originally were free-standing nouns in older varieties of Chinese, and have since been <a href="Grammaticalization">grammaticalized</a> to become <a href="bound%20morphemes">bound morphemes</a>. In other words, count-classifiers tend to come from words that once had specific meaning but lost it (a process known as <a href="semantic%20bleaching">semantic bleaching</a>). Many, however, still have related forms that work as nouns all by themselves, such as the classifier  () "dài" for long, ribbon-like objects: the modern word  "dàizi" means "ribbon". In fact, the majority of classifiers can also be used as other parts of speech, such as nouns. Mass-classifiers, on the other hand, are more transparent in meaning than count-classifiers; while the latter have some <a href="Etymology">historical meaning</a>, the former are still full-fledged nouns. For example,  ("bēi", cup), is both a classifier as in  ("yì chá", "a of tea") and the word for a cup as in  ("jiǔbēi", "wine glass").
It was not always the case that every noun required a count-classifier. In many historical varieties of Chinese, use of classifiers was not mandatory, and classifiers are rare in writings that have survived. Some nouns acquired classifiers earlier than others; some of the first documented uses of classifiers were for inventorying items, both in mercantile business and in storytelling. Thus, the first nouns to have count-classifiers paired with them may have been nouns that represent "culturally valued" items such as horses, scrolls, and intellectuals. The special status of such items is still apparent today: many of the classifiers that can only be paired with one or two nouns, such as  "pǐ" for horses and  "shǒu" for songs or poems, are the classifiers for these same "valued" items. Such classifiers make up as much as one-third of the commonly used classifiers today.

Classifiers did not gain official recognition as a <a href="lexical%20category">lexical category</a> (part of speech) until the 20th century. The earliest modern text to discuss classifiers and their use was <a href="Ma%20Jianzhong">Ma Jianzhong</a>'s 1898 "<a href="Mashi%20Wentong">Ma's Basic Principles for Writing Clearly</a>" (). From then until the 1940s, linguists such as Ma, Wang Li, and <a href="Li%20Jinxi">Li Jinxi</a> treated classifiers as just a type of noun that "expresses a quantity". <a href="L%C3%BC%20Shuxiang">Lü Shuxiang</a> was the first to treat them as a separate category, calling them "unit words" ( "dānwèicí") in his 1940s "Outline of Chinese Grammar" () and finally "measure words" ( "liàngcí") in "Grammar Studies" (). He made this separation based on the fact that classifiers were semantically bleached, and that they can be used directly with a number, whereas true nouns need to have a measure word added before they can be used with a number. After this time, other names were also proposed for classifiers: Gao Mingkai called them "noun helper words" ( "zhùmíngcí"), Lu Wangdao "counting markers" ( "jìbiāo"), and Japanese linguist Miyawaki Kennosuke called them "accompanying words" ( "péibàncí"). In the "<a href="Draft%20Plan%20for%20a%20System%20of%20Teaching%20Chinese%20Grammar">Draft Plan for a System of Teaching Chinese Grammar</a>" () adopted by the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> in 1954, Lü's "measure words" ( "liàngcí") was adopted as the official name for classifiers in China. This remains the most common term in use today.

Historically, "gè" was not always the general classifier. Some believe it was originally a noun referring to <a href="bamboo">bamboo</a> stalks, and gradually expanded in use to become a classifier for many things with "vertical, individual, [or] upright qualit[ies]", eventually becoming a general classifier because it was used so frequently with common nouns. The classifier "gè" is actually associated with three different <a href="Homophony">homophonous</a> characters: , (used today as the <a href="Traditional%20Chinese%20character">traditional-character</a> equivalent of ), and . Historical linguist Lianqing Wang has argued that these characters actually originated from different words, and that only had the original meaning of "bamboo stalk". , she claims, was used as a general classifier early on, and may have been derived from the orthographically similar "jiè", one of the earliest general classifiers. later merged with because they were similar in pronunciation and meaning (both used as general classifiers). Likewise, she claims that was also a separate word (with a meaning having to do with "partiality" or "being a single part"), and merged with for the same reasons as did; she also argues that was "created", as early as the <a href="Han%20Dynasty">Han Dynasty</a>, to supersede .

Nor was the only general classifier in the history of Chinese. The aforementioned "jiè" was being used as a general classifier before the <a href="Qin%20Dynasty">Qin Dynasty</a> (221 BCE); it was originally a noun referring to individual items out of a string of connected shells or clothes, and eventually came to be used as a classifier for "individual" objects (as opposed to pairs or groups of objects) before becoming a general classifier. Another general classifier was "méi", which originally referred to small twigs. Since twigs were used for counting items, became a counter word: any items, including people, could be counted as "one , two ", etc. was the most common classifier in use during the <a href="Southern%20and%20Northern%20Dynasties">Southern and Northern Dynasties</a> period (420–589 CE), but today is no longer a general classifier, and is only used rarely, as a specialized classifier for items such as pins and badges. Kathleen Ahrens has claimed that ("zhī" in Mandarin and "jia" in <a href="Taiwanese%20Hokkien">Taiwanese</a>), the classifier for animals in <a href="Standard%20Chinese">Mandarin</a>, is another general classifier in Taiwanese and may be becoming one in the Mandarin spoken in Taiwan.

Northern dialects tend to have fewer classifiers than southern ones. 個 "ge" is the only classifier found in the <a href="Dungan%20language">Dungan language</a>. All nouns could have just one classifier in some dialects, such as <a href="Shanghainese">Shanghainese</a> (Wu), the Mandarin dialect of <a href="Jin%20Chinese">Shanxi</a>, and <a href="Shandong">Shandong</a> dialects. Some dialects such as <a href="Northern%20Min">Northern Min</a>, certain <a href="Xiang%20Chinese">Xiang dialects</a>, <a href="Hakka%20Chinese">Hakka dialects</a>, and some <a href="Yue%20Chinese">Yue dialects</a> use 隻 for the noun referring to people, rather than 個.

Ed, Edd n Eddy

Ed, Edd n Eddy is a Canadian-American <a href="animated%20series">animated</a> <a href="Television%20comedy">comedy</a> television series created by <a href="Danny%20Antonucci">Danny Antonucci</a> for <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a>, and the sixth of the network's <a href="Cartoon%20Cartoons">Cartoon Cartoons</a>. The series revolves around three preteen boys named Ed, Edd (called "Double D" to avoid confusion with Ed), and Eddy—collectively known as "the Eds"—who live in a suburban <a href="cul-de-sac">cul-de-sac</a> in the fictional town of Peach Creek. Under the unofficial leadership of Eddy, the trio frequently invent schemes to make money from their peers to purchase their favorite confectionery, <a href="Gobstopper">jawbreakers</a>. Their plans usually fail, leaving them in various, often humiliating, predicaments.

Adult <a href="cartoonist">cartoonist</a> Antonucci was dared to create a children's cartoon; while designing a commercial, he conceived "Ed, Edd n Eddy", designing it to resemble classic cartoons from the 1940s–1970s. He pitched the series to Cartoon Network and <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a>, but the latter demanded <a href="Artistic%20control">creative control</a>, leading to him making a deal with the former and the series premiering on January 4, 1999. During the show's run, several specials and shorts were produced in addition to the regular television series. The series concluded with a TV movie, "<a href="Ed%2C%20Edd%20n%20Eddy%27s%20Big%20Picture%20Show">Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show</a>", on November 8, 2009.

"Ed, Edd n Eddy" received generally positive reviews from critics and became one of Cartoon Network's most successful original series. It won a <a href="National%20Cartoonists%20Society%23Reuben%20Award">Reuben Award</a>, two <a href="Leo%20Awards">Leo Awards</a> and a <a href="Society%20of%20Composers%2C%20Authors%20and%20Music%20Publishers%20of%20Canada">SOCAN Award</a>, and was also nominated for another four Leo Awards, an <a href="Annie%20Award">Annie Award</a> and two <a href="Kids%27%20Choice%20Awards">Kids' Choice Awards</a>. The show attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 120 countries, and proved to be popular among children, teenagers, and adults. With nearly an 11-year run, "Ed, Edd n Eddy" is currently the longest-running Cartoon Network original series.

"Ed, Edd n Eddy" follows the lives of "the Eds", three preteen boys who all share variations of the name Ed, but differ greatly in their personalities: Ed (voiced by <a href="Matt%20Hill">Matt Hill</a>) is the strong, dim-witted <a href="dogsbody">dogsbody</a> of the group; Edd (<a href="Samuel%20Vincent">Samuel Vincent</a>), called Double D, is an <a href="Invention">inventor</a>, <a href="Mysophobia">neat freak</a>, and the most intelligent of the Eds; and Eddy (<a href="Tony%20Sampson">Tony Sampson</a>) is a devious, quick-tempered, bitter <a href="Confidence%20trick">con artist</a>, and self-appointed leader of the Eds. The three devise plans to scam the cul-de-sac kids out of their money, which they want to use to buy jawbreakers. However, problems always ensue, and the Eds' schemes usually end in failure and humiliation.

The cul-de-sac kids do not include the Eds as part of their group, making the trio outcasts. The group of kids consist of: Jonny 2×4 (<a href="David%20Paul%20Grove">David Paul "Buck" Grove</a>) is a loner whom his peers consider to be a nuisance, and spends most of his time with his imaginary friend, a wooden board named Plank; Jimmy (Keenan Christensen) is a weak, insecure, and innocent yet accident-prone child, who is most often seen spending his time with Sarah (<a href="Janyse%20Jaud">Janyse Jaud</a>), Ed's spoiled and ill-tempered younger sister; Rolf (<a href="Peter%20Kelamis">Peter Kelamis</a>) is an immigrant, who often participates in unconventional customs; Kevin (<a href="Kathleen%20Barr">Kathleen Barr</a>) is a <a href="Cynicism%20%28contemporary%29">cynical</a> and <a href="Sardonicism">sardonic</a> jock who detests the Eds, particularly Eddy; Nazz (<a href="Tabitha%20St.%20Germain">Tabitha St. Germain</a>; <a href="Jenn%20Forgie">Jenn Forgie</a>; <a href="Erin%20Fitzgerald">Erin Fitzgerald</a>), usually seen with Kevin, is a stereotypical <a href="dumb%20blonde">dumb blonde</a> and an unattainable love interest for the cul-de-sac kids. All of the cul-de-sac kids share a common fear of the Kanker Sisters, Lee (Janyse Jaud), May (Erin Fitzgerald; Jenn Forgie), and Marie (Kathleen Barr), three teenage girls who live in a nearby trailer park and are in love with the Eds.

Aside from the Eds, the other cul-de-sac kids, and the Kanker Sisters, no other characters appeared in the series until the fifth season, when the silhouettes of other people were occasionally shown, and in "Mission Ed-Possible", the arms of Eddy's father and Ed's mother were seen. In the series finale, "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show", Eddy's adult brother (<a href="Terry%20Klassen">Terry Klassen</a>) was seen for the first time, making him the only non-main character, and the only adult character to ever fully appear on the show.

The series took place mostly within the fictional town of Peach Creek, and new locations were rarely introduced. The first four seasons of the show are set during a seemingly endless summer vacation, though from the fifth season onwards, the characters are shown attending junior high school in the fall and winter months.

Although <a href="cartoonist">cartoonist</a> <a href="Danny%20Antonucci">Danny Antonucci</a> began his career by working as an animator on various children's series for <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a>, his later solo works were edgy and aimed at adult audiences. He gained notoriety with the 1987 short film "<a href="Lupo%20the%20Butcher">Lupo the Butcher</a>" and then, after founding his own production studio, <a href="a.k.a.%20Cartoon">a.k.a. Cartoon</a> in 1994, created the series "<a href="The%20Brothers%20Grunt">The Brothers Grunt</a>" for <a href="MTV">MTV</a>. It was quickly cancelled, however, upon being met with generally poor reviews.

On a dare, Antonucci then decided that he would try producing a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, he ended up drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them. He faxed a one-page <a href="Model%20sheet">concept sheet</a> to <a href="Cartoon%20Network">Cartoon Network</a> and <a href="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> in 1996. Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more; they each demanded creative control, however, and Antonucci refused. After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci have control of the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.

Vice president of programming and production of Cartoon Network, <a href="Mike%20Lazzo">Mike Lazzo</a>, showed high interest in the series and requested a <a href="bible%20%28writing%29">show bible</a>, which came through by fax, a few pages at a time, over a period of the next few months. After an affirmative response from Cartoon Network president Betty Cohen, the legal paperwork and deal-making began, followed by a start-up meeting at the <a href="Chateau%20Marmont%20Hotel">Chateau Marmont Hotel</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. A deal was made that Antonucci's studio, a.k.a. Cartoon, would produce "Ed, Edd n Eddy", the first Cartoon Network original series to be produced by an outside production company rather than Cartoon Network's <a href="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a>. The series also entered production and bypassed a seven-minute short; this marked the first time that one of the studio's original series had ever done this.

According to Antonucci, he based the characters on real people in his life. The personalities of Ed, Double D, and Eddy are based on his own traits as well as the activities of his two sons, while the cul-de-sac children and the Kanker sisters were all based on children he grew up with. Rolf is based on Antonucci and his cousins, since he was part of an Italian immigrant family, and grew up in a first generation foreign household with different customs and ways of living, compared to those born in Canada.

<a href="Matt%20Hill">Matt Hill</a>, <a href="Samuel%20Vincent">Samuel Vincent</a>, and <a href="Tony%20Sampson">Tony Sampson</a> were respectively cast as Ed, Double D, and Eddy. <a href="David%20Paul%20Grove">David Paul "Buck" Grove</a> and Keenan Christensen played the parts of Jonny 2×4 and Jimmy, respectively, while Sarah was voiced by <a href="Janyse%20Jaud">Janyse Jaud</a>. <a href="Peter%20Kelamis">Peter Kelamis</a> voiced Rolf, while <a href="Kathleen%20Barr">Kathleen Barr</a> was cast as Kevin. Nazz was voiced by <a href="Tabitha%20St.%20Germain">Tabitha St. Germain</a> in season 1, <a href="Jenn%20Forgie">Jenn Forgie</a> in season 3 and <a href="Erin%20Fitzgerald">Erin Fitzgerald</a> in seasons 2, 4, 5 and 6. Fitzgerald also played the part of May, one of the Kanker Sisters, except in season 3 when she was voiced by Jenn Forgie. The other two Kanker sisters, Marie and Lee, were voiced by Kathleen Barr and Janyse Jaud. Eddy's adult brother is mentioned frequently throughout the series but does not appear until "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show", where he is voiced by series voice director <a href="Terry%20Klassen">Terry Klassen</a>.

Antonucci, an advocate of hand-drawn animation, wanted to ensure "Ed, Edd n Eddy" was produced in a way similar to cartoons from the 1940s to 1970s. As a result, the series was the last major animated series to use traditional <a href="Traditional%20animation%23Cels">cel animation</a>; the cels were shipped to Korea for creating the initial animation, and then later edited back at Antonucci's a.k.a. Cartoon studio. The first four seasons were produced traditionally. Starting with "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle" in 2004, the series switched to digital ink and paint.

To give the impression of movement, "Ed, Edd n Eddy" uses "<a href="wiktionary%3Aboiling%23Noun">boiling lines</a>" or shimmering outlines which Antonucci likens it to cartoons of the 1930s. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> has compared to <a href="Squigglevision">Squigglevision</a>, and <a href="Animation%20World%20Magazine">Animation World Magazine</a> wrote that the way the line varies and shakes gives the animation a distinctive and spontaneous feeling, as if it were drawn by children. The boiling line is created by tracing off a drawing three times through sheets of paper. Antonucci explained that he felt it "helps keep the characters alive" and that he wanted to depart from other Cartoon Network series and pay homage to the classic cartoon era.

All the children have multicolored tongues; Antonucci said that the idea came after he saw his son and his friends with different-colored tongues because of eating different candy while he was working on a storyboard. The characters went through a number of "walking cycles," a process used to determine how each character should walk or run, turn around, blink, etc. before the crew came up with the final product.

Antonucci showed the theme song to the studios when first pitching the series, thinking it would be better than only looking at drawings. It was inspired by the <a href="Bob%20Crosby">Bob Crosby</a> and <a href="The%20Big%20Cats">The Big Cats</a> song "<a href="Big%20Noise%20from%20Winnetka">Big Noise from Winnetka</a>," which was whistled, something Antonucci enjoyed doing as a child. Composed by <a href="Patric%20Caird">Patric Caird</a>, who created all the music in the series, Antonucci performed the whistling himself. The theme song was featured on the <a href="compilation%20album">compilation album</a> "<a href="Cartoon%20Medley">Cartoon Medley</a>". The title sequence was created by <a href="Paul%20Boyd%20%28animator%29">Paul Boyd</a>.

Although "Ed, Edd n Eddy" was originally set to premiere on November 7, 1998, the pilot, "<a href="The%20Ed-touchables%20/%20Nagged%20to%20Ed">The Ed-touchables / Nagged to Ed</a>," aired on January 4, 1999, as the sixth <a href="Cartoon%20Cartoons">Cartoon Cartoon</a>, due to minor post-production delays. During the series' original run, episodes often aired as a part of Cartoon Network's weekly programming block "Cartoon Cartoon Fridays."

Cartoon Network ran several <a href="Marathon%20%28television%29">marathons</a> for either commercial promotions or special airings of one of their shows. The eight-hour "Boy Girl, Boy Girl" marathon ran on March 7, 1999, airing episodes of "Ed, Edd n Eddy" and "<a href="The%20Powerpuff%20Girls">The Powerpuff Girls</a>", which had been Cartoon Network's two newest series at the time. Later that year, "Ed, Edd n Eddy" was featured with other original Cartoon Network series in the third annual "Cartoon Cartoon Weekend," a fifty-three-hour marathon, which ran from August 20 to August 22. In 2002, the show was included in the similar "Cartoon Cartoon Marathon Weekend," which ran from August 23 to August 25. The six-hour "Ed's Day Off Marathon" aired 22 episodes on January 19, 2004, in celebration of <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%2C%20Jr.%20Day">Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</a>.

"The Best Day Edder," in which every episode was shown in chronological order, ran from April 27 to April 28, 2007, and ended with the previously unbroadcast season five finale, which was promoted as the "final episode ever." However, it was quickly followed by ""The Eds are Coming"" in the next month, as part of a special alien-themed event called "Cartoon Network Invaded." As of May 2, 2007, "The Best Day Edder" provided Cartoon Network their best ratings of the year. A seven-hour Sunday marathon, which ran before the premiere of "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show", posted double-digit delivery gains among children ages 9–14 (up 14%), boys ages 9–14 (up 16%) and girls ages 6–11 (up 17%), compared to the same time frame last year, highlighting the network's weekend performance.

At the July 2007 <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con</a>, a cut segment from the season four finale "Take This Ed and Shove It" was screened at the "Ed, Edd n Eddy" panel. The series' fourth season was originally ordered as the last, but two additional seasons and four specials, including a movie, were ordered as a result of the series' popularity. The series' finale movie, "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show", aired on November 8, 2009, officially ending the series.

Along with an additional fifth and sixth season, Cartoon Network ordered three <a href="holiday">holiday</a> specials that originally aired in 2004 and 2005. "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Jingle Jingle Jangle," the first, is a <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> special aired on December 3, 2004. <a href="Valentine%27s%20Day">Valentine's Day</a>'s "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Hanky Panky Hullabaloo" originally aired on February 11, 2005. The final, <a href="Halloween">Halloween</a> special, "<a href="Ed%2C%20Edd%20n%20Eddy%27s%20Boo%20Haw%20Haw">Ed, Edd n Eddy's Boo Haw Haw</a>" aired on October 28, 2005. Antonucci stated that "Boo Haw Haw" was one of his favorite "Ed, Edd n Eddy" episodes that he worked on. On May 11, 2007, a fourth special, "The Eds are Coming, the Eds are Coming" aired; however, it was not a holiday special, but an adjunct to other Cartoon Network series "<a href="Foster%27s%20Home%20for%20Imaginary%20Friends">Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends</a>", "<a href="My%20Gym%20Partner%27s%20a%20Monkey">My Gym Partner's a Monkey</a>", "<a href="Camp%20Lazlo">Camp Lazlo</a>", and "<a href="The%20Grim%20Adventures%20of%20Billy%20%26amp%3B%20Mandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy</a>" in the <a href="Extraterrestrial%20life">alien</a>-themed mini-series Cartoon Network Invaded that aired all five specials from May 4 to May 28, 2007.

Besides their own series, Ed, Double D, and Eddy have also appeared in other cartoon series. They appeared in an episode of "Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends" and were drawn using that series' style of animation, and made a short <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> in "The Grim Adventures of the KND," a <a href="Fictional%20crossover">crossover</a> of "<a href="The%20Grim%20Adventures%20of%20Billy%20%26amp%3B%20Mandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy</a>" and "". They also appeared on a small crossover poster during its credits entitled "Ed, Edd n Mandy". In 2012, Double D made an appearance in the animated <a href="sketch%20comedy">sketch comedy</a> Cartoon Network series "<a href="Mad%20%28TV%20series%29">Mad</a>" episode "Once Upon a Toon."

The show was featured in the 2002 edition of Cartoon Network's fictional awards program, "The 1st 13th Annual Fancy Anvil Awards Show Program Special: Live in Stereo". It won Best Performance by an Inanimate Object in a Dramatic Role for the character of Plank, and Best Performance by a Team in a Cartoon Series for the characters of Ed, Double D, and Eddy. The character of Sarah was nominated for Best Performance by a Female in a Cartoon Series, but lost to <a href="Bubbles%20Utonium">Bubbles</a> from "<a href="The%20Powerpuff%20Girls">The Powerpuff Girls</a>".

In 2004, the Eds appeared in a short series of basketball commercials with <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">NBA</a> All-Star <a href="Steve%20Francis">Steve Francis</a>. Ed appeared in the "Cartoon Network Elections 2004" with Grim from "The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy" as a team, and they ended up winning, due to the highest number of votes by viewers.

"Ed, Edd n Eddy" attracted an audience of 31 million households, was broadcast in 120 countries, and was popular among both children and adults. According to Cartoon Network executive <a href="Linda%20Simensky">Linda Simensky</a>, the first season did "remarkably well" in ratings following its premiere, becoming one of the top-rated series on the network. It was Cartoon Network's most popular show among boys ages 2–11. In 2005, it was reported that "Ed, Edd n Eddy" was the number one rated show on Cartoon Network and was known to 79% of children aged 6–11. The series ran for nearly 11 years, making it the longest-running Cartoon Network original series, and at the time of its finale, the longest-running Canadian-produced animated series. It is tied with "<a href="Blue%27s%20Clues">Blue's Clues</a>", "<a href="Wonder%20Pets%21">Wonder Pets!</a>" and "<a href="Mickey%20Mouse%20Clubhouse">Mickey Mouse Clubhouse</a>" as the ninth <a href="List%20of%20longest-running%20United%20States%20television%20series">longest-running American animated series</a>.

"Ed, Edd n Eddy" received generally positive reviews from critics. David Cornelius of <a href="Internet%20Brands">DVD Talk</a> considered the Eds to be child equivalents of <a href="The%20Three%20Stooges">The Three Stooges</a>, believing that "the series revels in the sort of frantic, often gross humor kids love so much, and there's just enough oddball insanity at play to make adults giggle just as easily." Cornelius also wrote that the "animation is colorful and intentionally bizarre; bold lines forming the characters and backgrounds wiggle and morph in a delirious haze. This is animation that's, well, really animated." 

Despite this, not all reception of the show was positive. Terrence Briggs of "<a href="Animation%20World%20Network">Animation World Magazine</a>" considered every second of the show "filler" and lamented that the main characters are drawn as "products from the school of acid-trip caricature." After Briggs' review was published, a large number of letters supportive of the show were sent to the magazine, prompting it to "take a second look" at the show. Different reviewers then gave it a positive review, calling it a "fresh show with very different approaches."

During its run, "Ed, Edd n Eddy" was nominated for a Reuben Award, six Leo Awards, an Annie Award, two Kids' Choice Awards and a SOCAN Award, winning the Reuben Award, two Leo Awards and the SOCAN Award. It was ranked seventh on <a href="ScrewAttack">ScrewAttack</a>'s "Top Twenty Cartoon Network Shows." Desi Jedeikin of <a href="Smosh">Smosh</a>.com listed "Ed, Edd n Eddy" on the website's list of "9 Cartoons That Need a Reboot." "<a href="Complex%20Magazine">Complex</a>" included Eddy's room on their list of "Movie and TV Characters' Bedrooms You Wished Were Yours," and ranked Jimmy 14th on their list of "15 Artistic Characters We Miss From Our Childhood." <a href="Cracked.com">Cracked.com</a> praised the show's high level of violence, stating that it "set the bar on cartoon violence for anything that was played on Cartoon Network, and thus far, none have surpassed them." Bob Higgins, head of creative at <a href="Wild%20Brain">Wild Brain</a>, considered "Ed, Edd n Eddy" to be a "landmark in animation."

In August 2002, the New York <a href="Paley%20Center%20for%20Media">Museum of Television and Radio</a> featured the episode "An Ed Is Born" as part of the special program "Cartoon Power! Celebrating Cartoon Network's 10th Birthday".

Cartoon Network produced short cartoons involving the Eds which were shown during commercial breaks. A short music video was produced with stylized versions of Ed, Edd, Eddy and Sarah, entitled "The Incredible Shrinking Day" (listed on the Season 2 DVD as "I'm Not Coming in Anymore"), which aired on Cartoon Network in 2002 and 2003. In the video, Sarah uses a potion to shrink the Eds to a size capable of playing in her dollhouse, with predictable results. Plank starred in a similar video called "My Best Friend Plank," which aired in 2002.

The made-for-TV movie "Ed, Edd n Eddy's Big Picture Show" served as the series' finale and premiered in the United States on November 8, 2009; although it had completed production a year earlier and first aired in Scandinavia, Australia, and Southeast Asia. The plot focuses on the Eds' search for Eddy's Brother, a character mentioned several times throughout the series, but never seen until the film. He is voiced by series voice director Terry Klassen. The film was directed by Antonucci, who also co-wrote the script with Rachel Connor, <a href="Jono%20Howard">Jono Howard</a>, <a href="Mike%20Kubat">Mike Kubat</a>, and Stacy Warnick. The story was written by Joel Dickie, Steve Garcia, Jim Miller, Raven Molisee, and Scott Underwood, while the score was written by series composer Patric Caird. The film achieved huge ratings success for Cartoon Network with high delivery gains.

"Ed, Edd n Eddy" was regularly featured in <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a>' "Cartoon Network Block Party" (originally "Cartoon Cartoons", the <a href="Cartoon%20Cartoons">collective name of original Cartoon Network series from 1995 to 2003</a>) <a href="comic%20book">comic book</a>s, along with other Cartoon Network series.

Secret of Mana

Secret of Mana, originally released in Japan as Seiken Densetsu 2, is a 1993 <a href="action%20role-playing%20game">action role-playing game</a> developed and published by <a href="Square%20%28company%29">Square</a> (now <a href="Square%20Enix">Square Enix</a>) for the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super Nintendo Entertainment System</a>. It is the sequel to the 1991 game "Seiken Densetsu", released in North America as "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Adventure">Final Fantasy Adventure</a>" and in Europe as "Mystic Quest", and it was the first "Seiken Densetsu" title to be marketed as part of the <a href="Mana%20%28series%29">"Mana" series</a> rather than the "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" series. Set in a <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> universe, the game follows three heroes as they attempt to prevent an empire from conquering the world with the power of an ancient flying fortress.

Rather than using a <a href="turn-based">turn-based</a> battle system like contemporaneous role-playing games, "Secret of Mana" features <a href="Real-time%20game">real-time</a> battles with a power bar mechanic. The game has a unique <a href="pie%20menu">Ring Command</a> menu system, which <a href="Pausable%20real-time">pauses</a> the action and allows the player to make decisions in the middle of battle. An innovative <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative</a> <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> system allows a second or third player to drop in and out of the game at any time. "Secret of Mana" was directed and designed by <a href="Koichi%20Ishii">Koichi Ishii</a>, programmed primarily by <a href="Nasir%20Gebelli">Nasir Gebelli</a>, and produced by veteran Square designer <a href="Hiromichi%20Tanaka">Hiromichi Tanaka</a>.

The game received considerable acclaim for its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, Ring Command menu system, and innovative real-time battle system. Critics also praised the soundtrack by <a href="Hiroki%20Kikuta">Hiroki Kikuta</a> and the customizable <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a> (AI) settings for computer-controlled allies. 

The original version was released for the <a href="Nintendo%20Wii">Nintendo Wii</a>'s <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> in Japan in September 2008, and for the Wii U's Virtual Console in June 2013. The game was ported to mobile phones in Japan in 2009, and an enhanced port of the game was released for <a href="iOS">iOS</a> in 2010 and <a href="Android%20%28operating%20system%29">Android</a> in 2014. <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> re-released "Secret of Mana" in September 2017 as part of the company's <a href="Super%20NES%20Classic%20Edition">Super NES Classic Edition</a>. A full 3D remake was released for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>, and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> in February 2018. However, the original staff was not involved in the 3D remake's development.

Like many other role-playing games of the <a href="History%20of%20video%20game%20consoles%20%28fourth%20generation%29">16-bit era</a>, "Secret of Mana" displays a <a href="top-down%20perspective">top-down perspective</a>, in which the <a href="player%20characters">player characters</a> navigate the terrain and fight off hostile creatures. The game features three such characters: the hero, the girl, and the <a href="Sprite%20%28creature%29">sprite</a>, named Randi, Primm, and Popoi outside the initial North American and European releases. The player can choose to control each of the characters at any time; whichever character is currently selected, the other two companions are controlled via <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a>. The game may be played simultaneously by up to three players, made possible by the <a href="Super%20Multitap">Super Multitap</a> accessory for the <a href="Super%20Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Super NES</a> console. The <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> version of the game supports three-player gameplay via additional <a href="Nintendo%20GameCube%20controller">GameCube controllers</a> or <a href="Classic%20Controller">Classic Controller</a>s.

Each character possesses individual strengths and weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; the girl is a <a href="healer%20%28gaming%29">healer</a>, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s in battle, each character increases in level and improves in areas such as strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">hit points</a> or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">spells</a>, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a <a href="pie%20menu">circular menu</a> which hovers over the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.

Combat takes place in real-time. Located at the bottom of the screen is a power bar, a gauge that determines the amount of damage done to an enemy when attacking. Swinging a weapon causes the gauge to empty and then quickly recharge, allowing that character to attack at full strength. The party wields eight different types of weaponry: sword, spear, bow, axe, boomerang, glove, whip, and javelin. All weapons can be upgraded eight times, and repeated use of a weapon increases its skill level to a maximum of eight, unlocking a new special attack with each level. Weapons are upgraded with Weapon Orbs, which are found in <a href="dungeon%20crawl">dungeons</a> or earned by defeating certain <a href="boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">bosses</a>. The player takes each Orb to a <a href="blacksmith">blacksmith</a>, located in most towns, who uses it to reforge one weapon.

In order to learn magic, the party must rescue spirits known as Elementals. The eight Elementals represent different elements—such as water, earth, and life—and each provides the player with specific spells. Magic has skill levels similar to weapons, but each magic spell costs <a href="magic%20point">magic point</a>s to cast.

At the start of the game, to reach a destination players must traverse an enemy-infested countryside. Travel may be expedited with Cannon Travel Centers, where the party may be <a href="human%20cannonball">launched</a> to faraway destinations via a giant <a href="cannon">cannon</a>. Cannon Travel usually requires a fee, but is mandatory to visit other continents later on. Later, the party is given access to Flammie, a miniature dragon which is controlled by the player and able to fly freely across the world, represented by an <a href="overworld">overworld</a> map. These sequences make use of the SNES's <a href="Mode%207">Mode 7</a> capability to create a rotatable background, giving the illusion that the ground beneath Flammie is rendered in <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three dimensions</a>. While riding Flammie, the player may access either the "rotated map", which presents the world as a globe, or the "world map", a two-dimensional view of the overworld.

The story takes place in a <a href="high%20fantasy">high fantasy</a> world, which contains an ethereal energy source named "<a href="Mana%23Games%20and%20fiction">mana</a>". An ancient, technologically advanced civilization exploited mana to construct the "Mana Fortress", a flying warship. This angered the world's gods, who sent giant beasts to war with the civilization. The conflict was globally destructive and nearly exhausted all signs of mana in the world, until a hero used the power of the Mana Sword to destroy the fortress and the civilization. The world began to recover in peace. As the game opens, an empire seeks eight Mana Seeds, which when "unsealed" will restore mana to the world and allow the empire to restore the Mana Fortress.

The three main characters do not have names in the original SNES release, though their names appear in the manual of the Japanese release; and their names were added into the game in the iOS port worldwide. In all versions, the player can choose to name the characters whatever they wish. The , a young boy, is adopted by the Elder of Potos before the start of the game, after the boy's mother disappears. The is in love with a warrior named Dyluck, who was ordered by the king to attack Elinee's Castle. Angered by the king's actions and by her father's attempt to <a href="arranged%20marriage">arrange</a> her marriage to a local nobleman, she leaves the castle to save Dyluck and to accompany the hero as well. The hero and the girl meet the at the Dwarf Village. The sprite makes a living by scamming people at a <a href="freak%20show">freak show</a> held by dwarves. It does not remember anything about its past, so it joins the team to try to recover its memories.

The game begins as three boys from the small Potos village disobey their Elder's instructions and trespass into a local waterfall, where a treasure is said to be kept. One of the boys stumbles and falls into the lake, where he finds a rusty sword embedded in a stone. Guided by a disembodied voice, he pulls the sword free, inadvertently unleashing monsters in the surrounding countryside of the village. The villagers interpret the sword's removal as a bad omen and banish the boy from Potos forever. A traveling knight named Jema recognizes the blade as the legendary Mana Sword and encourages the hero to re-energize it by visiting the eight Mana Temples.

During his journey, the hero is joined by the girl and the sprite. Throughout their travels, the trio is pursued by the empire. The Emperor and his subordinates are being manipulated by Thanatos, an ancient sorcerer who hopes to create a "new, peaceful world". Due to his own body's deterioration, Thanatos is in need of a suitable body to <a href="Spirit%20possession">possess</a>. After placing the entire kingdom of Pandora under a trance, he abducts two candidates: Dyluck, now enslaved, and a young Pandoran girl named Phanna; he eventually chooses to possess Dyluck.

The Empire succeeds in unsealing all eight Mana Seeds. However, Thanatos betrays the Emperor and his henchmen, killing them and seizing control of the Mana Fortress for himself. The hero and his party journey to locate the Mana Tree, the focal point of the world's life energy. Anticipating their arrival, Thanatos positions the Mana Fortress over the Tree and destroys it. The charred remains of the Tree speak to the heroes, explaining that a giant dragon called the Mana Beast will soon be summoned to combat the Fortress. However, the Beast has little control over its rage and will likely destroy the world as well. The Mana Tree also reveals that it was once the human wife of Serin, the original Mana Knight and the hero's father. The voice heard at Potos' waterfall was that of Serin's ghost.

The trio flies to the Mana Fortress and confronts Thanatos, who is preparing to transfer his mind into Dyluck. With the last of his strength, Dyluck warns that Thanatos has sold his soul to the <a href="underworld">underworld</a> and must not be allowed to have the Fortress. Dyluck kills himself, forcing Thanatos to revert to a skeletal <a href="lich">lich</a> form, which the party defeats. The Mana Beast finally flies in and attacks the Fortress. The hero expresses reluctance to kill the Beast, fearing that with the dispersal of Mana from the world, the sprite will vanish. With the sprite's encouragement, he uses the fully energized Mana Sword to slay the Beast, causing it to explode and transform into snow. At the conclusion of the game, the hero is seen welcomed back in Potos, returning the Mana Sword to its place beneath the waterfall.

"Secret of Mana" was directed and designed by <a href="Koichi%20Ishii">Koichi Ishii</a>, the creator of the game's <a href="Game%20Boy">Game Boy</a> predecessor, "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20Adventure">Final Fantasy Adventure</a>". He has stated that he feels "Secret of Mana" is more "his game" than other projects he has worked on, such as the "<a href="Final%20Fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>" series. The game was programmed primarily by <a href="Nasir%20Gebelli">Nasir Gebelli</a> and produced by veteran Square designer <a href="Hiromichi%20Tanaka">Hiromichi Tanaka</a>. The team hoped to build on the foundation of "Final Fantasy Adventure", and they included several modified elements from that game and from other popular <a href="Square%20%28company%29">Square</a> titles in "Secret of Mana". In addition to having better graphics and sound quality than its predecessor, the attack power gauge was changed to be more engaging, and the weapon leveling system replaced "Final Fantasy Adventure"s system of leveling up the speed of the attack gauge. The party system also received an upgrade from the first "Mana" game: instead of temporary companions who could not be upgraded, party members became permanent protagonists and could be controlled by other players. The multiplayer component was not a part of the original design, but was added when the developers realized that they could easily make all three characters human-controlled.

The real-time battle system used in "Secret of Mana" has been described by its creators as an extension of the battle system used in the first three flagship "Final Fantasy" titles. The system for experience points and leveling up was taken from "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20III">Final Fantasy III</a>". According to Tanaka, the game's battle system features mechanics that had first been considered for "<a href="Final%20Fantasy%20IV">Final Fantasy IV</a>". Similarly, unused features in "Secret of Mana" were appropriated by the "<a href="Chrono%20Trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>" team, which like "Final Fantasy IV" was in production at the time.

"Secret of Mana" was originally planned to be a launch title for the <a href="SNES-CD">SNES-CD</a> add-on. After the contract between <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> and <a href="Sony">Sony</a> to produce the add-on failed, and Sony repurposed its work on the SNES-CD into the competing <a href="PlayStation%20%28console%29">PlayStation</a> console, Square adapted the game for the SNES cartridge format. The game had to be altered to fit the storage space of a SNES <a href="ROM%20cartridge">game cartridge</a>, which is much smaller than that of a CD-ROM. The developers initially resisted continuing the project without the CD add-on, believing that too much of the game would have to be cut, but they were overruled by company management. As a result of the hardware change, several features had to be cut from the game, and some completed work needed to be redone. One of the most significant changes was the removal of the option to take <a href="nonlinear%20gameplay">multiple routes</a> through the game that led to several <a href="alternate%20ending">possible endings</a>, in contrast to the linear journey in the final product. The plot that remained was different than the original conception, and Tanaka has said that the original story had a much darker tone. Ishii has estimated that up to forty percent of the planned game was dropped to meet the space limitations, and critics have suggested that the hardware change led to technical problems when too much happens at once in the game. In 2006, "Level" magazine claimed that "Secret of Mana"s rocky development was Square's main inspiration to move their games, such as the "Final Fantasy" series, from Nintendo consoles to Sony consoles in 1996.

The English translation for "Secret of Mana" was completed in only 30 days, mere weeks after the Japanese release, and the North American <a href="game%20localization">localization</a> was initially advertised as "Final Fantasy Adventure 2". Critics have suggested that the translation was done hastily so that the game could be released in North America for the 1993 holiday season. According to translator <a href="Ted%20Woolsey">Ted Woolsey</a>, a large portion of the game's script was cut out in the English localization due to space limitations. To display text on the main gameplay screen, the English translation uses a <a href="monospaced%20font">fixed-width font</a>, which limits the amount of space available to display text. Woolsey was unhappy that he had to trim conversations to their bare essentials and that he had so little time for translation, commenting that it "nearly killed me". The script was difficult to translate as it was presented to Woolsey in disordered groups of text, like "shuffling a novel". Other localizations were done in German and French. The Japanese release only named the three protagonists in the manual, while Western versions omitted the characters' names until the enhanced port on the iOS.

The original score for "Secret of Mana" was composed and produced by <a href="Hiroki%20Kikuta">Hiroki Kikuta</a>. <a href="Kenji%20Ito%20%28composer%29">Kenji Ito</a>, who had composed the soundtrack for "Final Fantasy Adventure", was originally slated for the project, but was replaced with Kikuta after he had started on other projects, such as "<a href="Romancing%20SaGa">Romancing SaGa</a>". "Secret of Mana" was Kikuta's first video game score, and he encountered difficulties in dealing with the hardware limitations of the Super NES. Kikuta tried to express in the music two "contrasting styles" to create an original score which would be neither <a href="pop%20music">pop music</a> nor standard <a href="video%20game%20music">game music</a>. Kikuta worked on the music mostly by himself, spending nearly 24 hours a day in his office, alternating between composing and editing to create a soundtrack that would be, according to him, "immersive" and "three-dimensional". Rather than having sound engineers create the samples of instruments like most game music composers of the time, Kikuta made his own samples that matched the hardware capabilities of the Super NES. These custom samples allowed him to know exactly how each piece would sound on the system's hardware, so he did not have to worry about differences between the original composition and the Super NES. Kikuta stated in 2001 that he considered the score for "Secret of Mana" his favorite creation.

The soundtrack's music includes both "ominous" and "light-hearted" tracks, and is noted for its use of bells and "dark, solemn pianos". Kikuta's compositions for the game were partly inspired by natural landscapes, as well as music from <a href="Bali">Bali</a>. Hardware limitations made the title screen to the game slowly fade in, and Kikuta designed the title track to the game, "Fear of the Heavens", to sync up with the screen. At that time, composers rarely tried to match a game's music to its visuals. Kikuta also started the track off with a "whale noise", rather than a traditional "ping", in order to try to "more deeply connect" the player with the game from the moment it started up. Getting the sound to work with the memory limitations of the Super NES was a difficult technical challenge.

An official soundtrack album, "Seiken Densetsu 2 Original Sound Version", was released in Japan in August 1993, containing 44 musical tracks from the game. An English version, identical to the Japanese original aside from its localized packaging and track titles, was later released in North America in December 1994 as "Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack", making "Secret of Mana" one of the first Japanese games to inspire a localized soundtrack release outside of Japan. An album of arranged music from "Secret of Mana" and its sequel "<a href="Seiken%20Densetsu%203">Seiken Densetsu 3</a>" was produced in 1993 as "Secret of Mana+". The music in the album was all composed and arranged by Kikuta. "Secret of Mana+" contains a single track, titled "Secret of Mana", that incorporates themes from the music of both "Secret of Mana" and "Seiken Densetsu 3", which was still under development at the time. The style of the album has been described by critics as "experimental", using "strange sounds" such as waterfalls, bird calls, cell phone sounds, and "typing" sounds. The music has also been described by critics as covering many different musical styles, such as "Debussian impressionist styles, his own heavy electronic and synth ideas, and even ideas of popular musicians". The latest album of music from the game is a 2012 arranged album titled "Secret of Mana Genesis / Seiken Densetsu 2 Arrange Album". The 16 tracks are upgraded versions of the original Super NES tracks, and Kikuta said in the liner notes for the album that they are "how he wanted the music to sound when he wrote it", without the limitations of the Super NES hardware. Critics such as Patrick Gann of RPGFan, however, noted that the differences were minor. Music for the 2018 remake, which features remastered versions of the original soundtrack, was overseen by Kikuta and arranged by numerous game composers, such as <a href="Yuzo%20Koshiro">Yuzo Koshiro</a> and <a href="Tsuyoshi%20Sekito">Tsuyoshi Sekito</a>. The soundtrack was released as an album, also titled "Secret of Mana Original Soundtrack", shortly after the remake's release in February 2018.

In 1999, Square announced they would be porting "Secret of Mana" to <a href="Bandai">Bandai</a>'s handheld system <a href="WonderSwan">WonderSwan Color</a> as one of nine planned games for the system. No such port was ever released. A mobile phone port of "Secret of Mana" was released on October 26, 2009. A port of the game for <a href="iOS">iOS</a> was revealed at <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">E3</a> 2010, and released on Apple's App Store on December 21, 2010. The port fixed several bugs, and the English script was both edited and retranslated from the original Japanese. The enhanced port from the iOS version was released on <a href="Android%20%28OS%29">Android</a> devices in 2014. A port for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> was released with ports of "Final Fantasy Adventure" and "Seiken Densetsu 3" as part of the "Seiken Densetsu Collection" on June 1, 2017. The game was released as one of the games included on the <a href="Super%20NES%20Classic%20Edition">Super NES Classic Edition</a> on September 29, 2017. In August 2017, a 3D remake of the game was announced for <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a>, and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and was released on February 15, 2018.

According to Square Enix, as of February 2004, "Secret of Mana" had shipped 1.83 million copies worldwide, with 1.5 million of those copies being shipped in Japan and 330,000 abroad. The abroad figure is challenged by "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>", who claim that the game sold over 500,000 copies in the US alone. The initial shipment of games in Japan sold out within days of the release date. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" noted in November 1993 that the game was "the most widely covered game of the year in Japan", with a high number of sales, but was released in North America "completely un-hyped and mostly unheard of". Despite this, "Secret of Mana" went on to become the second best-selling Super NES game on <a href="GameStop">Babbage's</a> North American chart in October 1993, behind only "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat%20%281992%20video%20game%29">Mortal Kombat</a>". According to "Next Generation", it was surprisingly popular for a role-playing game, contributing to the genre's growing popularity in the West.

"<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" magazine's reviewers heavily praised the graphics, music, and multiplayer gameplay, saying that it had "some of the best music I've ever heard from a cartridge". They hoped that other companies would take the game's lead in adding multiplayer modes to role-playing games. "<a href="GameFan">Diehard GameFan</a>"s review of the game named the multiplayer as the game's best component, with reviewer Kelly Rickards saying that while the graphics were nice, the multiplayer "made the game". "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>"s review praised the graphics, plot, "first-rate gameplay" and "positively massive" world "dwarfing even "Zelda"", while stating the gameplay and multiplayer were "rough around the edges", concluding it to be "one of the finest action/RPGs" on the SNES. "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" called it an "enthralling epic", praising the "wide variety of sites and terrain," music, "Beautiful graphics and great depth of play" but criticizing the "unnecessarily long" sword powering-up and "awkward" item selection method.

"Secret of Mana" was awarded Game of the Month in December 1993 and Best Role-Playing Game of 1993 by "Electronic Gaming Monthly". In its annual <a href="GameFan%23Golden%20Megawards">Megawards</a>, "GameFan" awarded it Best Action/RPG (SNES). "GamePro" gave it the award for <a href="List%20of%20Game%20of%20the%20Year%20awards">Role-Playing Game of the Year</a>, ahead of "<a href="Lufia%20%26amp%3B%20the%20Fortress%20of%20Doom">Lufia</a>" and "<a href="Shadowrun%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Shadowrun</a>" as runners-up.

"Edge"s review said that "Secret of Mana" was better than contemporary role-playing games "<a href="Ys%20I%20%26amp%3B%20II">Ys I & II</a>", "", and "". The review stated that "Secret of Mana" "includes some of the best game design and features ever seen: simultaneous threeplayer action, the best combat system ever designed, the best player interface ever designed, a superb control system, and yes, some of the most engrossing and rewarding gameplay yet". They concluded that the game was one of the best action RPGs or adventure games. Game designer <a href="Sandy%20Petersen">Sandy Petersen</a> reviewed the game in "<a href="Dragon%20%28magazine%29">Dragon</a>", and described the game as much like "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">Zelda</a>" but with conventional role-playing game features. He predicted that the game would be regarded as a classic. Peterson concluded that "Secret of Mana" was one of the best SNES role-playing games and that it was "a much larger game than "Zelda", with many more types of monsters, character options, and fortresses to explore". "<a href="Official%20Nintendo%20Magazine">Nintendo Magazine System</a>" also compared it favorably with "A Link to the Past"; one reviewer stated that "even the magnificence of "Zelda III" seems stale in comparison to the incredible features found within this refreshing, exhilarating adventure" while the other stated that it "comes the closest yet" to surpassing "Zelda", concluding that "Secret of Mana" was "one of the greatest graphical RPGs in the history of the world".

In 2008, Lucas Thomas of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> reviewed the <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> port of "Secret of Mana" and stated that it was considered one of the best video games ever made. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>'s Dan Whitehead also recommended the port, describing it as "essential" and as the formative game of the "Mana" series. The <a href="iOS">iOS</a> port of the game was praised by Nadia Oxford of Slide to Play for its improved graphics and computer-controlled characters. She also praised the quality of the touch controls relative to other role-playing game phone versions, though she disliked that the multiplayer mode had been removed.

In 2014, "Edge" magazine described "Secret of Mana" as "one of the high points of the 16bit era". A writer for the magazine noted that, 20 years after "Secret of Mana"s release, its reputation as a SNES action RPG had been surpassed only by that of "The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past". Review aggregator site <a href="GameRankings">GameRankings</a> lists the game as the 13th-highest rated SNES game. In 1996, "<a href="Super%20Play">Super Play</a>" ranked "Secret of Mana" eighth on its list of the best 100 SNES games of all time. It took 42nd place on "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" magazine's 2006 "Top 200 Nintendo Games of All Time" list, and the magazine called it the 86th best game on a Nintendo system. IGN's "<a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">Top 100 Games</a>" list ranked the game at number 48 in 2005, number 49 in 2006, and number 79 in 2007, and their 2017 "Top 100 RPGs" list had it as number 7. In 2006, "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu</a>"s "All Time Top 100" audience poll ranked it number 97. "Secret of Mana" was an influential game in its time, and its influence continued into the 2010s. Elements such as its radial ring menu system, described by "Edge" as "oft-mimicked", were borrowed by later games such as "<a href="The%20Temple%20of%20Elemental%20Evil%20%28video%20game%29">The Temple of Elemental Evil</a>". Its cooperative multiplayer gameplay has been mentioned as an influence on "<a href="Dungeon%20Siege%20III">Dungeon Siege III</a>".

Operation Bernhard

Operation Bernhard was an exercise by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> to forge British <a href="Banknotes%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling">bank notes</a>. The initial plan was to drop the notes over Britain to bring about a <a href="economic%20collapse">collapse</a> of the <a href="Economy%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">British economy</a> during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. The first phase was run from early 1940 by the (SD) under the title (Operation Andreas, Operation Andrew). The unit successfully duplicated the <a href="cotton%20paper">rag paper</a> used by the British, produced near-identical engraving blocks and deduced the <a href="algorithm">algorithm</a> used to create the alpha-numeric serial code on each note. The unit closed in early 1942 after its head, <a href="Alfred%20Naujocks">Alfred Naujocks</a>, fell out of favour with his superior officer, <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>.

The operation was revived later in the year; the aim was changed to forging money to finance German intelligence operations. Instead of a specialist unit within the SD, prisoners from <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a> were selected and sent to <a href="Sachsenhausen%20concentration%20camp">Sachsenhausen concentration camp</a> to work under <a href="Schutzstaffel">SS</a> Major <a href="Bernhard%20Kr%C3%BCger">Bernhard Krüger</a>. The unit produced British notes until mid-1945; estimates vary of the number and value of notes printed, from £132.6 million up to £300 million. By the time the unit ceased production, they had perfected the artwork for <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Note">US dollars</a>, although the paper and serial numbers were still being analysed. The <a href="counterfeit%20money">counterfeit money</a> was <a href="money%20laundering">laundered</a> in exchange for money and other assets. Counterfeit notes from the operation were used to pay the Turkish agent <a href="Elyesa%20Bazna">Elyesa Bazna</a>—code named Cicero—for his work in obtaining British secrets from the British ambassador in <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>, and £100,000 from Operation Bernhard was used to obtain information that helped to free the Italian leader <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> in the <a href="Gran%20Sasso%20raid">Gran Sasso raid</a> in September 1943.

In early 1945 the unit was moved to <a href="Mauthausen-Gusen%20concentration%20camp">Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp</a> in Austria, then to the <a href="Redl-Zipf">Redl-Zipf</a> series of tunnels and finally to <a href="Ebensee%20concentration%20camp">Ebensee concentration camp</a>. Because of an overly precise interpretation of a German order, the prisoners were not executed on their arrival; they were <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps%23Liberation">liberated</a> shortly afterwards by the American Army. Much of the output of the unit was dumped into the <a href="Lake%20Toplitz">Toplitz</a> and <a href="Grundlsee">Grundlsee</a> lakes at the end of the war, but enough went into general circulation that the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a> stopped releasing new notes and issued a new design after the war. The operation has been dramatised in a comedy-drama miniseries "<a href="Private%20Schulz%20%28TV%20series%29">Private Schulz</a>" by the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> and in a 2007 film, "<a href="The%20Counterfeiters%20%282007%20film%29">The Counterfeiters</a>" ().

The designs used on British paper currency at the beginning of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> were introduced in 1855 and had been altered only slightly over the intervening years. The notes were made from white <a href="cotton%20paper">rag paper</a> with black printing on one side and showed an engraving of <a href="Britannia">Britannia</a> by <a href="Daniel%20Maclise">Daniel Maclise</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Arts">Royal Academy of Arts</a> in the top left-hand corner. The <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20%C2%A35%20note">£5</a>, also known as the White Fiver, measured , while the <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20%C2%A310%20note">£10</a>, <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20%C2%A320%20note">£20</a> and <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20%C2%A350%20note">£50</a> notes measured .

The notes had 150 minor marks that acted as security measures to identify forgeries. These were often assumed to be printing errors, and were changed between issues of notes. Each note bore an alphanumeric <a href="serial%20code">serial designation</a> and the signature of the <a href="Chief%20Cashier%20of%20the%20Bank%20of%20England">Chief Cashier of the Bank of England</a>. Prior to the release of any notes by the Bank of England, all serial numbers were recorded in ledgers so the bank could verify its liabilities; these numbers were checked when the notes circulated back through the bank.

A <a href="watermark">watermark</a> appeared across the middle of every note; it differed depending on the value of the currency and the alphanumeric serial designation used. According to John Keyworth, the curator of the <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20Museum">Bank of England Museum</a>, as the paper currency had never been successfully counterfeited, the <a href="Bank%20of%20England">Bank of England</a> "was a little complacent about the design of its notes and the production of them"; he described the notes as "technologically ... very simple".

At a meeting on 18 September 1939 <a href="Arthur%20Nebe">Arthur Nebe</a>, the head of the —the central criminal investigation department of Nazi Germany—put forward a proposal to use known counterfeiters to forge <a href="Banknotes%20of%20the%20pound%20sterling">British paper currency</a>. The forged notes—amounting to £30 billion—would then be dropped over Britain, causing a financial collapse and the loss of its <a href="world%20currency">world currency</a> status. Nebe's superior officer, <a href="Reinhard%20Heydrich">Reinhard Heydrich</a>, liked the plan, but was unsure of using the police files to find the available individuals. <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, the <a href="Reichs%20Ministry%20of%20Public%20Enlightenment%20and%20Propaganda">Reich Minister of Propaganda</a>, described it as "", "a grotesque plan", although he saw it had potential. The main objection to the plan came from <a href="Walther%20Funk">Walther Funk</a>, the Reich Minister for Economic Affairs, who said it would breach international law. <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, the <a href="Chancellor%20of%20Germany">German Chancellor</a>, gave the final approval for the operation to proceed.

Although the discussion was supposed to be secret, in November 1939 <a href="Michael%20Palairet">Michael Palairet</a>, <a href="List%20of%20ambassadors%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom%20to%20Greece">Britain's ambassador to Greece</a>, met a Russian émigré who gave him full details of the plan discussed at the 18 September meeting; according to the émigré's report, the plan was titled "Offensive against Sterling and Destruction of its Position as World Currency". Palairet reported the information to London, who alerted the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury">US Department of the Treasury</a> and the Bank of England. Although the Bank considered the existing security measures were sufficient, in 1940 it released a blue emergency <a href="Bank%20of%20England%20%C2%A31%20note">£1 note</a> which had a metal <a href="security%20thread">security thread</a> running through the paper. It also banned the import of pound notes for the duration of the war in 1943, stopped producing new £5 notes and warned the public about the danger of counterfeit currency.

On receipt of Hitler's go-ahead, Heydrich opened a counterfeiting unit under the operational title (Operation Andreas). Heydrich's order to set up the unit stated that

This is not to be a forgery or counterfeiting in the usual sense, but authorised facsimile production. The notes must be such a perfect copy of the original that even the most experienced bank-note experts cannot tell the difference.

In early 1940 the forgery unit was set up in Berlin within the technical department of the (SD), headed by <a href="Alfred%20Naujocks">Alfred Naujocks</a>, a <a href="Sturmbannf%C3%BChrer">major</a> in the paramilitary <a href="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a> (SS). Daily operational control fell under the auspices of Naujocks's technical director, Albert Langer, a mathematician and <a href="cryptography">code-breaker</a>. The pair broke the task down into three stages: producing identical paper, preparing identical <a href="Offset%20printing%23Plates">printing plates</a> to the British notes, and duplicating the British serial numbering system.

The Germans decided to concentrate on the notes with the largest number in circulation, the £5. Samples of British notes were sent to technical colleges for analysis, which reported back that it was rag paper with no added <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>. Naujocks and Langer realised that the paper would have to be handmade. The colour of the first samples differed from the original; the Germans had used new rags. After tests at the <a href="Hahnem%C3%BChle">Hahnemühle</a> paper factory, the rags were used by local factories and then cleaned before being used to make the paper; the colours of the counterfeit and original notes then matched. When the initial paper samples were produced, at a factory in Spechthausen, they looked identical to British notes in normal light, but looked dull in <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> light when compared to the originals. Langer surmised it was because of the chemical composition of the water used for making the paper and in the ink. He duplicated the chemical balance of British water in order to make the colours match.

To break the coded arrangement of the alphanumeric serial designation, Langer worked with banking experts, examining records of currency from the previous 20 years in order to replicate the correct order. No records were kept by Operation Andreas and the method of how the Germans identified the correct sequences is not known; the paper historian Peter Bower states that it is possible that techniques adapted from those used in <a href="cryptanalysis">cryptanalysis</a> were used to break the sequences. The German engravers working on the engraving plates struggled to reproduce the vignette of Britannia, which they nicknamed "Bloody Britannia" because it was so difficult. After seven months the forgers finished what they thought was a perfect copy, although Kenworthy states that the figure's eyes are incorrect.

By late 1940 Naujocks had been removed from his position after he fell out of favour with Heydrich. The counterfeiting unit continued under Langer before he left in early 1942 at which point it closed down; he later stated that over 18 months, the unit had produced around £3 million in forged notes; the historian Anthony Pirie puts the figure at £500,000. Most of the currency produced in Operation Andreas was never used.

In July 1942, following changes in the aim of the plan, <a href="Heinrich%20Himmler">Heinrich Himmler</a> revived the operation. Whereas the original plan was to bring about the collapse of the British economy through dropping the notes over the UK, Himmler's new intention was to use the counterfeit money to finance German intelligence operations. The security services under Himmler's control were poorly funded, and the counterfeit funds were used to cover the financial shortfalls in revenue from the .

SS Major <a href="Bernhard%20Kr%C3%BCger">Bernhard Krüger</a> replaced Naujocks; searching through the offices used daily by Operation Andreas, he found the copper engraving plates and the machinery, although some of the wire gauzes used to make the watermarks were bent. He was ordered to use the Jewish prisoners incarcerated in the <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">Nazi concentration camps</a>, and set up his unit in blocks 18 and 19 at <a href="Sachsenhausen%20concentration%20camp">Sachsenhausen</a>. The blocks were isolated from the rest of the camp by additional barbed wire fences, and a unit was assigned as guards.

Krüger visited several other concentration camps to assemble the people he needed, primarily <a href="Forced%20labour%20under%20German%20rule%20during%20World%20War%20II">selecting those</a> with skills in draftsmanship, engraving, printing and banking. In September 1942 the first 26 prisoners for Operation Bernhard arrived at Sachsenhausen; 80 more arrived in December. When met by Krüger, he called them in the formal and polite form , rather than the more demeaning , which was normally used when the Nazis spoke to a Jew. Several of the prisoners selected later reported that Krüger had interviewed them for the role, and treated them with politeness and good manners. He also provided the prisoners with cigarettes, newspapers, extra rations and a radio. Prisoners had a <a href="ping%20pong">ping pong</a> table, and they would play with the guards and among themselves; evenings of amateur theatricals also took place, staged by the prisoners, with a mixed audience of guards and counterfeiters; Krüger provided musicians for musical numbers.
The printing equipment was also delivered in December, and 12,000 sheets of banknote paper a month began to arrive from Hahnemühle; it was large enough for four notes to be printed on each sheet. Production of counterfeit notes started in January 1943; it took a year for production to return to the levels achieved in Operation Andreas.

Each section of the process was overseen by one of the prisoners, and the day-to-day operations were run by Oscar Stein, a former office manager and bookkeeper. Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were roughened to imitate the <a href="deckle">deckle</a> finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six <a href="History%20of%20printing%23Flat-bed%20printing%20press">flat-bed printing presses</a>.

To age the notes, between 40 and 50 prisoners stood in two columns and passed the notes among them to accumulate dirt, sweat and general wear and tear. Some of the prisoners would fold and refold the notes, others would pin the corners to replicate how a bank clerk would collect bundles of notes. British names and addresses were written on the reverse, as happened with some English notes, and numbers were written on the front – duplicating how a bank teller would mark the value of a bundle. Four grades of note quality were introduced: grade 1 was the highest quality, to be used in neutral countries and by Nazi spies; grade 2 was to be used to pay collaborators; grade 3 was for notes that were to be possibly dropped over Britain; grade 4 were too flawed to be of use and were destroyed.

The Nazi authorities were so pleased with the results of the operation that twelve prisoners, three of whom were Jewish, were awarded the <a href="War%20Merit%20Medal">War Merit Medal</a> while six of the guards received the <a href="War%20Merit%20Cross">War Merit Cross</a>, 2nd class.
In May 1944 <a href="Ernst%20Kaltenbrunner">Ernst Kaltenbrunner</a>, an SS (general) in the (Reich Main Security Office; RSHA), ordered that the counterfeiting unit begin to produce forged <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Note">US dollars</a>. The artwork on the notes was more complex than that of the British currency and caused problems for the forgers. Additional challenges they faced included the paper, which contained minute silk threads, and the <a href="intaglio%20%28printmaking%29">intaglio</a> printing process, which added small ridges to the paper.

The prisoners realised that if they managed to fully counterfeit the dollars, their lives would no longer be safeguarded by the work they were undertaking, so they slowed their progress as much as they could. The journalist Lawrence Malkin, who wrote a history of Operation Bernhard, writes that prisoners considered this to have the tacit approval of Krüger, who would face front-line duty if Operation Bernhard ended. In August 1944 <a href="Salomon%20Smolianoff">Salomon Smolianoff</a>, a convicted forger, was added to the production team at Sachsenhausen to aid the counterfeiting of US dollars, although he also assisted in quality control for the pound notes. The Jewish prisoners working on the operation at the time complained to Krüger at having to work with a criminal, so he was given his own room to sleep in.

In late 1944 the prisoners had counterfeited the <a href="obverse%20and%20reverse">reverse</a> of the dollar, and the obverse by January 1945. Twenty samples of the $100 note were produced—without the serial number, whose algorithm was still being examined—and shown to Himmler and banking experts. The standard of engraving and printing was considered excellent, although the paper used was technically inferior to the genuine notes.

The counterfeit money was transported from Sachsenhausen to Schloss Labers, an SS-run facility in the <a href="South%20Tyrol">South Tyrol</a>. It was put through a money laundering operation run by , who had been running an illegal currency and smuggling business since the 1930s. He negotiated a deal in which he would be paid 33.3% of the money he laundered; 25% was given to his agents undertaking the work—as payment to them and their sub-agents, and for expenses—leaving him with 8.3%. He recruited what he called "salesmen" in various territories, and built a network of 50 agents and sub agents; some of these were Jewish, deliberately selected because there was less chance that the authorities would consider them to be working for the Nazis. He informed his agents that the money had been seized from the banks of occupied countries.

Schwend was given two objectives: to exchange the counterfeit money for genuine <a href="Swiss%20franc">Swiss franc</a>s or <a href="United%20States%20dollar">US dollars</a>, and to assist with the funding of special operations, including buying <a href="black%20market">black market</a> arms from the <a href="Yugoslav%20Partisans">Yugoslav Partisans</a> then selling them to pro-Nazi groups in <a href="Southeast%20Europe">Southeast Europe</a>. He also arranged for the counterfeit notes to pay the Turkish agent <a href="Elyesa%20Bazna">Elyesa Bazna</a>—code named Cicero—for his work in obtaining secrets from the British ambassador in <a href="Ankara">Ankara</a>. Counterfeit notes with a <a href="face%20value">face value</a> of £100,000 were used to obtain information that helped to free the Italian leader <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> in the <a href="Gran%20Sasso%20raid">Gran Sasso raid</a> in September 1943.

Between late February and early March 1945, with the <a href="Allied%20advance%20from%20Paris%20to%20the%20Rhine">advance of the Allied armies</a>, all production of notes at Sachsenhausen ceased. The equipment and supplies were packed and transported, with the prisoners, to the <a href="Mauthausen-Gusen%20concentration%20camp">Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp</a> in Austria, arriving on 12 March. Shortly afterwards Krüger arranged for a further transfer to the <a href="Redl-Zipf">Redl-Zipf</a> series of tunnels where they were to restart production. The order to resume production was soon rescinded, and the prisoners were ordered to destroy the cases of money they had with them. That which was not burnt by the prisoners was loaded onto trucks with the printing equipment and sunk in the <a href="Lake%20Toplitz">Toplitz</a> and <a href="Grundlsee">Grundlsee</a> lakes.

At the start of May, Operation Bernhard was officially closed down and the prisoners were transported from the caves to the nearby <a href="Ebensee%20concentration%20camp">Ebensee concentration camp</a>. They were divided into three groups, and a truck was to make trips to and from the camp. An order had been issued that the prisoners were to be killed, but only once they were together at Ebensee. The truck delivered the first two groups to the camp, where the men were housed separately from the general camp population. On the third journey the vehicle broke down after it had picked up the final group of prisoners; the men in the last group were marched to the camp, which took two days. As the order had specified that the prisoners had to be killed together, the first two groups were kept safe to await their comrades. Because of the delay with the third journey and the close proximity of the advancing Allied army, on 5 May the first two groups were released from their isolation into the general population and their SS guards fled. That afternoon the third group arrived at the camp. When the guards learned what had happened to the first two groups, they also released their prisoners into the main prison population and fled. The Americans arrived the following day and liberated the camp.

Estimates of the number and value of notes printed during Operation Bernhard vary from a total of £132,610,945 (of which £10,368,445 were sent to the RHSA central office), up to £300 million (of which £125 million were usable notes).

Krüger hid at his home until November 1946 when he handed himself over to the <a href="Allied-occupied%20Germany">British authorities</a>. Forging an enemy's currency was not a <a href="war%20crime">war crime</a>; he faced no charges. He was detained until early 1947 when he was handed over to the French. They attempted to persuade him to forge <a href="passport">passport</a>s for them, but he refused; he was released in November 1948. He underwent a <a href="denazification">denazification</a> process, during which statements were produced from the forger-inmates whose lives he had been responsible for saving. He later worked for the Hahnemühle paper company. In 1965 the <a href="East%20German">East German</a> writer <a href="Julius%20Mader">Julius Mader</a> published , an attack on the <a href="West%20German">West German</a> government for harbouring Krüger.

Schwend amassed a fortune from Operation Bernhard. He was captured by American forces in June 1945, who tried to use him to assist in setting up a counterintelligence network in Germany, the <a href="Gehlen%20Organization">Gehlen Organization</a>. After he was caught trying to defraud the network, he <a href="Ratlines%20%28World%20War%20II%20aftermath%29">fled to Peru</a>. Although he periodically acted as an informant for Peruvian intelligence, he was arrested for currency smuggling and selling state secrets. After a two-year prison sentence, he was deported to West Germany where he was tried for a wartime murder in 1979; he was given a <a href="suspended%20sentence">suspended sentence</a> for <a href="manslaughter">manslaughter</a>.
Lake Toplitz has been the site of several large-scale searches. In 1958 an expedition located several cases of the counterfeit money from Operation Bernhard and a book that detailed the Bank of England's numbering system. Following the death of a diver in the lake in 1963—his two companions on the lake included "a former Nazi secret agent and ... a German business man mentioned in connection with counterfeit gold coins"—the Austrian government undertook a month-long search of the lake, during which they recovered more boxes of notes. The zoologist Hans Fricke from the <a href="Max%20Planck%20Institute">Max Planck Institute</a> searched the lake bottom for several years for rare aquatic life; in 1989 he took Krüger in a mini-submarine on one of his exploratory trips. In 2000 the submersible that was used to search the wreck of <a href="RMS%20Titanic">RMS "Titanic"</a> was used to survey the lake floor, and several boxes of notes were recovered, witnessed by <a href="Adolf%20Burger">Adolf Burger</a>, a former prisoner involved in the counterfeiting operation.

On seeing the quality of the notes, one bank official described them as "the most dangerous ever seen". Counterfeit notes worth £15–20 million were in general circulation at the end of the war. With such a volume in general circulation, in April 1943 the Bank of England stopped releasing all notes of £10 and above. In February 1957 a new £5 banknote was issued; the blue note was printed on both sides and "relied on subtle colour changes and detailed machine engraving" for security. Other denominations were also reintroduced: the £10 in February 1964, the £20 in July 1970 and the £50 note in March 1981.

The "<a href="Tilhas%20Tizig%20Gesheften">Tilhas Tizig Gesheften</a>", a small group formed from the British Army's <a href="Jewish%20Brigade">Jewish Brigade</a>, obtained a supply of counterfeit pounds from Jaacov Levy, one of Schwend's money-laundering agents. The forged notes were used to buy equipment and to bring displaced persons to <a href="Mandatory%20Palestine">Palestine</a>, in defiance of the British blockade of the territory.

Several memoirs have been published by former prisoners, which include the 1949 Norwegian account by , and "Des Teufels Werkstatt", the 1983 German-language account by Adolf Burger. Both works have been translated into English; several histories about the operation have also been published.

In 1981 "<a href="Private%20Schulz">Private Schulz</a>", a fictional version of Operation Bernhard, was broadcast on the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> as a comedy-drama. The television serial starred <a href="Michael%20Elphick">Michael Elphick</a> and <a href="Ian%20Richardson">Ian Richardson</a>. In 2007 Burger's memoirs were used as the basis for a film adaption, "<a href="The%20Counterfeiters%20%282007%20film%29">The Counterfeiters</a>" (), which tells the story of Salomon Sorowitsch, a character loosely based on the lives of Smolianoff and Burger. The film won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Foreign%20Language%20Film">Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film</a> at the <a href="80th%20Academy%20Awards">80th Academy Awards</a>.

It is the policy of the Bank of England to redeem all withdrawn notes for current currency at the face value shown on the note, except for counterfeit currency. Examples of counterfeits from Operation Bernhard have appeared at auction and been sold through dealers for a higher face value than the original £5. There are also examples of the notes in the museum of the <a href="National%20Bank%20of%20Belgium">National Bank of Belgium</a> and the Bank of England Museum.

McDonnell XF-85 Goblin

The McDonnell XF-85 Goblin is an American prototype <a href="fighter%20aircraft">fighter aircraft</a> conceived during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> by <a href="McDonnell%20Aircraft">McDonnell Aircraft</a>. It was intended to deploy from the <a href="bomb%20bay">bomb bay</a> of the giant <a href="Convair%20B-36">Convair B-36</a> bomber as a <a href="parasite%20fighter">parasite fighter</a>. The XF-85's intended role was to defend bombers from hostile <a href="interceptor%20aircraft">interceptor aircraft</a>, a need demonstrated during World War II. McDonnell built two prototypes before the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Air%20Forces">Air Force (USAAF)</a> terminated the program.

The XF-85 was a response to a USAAF requirement for a fighter to be carried within the <a href="Northrop%20YB-35">Northrop XB-35</a> and B-36, then under development. This was to address the limited range of existing interceptor aircraft compared to the greater range of new bomber designs. The XF-85 was a diminutive jet aircraft featuring a distinctive egg-shaped <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a> and a forked-tail <a href="Stabilizer%20%28aircraft%29">stabilizer</a> design. The prototypes were built and underwent testing and evaluation in 1948. Flight tests showed promise in the design, but the aircraft's performance was inferior to the jet fighters it would have faced in combat, and there were difficulties in docking. The XF-85 was swiftly canceled, and the prototypes were thereafter relegated to museum exhibits. The 1947 successor to the USAAF, the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">United States Air Force</a> (USAF), continued to examine the concept of parasite aircraft under <a href="FICON%20project">Project MX-106 "Tip Tow"</a>, <a href="FICON%20project">Project FICON</a> and <a href="FICON%20project">Project "Tom-Tom"</a> following the cancellation.

During World War II, American bombers such as the <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress</a>, <a href="Consolidated%20B-24%20Liberator">Consolidated B-24 Liberator</a> and <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">Boeing B-29 Superfortress</a> were protected by long-range escort fighters such as the <a href="Republic%20P-47%20Thunderbolt">Republic P-47 Thunderbolt</a> and <a href="North%20American%20P-51%20Mustang">North American P-51 Mustang</a>. These fighters could not match the range of the Northrop B-35 or Convair B-36, the next generation of bombers developed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF). The development cost for longer-ranged fighters was high, while <a href="aerial%20refueling">aerial refueling</a> was still considered risky and technologically difficult. Pilot fatigue had also been a problem during long fighter escort missions in Europe and the Pacific, giving further impetus to innovative approaches.

The USAAF considered a number of different options including the use of remotely piloted vehicles before choosing <a href="parasite%20fighter">parasite fighter</a>s as the most viable B-36 defense. The concept of a parasite fighter had its origins in 1918, when the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a> examined the viability of <a href="Sopwith%20Camel">Sopwith Camel</a> parasite fighters operating from <a href="23%20class%20airship">"R23"</a> airships. In the 1930s, the U.S. Navy had a short-lived operational parasite fighter, the <a href="Curtiss%20F9C%20Sparrowhawk">Curtiss F9C Sparrowhawk</a>, aboard the airships and . Starting in 1931, aircraft designer <a href="Vladimir%20Vakhmistrov">Vladimir Vakhmistrov</a> conducted experiments in the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> as part of the <a href="Zveno%20project">Zveno project</a> during which up to five fighters of various types were carried by <a href="Polikarpov%20TB-2">Polikarpov TB-2</a> and <a href="Tupolev%20TB-3">Tupolev TB-3</a> bombers. In August 1941, these combinations flew the only combat missions ever undertaken by parasite fighters – TB-3s carrying <a href="Polikarpov%20I-16">Polikarpov I-16SPB</a> <a href="dive%20bomber">dive bomber</a>s attacked the <a href="King%20Carol%20I%20Bridge">Cernavodă bridge</a> and <a href="Constantsa">Constantsa</a> docks, in <a href="Romania">Romania</a>. After that attack, the squadron, based in the Crimea, carried out a tactical attack on a bridge over the river <a href="Dnieper">Dnieper</a> at <a href="Zaporizhia">Zaporozhye</a>, which had been captured by advancing German troops. Later in World War II, the "<a href="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a>" experimented with the <a href="Messerschmitt%20Me%20328">Messerschmitt Me 328</a> as a parasite fighter, but problems with its <a href="pulsejet">pulsejet</a> engines could not be overcome. Other late-war <a href="rocket">rocket</a>-powered parasite fighter projects such as the <a href="Arado%20E.381">Arado E.381</a> and <a href="List%20of%20German%20aircraft%20projects%2C%201939-1945">Sombold So 344</a> were unrealized "paper projects".

On 3 December 1942, the USAAF sent out a Request for Proposals (RfP) for a diminutive piston-engined fighter. By January 1944, the <a href="Air%20Force%20Logistics%20Command">Air Technical Service Command</a> refined the RfP and in January 1945, the specifications were further revised in MX-472 to specify a jet-powered aircraft. Although a number of aerospace companies studied the feasibility of such aircraft, McDonnell was the only company to submit a proposal to the original 1942 request and later revised requirements. The company's Model 27 proposal was completely reworked to meet the new specifications.

The initial concept for the Model 27 was for the fighter to be carried half-exposed under the B-29, B-35 or B-36. The USAAF rejected this proposal, citing increased drag, and hence reduced range for the composite bomber-fighter configuration. On 19 March 1945, McDonnell's design team led by Herman D. Barkey, submitted a revised proposal, the extensively redesigned Model 27D. The smaller aircraft had an egg-shaped fuselage, three fork-shaped vertical stabilizers, horizontal stabilizers with a significant <a href="Dihedral%20%28aircraft%29">dihedral</a>, and 37° swept-back folding wings to allow it to fit in the confines of a bomb bay. The diminutive aircraft measured long; the folding wings spanned . Only a limited fuel supply of was deemed necessary for the specified 30-minute combat endurance. A hook was installed along the aircraft's center of gravity; in flight, it retracted to lie flat in the upper part of the nose. The aircraft had an empty weight just short of . To save weight, the fighter had no landing gear. During the testing program, a fixed steel skid under the fuselage and spring-steel "runners" at the underside of the wingtips were installed in case of an emergency landing. Despite the cramped quarters, a pilot was provided with a cordite ejection seat, bail-out oxygen bottle and high-speed ribbon parachute. Four machine guns in the nose made up the aircraft's armament.

In service, the parasite fighter would be launched and retrieved by a <a href="trapeze">trapeze</a>. With the trapeze fully extended, the engine would be airstarted and the release from the <a href="mother%20ship">mother ship</a> was accomplished by the pilot pulling the nose back to disengage from the hook. In recovery, the aircraft would approach the mother ship from underneath and link up with the trapeze using the retractable hook in the aircraft's nose. The anticipated production shift would see a mixed B-36 fleet with both "fighter carriers" and bombers employed on missions. There were plans that, from the 24th B-36 onward, provisions would be made to accommodate one XF-85, with a maximum of four per bomber envisioned. Up to 10 percent of the B-36s on order were to be converted to fighter carriers with three or four F-85s instead of a bomb load.
On 9 October 1945, the USAAF signed a letter of intent covering the engineering development for two prototypes (<a href="United%20States%20military%20aircraft%20serials">US serial numbers</a> "46-523/4"), although the contract was not finalized until February 1947. After the successful conclusion of two reviews of a wooden mock-up in 1946 and 1947 by USAAF engineering staff, McDonnell constructed two prototypes in late 1947. The Model 27D was re-designated XP-85, but by June 1948, it was changed to XF-85 and given the name "Goblin". There were plans to acquire 30 production P-85s, but the USAAF took the cautious approach – if test results from the two prototypes were positive, production orders for more than 100 Goblins would be finalized later.

During <a href="wind%20tunnel">wind tunnel</a> testing at <a href="Moffett%20Field">Moffett Field</a>, California, the first prototype XF-85 was accidentally dropped from a crane at a height of , causing substantial damage to the forward fuselage, air intake and lower fuselage. The second prototype had to be substituted for the remainder of the wind tunnel tests and the initial flight tests.

As a production series B-36 was unavailable, all XF-85 flight tests were carried out using a converted <a href="Boeing%20B-29%20Superfortress">EB-29B Superfortress</a> mother ship that had a modified, "cutaway" bomb bay complete with trapeze, front airflow deflector and an array of camera equipment and instrumentation. Since the EB-29B, named "Monstro", was smaller than the B-36, the XF-85 would be flight tested, half-exposed. To load the XF-85 into the host plane, a special "loading pit" was dug into the tarmac at South Base, <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Muroc Field</a>, where all the flight tests originated. On 23 July 1948, the XF-85 flew the first of five captive flights, designed to test whether the EB-29B and its parasite fighter could fly "mated". The XF-85 was carried in a stowed position, but was sometimes tethered and extended into the airstream with the engine off, for the pilot to gain some feel for the aircraft in flight.
McDonnell test pilot Edwin Schoch was assigned to the project, riding in the XF-85 while it was stowed aboard the EB-29B, before attempting a "free" flight on 23 August 1948. After Schoch was released from the bomber at a height of 20,000 ft (6,000 m), he completed a 10-minute proving flight at speeds between 180 and 250 mph (290–400 km/h), testing controls and maneuverability. When he attempted a hook-up, it became obvious the Goblin was extremely sensitive to the bomber's <a href="wake%20turbulence">turbulence</a>, as well as being affected by the <a href="Ground%20effect%20%28aircraft%29">air cushion</a> created by the two aircraft operating in close proximity. Constant but gentle adjustments of throttle and trim were necessary to overcome the cushioning effect. After three attempts to hook onto the trapeze, Schoch miscalculated his approach and struck the trapeze so violently that the canopy was smashed and ripped free and his helmet and mask were torn off. He saved the prototype by making a <a href="belly%20landing">belly landing</a> on the reinforced skid at the dry lake bed at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Muroc</a>. All flight testing was suspended for seven weeks while the XF-85 was repaired and modified. Schoch used the down period to undertake a series of problem-free dummy dockings with a <a href="Lockheed%20P-80%20Shooting%20Star">Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star</a> fighter.

After boosting the trim power by 50 percent, adjusting the aerodynamics, and other modifications, two further mated test flights were carried out before Schoch was able to make a successful release and hookup on 14 October 1948. During the fifth free flight on 22 October 1948, Schoch again found it difficult to hook the Goblin to the bomber's trapeze, aborting four attempts before hitting the trapeze bar and breaking the hook on the XF-85's nose. Again, a forced landing was successfully carried out at Muroc.

With the first prototype's repairs completed, it also joined the flight test program, completing captive flights. While in flight, the Goblin was stable, easy to fly, and recoverable from spins, although initial estimates of a 648 mph (1,043 km/h) top speed proved optimistic. The first test flights revealed that turbulence during approach to the B-29 was significant, leading to the addition of upper and lower fins at the extreme rear fuselage, as well as two wingtip fins to compensate for the increased directional instability in docking. All the initial flights had the hook secured in a fixed position, but when the hook was stowed and later raised, the resulting buffeting added to the difficulty in attempting a hookup. To address the problem, small aerodynamic <a href="fairing%20%28aircraft%29">fairings</a> were added to the hook well that reduced the buffeting when the hook was extended and retracted. When testing resumed, on the 18 March 1948 test flight, Schoch continued to have difficulty in hooking up, striking and damaging the trapeze's nose-stabilizing section, before resorting to another emergency belly landing. After repairs to the trapeze, Schoch flew the first prototype on 8 April 1949, completing a 30-minute free flight test, but after three attempts, abandoned his efforts and resorted to another belly landing at Muroc.

Aware of the problems revealed in flight tests, McDonnell reviewed the program and proposed a new development based on a more conventional design promising a Mach 0.9 capability, using alternatively a 35° swept wing and delta wing. McDonnell also considered adding a telescoping extension to the docking trapeze that would extend the device below the turbulent air under the mother ship. Before any further work on the trapeze, other modifications to the XF-85, or continued design studies on its follow-up could be carried out, the <a href="United%20States%20Air%20Force">USAF</a> canceled the XF-85 program on 24 October 1949.

Two main reasons contributed to the cancellation. The XF-85's deficiencies revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected. The development of practical aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also a factor in the cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven times, with a total flight time of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful hookup. Schoch was the only pilot who ever flew the aircraft.

Despite cancellation of the XF-85, the USAF continued to examine the concept of parasite aircraft as defensive fighters through a series of projects. These included <a href="FICON%20project">Project MX-106 "Tip Tow", Project FICON, and Project "Tom-Tom"</a>—which involved fighter aircraft attached to bomber aircraft by their wingtips. Project FICON ("fighter conveyor") emerged as an effective <a href="Convair%20B-36">Convair GRB-36D</a> and <a href="Republic%20F-84F%20Thunderstreak">Republic RF-84K Thunderflash</a> combined bomber-reconnaissance-fighter, although the role was changed to that of strategic reconnaissance. Project FICON drew heavily on data from the abortive XF-85 project and closely followed McDonnell's recommendations in designing a more refined trapeze. A total of 10 converted B-36s and 25 reconnaissance fighters saw limited service with the <a href="Strategic%20Air%20Command">Strategic Air Command</a> in 1955–1956, before they were supplemented by more effective aircraft and satellite systems.

After the program's termination, the two XF-85 prototypes were stored, before being surplussed and relegated to museum display in 1950.

Hoodening

Hoodening (), also spelled hodening and oodening, is a <a href="tradition">folk custom</a> found in <a href="Kent">Kent</a>, a county in <a href="South%20East%20England">south-eastern</a> <a href="England">England</a>. The tradition entails the use of a wooden <a href="hobby%20horse">hobby horse</a> known as a hooden horse that is mounted on a pole and carried by an individual hidden under a <a href="sackcloth">sackcloth</a>. Originally, the tradition was restricted to the area of <a href="East%20Kent">East Kent</a>, although in the twentieth century it spread into neighbouring <a href="West%20Kent">West Kent</a>. It represents a regional variation of a "hooded animal" tradition that appears in various forms throughout the British Isles.

As recorded from the eighteenth to the early twentieth centuries, hoodening was a tradition performed at <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> time by groups of farm labourers. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, a man in female clothing known as a "Mollie", and several musicians. The team would then carry the hooden horse to local houses and shops, where they would expect payment for their appearance. Although this practice is extinct, in the present the hooden horse is incorporated into various Kentish <a href="Mummers%20play">Mummers play</a>s and <a href="Morris%20dance">Morris dance</a>s that take place at different times of the year.

The origins of the hoodening tradition, and the original derivation of the term "hooden", remain subject to academic debate. An early suggestion was that "hooden" was related to the <a href="Anglo-Saxon%20paganism">Anglo-Saxon pre-Christian</a> god <a href="Woden">Woden</a>, and that the tradition therefore originated with pre-Christian religious practices in the early medieval <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kingdom of Kent</a>. This idea has not found support from <a href="History">historians</a> or <a href="Folkloristics">folklorists</a> studying the tradition. A more widely accepted explanation among scholars is that the term "hooden" relates to "hooded", a reference to the sackcloth worn by the individual carrying the horse. The absence of late medieval references to such practices and the geographic dispersal of the various British hooded animal traditions—among them the <a href="Mari%20Lwyd">Mari Lwyd</a> of south Wales, <a href="The%20Broad%20%28folk%20custom%29">the Broad</a> of the <a href="Cotswolds">Cotswolds</a>, and the <a href="Old%20Ball">Old Ball</a>, <a href="Old%20Tup">Old Tup</a>, and <a href="Old%20Horse">Old Horse</a> of northern England—have led to suggestions that they derive from the regionalised popularisation of the sixteenth and seventeenth-century fashion for hobby horses among the social elite.

The earliest textual reference to the hoodening tradition comes from the first half of the eighteenth century. Scattered references to it appeared over the next century and a half, many of which considered it to be a declining tradition that had died out in many parts of Kent. Aware of this decline, in the early twentieth century the folklorist and historian Percy Maylam documented what survived of the tradition and traced its appearances in historical documents, publishing his findings as "The Hooden Horse" in 1909. Although deemed extinct at the time of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a>, the custom was revived in an altered form during the mid-twentieth century, when the use of the hooden horse was incorporated into some modern Kentish folk traditions.

Surviving sources testify to the fact that while there was some variation in the hoodening tradition as it was practiced by different individuals in different parts of East Kent, it was nevertheless "on the whole remarkably uniform". The hooden horse, which was at the centre of the tradition, was usually made out of a wooden horse's head affixed to a pole about four feet long, with a hinged jaw that was moved by a string. This horse was then carried aloft by an individual who was concealed beneath a dark cloth. As part of the hoodening custom, a team of "hoodeners", consisting of between four and eight men, would carry the horse through the streets. This team included the horse operator, a "Groom", "Driver", or "Waggoner" who carried a whip and led the horse by a bridle, a "Jockey" who would attempt to mount the horse, a "Mollie" who was a man dressed as a woman, and one or two musicians. All of the men were farm labourers, usually being those who worked with horses. 

The team performed the custom at Christmas time, and usually on <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>. The team would arrive at people's houses where they would sing a song before being admitted entry. Once inside, the horse pranced and gnashed its jaw, while the Jockey attempted to mount it, and the Mollie swept the floor with a broom while chasing any girls present. Sometimes they would sing further songs and carols. Upon being presented with payment, the team would leave to repeat the process at another house.

Historians have catalogued 33 recorded instances of the hoodening tradition extant in Kent prior to the twentieth-century revival. These are clustered in a crescent shape along the eastern and northern coasts of the county, and all were found within the area historically defined as <a href="East%20Kent">East Kent</a>, the tradition being unknown in neighbouring <a href="West%20Kent">West Kent</a>. More specifically, the folklorist Percy Maylam noted that there were no records of the tradition having been found west of <a href="Godmersham">Godmersham</a>. This region was "a well populated area" during the period in which the hoodeners were active, and Maylam noted that all of the areas in which the tradition was found contained the East Kentish dialect. The folklorist E. C. Cawte analysed the historical distribution of the hoodeners and found that it did not correspond with the areas of early Anglo-Saxon settlement in Kent, nor did it accord with the county's coal mining areas. He concluded that "there is no apparent reason why the custom did not spread further afield".

Hoodening was part of a wider "hooded animal" tradition that Cawte identified as existing in different forms in various parts of Britain. Features common to these customs were the use of a hobby horse, the performance at Christmas time, a song or spoken statement requesting payment, and the use of a team who included a man dressed in women's clothing. In South Wales, the <a href="Mari%20Lwyd">Mari Lwyd</a> tradition featured troupes of men with a hobby horse knocking at doors over the Christmas period. In an area along the border between <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> and <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, the <a href="Old%20Tup">Old Tup</a> tradition featured groups knocking on doors around Christmas carrying a hobby horse that had a goat's head. The folklorist <a href="Christina%20Hole">Christina Hole</a> drew parallels between hoodening and the <a href="Christmas%20Bull">Christmas Bull</a> tradition recorded in <a href="Dorset">Dorset</a> and <a href="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>. In south-west England, there are two extant hobby horse traditions—the Padstow <a href="%27Obby%20%27Oss%20festival">'Obby 'Oss festival</a> and <a href="Minehead%20Hobby%20Horse">Minehead Hobby Horse</a>—which take place not at Christmas time but on <a href="May%20Day">May Day</a>.
Although the origins of these traditions are not known with any certainty, the lack of any late medieval references to such practices may suggest that they emerged from the documented elite fashion for hobby horses in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In this, the hooded animal traditions may be comparable to England's <a href="Morris%20dance">Morris dance</a> tradition, which became a "nation-wide craze" in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries before evolving into "a set of sharply delineated regional traditions".

Maylam noted that most nineteenth-century sources describing the tradition had spelled the word as "hoden", but that he favoured "hooden" because it better reflected the pronunciation of the word with its <a href="long%20vowel">long vowel</a>. He added that "the word 'hooden' rhymes with 'wooden' and not with 'sodden' as some writers appear to think". Given this pronunciation, Cawte suggested that "oodening" was a better spelling for the tradition's name. Maylam also noted that none of the hoodeners with whom he communicated were aware of the <a href="etymology">etymology</a> of the term, and that similarly they were unaware of the tradition's historical origins.

The term "hoodening" is thus of unknown derivation. One possible explanation for the origin of "hooden" was that it had emerged as a mispronunciation of "wooden", referring to the use of the wooden horse. Maylam was critical of this idea, expressing the view that such a mispronunciation was unlikely to emerge from the Kentish dialect. A second possibility is that the name "hooden" was a reference to the hooded nature of the horse's bearer. The historian <a href="Ronald%20Hutton">Ronald Hutton</a> deemed this to be the "simplest" derivation, while folklorists Cawte and <a href="Charlotte%20Sophia%20Burne">Charlotte Sophia Burne</a> also considered it the most likely explanation. Maylam was also critical of this, suggesting that the cloth under which the carrier was concealed was too large to be considered a hood.
In his "History of Kent", the antiquarian <a href="Alfred%20John%20Dunkin">Alfred John Dunkin</a> suggested that "Hodening" was a corruption of "Hobening", and that it was ultimately derived from the <a href="Gothic%20language">Gothic</a> "hopp", meaning horse. Maylam opined that Dunkin's argument could be "ignored", stating that it rested on the erroneous assumption that "Hodening" began with a short vowel.

Maylam concluded that the hoodening tradition was "a mutilated survival" of a form of Morris dance. Noting that some medieval Morris dancers had incorporated games devoted to the English folk hero <a href="Robin%20Hood">Robin Hood</a> into their custom, he suggested that "hoodening" might have originally been a reference to Robin Hood. This idea was challenged by Burne, who noted that in his legends, Robin Hood was always depicted as an archer rather than a horse-rider, thus questioning how he had come to be associated with the hooden horse. She further noted that the medieval games devoted to Robin Hood all took place in May rather than at Christmas, as hoodening did. Cawte also criticised Maylam's argument, noting that there was no evidence of Morris dancing in Kent prior to the twentieth century, and that neither hoodening nor Robin Hood had a particularly close association with the Morris dance to start with.

In 1807, an anonymous observer suggested that the term "hoden" was linked to the Anglo-Saxon god <a href="Woden">Woden</a>, and that the tradition might be "a relic of a festival to commemorate our Saxon ancestors landing in Thanet". In 1891, it was suggested that the custom had once been known as "Odining", a reference to the early medieval Scandinavian god <a href="Odin">Odin</a>. The author of this idea further suggested that the custom had begun either with the ritual wearing of the skins of horses sacrificed to Odin, or as an early Christian mockery of such Odinic practices. 

Maylam noted that he was initially attracted to the idea that the term "hodening" had derived from "Woden"—an <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> name that he thought a more likely origin than the <a href="Old%20Norse">Old Norse</a> "Odin"—but that upon investigating this possibility found "no sufficient evidence" for it. He added that it would seem unlikely that the "W" would be lost from "Woden" in the Kentish dialect, citing the example of <a href="Woodnesborough">Woodnesborough</a>, a Kentish village whose name is often interpreted as having derived from "Woden" and which clearly retains its use of "W". He concluded that "one feels that the theory is based on inferences and analogies not strong enough for a foundation to carry the building erected on them". The idea of linking the tradition to Woden was also dismissed as unlikely by both Burne and Cawte.

Believing it likely that the hoodening tradition "substantially pre-dates" its earliest textual appearances, the folklorist Geoff Doel suggested the possibility that it had originated as a Midwinter rite to re-energise the vegetation. As evidence for this claim, Doel noted that other English winter folk customs, such as the <a href="Apple%20Wassail">Apple Wassail</a>, have also been interpreted in this manner. He also suggested that the use of the horse in the tradition may have some connections to either the use of <a href="White%20horse%20of%20Kent">the white horse as the symbol of Kent</a>, and the use of <a href="Hengist%20and%20Horsa">Hengist and Horsa</a> (meaning "stallion" and "horse" in Old English) as prominent characters in the origin myths of the early medieval Kingdom of Kent.

The oldest known textual reference to hoodening comes from the "Alphabet of Kenticisms", a manuscript authored by <a href="Samuel%20Pegge">Samuel Pegge</a>, an <a href="antiquarianism">antiquary</a> who served as the vicar of Godmersham in Kent from 1731 to 1751. After Pegge died, the manuscript was obtained by the palaeographer <a href="Frederic%20Madden">Sir Frederic Madden</a>, and after his death it was purchased by the <a href="English%20Dialect%20Society">English Dialect Society</a>, who published it in 1876. In this manuscript, Pegge noted simply that "Hoodening (huod.ing) is a country masquerade at Christmas times", comparing it to <a href="Mummers%20play">Mumming</a> and the <a href="Winster%20Guisers">Winster Guisers</a> of <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a>.

The earliest known textual description of the tradition is provided by a letter that was published in a May 1807 edition of "<a href="European%20Magazine">European Magazine</a>". The letter had been written by an anonymous individual who was describing an encounter with the hoodeners on a visit to the Kentish coastal town of <a href="Ramsgate">Ramsgate</a> in <a href="Thanet%20District">Thanet</a>:

Later commenting on this source, Maylam highlighted that its author did not appear to be from Kent and that, from their use of wording, it appeared that they had been told about the tradition by locals but had not actually witnessed it first hand. As such, Maylam suggested that the author may have been wrong in describing the use of a horse's skull in the Ramsgate tradition, given that both later sources and the hoodeners of his own time all used a wooden model of a horse's head. At the same time, Maylam noted that the use of a horse's skull was not impossible, for such skulls had also been used in the hobby horse traditions of other parts of Britain.

The anonymously authored account was repeated almost verbatim in a range of other publications in the coming decades, giving its description far wider exposure. The first printed reference to the hooden horse having a wooden head appeared in Mackenzie E. C. Walcott's "Guide to the Coast of Kent", published in 1859, where he referred to a "curious custom [which] used to prevail" in Ramsgate. Maylam later suggested that the Ramsgate hooden horse tradition died out between 1807 and 1838, for he had interviewed elderly town residents in the early twentieth century and while several were aware that it had once taken place in the town, none could recall it happening in their own lifetime.

Many years after the event, the Kentish antiquarian <a href="J.%20Meadows%20Cooper">J. Meadows Cooper</a> related that while sitting in a pub on the outskirts of <a href="Margate">Margate</a> on <a href="Boxing%20Day">Boxing Day</a> 1855 he had encountered a party carrying a hooden horse that entered the building. Another local resident, Mrs. Edward Tomlin, later related that as a child she had lived at a house named Updown, near Margate, and that she remembered the hooden horse visiting them at Christmas time during the 1850s and up until 1865. Maylam's researches also found recollections of a hooden horse that had appeared in <a href="Herne%2C%20Kent">Herne</a> and <a href="Swalecliffe">Swalecliffe</a> but which had been discontinued in the 1860s, another that was active from Wingate Farm House in <a href="Harbledown">Harbledown</a> during the 1850s, and one that had been active at <a href="Evington">Evington</a> but which had ceased by the 1860s. He found another based at <a href="Lower%20Hardres">Lower Hardres</a> that had been active from at least the 1850s under the leadership of Henry Brazier; it was subsequently taken over by his son John, until the tradition ended locally in 1892.
In a January 1868 edition of the "<a href="Kentish%20Gazette">Kentish Gazette</a>", an anonymous author mentioned that hoodening had taken place in <a href="Minster%2C%20Swale">Minster, Swale</a> on the Christmas Eve of 1867. The author noted that the tradition featured <a href="Christmas%20carol">carol singing</a> and the ringing of <a href="handbell">handbell</a>s, which were accompanied by the appearance of a hooden horse; they expressed surprise at this latter event because they had thought that the horse was "as extinct as the <a href="megatherium">megatherium</a>".

In their 1888 "Dictionary of the Kentish Dialect", W. D. Parish and W. F. Shaw claimed that "Hodening" was a term used in Kent to refer to a custom involving the singing of carols, but that in the past "Hoodening" had been applied to "a mumming or masquerade" involving the hooden horse. They added that they had gained information on this older custom in 1876 from the Reverend H. Bennett Smith of <a href="St%20Nicholas-at-Wade">St Nicholas-at-Wade</a>, who had in turn learned from a retired farmer in his parish that "the farmer used to send annually round the neighbourhood the best horse under the charge of the wagoner, and that afterwards instead, a man used to represent the horse, being supplied with a tail, and with a wooden figure of a horse's head, and plenty of horse hair for a mane... The custom has long since ceased."

Parish and Shaw did not mention what time of year the tradition took place or its geographical location. They also made no reference to a sack concealing the person carrying the horse. Doel thought it likely that neither Parish or Shaw had ever seen a hooden horse, and that instead their information was based on older written sources. He also thought it noteworthy that they described the tradition using the <a href="past%20tense">past tense</a>, indicating that they considered it to be either dead or dying at the time of writing. Maylam believed that the information regarding the decline of the tradition was erroneous, because hoodeners were still active in St. Nicholas-at-Wade during the early twentieth century and various locals living in the area at the time could recall it taking place in the area back to the 1840s.

In December 1889, a letter written by a resident of St. Lawrence named Charles J. H. Saunders appeared in the "<a href="Bromley%20Record">Bromley Record</a>". Saunders stated that he had conversed with many elderly residents of Thanet on the subject of hoodening, and that they informed him that the custom had been discontinued around fifty years previously, after a woman in <a href="Broadstairs">Broadstairs</a> was so scared by the hooden horse that she died. He added that a horse's skull was rarely used, "owing to the difficulty procuring one", and that the wooden head was thus typically used as a replacement. He stated that the hoodening company typically consisted of a "Jockey" who placed himself on the back of the individual carrying the horse, and that it was the "sport" that bystanders attempted to throw him off, resulting in violence. The horse and jockey were also accompanied by two singers, two attendants, and an individual dressed as an "old woman" carrying a broom; when the company knocked on people's doors, it was the old woman's job to sweep the inhabitants feet away with her broom and to chase any girls until being paid off with money or refreshments. He was of the opinion that the custom had been restricted to the Isle of Thanet, noting that locals informed him that it had been carried out in Ramsgate, St. Lawrence, Minster, St. Nicholas, <a href="Acol%2C%20Kent">Acol</a>, <a href="Monkton%2C%20Kent">Monkton</a>, and <a href="Birchington-on-Sea">Birchington</a>. Contradicting this were several letters published in the "<a href="Church%20Times">Church Times</a>" in January 1891 which attested to the continuing practice of the hooden horse tradition at both Deal and Walmer.

Percy Maylam was born into a farming family in 1865 at Pivington Farm in <a href="Pluckley">Pluckley</a>, and in 1890 became a solicitor of the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Supreme Court</a> before working as a solicitor at <a href="Canterbury">Canterbury</a>. As well as being a keen cricketer and coin collector, Maylam was an amateur historian and in 1892 joined the <a href="Kent%20Archaeological%20Society">Kent Archaeological Society</a>. During the 1880s, Maylam came upon the hoodening tradition and began undertaking research into it, searching for textual references to the tradition in books, periodicals, and newspapers, and interviewing those involved in three extant traditions, at St Nicholas-at-Wade, <a href="Walmer">Walmer</a>, and <a href="Deal%2C%20Kent">Deal</a>. He expressed the opinion that "in these days Kent possesses so few genuine popular customs of this kind that we cannot afford to be indifferent to those still in existence. This is my excuse for my attempt to record the custom as now existing before it is utterly lost to us." 

The period in which Maylam conducted his research was one that was witnessing increased interest in the recording of Britain's rural folk culture, in particular by members of the professional classes—of which Maylam was a member—in part due to the fear that such traditions were rapidly dying out. Such folklore collecting was encouraged by <a href="The%20Folklore%20Society">The Folklore Society</a>, with whom Maylam was associated, and also by the widely read book "<a href="The%20Golden%20Bough">The Golden Bough</a>", a work of comparative folkloristics authored by the anthropologist <a href="James%20Frazer">James Frazer</a>. Maylam published his research in 1909 as "The Hooden Horse", in an edition limited to 303 copies. The book was reviewed in the journal "Folklore" by Burne, who described it as "an admirable piece of work, careful, thorough, unambitious, and complete in itself". Cawte later described it as "unusually good", while Fran and Geoff Doel regarded it as "a very enlightened piece of Edwardian folk research".

Maylam concluded that at the time, there was only one hooden horse still in active use in Thanet, that stored at Hale Farm in St. Nicholas-at-Wade, which he noted was brought out each Christmas to visit <a href="Sarre%2C%20Kent">Sarre</a>, Birchington, and St. Nicholas-at-Wade itself. The members included a man in female garb, known as the Mollie, in their procession, but added that this had not been done for some time and was thus reintroduced for Maylam's benefit. In his book, Maylam included a photograph of the horse taken at Sarre in 1905. On Christmas Eve 1906, Maylam encountered a second hooden horse, this time at Walmer. This horse came into the local hotel tearoom at about 6.30 pm, accompanied by two musicians—one playing the <a href="tambourine">tambourine</a> and the other the <a href="concertina">concertina</a>—and a man named Robert Laming who led the horse itself. They were wearing ordinary clothes, but informed Maylam that they had once worn smock frocks as part of the tradition. They had no Mollie, and the members could not recall a Mollie ever having been part of their custom. The hotel owner's daughter placed a gratuity in the horse's mouth, before the troupe moved on to the local shops, where they were also given gratuities in a similar manner. Maylam talked to the troupe about the tradition, and eventually organised the photographing of the Walmer horse and those who accompanied it in March 1907.

Maylam also interviewed those involved in the hoodening tradition at Deal, whom he encountered in the summer of 1909. One elderly gentleman, Robert Skardon, related that his father had once led the town's hoodening troupe, in which he personally carried the head, his father the drum, his "Uncle John Beaney" the <a href="fiddle">fiddle</a>, and "old Harry Chorner" the <a href="piccolo">piccolo</a>. For many years they had included a man dressed in woman's clothing, who was known as a "Daisy" rather than a "Mollie", but that this had been discontinued. Skardon had given up the tradition many years previously, and the hooden horse itself had come into the possession of Elbridge Bowles of <a href="Great%20Mongeham">Great Mongeham</a>, who continued to lead a hoodening troupe after Christmas each year, visiting Deal as well as the neighbouring villages of <a href="Finglesham">Finglesham</a>, <a href="Ripple%2C%20Kent">Ripple</a>, <a href="Tilmanstone">Tilmanstone</a>, <a href="Eastry">Eastry</a>, and <a href="Betteshanger">Betteshanger</a>. Maylam was also informed that at the time of Britain's involvement in the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a>, the horse had been decorated with military equipment. The fourth hooden horse that Maylam encountered was owned by the men who worked at George Goodson's farm in Fenland, Word, near <a href="Sandwich%2C%20Kent">Sandwich</a>. They informed him that it had been made by a farm hand in <a href="Cleve%2C%20Kent">Cleve</a>, Monkton, before being brought to Word when one of the Cleve farm workers relocated there.

Maylam believed that the custom—as a "natural and spontaneous observance" among the people—was clearly going to die out, expressing his hope that the hooden horses could be preserved in Kentish museums and brought out for specially arranged public processions so as to maintain their place in Kentish culture. In later life, Maylam focused his attentions on exploring his family history, privately publishing "Maylam Family Records" in 1932, before dying in 1939. In the century following his death, Maylam's book on hoodening became difficult to obtain and expensive to purchase, and so to mark the centenary of its first publication, it was republished in 2009 by <a href="The%20History%20Press">The History Press</a>, under the altered title of "The Kent Hooden Horse". Writing an introductory article for the second publication, Doel, a specialist in Kentish folklore, praised Maylam's book as a "classic study" which was "impressive for its separation of fact from speculation as to the origins and significance of the custom."

Writing in 1967, the folklorist Barnett Field claimed that at some point after Maylam's book was published, hoodening had "died out. The Horses were hung up in the stables, and when the tractors came, were taken out and burnt on the bonfire." Doel and Doel later suggested that it was the impact of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> which effectively ended the tradition. Field noted that the first revival of the custom after the war took place at the 1936 <a href="Kent%20District%20Folk-Dance%20Festival">Kent District Folk-Dance Festival</a> at <a href="Aylesford">Aylesford</a>. A new horse was specially created for this festival, and was modelled on an older example that had been used at Sarre. The hobby horse had not previously had any connection with Morris dancing, although was adopted as a <a href="totemism">totem</a> animal for several Morris sides after the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>. This revival in the usage of the horse was heavily influenced by Maylam's book. The Aylesford horse was adopted by the <a href="Ravensbourne%20Morris%20Men">Ravensbourne Morris Men</a>, a Morris troupe based in the West Kentish village of <a href="Keston">Keston</a>, in 1947. The Ravensbourne Morris's hoodening tradition is the earliest known variant of the custom to exist in West Kent, although there are accounts of a hooden horse being located at Balgowan School in the West Kentish town of <a href="Beckenham">Beckenham</a> during the 1930s. At the 1945 celebration marking British victory in the Second World War, a horse was brought out in Acol; this instance has been described as "a kind of missing link between tradition and revival" because the horse had been used as part of the historical hoodening tradition up until the mid-1920s.

Barnett Field (1912–2000) as born at <a href="Wych%20Cross">Wych Cross</a> in the <a href="Ashdown%20Forest">Ashdown Forest</a> and subsequently educated at <a href="Tunbridge%20Wells">Tunbridge Wells</a>. He trained as a banker before working as manager of the <a href="Hythe%2C%20Kent">Hythe</a> and <a href="Folkestone">Folkestone</a> branches of the <a href="Westminster%20Bank">Westminster Bank</a> until his retirement in 1979. Field and his wife, Olive Ridley, had a keen interest in folk dances; she established the <a href="Folkestone%20National%20Folk%20Dance%20Group">Folkestone National Folk Dance Group</a> in 1950, and he founded the <a href="East%20Kent%20Morris%20Men">East Kent Morris Men</a> in 1953. Field constructed a hooden horse for the group to use, based in large part on the Deal horse photographed for Maylam's book, and unveiled it at the Folkestone celebrations for the <a href="Coronation%20of%20Elizabeth%20II">Coronation</a> of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> in June 1953. After this, it came to be used by both the East Kent Morris Men and the Folkestone District National Dance Group's Handbell Ringers, who took it with them for performances in various parts of continental Europe, including Austria, the Netherlands, Yugoslavia, Sweden, and Czechoslovakia, developing what came to be known as "handbell hoodening". The Handbell Ringers also brought out the horse to accompany them as they went around in public collecting money for charity at Christmas time.

From 1954, the horse was also brought out for a <a href="Whitsun">Whitsun</a> celebration in which it was paraded from <a href="Charing">Charing</a> to the <a href="village%20green">village green</a> at <a href="Wye%2C%20Kent">Wye</a>. A special service was held in the Charing Church, in which the Morris Men danced in the <a href="chancel">chancel</a> and through the aisle, while the <a href="vicar">vicar</a> put a bridle on the horse itself. The horse was also brought out for a July 1956 ceremony in which The Swan Inn, a pub at <a href="Wickhambreaux">Wickhambreaux</a>, was officially renamed as The Hooden Horse; present were the East Kent Morris Men, the Handbell Ringers, and the Ravensbourne Morris Men. This venture led to the groups establishing a new folk custom, "hop hoodening", which was derived in part from an older hop-picking ceremony found in the Weald area. Their new custom involved the different groups joining together on a tour around the villages of East Kent, beginning at <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a> and going through Ramsgate, <a href="Cliftonville">Cliftonville</a>, and <a href="Herne%20Bay%2C%20Kent">Herne Bay</a> before ending in a <a href="barn%20dance">barn dance</a> at Wickhambreaux.

In October 1957, Field was introduced to Jack Laming of Walmer, who as a boy had performed in a hoodening troupe earlier in the century. Laming taught Field more about the historical hoodening tradition, and together they unearthed an old hooden horse that was stored at Walmer's Coldblow Farm; this artefact was later placed on display at <a href="Deal%20Maritime%20and%20Local%20History%20Museum">Deal Maritime and Local History Museum</a>. In June 1961 Field and his wife established the first Folkestone International Folklore Festival as a biannual celebration of folk customs; it continued for 28 years.

Since the end of the Second World War, the hooden horse's use has been revived in <a href="Whitstable">Whitstable</a>, where it is often brought out for the <a href="Jack%20in%20the%20Green">Jack in the Green</a> festival each May, and is owned by a group called the Ancient Order of Hoodeners. Since 1981, the Tonbridge Mummers and Hoodeners have made use of a horse, incorporating it into a play specially written for the purpose by Doel and Nick Miller.
An annual conference of hoodeners was also established; initially meeting at the Marsh Gate Inn near Herne Bay, it subsequently moved to Simple Simon's in Canterbury. A member of the St. Nicholas-at-Wade hoodeners, Ben Jones, established a website devoted to the tradition. At the prompting of local residents, in December 2014 a pub named The Hungry Horse, located on the corner of Haine Road and Nash Road in Broadstairs, was renamed as The Hoodening Horse after the folk custom. Commenting on the Kentish revival of hoodening, Hutton suggested that its success was due largely to the desire of many Kentish folk to culturally distinguish themselves from neighbouring London.

Ashton-under-Lyne

Ashton-under-Lyne is a <a href="market%20town">market town</a> in <a href="Tameside">Tameside</a>, <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>, England. The population was 45,198 at the 2011 census. <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">Historically</a> in <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a>, it is on the north bank of the <a href="River%20Tame%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">River Tame</a>, in the foothills of the <a href="Pennines">Pennines</a>, east of Manchester.

Evidence of <a href="Stone%20Age">Stone Age</a>, <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>, and <a href="Viking">Viking</a> activity has been discovered in Ashton-under-Lyne. The "Ashton" part of the town's name probably dates from the <a href="History%20of%20Anglo-Saxon%20England">Anglo-Saxon period</a>, and derives from <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> meaning "settlement by ash trees". The origin of the "under-Lyne" suffix is less clear; it possibly derives from the <a href="British%20language%20%28Celtic%29">British</a> "lemo" meaning <a href="elm">elm</a> or from Ashton's proximity to the Pennines. In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, Ashton-under-Lyne was a <a href="parish">parish</a> and <a href="Township%20%28England%29">township</a> and Ashton Old Hall was held by the de Asshetons, <a href="Lord%20of%20the%20Manor">lords of the manor</a>. Granted a <a href="Royal%20Charter">Royal Charter</a> in 1414, the manor spanned a rural area consisting of marshland, moorland, and a number of villages and hamlets.

Until the introduction of the <a href="cotton">cotton</a> trade in 1769, Ashton was considered "bare, wet, and almost worthless". The <a href="factory%20system">factory system</a>, and <a href="textile%20manufacture%20during%20the%20Industrial%20Revolution">textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution</a> triggered a process of unplanned urbanisation in the area, and by the mid-19th century Ashton had emerged as an important <a href="mill%20town">mill town</a> at a convergence of newly constructed canals and railways. Ashton-under-Lyne's transport network allowed for an economic boom in <a href="cotton">cotton</a> <a href="Spinning%20%28textiles%29">spinning</a>, <a href="weaving">weaving</a>, and <a href="coal%20mining">coal mining</a>, which led to the granting of <a href="municipal%20borough">municipal borough</a> status in 1847.

In the mid-20th century, imports of cheaper foreign goods led to the decline of Ashton's heavy industries but the town has continued to thrive as a centre of commerce and Ashton Market is one of the largest outdoor markets in the United Kingdom. The , two-floored <a href="Ashton%20Arcades">Ashton Arcades</a> shopping centre opened in 1995 and an <a href="IKEA">IKEA</a> store in 2006.

Evidence of prehistoric activity in the area comes from Ashton Moss – a <a href="peat%20bog">peat bog</a> – and is the only one of Tameside's 22 <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> sites not located in the hilly uplands in the north east of the borough. A single Mesolithic <a href="flint%20tool">flint tool</a> has been discovered in the bog, along with a collection of nine <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> flints. There was further activity in or around the bog in the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a>. In about 1911, an adult male skull was found in the moss; it was thought to belong to the <a href="Roman%20Britain">Romano-British period</a> – similar to the <a href="Lindow%20Man">Lindow Man</a> bog body – until <a href="radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dating</a> revealed that it dated from 1,320–970 BC.

The eastern terminus of the early medieval linear earthwork <a href="Nico%20Ditch">Nico Ditch</a> is in Ashton Moss (); it was probably used as an administrative boundary and dates from the 8th or 9th century. Legend claims it was built in a single night in 869 or 870 as a defence against Viking invaders. Further evidence of <a href="Dark%20Ages%20%28historiography%29">Dark Age</a> activity in the area comes from the town's name. The "Ashton" part probably derives from the <a href="Old%20English">Anglo-Saxon</a> meaning "settlement by ash trees", the origin of the "under-Lyne" element is less clear: it could derive from the <a href="British%20language%20%28Celtic%29">British</a> "lemo" meaning <a href="elm">elm</a>, or may refer to Ashton being "under the line" of the <a href="Pennines">Pennines</a>. This means that Ashton probably became a settlement some time after the <a href="End%20of%20Roman%20rule%20in%20Britain">Romans left Britain</a> in the 5th century. An early form of the town's name, which included a "burh" element, indicates that in the 11th century Ashton and <a href="Bury%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Bury</a> were two of the most important towns in Lancashire. The "under Lyne" suffix was not widely used until the mid-19th century when it became useful for distinguishing the town from other places called Ashton.
The "<a href="Domesday%20Survey">Domesday Survey</a>" of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that <a href="St%20Michael%20and%20All%20Angels%27%20Church%2C%20Ashton-under-Lyne">St Michael's Church</a>, mentioned in the <a href="Domesday%20Survey">Domesday</a> entry for the <a href="Manchester%20%28ancient%20parish%29">ancient parish of Manchester</a>, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the <a href="manorialism">manor</a> was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the <a href="Gresley%20baronets">Gresleys</a>, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a <a href="manor%20house">manor house</a>, the administrative centre of the <a href="manor">manor</a>, and the <a href="seat">seat</a> of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was "one of the finest great houses in the North West" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a <a href="Royal%20Charter">Royal Charter</a> in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a <a href="market%20town">market town</a>.

According to popular tradition, <a href="Ralph%20de%20Ashton">Sir Ralph de Assheton</a>, who was <a href="lord%20of%20the%20manor">lord of the manor</a> in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel <a href="feudal%20lord">feudal lord</a>. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.

The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The <a href="Manor%20Lordships">lordship of the manor</a> passed to <a href="Baron%20Delamer">Sir George Booth</a>, great-great grandson of Sir <a href="Thomas%20de%20Ashton%20%28alchemist%29">Thomas Ashton</a>, devolving through the Booth family until the <a href="Earl%20of%20Stamford">Earls of Stamford</a> inherited it through marriage in 1758. The <a href="George%20Grey%2C%205th%20Earl%20of%20Stamford">Booth-Grey</a>s then held the manor until the 19th century, whose patronage, despite being absentee lords, was probably the stimulus for Ashton's growth of a large-scale domestic-based textile industry in the 17th century. Pre-industrial Ashton was centred on four roads: Town Street, Crickets Lane, Old Street, and Cowhill Lane. In the late-18th and early-19th centuries, the town was re-planned, with a grid pattern of roads. As a result, very little remains of the previous town. In 1730 a <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a> was established which consisted of a house and two cottages; it later came to be used as a hospital. The <a href="Ashton%20Canal">Ashton Canal</a> was constructed in the 1790s to transport coal from the area to Manchester, with a <a href="Fairbottom%20Branch%20Canal">branch to the coal pits at Fairbottom</a>.

<a href="Domestic%20system">Domestic</a> <a href="fustian">fustian</a> and <a href="woollen">woollen</a> <a href="weaving">weaving</a> have a long history in the town, dating back to at least the <a href="Early%20Modern%20Britain">Early Modern period</a>. Accounts dated 1626 highlight that <a href="Humphrey%20Chetham">Humphrey Chetham</a> had dealings with clothworkers in Ashton. However, the introduction of the <a href="factory%20system">factory system</a> in the 19th century, during the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>, changed Ashton from a market town to a <a href="mill%20town">mill town</a>. Having previously been one of the two main towns in the Tame Valley, Ashton-under-Lyne became one of the "most famous mill towns in the North West". On Christmas Day 1826, workers in the town formed the Ashton Unity, a <a href="friendly%20society">sickness and benefits society</a> that was later renamed the "<a href="Shepherds%20Friendly%20Society">Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds</a>". From 1773 to 1905, 75 cotton mills were established in the town. On his tour of <a href="northern%20England">northern England</a> in 1849, Scottish publisher Angus Reach said: 

The cotton industry in the area grew rapidly from the start of the 19th century until the <a href="Lancashire%20Cotton%20Famine">Lancashire Cotton Famine</a> of 1861–1865. The growth of the town's textile industry led to the construction of estates specifically for workers. Workers' housing in <a href="Park%20Bridge">Park Bridge</a>, on the border between Ashton and Oldham, was created in the 1820s. The iron works were founded in 1786 and were some of the earliest in the north west. The Oxford Mills settlement was founded in 1845 by local industrialist and mill-owner <a href="Hugh%20Mason">Hugh Mason</a> who saw it as a model industrial community. The community was provided with a recreational ground, a gymnasium, and an institute containing public baths, a library, and a reading room. Mason estimated that establishing the settlement cost him around £10,000 and would require a further £1,000 a year to maintain (about £600,000 and £60,000 respectively as of 2019), and that its annual <a href="mortality%20rate">mortality rate</a> was significantly lower than in the rest of the town.

A poor supply of fresh water and dwellings without adequate drainage led to a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> outbreak in the town in 1832. The Ashton <a href="Poor%20Law%20Union">Poor Law Union</a> was established in 1837 and covered most of what is now Tameside. A new workhouse was built in 1850 which provided housing for 500 people. It later became part of <a href="Tameside%20General%20Hospital">Tameside General Hospital</a>. Construction on the <a href="Sheffield%2C%20Ashton-under-Lyne%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway</a> (SA&MR) began in 1837 to provide passenger transport between Manchester and <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>. Although a nine-arch <a href="viaduct">viaduct</a> in Ashton collapsed in April 1845, the line was fully opened on 22 December 1845. The SA&MR was amalgamated with the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, the Great Grimsby & Sheffield Railway, and the Grimsby Docks Company in 1847 to form the <a href="Manchester%2C%20Sheffield%20and%20Lincolnshire%20Railway">Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway</a> (MS&LR). In 1890, the MS&LR bought the Old Hall and demolished it to make way for the construction of new <a href="Rail%20siding">sidings</a>.
In the late 19th century, public buildings such as the market hall, town hall, public library and public baths were built. A donation from Hugh Mason funded the construction of the baths constructed in 1870–1871. The Ashton-under-Lyne Improvement Act was passed in 1886 which gave the borough influence over housing and allowed the imposition of minimum standards such as drainage. Coal mining was not as important to the town as the textile industry, but in 1882 the Ashton Moss Colliery had the deepest mine shaft in the world at . Ashton's textile industry remained constant between 1865 and the 1920s. Although some mills closed or merged, the number of <a href="Spindle%20%28textiles%29">spindles</a> in use increased. With the collapse of the overseas market in the 1920s, the town's cotton industry went into decline, and by the 1930s most of the firms and mills in the area had closed.

At about 4.20 pm on Wednesday 13 June 1917, <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20munitions%20explosion">a fire in an ammunition factory producing TNT</a> caused an explosion that demolished much of the west end of the town. Two <a href="gasometer">gasometer</a>s exploded and the explosion destroyed the factory and threw heavy objects long distances. At least 41 people died and about 100 were injured. Sylvain Dreyfus, managing director of the works, helped to fight the fire but died in the subsequent explosion.

12-year-old John Kilbride, the second of the five <a href="Moors%20Murders">Moors Murders</a> victims, was lured away from the town's market on 23 November 1963 by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley before being murdered and buried on <a href="Saddleworth%20Moor">Saddleworth Moor</a>. His body was found in October 1965, after police arrested Brady and Hindley on suspicion of murdering 17-year-old Edward Evans at their house in <a href="Hattersley">Hattersley</a>, and found evidence among their possessions which led them to discover the bodies of John Kilbride and Lesley Ann Downey. His parents Patrick and Sheila Kilbride divorced a number of years later and both gave a number of newspaper and television interviews as part of the campaign to prevent Myra Hindley from being released on parole. Patrick Kilbride died in May 1999, and Sheila Kilbride in July 2002; just four months before Myra Hindley's death after 36 years in prison.

Ashton became a part of the newly formed <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough">Metropolitan Borough</a> of <a href="Tameside">Tameside</a> in 1974. In May 2004, a massive fire ravaged the Victorian market hall, and a temporary building called "The Phoenix Market Hall" was built on Old Cross Street on the opposite side of the Old Market hall. Described as the "heart of Ashton", the market was rebuilt and officially opened on 1 December 2008.

Lying within the <a href="Historic%20counties%20of%20England">historic county boundaries</a> of <a href="Lancashire">Lancashire</a> <a href="History%20of%20Lancashire">since the early 12th century</a>, Ashton anciently constituted a "single parish-township", but was divided into four divisions (sometimes each styled townships): Ashton Town, <a href="Audenshaw">Audenshaw</a>, Hartshead, and Knott Lanes. Ashton Town was granted a <a href="Royal%20Charter">Royal Charter</a> in 1414, granting it the right to hold a <a href="market%20town">market</a>. All four divisions lay within the <a href="Salford%20%28hundred%29">Hundred of Salford</a>, an ancient division of the county of Lancashire.
In 1827, police commissioners were established for Ashton Town, tasked with bringing about social and economic improvement. In 1847, this area was incorporated under the <a href="Municipal%20Corporations%20Act%201835">Municipal Corporations Act 1835</a>, as a <a href="municipal%20borough">municipal borough</a> with the name "Ashton-under-Lyne", giving it <a href="borough%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">borough status</a>. When the <a href="Administrative%20counties%20of%20England">administrative county</a> of Lancashire was created by the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201888">Local Government Act 1888</a>, the borough fell under the newly created <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Council">Lancashire County Council</a>. The borough's boundaries changed during the late 19th century through small exchanges of land with the neighbouring districts of Oldham, Mossley, Dukinfield, and Stalybridge. In the early 20th century, the Borough of Ashton-under-Lyne grew; Hurst Urban District was added in 1927, parts of Hartshead and <a href="Alt%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">Alt</a> <a href="Civil%20parishes%20in%20England">civil parish</a>es in 1935, and parts of <a href="Limehurst%20Rural%20District">Limehurst Rural District</a> in 1954. Since 1956, Ashton has been twinned with <a href="Chaumont%2C%20Haute-Marne">Chaumont</a>, <a href="France">France</a>.

Under the <a href="Local%20Government%20Act%201972">Local Government Act 1972</a>, the town's borough status was abolished, and Ashton has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Tameside">Metropolitan Borough of Tameside</a>, within the <a href="metropolitan%20county">metropolitan county</a> of <a href="Greater%20Manchester">Greater Manchester</a>. Ashton-under-Lyne is divided into four <a href="Wards%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">wards</a>: Ashton Hurst, Ashton St. Michaels, Ashton St Peters and Ashton Waterloo. As of the <a href="Tameside%20local%20elections">2012 local elections</a>, all twelve seats are held by <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> <a href="councillor">councillor</a>s.

Since the <a href="Reform%20Act%201832">Reform Act 1832</a> the town has been represented in <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliament</a> as part of the <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Ashton-under-Lyne parliamentary constituency</a>. During its early years the constituency was represented in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> by members of the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> until the late 19th century, when it was broadly held by the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a>. It has been held by the <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour Party</a> since 1935; <a href="Angela%20Rayner">Angela Rayner</a> has been the constituency's <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament">Member of Parliament</a> since 2015.

At (53.4941°, −2.1032°), and north-northwest of <a href="London">London</a>, Ashton-under-Lyne stands on the north bank of the <a href="River%20Tame%2C%20Greater%20Manchester">River Tame</a>, about above the river. Described in <a href="Samuel%20Lewis%20%28publisher%29">Samuel Lewis</a>'s "A Topographical Dictionary of England" (1848) as situated "on a gentle declivity", Ashton-under-Lyne lies on undulating ground by the <a href="Pennines">Pennines</a>, reaching a maximum elevation of about above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a>. It is east of <a href="Manchester%20city%20centre">Manchester city centre</a>, and is bound on all sides by other towns: <a href="Audenshaw">Audenshaw</a>, <a href="Droylsden">Droylsden</a>, <a href="Dukinfield">Dukinfield</a>, <a href="Mossley">Mossley</a>, <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a> and <a href="Stalybridge">Stalybridge</a>, with little or no <a href="Green%20belt">green space</a> between them. Ashton experiences a <a href="temperate">temperate</a> <a href="Oceanic%20climate">maritime climate</a>, like much of the <a href="British%20Isles">British Isles</a>.
Generally the <a href="bedrock">bedrock</a> of the west of the town consists of coal measures, which were exploited by the coal mining industry, while the east is mainly <a href="gritstone">millstone grit</a>. Overlying the bedrock are deposits of glacial sand and gravel, clay, and some <a href="alluvial%20deposits">alluvial deposits</a>. Ashton Moss, a peat bog, lies to the west of the town and was originally much larger. The River Tame forms part of the southern boundary, dividing the town from Stalybridge and Dukinfield, and the <a href="River%20Medlock">River Medlock</a> runs to the west.

Ashton's <a href="built%20environment">built environment</a> is similar to the <a href="urban%20structure">urban structure</a> of most <a href="List%20of%20towns%20in%20England">towns in England</a>, consisting of residential dwellings centred on a <a href="market%20square">market square</a> and high street in the <a href="town%20centre">town centre</a>, which is the local centre of commerce. There is a mixture of low-density <a href="urban%20areas">urban areas</a>, <a href="suburb">suburb</a>s, semi-rural and <a href="rural">rural</a> locations in Ashton-under-Lyne, but overwhelmingly the <a href="land%20use">land use</a> in the town is residential; industrial areas and <a href="terraced%20house">terraced house</a>s give way to suburbs and rural greenery as the land rises out of the town in the east. The older streets are narrow and irregular, but those built more recently are spacious, lined by "substantial and handsome houses". Areas and suburbs of Ashton-under-Lyne include Cockbrook, Crowhill, Guide Bridge, Hartshead, Hazelhurst, Hurst, Limehurst, Ryecroft, Taunton and Waterloo.

As of the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Census%202001">2001 UK census</a>, Ashton-under-Lyne had a population of 43,236. The 2001 population density was 12,374 per mi² (4,777 per km²), with a 100 to 96.1 female-to-male ratio. Of those over 16 years old, 30.9% were single (never married) and 50.0% married. Ashton-under-Lyne's 18,347 households included 33.2% one-person, 33.0% married couples living together, 8.9% were <a href="cohabitation">co-habiting</a> couples, and 12.4% single parents with their children; these figures were similar to those of Tameside, however both Tameside and Ashton have higher rates of single parents than England (9.5%). Of those aged 16–74, 37.0% had no <a href="Education%20in%20England%23Specialist%20qualifications">academic qualifications</a>, similar to that of 35.2% in all of Tameside but significantly higher than the 28.9% in all of England, and 11.9% had an educational qualification such as first degree, higher degree, qualified teacher status, qualified medical doctor, qualified dentist, qualified nurse, midwife, health visitor, etc. compared to 20% nationwide.

In 1931, 10.2% of Ashton's population was <a href="middle%20class">middle class</a> compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased steadily to 17.3% compared with 24% nationally. In the same time frame, there was the decline of the <a href="working%20class">working class</a> population. In 1931, 33.8% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 29.2% in Ashton and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers.

In 1700, the population of Ashton, the Tame Valley's main urban area, was an estimated 550. The town's 18th-century growth was fuelled by an influx of people from the countryside attracted by the prospect of work in its new industries, mirroring the rest of the region. In the early 19th century, Irish immigrants escaping from the <a href="Great%20Irish%20Famine">Great Irish Famine</a> were also drawn to the area by the new jobs created, The availability of jobs created by the growth of the textile industry in the town led to Ashton's population increasing by more than 400% between 1801 and 1861, from 6,500 to 34,886. The population dropped by 9% during the 1860s as a consequence of the cotton famine caused by the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>. The table below details the population change since 1851, including the percentage change since the last census.

<a href="St%20Michael%20and%20All%20Angels%27%20Church%2C%20Ashton-under-Lyne">St Michael and All Angels' Church</a> is a <a href="Grade%20I%20listed%20buildings%20in%20Greater%20Manchester">Grade I listed building</a> that dates back to at least 1262, although it was rebuilt in the 15th, 16th and 19th centuries. In 1795 it was the only church in the town, and one of only two in Tameside. There was a great increase in the number of chapels and religious buildings in the area during the 19th century, and by the end of the century there were 44 Anglican churches and 138 chapels belonging to other denominations. The most common denomination amongst the chapels were <a href="Catholic">Catholic</a>, <a href="Congregational%20church">Congregationalist</a>, and <a href="Methodism">Methodist</a>.

The 19th-century <a href="evangelism">evangelist</a> <a href="John%20Wroe">John Wroe</a> attempted to turn Ashton-under-Lyne into a "new Jerusalem". He founded the <a href="Christian%20Israelite%20Church">Christian Israelite Church</a>, and from 1822 to 1831 Ashton-under-Lyne was the religion's headquarters. Wroe intended to build a wall around the town with four gateways, and although the wall was never constructed, the four gatehouses were. Popular opinion in the town turned against Wroe when he was accused of indecent behaviour in 1831, but the charges were dismissed. The Church spread to Australia, where it is still active.

As of the 2001 UK census, 68.5% of Ashton residents reported themselves as being Christian, 6.1% Muslim, 5.0% Hindu, and 0.2% Buddhist. The census recorded that 11.4% had no religion, 0.2% had an alternative religion, and 8.7% did not state their religion. The proportion of Hindus in the town was much higher than the average for the borough and the whole of England 1.4% and 1.1% respectively. The percentage of Muslims in Ashton-under-Lyne was nearly double the national average of 3.1%, and was higher than the average of 2.5% for Tameside. In Ashton-under-Lyne are located 6 mosques (October 2013), including on Hillgate Street in Penny Meadow (Ashton Central Mosque, formerly known as Markazi Jamia Mosque) and on Katherine Street in West End (Masjid Hamza Mosque).

In the medieval period, farming was important in Ashton, particularly <a href="Agronomy">arable</a> farming. By the 18th century, textiles had also become more to the town's economy; in the 1700s, 33.2% of those with jobs worked in textiles and 36% in agriculture. With the advent of the Industrial Revolution in the second half of the 18th century, the textile industry in the town boomed. It continued to expand until the cotton famine of 1861–1865, after which the industry was steady until it collapsed after the overseas markets shut down in the 1920s.

Coal has been mined in Ashton since at least the 17th century. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries demand for coal increased, which led to an expansion of the town's coal industry. The produce of the collieries was transported by canal to Manchester. The industry began to decline during the late 19th century, and by 1904 only the Ashton Moss Colliery was still operational, the last colliery to be opened in the area.

Ashton town centre, which is the largest in Tameside, developed in the Victorian period. Many of the original buildings have survived, and as a result, the town centre is protected by Tameside Council as a conservation area. As well as being populated by leading high-street names, Ashton has an outdoor market which was established in the medieval period. It is made up of about 180 stalls, and is open six days a week. The <a href="farmers%27%20market">farmers' market</a>, with over 70 stalls, is the largest in the region, as is the weekday <a href="flea%20market">flea market</a>. Ashton Market Hall underwent a £15M restoration after it was damaged by fire. The Ashton Renewal Area project has attracted investment in the town centre, encouraging conservation and economic development.

The , two-floored <a href="Ashton%20Arcades">Ashton Arcades</a> shopping centre opened in 1995. Permission has been granted for a £40 million extension yet no work on this project has begun, on the nearby Lord Sheldon Way development of the new Golf Course is in its early stages, Tameside Hospital is under regeneration and there are preliminary stages being taken to welcome the Metrolink to Ashton. These four projects are currently the biggest in Ashton.
In 2006, after failing twice to gain permission, <a href="IKEA">IKEA</a> announced plans to build its first town centre-store in Ashton-under-Lyne. The store is expected to create 500 new jobs as well as attract other businesses to the area. The store opened on 19 October 2006 and covers . At the time of its creation, the store was the tallest in Britain.

Amongst the facilities provided by Ashton Leisure Park are a 14-screen cinema, a bowling alley, and several restaurants. The St Petersfield area of Ashton underwent a £42M redevelopment and provided 2,000 jobs. The aim of the investment was to create a business district in the town and bring life to a neglected area of Ashton. The development provided of office space and of retail and leisure space. Pennine Care NHS Trust relocated its headquarters to the St Petersfield area in 2006. Until then a popular nightspot, in 2002 several night clubs were brought to the brink of closure after a downturn in trade caused by four murders in three months.

According to the 2001 UK census, the industry of employment of residents aged 16–74 was 22.7% manufacturing, 18.6% retail and wholesale, 11.3% health and social work, 9.8% property and business services, 6.7% construction, 6.5% transport and communications, 5.8% education, 5.6% public administration, 4.3% hotels and restaurants, 3.8% finance, 0.4% agriculture, 0.7% energy and water supply, and 3.9% other. Compared with national figures, the town had a relatively low percentage working in agriculture, public administration, and property which was also below the national average, and high rates of employment in construction at more than triple the national rate (6.8%). The census recorded the economic activity of residents aged 16–74, 2.0% students were with jobs, 3.8% students without jobs, 6.4% looking after home or family, 9.5% permanently sick or disabled, and 3.9% economically inactive for other reasons. Ashton's 4.1% unemployment rate was above the national rate of 3.3%.

<a href="Curzon%20Ashton%20F.C.">Curzon Ashton F.C.</a> play at the Tameside Stadium. They are currently in <a href="National%20League%20North">National League North</a>, the highest level in the club's history, following two consecutive promotions, beating town rivals <a href="Ashton%20United%20F.C.">Ashton United F.C.</a> in the playoffs.

Ashton United was the first team in the <a href="Manchester%20Football%20Association">Manchester Football Association</a> to win an FA Cup tie, when they beat <a href="Turton%20F.C.">Turton</a> 3–0 in 1883. In 1885, they were the first winners of the <a href="Manchester%20Senior%20Cup">Manchester Senior Cup</a>, beating Newton Heath (who later became <a href="Manchester%20United%20F.C.">Manchester United</a>) in the final. Ashton United play at <a href="Hurst%20Cross">Hurst Cross</a>.

Other sporting venues include the Richmond Park Athletics Stadium, which has an all-weather running track with facilities for field events and is home to the East Cheshire Harriers, Tameside Athletics Club and <a href="Ashton%20C.C.">Ashton Cricket Club</a>, which has won the <a href="Central%20Lancashire%20Cricket%20League">Central Lancashire Cricket League</a>'s first and second division twice each, and the Wood Cup four times.

After the Ashton Canal closed in the 1960s, it was decided to turn the <a href="Portland%20Basin">Portland Basin</a> warehouse into a museum. In 1985, the first part of the Heritage Centre and Museum opened on the first floor of the warehouse. The restoration of building was complete in 1999; the museum details Tameside's social, industrial, and political history. The basin next to the warehouse is the point at which the <a href="Ashton%20Canal">Ashton Canal</a>, the <a href="Huddersfield%20Narrow%20Canal">Huddersfield Narrow Canal</a> and the <a href="Peak%20Forest%20Canal">Peak Forest Canal</a> meet. It has been used several times as a filming location for <a href="Coronation%20Street">Coronation Street</a>, including a scene where the character Richard Hillman drove into the canal.

The earliest parts of <a href="Ashton%20Town%20Hall">Ashton Town Hall</a>, which was the first purpose-built town hall in what is now Tameside, date to 1840 when it was opened. It has classical features such as the <a href="Corinthian%20order">Corinthian columns</a> on the entrance <a href="facade">facade</a>. Enlarged in 1878, the hall provides areas for administrative purposes and public functions. Meanwhile, the <a href="Old%20Street%20drill%20hall%2C%20Ashton-under-Lyne">Old Street drill hall</a> was completed in 1887.
There are five parks in the town, three of which have <a href="Green%20Flag%20Award">Green Flag Award</a>s. The first park opened in Ashton-under-Lyne was Stamford Park on the border with Stalybridge. The park opened in 1873, following a 17-year campaign by local cotton workers; the land was bought from a local mill-owner for £15,000 (£ as of 2019) and further land was donated by <a href="George%20Grey%2C%207th%20Earl%20of%20Stamford">George Grey, 7th Earl of Stamford</a>. A crowd of between 60,000 and 80,000 turned out to see the Earl of Stamford formally open the new facility on 12 July 1873. It now includes a boating lake, and a memorial to <a href="Rayner%20Stephens">Joseph Rayner Stephens</a>, commissioned by local factory workers to commemorate his work promoting fair wages and improved working conditions. A <a href="sunroom">conservatory</a> was opened in 1907, and Coronation gates installed at both the Ashton-under-Lyne and Stalybridge entrances in 1953.

<a href="Hartshead%20Pike">Hartshead Pike</a> is a stone tower on top of Hartshead Hill overlooking Ashton and <a href="Oldham">Oldham</a>. The current building was constructed in 1863 although there has been a building on the site since at least the mid-18th century, although the original purpose is obscure. The pike may have been the site of a beacon in the late 16th century. It has a visitor centre and from the top of the hill it is possible to see the <a href="Jodrell%20Bank%20Observatory">Jodrell Bank Observatory</a> in Cheshire, the Welsh hills, and the <a href="Holme%20Moss%23Transmitting%20station">Holme Moss transmitter</a> in <a href="West%20Yorkshire">West Yorkshire</a>.
<a href="The%20Witchwood">The Witchwood</a> <a href="public%20house">public house</a>, in the St Petersfield area of the town, has been a music venue since the 1960s, hosting acts such as <a href="Muse%20%28band%29">Muse</a>, <a href="The%20Coral">The Coral</a>, and <a href="Lost%20Prophets">Lost Prophets</a>. In 2004 The Witchwood came under threat when the area was being redeveloped, but was saved from demolition after a campaign by locals and led by <a href="Tom%20Hingley">Tom Hingley</a>, drawing support from musicians such as <a href="Bert%20Jansch">Bert Jansch</a>, <a href="The%20Fall%20%28band%29">The Fall</a>, and <a href="The%20Chameleons">The Chameleons</a>.

The main Ashton-under-Lyne War Memorial, in Memorial Gardens, consists of a central cenotaph on plinth, surmounted by sculpted wounded soldier and the figure of "Peace who is taking the sword of honour" from his hand. It commemorates the 1,512 people from the town who died in the First World War and the 301 who died in the Second World War. The cenotaph is flanked on both sides by two bronze lions. The plinth is decorated with military equipment representing the services, as well as bronze tablets listing the Roll of Honour from <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. Commissioned by the Ashton War Memorial Committee, the statue was sculpted between 1919 and 1922 by <a href="John%20Ashton%20Floyd">John Ashton Floyd</a>, and unveiled on 16 September 1922 by <a href="Ian%20Standish%20Monteith%20Hamilton">General Sir Ian Hamilton</a>.

The tablet on the front of the memorial reads:

Erected in honour of the men of Ashton-under-Lyne and district who fought for King and Empire in The Great War, especially those who sacrificed their lives, and whose names are recorded hereon 1914–1919

Ashton is served by the <a href="M60%20motorway">M60 motorway</a>, which cuts through the west end of Ashton (Junction 23).

In 1732, an <a href="Act%20of%20Parliament">Act of Parliament</a> was passed which permitted the construction of a <a href="Turnpike%20trust">turnpike</a> from Manchester, then in Lancashire, to Salters Brook in Cheshire. The road passed through Ashton-under-Lyne as well as <a href="Audenshaw">Audenshaw</a>, <a href="Mottram-in-Longdendale">Mottram-in-Longdendale</a>, and <a href="Stalybridge">Stalybridge</a>. A Turnpike Trust was responsible for collecting tolls from traffic; the proceeds were used for road maintenance. The Trust for Manchester to Salters Brook was one of over 400 established between 1706 and 1750, a period in which turnpikes became popular. It was the first <a href="Turnpike%20trusts%20in%20Greater%20Manchester">turnpike to be opened in Tameside</a>, and driven by economic growth, more turnpikes were opened in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Acts of Parliaments were passed in 1765, 1793, and 1799 permitting the construction turnpikes from Ashton-under-Lyne to Doctor Lane Head in Saddleworth, Standedge in Saddleworth, and Oldham respectively. Towards the end of the 19th century, many Turnpike Trusts were wound up as they were superseded by local government; the last in Tameside to close was the Ashton-under-Lyne to Salters Brook road in 1884.

The town of Ashton-under-Lyne became the focus of three canals which were constructed in Tameside in the 1790s because it was an important centre of coal mining in the Lancashire coalfield. The 1790s has been characterised as a period of mania for canal building in England. The first of the three to be built was the <a href="Ashton%20Canal">Ashton Canal</a>, which was constructed between 1792 and 1797. Connecting Manchester to Ashton-under-Lyne, with a branch to Oldham, it cost about £170,000 (£ as of 2019). The <a href="Peak%20Forest%20Canal">Peak Forest Canal</a> was constructed from 1794 to 1805, and was originally planned as a branch of the Ashton Canal. It connected the <a href="Portland%20Basin">Portland Basin</a> with the <a href="Peak%20District">Peak District</a> and cost £177,000 (£ as of 2019). The <a href="Huddersfield%20Narrow%20Canal">Huddersfield Narrow Canal</a> was built between 1794 and 1811, to enable cross-Pennine trade between Manchester and <a href="Kingston%20upon%20Hull">Kingston upon Hull</a>; the cost of construction was £400,000.

The advent of the railways in the 19th century signalled the decline of the canal system. The new railways were quicker and more economical than the canals, and the waterways declined. The Huddersfield Canal was bought by the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway in 1844. Along with the Ashton and Peak Forest canals, the Huddersfield canal was later bought by the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company. The canals remained in use throughout the 19th century on a smaller scale than in their heyday, but by the mid-20th century all commercial traffic had ceased. Following an extended period of closure & dereliction, when the Huddersfield canal was in parts filled-in or built over, a complete restoration was undertaken resulting in the full reopening of the canal in 2001. They are now used for leisure craft and are still maintained and in good condition.
<a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20railway%20station">Ashton-under-Lyne railway station</a> sees regular services on the <a href="Huddersfield%20Line">Huddersfield Line</a> between Manchester (<a href="Manchester%20Victoria%20station">Victoria</a>) and <a href="Huddersfield">Huddersfield</a>.

The present station, known historically as "Ashton (Charlestown)" as was opened by the <a href="Ashton%2C%20Stalybridge%20and%20Liverpool%20Junction%20Railway">Ashton, Stalybridge and Liverpool Junction Railway</a> (AS&LJR) on 13 April 1846. The AS&LJR was absorbed by the <a href="Manchester%20and%20Leeds%20Railway">Manchester and Leeds Railway</a> in 1847, which was then renamed the <a href="Lancashire%20and%20Yorkshire%20Railway">Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway</a> (LYR). The LYR renamed it "Ashton (Charlestown)" in 1874. The LYR amalgamated with the <a href="London%20and%20North%20Western%20Railway">London and North Western Railway</a> at the start of 1922, and these in turn amalgamated with several other companies on 1 January 1923, to form the <a href="London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a> during the <a href="1923%20Grouping">1923 Grouping</a>. It then passed to the <a href="London%20Midland%20Region%20of%20British%20Railways">London Midland Region of British Railways</a> on <a href="nationalisation">nationalisation</a> in 1948. The station was renamed "Ashton-under-Lyne" on 6 May 1968.

There were once three stations in the town: Charlestown, <a href="Ashton%20Park%20Parade%20railway%20station">Park Parade</a> (closed 1956) and <a href="Oldham%20Road%20railway%20station%20%28Ashton-under-Lyne%29">Oldham Road</a> (closed 1959) on the <a href="Oldham%2C%20Ashton%20and%20Guide%20Bridge%20Railway">Oldham, Ashton and Guide Bridge Railway</a>. Also, <a href="Guide%20Bridge%20railway%20station">Guide Bridge</a>, a few miles away, was known as "Ashton & Hooley Hill" and then "Ashton" in its earliest years.
The <a href="Sheffield%2C%20Ashton-under-Lyne%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway Company</a> was founded in 1836 with the purpose of building a line linking Manchester and Sheffield. The line was opened in stages and by 1845 was complete. It included a branch to the nearby town of Stalybridge, the former Ashton Park Parade station was included on this branch.

In 1881, a <a href="tram">tram</a>way with horse-drawn tramcars was opened between Stalybridge and Audenshaw, through Ashton-under-Lyne. The first tramway of its kind in Tameside, it was later extended to Manchester. The Oldham, Ashton and Hyde Electric Tramway Company, founded in 1899, operated of tram lines with electric tramcars. It was the first line around Manchester to use electricity. A line from Stalybridge to Ashton-under-Lyne was opened in 1903 and operated by the <a href="SHMD">Stalybridge, Hyde, Mossley & Dukinfield Tramways & Electricity Board</a>. The first <a href="bus">bus</a> service from Ashton-under-Lyne ran in 1923 and the 1920s saw a period of decline for the tramways as they suffered from the competition from buses. The last electric tram service in the town ran in 1938.

After a 75-year absence, trams returned to Ashton in October 2013, when the <a href="Manchester%20Metrolink">Manchester Metrolink</a> tram system opened the <a href="East%20Manchester%20Line">East Manchester Line</a> to the town: <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20tram%20stop">Ashton-under-Lyne tram stop</a> in the town centre, lies alongside <a href="Ashton-under-Lyne%20bus%20station">Ashton-under-Lyne bus station</a> and is the terminus for the East Manchester Line, which runs to <a href="Manchester%20Piccadilly%20station">Manchester Piccadilly station</a> and Manchester city-centre. Away from the town centre towards Manchester there is also <a href="Ashton%20West%20tram%20stop">Ashton West tram stop</a> and <a href="Ashton%20Moss%20tram%20stop">Ashton Moss tram stop</a>.

There are eight <a href="nursery%20school">nursery school</a>s, fifteen <a href="primary%20school">primary school</a>s, and two <a href="secondary%20school">secondary school</a>s in Ashton-under-Lyne. In 2006, the council began a scheme to develop education in the borough by opening six new secondary schools. Among the changes proposed as part of the £160M scheme was the closure of Hartshead Sports College and Stamford Community High School, to be replaced by a 1,350-pupil <a href="Academy%20%28English%20school%29">academy</a> with 300 members of sixth form. The new school is named <a href="New%20Charter%20Academy">New Charter Academy</a> after its sponsor, the New Charter Housing Trust. In 2007, Hartshead Sports College was placed on "special measures" after it failed to achieve its targets for <a href="General%20Certificate%20of%20Secondary%20Education">General Certificate of Secondary Education</a> results and was criticised by <a href="Ofsted">Ofsted</a> for its teaching standard. Originally expected to open in September 2009, the academy opened in September 2008.

The other secondary school in the town is <a href="St%20Damian%27s%20Roman%20Catholic%20Science%20College">St Damian's RC Science College</a>, which was founded in 1963, and provides education for 800 pupils aged 11–16. As part of the BSF Project, they created plans for a new school building (built by <a href="Carillion">Carillion</a>) and the pupils moved into this new building in May 2011. Dale Grove School has 60 pupils and offers education for pupils aged 5–16 with special needs. <a href="Ashton%20Sixth%20Form%20College">Ashton Sixth Form College</a> is a centre for <a href="further%20education">further education</a> with 1,650 pupils aged 16–18. <a href="Tameside%20College">Tameside College</a> also provides opportunities for further education and operates in Ashton-under-Lyne, Droylsden, and Hyde. Founded in 1954 and expanded in 1957 and 1964, it was originally called Ashton College.

In the early 19th century, Ashton-under-Lyne's growth made it necessary to find a new water supply. Before the introduction of piped water the town's inhabitants drew water from wells and the nearby River Tame. Industrial processes had polluted the river however, and the wells could not sustain a rapidly expanding population. From 1825, a private company was responsible for piping water from reservoirs, but there were still many homes without proper drainage or water supply. Today, waste management is co-ordinated by the <a href="local%20authority">local authority</a> via the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Waste%20Disposal%20Authority">Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority</a>.
The first power station in Tameside was built in 1899, providing power for the area. Ashton's <a href="Distribution%20Network%20Operator">Distribution Network Operator</a> for electricity is <a href="United%20Utilities">United Utilities</a>; there are no power stations in the town. United Utilities also manages the drinking and waste water.

<a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a> policing in Ashton-under-Lyne is provided by the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Police">Greater Manchester Police</a>. The force's Tameside Division have their divisional headquarters for policing Tameside in the town. Public transport in the area is co-ordinated by <a href="Transport%20for%20Greater%20Manchester">Transport for Greater Manchester</a>. <a href="Fire%20service%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Statutory emergency fire and rescue service</a> is provided by the <a href="Greater%20Manchester%20Fire%20and%20Rescue%20Service">Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service</a>, which has one station on Slate Lane. The <a href="Tameside%20General%20Hospital">Tameside General Hospital</a> is a large <a href="National%20Health%20Service%20%28England%29">NHS</a> hospital on the outskirts of the town, administrated by Tameside Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.

Disco Demolition Night

Disco Demolition Night was an ill-fated <a href="baseball">baseball</a> <a href="promotional%20event">promotion</a> on July 12, <a href="1979%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">1979</a> at <a href="Comiskey%20Park">Comiskey Park</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>. At the climax of the event, a crate filled with <a href="disco">disco</a> records was blown up on the field between games of the <a href="Doubleheader%20%28baseball%29%23Twi-night">twi-night doubleheader</a> between the <a href="1979%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">Chicago White Sox</a> and the <a href="1979%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Detroit Tigers</a>. Many of those in attendance had come to see the explosion rather than the games and rushed onto the field after the detonation. The playing field was so damaged by the explosion and by the fans that the White Sox were required to <a href="forfeit%20%28baseball%29">forfeit</a> the second game to the Tigers.

In the late 1970s, dance-oriented <a href="Disco">disco music</a> was popular in the United States, particularly after being featured in hit films such as "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Fever">Saturday Night Fever</a>" (1977). Disco sparked a backlash from <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> fans. This opposition was prominent enough that the White Sox, seeking to fill seats at Comiskey Park during a lackluster season, engaged Chicago <a href="shock%20jock">shock jock</a> and anti-disco campaigner <a href="Steve%20Dahl">Steve Dahl</a> for the promotion at the July 12 doubleheader. Dahl's sponsoring radio station was 97.9 <a href="WCKL-FM">WLUP</a>, so attendees would pay 98 cents and bring a disco record; between games, Dahl would destroy the collected <a href="Gramophone%20record">vinyl</a> in an explosion.

White Sox officials had hoped for a crowd of 20,000, about 5,000 more than usual. Instead, at least 50,000—including tens of thousands of Dahl's adherents—packed the stadium, and thousands more continued to sneak in after gates were closed. Many of the records were not collected by staff and were thrown like <a href="flying%20disc">flying disc</a>s from the stands. After Dahl blew up the collected records, thousands of fans <a href="Pitch%20invasion">stormed the field</a> and remained there until dispersed by riot police.

The second game was initially postponed, but forfeited by the White Sox the next day by order of <a href="American%20League">American League</a> president <a href="Lee%20MacPhail">Lee MacPhail</a>. Disco Demolition Night preceded, and may have helped precipitate, the decline of disco in late 1979; some scholars and disco artists have described the event as expressive of <a href="racism">racism</a> and <a href="homophobia">homophobia</a>. Disco Demolition Night remains well known as one of the most extreme promotions in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">major league</a> history.

<a href="Disco">Disco</a>, named for its popularity in , evolved in the early 1970s in inner-city New York clubs, where <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a>s played imported <a href="dance%20music">dance music</a>. With roots in <a href="African-American%20music">African-American</a> and <a href="Latin%20American%20music">Latin American music</a> and <a href="gay%20culture">gay culture</a>, even white artists associated with more sedate music had disco-influenced hits, such as <a href="Barry%20Manilow">Barry Manilow</a> with "<a href="Copacabana%20%28song%29">Copacabana</a>". By 1977, disco was popular in the United States, especially after the release that year of the hit movie "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Fever">Saturday Night Fever</a>". The fact that its star <a href="John%20Travolta">John Travolta</a> and musical performers the <a href="Bee%20Gees">Bee Gees</a> were white and presented a heterosexual image helped popularize disco. As <a href="Al%20Coury">Al Coury</a>, president of <a href="RSO%20Records">RSO Records</a> (which had released the bestselling soundtrack album for the film) put it, "Saturday Night Fever" "kind of took disco <a href="Coming%20out">out of the closet</a>."

Some felt disco was too mechanical; "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine deemed it a "diabolical thump-and-shriek". Others hated the music for the lifestyle associated with it, feeling that in the disco scene, personal appearance and style of dress were too important. The media emphasized its roots in gay culture. According to historian Gillian Frank, "by the time of the Disco Demolition in Comiskey Park, the media commonly emphasized that disco was gay and cultivated a widespread perception that disco was taking over." Performers who cultivated a gay image, such as the <a href="Village%20People">Village People</a> (described by "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" as "the face of disco") did nothing to efface these perceptions, and fears that <a href="rock%20music">rock music</a> would die out increased after disco albums dominated the <a href="21st%20Grammy%20Awards">21st Grammy Awards</a> in February 1979.

In 1978, New York's <a href="WNYL%20%28FM%29">WKTU</a>-FM, a low-rated rock station, switched to disco and became the most popular station in the country; this led other stations to try to emulate its success. In Chicago, Dahl, then 24, was working as a disc jockey for local <a href="radio%20station">radio station</a> <a href="WLS-FM">WDAI</a> when he was fired on Christmas Eve 1978 as part of the station's switch from rock to disco. He was hired by rival <a href="Album-oriented%20rock">album-rock</a> station <a href="WCKL-FM">WLUP</a>, the Loop. Sensing an incipient anti-disco backlash and playing off the publicity surrounding his firing (he frequently mocked WDAI's "Disco DAI" slogan on the air as "Disco DIE"), Dahl created a mock organization, the "Insane Coho Lips", an anti-disco army consisting of his listeners. According to Andy Behrens of <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>, Dahl and his broadcast partner <a href="Garry%20Meier">Garry Meier</a> "organized the Cohos around a simple and surprisingly powerful idea: Disco Sucks".

According to Dahl, in 1979, the Cohos were locked in a war "dedicated to the eradication of the dreaded musical disease known as DISCO". In the weeks leading up to Disco Demolition Night, Dahl promoted a number of anti-disco public events, several of which became unruly. When a in <a href="Linwood%2C%20Indiana">Linwood, Indiana</a>, switched from disco to rock in June, Dahl arrived, as did several thousand Cohos, and the police were called. Later that month, Dahl and several thousand Cohos occupied a teen disco in the Chicago suburbs. At the end of June, Dahl urged his listeners to throw marshmallows at a WDAI promotional van at a shopping mall where a teen disco had been built. The Cohos chased the van and driver and cornered them in a local park, though the situation ended without violence. On July 1, a near-riot occurred in <a href="Hanover%20Park%2C%20Illinois">Hanover Park, Illinois</a>, when hundreds of Cohos could not enter a sold-out promotional event, and fights broke out. Some 50 police officers were needed to control the situation. When disco star <a href="Van%20McCoy">Van McCoy</a> died suddenly on July 6, Dahl marked the occasion by destroying one of his records, "<a href="The%20Hustle%20%28song%29">The Hustle</a>", on the air.

Dahl and Meier regularly mocked disco records on the radio. Dahl also recorded his own song, "Do Ya Think I'm Disco?", a <a href="Parody%20music">parody</a> of <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a>'s disco-oriented hit "<a href="Da%20Ya%20Think%20I%27m%20Sexy%3F">Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?</a>". The song characterized as populated by effeminate men and frigid women. The protagonist, named Tony after Travolta's character in "Saturday Night Fever", is unable to attract a woman until he abandons the disco scene, selling his three-piece white suit at a garage sale and melting down his gold chains for a <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> belt buckle.

A number of anti-disco incidents took place elsewhere in the first half of 1979, showing that "the Disco Demolition was not an isolated incident or an aberration." In <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, hundreds of rock fans attacked a mobile dance floor, while in <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, a disc jockey destroyed a stack of disco records with a chainsaw as thousands cheered. In New York, a rock DJ played <a href="Donna%20Summer">Donna Summer</a>'s disco hit "<a href="Hot%20Stuff%20%28Donna%20Summer%20song%29">Hot Stuff</a>" and received protests from listeners.

Since the 1940s, <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> owner <a href="Bill%20Veeck">Bill Veeck</a> had been noted for using promotions to attract fan interest; he stated "you can draw more people with a losing team plus bread and circuses than with a losing team and a long, still silence". His son, Mike, was the promotions director for the White Sox in 1979. Mike Veeck wrote in a letter to a fan before the season that team management intended to make sure that whether the White Sox won or lost, the fans would have fun.

Early in the <a href="1979%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">1979</a> season, on May 2, the <a href="1979%20Detroit%20Tigers%20season">Tigers</a>–White Sox game at Comiskey Park was rained out. Officials rescheduled it as part of a <a href="doubleheader%20%28baseball%29">twi-night doubleheader</a> on July 12. Already scheduled for the evening of July 12 was a promotion aimed at teenagers, who could purchase tickets at half the regular price.

The White Sox had had a "Disco Night" at Comiskey Park in <a href="1977%20Chicago%20White%20Sox%20season">1977</a>; Mike Veeck, WLUP Sales Manager Jeff Schwartz, and WLUP Promotions Director Dave Logan discussed the possibility of an anti-disco night promotion after Schwartz mentioned that the White Sox were looking to do a promotion with the station. The matter had also been brought up early in the 1979 season when Schwartz told Mike Veeck of Dahl and his plans to blow up a crate of disco records while live on the air from a shopping mall. During a meeting at WLUP, Dahl was asked if he would be interested in blowing up records at Comiskey Park on July 12. Since the radio frequency of WLUP was 97.9, the promotion for July 12, "Disco Demolition Night" (in addition to the offer for teenagers) was that anyone who brought a disco record to the ballpark would be admitted for 98 cents. Dahl was to blow up the collected records between games of the doubleheader.

In the weeks before the event Dahl invited his listeners to bring records they wanted to see destroyed to Comiskey Park. He feared that the promotion would fail to draw people to the ballpark, and that he would be humiliated. The previous night's attendance had been 15,520, and Comiskey Park had a capacity of 44,492. The White Sox were not having a good year, and were  going into the July 12 doubleheader. The White Sox and WLUP hoped for a crowd of 20,000, and Mike Veeck hired enough security for 35,000.

Owner Bill Veeck was concerned the promotion might become a disaster and checked himself out of the hospital, where he had been undergoing tests. His fears were substantiated when he saw the people walking towards the ballpark that afternoon; many carried signs that described disco in profane terms.

The doubleheader sold out, leaving at least 20,000 people outside the ballpark. Some leapt <a href="turnstile">turnstile</a>s, climbed fences, and entered through open windows. The attendance was officially reported as 47,795, though Bill Veeck estimated that there were anywhere from 50,000 to 55,000 in the park—easily the largest crowd of his second stint as White Sox owner. The Chicago Police Department closed off-ramps from the <a href="Dan%20Ryan%20Expressway">Dan Ryan Expressway</a> near the stadium. Attendees were supposed to deposit their records into a large box, some tall; once the box was overflowing, many people brought their discs to their seats.

The first game was to begin at 6 pm <a href="Central%20Time%20Zone">CDT</a>, with the second game to follow. Lorelei, a model who did public appearances for WLUP and who was popular in Chicago that summer for her sexually provocative poses in the station's advertisements, threw out the <a href="Ceremonial%20first%20pitch">first pitch</a>. As the first game began, Mike Veeck got word that thousands of people were trying to get into the park without tickets, and sent his security personnel to the stadium gates to keep them at bay. This left the field unattended, and fans began throwing the uncollected disco <a href="LP%20record">LPs</a> and <a href="45rpm%20single">singles</a> from the stands. Tigers <a href="designated%20hitter">designated hitter</a> <a href="Rusty%20Staub">Rusty Staub</a> remembered that the records would slice through the air, and land sticking out of the ground. He urged teammates to wear batting helmets when playing their positions, "It wasn't just one, it was many. Oh, God almighty, I've never seen anything so dangerous in my life." Attendees also threw firecrackers, empty liquor bottles, and lighters onto the field. The game was stopped several times because of the rain of foreign objects.

Dozens of hand-painted banners with such slogans as "Disco sucks" were hung from the ballpark's seating decks. White Sox broadcaster <a href="Harry%20Caray">Harry Caray</a> could see groups of people, who were clearly music rather than baseball fans, wandering through the stadium. Others sat intently in their seats, awaiting the explosion. Mike Veeck recalled an odor of <a href="Cannabis%20%28drug%29">marijuana</a> in the grandstand and said of the attendees, "This is the <a href="Woodstock">Woodstock</a> they never had." The miasma permeated the press box, which Caray and his broadcast partner, <a href="Jimmy%20Piersall">Jimmy Piersall</a>, commented on over the air. The crowds outside the stadium threw records as well, or gathered them and burned them in bonfires. Detroit won the first game, 4–1.

The first game ended at 8:16 pm; at 8:40 Dahl, dressed in army fatigues and a helmet, emerged onto the playing surface together with Meier and Lorelei. They circled the field in a Jeep, showered (according to Dahl, lovingly) by his troops with firecrackers and beer, then proceeded to <a href="Baseball%20field%23outfield">center field</a> where the box containing the records awaited, rigged with explosives. Dahl and Meier warmed up the crowd, leading attendees in a chant of "disco sucks". Lorelei recalled that the view from center field was surreal. On the <a href="Baseball%20field%23Pitcher%27s%20mound">mound</a>, White Sox pitcher <a href="Ken%20Kravec">Ken Kravec</a>, scheduled to start the second game, began to warm up. Other White Sox, in the <a href="Dugout%20%28baseball%29">dugout</a> and wearing <a href="batting%20helmet">batting helmet</a>s, looked out upon the scene. Fans who felt events were getting out of control and who wished to leave the ballpark had difficulty doing so; in an effort to deny the intruders entry, security had padlocked all but one gate.

Dahl told the crowd:

Dahl set off the explosives, destroying the records and tearing a large hole in the outfield grass. With most of the security personnel still watching the gates per Mike Veeck's orders, there was almost no one guarding the playing surface. Soon, the first of 5,000 to 7,000 attendees <a href="Pitch%20invasion">rushed onto the field</a>, causing Kravec to flee the mound and join his teammates in a barricaded clubhouse. Some climbed the foul poles, while others set records on fire or ripped up the grass. The <a href="batting%20cage">batting cage</a> was destroyed, and the bases were pulled up and stolen. Among those taking to the field was 21-year-old aspiring actor <a href="Michael%20Clarke%20Duncan">Michael Clarke Duncan</a>; during the melee, Duncan slid into third base, had a silver belt buckle stolen, and went home with a bat from the dugout. As Bill Veeck stood with a microphone near where home plate had been, begging people to return to the stands, a bonfire raged in center field.

Years later, Lorelei remembered that she had been waving to the crowd when she was grabbed by two of the bodyguards who had accompanied the Jeep, who placed her back in the vehicle. The party was unable to return to home plate because of the rowdy fans, so the Jeep was driven out of the stadium and through the surrounding streets, to the delight of the many Cohos outside the stadium, who recognized the occupants. They were driven to the front of the stadium, ushered back inside, and taken up to the press room where they had spent most of the first game.

Caray unsuccessfully attempted to restore order by the public address system. The scoreboard, flashing "PLEASE RETURN TO YOUR SEATS", was ignored, as was the playing of "<a href="Take%20Me%20Out%20to%20the%20Ball%20Game">Take Me Out to the Ball Game</a>". Some attendees danced in circles around the burning vinyl shards. Dahl offered his help to get the rowdy fans to leave, but it was declined.

At 9:08 pm, Chicago police in full <a href="riot%20gear">riot gear</a> arrived, to the applause of the baseball fans remaining in the stands. Those on the field hastily dispersed upon seeing the police. Thirty-nine people were arrested for disorderly conduct; estimates of injuries to those at the event range from none to over thirty.

Bill Veeck wanted the teams to play the second game once order was restored. However, the field was so badly torn up that umpiring crew chief <a href="Dave%20Phillips%20%28umpire%29">Dave Phillips</a> felt that it was still not playable, even after White Sox groundskeepers spent an hour clearing away debris. Tigers manager <a href="Sparky%20Anderson">Sparky Anderson</a> refused to allow his players to take the field in any event due to safety concerns. Phillips called American League president <a href="Lee%20MacPhail">Lee MacPhail</a>, who postponed the second game to Sunday after hearing a report on conditions. Anderson, however, demanded that the game be <a href="forfeit%20%28baseball%29">forfeited</a> to the Tigers. He argued that under baseball's rules, a game can only be postponed due to an <a href="act%20of%20God">act of God</a>, and that, as the home team, the White Sox were responsible for field conditions. The next day, MacPhail forfeited the second game to the Tigers 9–0. In a ruling that largely upheld Anderson's arguments, MacPhail stated that the White Sox had failed to provide acceptable playing conditions.

The day after the event, Dahl began his regular morning broadcast by reading the indignant headlines in the local papers. He mocked the coverage, saying: "I think for the most part everything was wonderful. Some maniac Cohos got wild, went down on the field. Which you shouldn't have done. Bad little Cohos." Tigers manager Anderson said of the events: "Beer and baseball go together, they have for years. But I think those kids were doing things other than beer." Columnist <a href="David%20Israel">David Israel</a> of the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>" said on July 12 that he was not surprised by the events, writing: "It would have happened any place 50,000 teenagers got together on a sultry summer night with beer and reefer." White Sox pitcher <a href="Rich%20Wortham">Rich Wortham</a>, a Texan, said: "This wouldn't have happened if they had country and western night."

Although Bill Veeck took much of the public criticism for the fiasco, his son Mike suffered repercussions as the front-office promoter. Mike Veeck remained with the White Sox until late 1980, when he resigned; his father sold the team to <a href="Jerry%20Reinsdorf">Jerry Reinsdorf</a> soon afterward. He was unable to find another job in baseball for some time and claimed that he had been <a href="blackballing">blackballed</a>. For several years, he worked for a <a href="jai-alai">jai-alai</a> <a href="Fronton%20%28court%29">fronton</a> in Florida, battling <a href="alcoholism">alcoholism</a>. As Mike Veeck said: "The second that first guy shimmied down the outfield wall, I knew my life was over!" Mike Veeck has since become an owner of minor league baseball teams. In July 2014 the <a href="Charleston%20RiverDogs">Charleston RiverDogs</a>, of whom Veeck is president, held a promotion involving the destruction of <a href="Justin%20Bieber">Justin Bieber</a> and <a href="Miley%20Cyrus">Miley Cyrus</a> merchandise. Dahl is still a radio personality in Chicago and also releases <a href="podcasting">podcasts</a>.

The popularity of disco declined significantly in late 1979 and 1980. Many disco artists continued, but record companies began labeling their recordings as dance music. Dahl stated in a 2004 interview that by 1979 disco was "probably on its way out. But I think [Disco Demolition Night] hastened its demise". According to Frank, "the Disco Demolition triggered a nationwide expression of anger against disco that caused disco to recede quickly from the American cultural landscape".

"<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" critic <a href="Dave%20Marsh">Dave Marsh</a> described Disco Demolition Night as "your most paranoid fantasy about where the ethnic cleansing of the rock radio could ultimately lead". Marsh was one who, at the time, deemed the event an expression of <a href="bigotry">bigotry</a>, writing in a year-end 1979 feature that "white males, eighteen to thirty-four are the most likely to see disco as the product of homosexuals, blacks, and Latins, and therefore they're the most likely to respond to appeals to wipe out such threats to their security. It goes almost without saying that such appeals are racist and sexist, but broadcasting has never been an especially civil-libertarian medium."

<a href="Nile%20Rodgers">Nile Rodgers</a>, producer and guitarist for the disco-era band <a href="Chic%20%28band%29">Chic</a>, likened the event to <a href="Nazi%20book%20burnings">Nazi book burning</a>. <a href="Gloria%20Gaynor">Gloria Gaynor</a>, who had a huge disco hit with "<a href="I%20Will%20Survive">I Will Survive</a>", stated, "I've always believed it was an economic decision—an idea created by someone whose economic bottom line was being adversely affected by the popularity of disco music. So they got a mob mentality going."

<a href="University%20of%20East%20London">University of East London</a> professor Tim Lawrence states, "Following the unexpected commercial success of "<a href="Saturday%20Night%20Fever">Saturday Night Fever</a>", major record companies had started to invest heavily in a sound that their white straight executive class did not care for, and when the overproduction of disco coincided with a deep recession, the homophobic (and also in many respects sexist and racist) 'disco sucks' campaign culminated with a record burning rally that was staged at the home of the Chicago White Sox in July 1979."

Dahl denies that prejudice was his motivation for the event. "The worst thing is people calling Disco Demolition homophobic or racist. It just wasn't ... We weren't thinking like that." In a 2014 op-ed for "<a href="Crain%27s%20Chicago%20Business">Crain's Chicago Business</a>", Dahl defended the event as "a romp, not of major cultural significance". He wrote that it had been "reframed" as prejudiced by a 1996 <a href="VH1">VH1</a> documentary about the 1970s, in a move he described as "a cheap shot made without exploration".

In response to Dahl's op-ed, NBC Chicago political journalist Mark W. Anderson, who attended Disco Demolition aged 15, described the fear that white neighborhoods would be taken over by blacks and the anxiety around shifting pop culture trends. He wrote: 

The unplayed second game remains the last American League game to be forfeited. The last <a href="National%20League">National League</a> game to be forfeited was on August 10, 1995, when a baseball giveaway promotion at <a href="Dodger%20Stadium">Dodger Stadium</a> went awry, forcing the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> to concede the game to the <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a>. According to baseball analyst Jeremiah Graves, "To this day Disco Demolition Night stands in infamy as one of the most ill-advised promotions of all-time, but arguably one of the most successful as 30 years later we're all still talking about it."

Game 1:

Game 2 forfeited to Detroit, 9–0.

Remain in Light

Remain in Light is the fourth <a href="studio%20album">studio album</a> by American <a href="rock%20music">rock</a> band <a href="Talking%20Heads">Talking Heads</a>, released on October 8, 1980 by <a href="Sire%20Records">Sire Records</a>. It was recorded at <a href="Compass%20Point%20Studios">Compass Point Studios</a> in the Bahamas and <a href="Sigma%20Sound%20Studios">Sigma Sound Studios</a> in Philadelphia between July and August 1980 and produced by longtime collaborator <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a>. Following the release of their previous album "<a href="Fear%20of%20Music">Fear of Music</a>" in 1979, the quartet and Eno sought to dispel notions of the band as a mere vehicle for <a href="frontman">frontman</a> and lyricist <a href="David%20Byrne">David Byrne</a>. Drawing on the influence of <a href="Nigerian">Nigerian</a> musician <a href="Fela%20Kuti">Fela Kuti</a>, the band experimented with African <a href="polyrhythms">polyrhythms</a>, <a href="funk">funk</a>, and <a href="electronic%20music">electronics</a>, recording instrumental tracks as a series of looping grooves. The sessions incorporated a variety of side musicians, including guitarist <a href="Adrian%20Belew">Adrian Belew</a>, singer <a href="Nona%20Hendryx">Nona Hendryx</a>, and trumpet player <a href="Jon%20Hassell">Jon Hassell</a>.

Byrne struggled with <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a>, but adopted a scattered, <a href="Stream%20of%20consciousness%20%28narrative%20mode%29">stream-of-consciousness</a> lyrical style inspired by early <a href="Hip%20hop%20music">rap</a> and academic literature on Africa. The artwork for the album was conceived by bassist <a href="Tina%20Weymouth">Tina Weymouth</a> and drummer <a href="Chris%20Frantz">Chris Frantz</a>, and was crafted with the help of the <a href="Massachusetts%20Institute%20of%20Technology">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>'s computers and design company <a href="M%20%26amp%3B%20Co.%20%28design%20firm%29">M&Co</a>. The band expanded to nine members for a promotional tour, and following its completion, they went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side projects. The album was the last of the band's collaborations with Eno, although Eno and Byrne's "<a href="My%20Life%20in%20the%20Bush%20of%20Ghosts%20%28album%29">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a>" was released the following year.

"Remain in Light" was widely acclaimed by critics, who praised its sonic experimentation, rhythmic innovations, and cohesive merging of disparate genres. The album peaked at number nineteen on the <a href="Billboard%20200">US "Billboard" 200</a> and number 21 on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a>, and spawned the <a href="single%20%28music%29">singles</a> "<a href="Once%20in%20a%20Lifetime%20%28Talking%20Heads%20song%29">Once in a Lifetime</a>" and "<a href="Houses%20in%20Motion">Houses in Motion</a>". It has been featured in several publications' lists of the best albums of the 1980s and of all time, and is often considered Talking Heads' <a href="Masterpiece">magnum opus</a>. In 2017, the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> deemed the album "culturally, historically, or artistically significant", and selected it for preservation in the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a>.

In January 1980, the members of Talking Heads returned to New York City after the tours in support of their 1979 critically acclaimed third album, "<a href="Fear%20of%20Music">Fear of Music</a>", and took time off to pursue personal interests. Singer <a href="David%20Byrne">David Byrne</a> worked with <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a>, the record's producer, on an <a href="experimental%20music">experimental</a> album, "<a href="My%20Life%20in%20the%20Bush%20of%20Ghosts%20%28album%29">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a>". Keyboardist <a href="Jerry%20Harrison">Jerry Harrison</a> produced an album for <a href="soul%20music">soul</a> singer <a href="Nona%20Hendryx">Nona Hendryx</a> at the <a href="Sigma%20Sound%20Studios">Sigma Sound Studios</a> branch in New York City; Hendryx and the studio were used during the "Remain in Light" recording on Harrison's advice.

Drummer <a href="Chris%20Frantz">Chris Frantz</a> and bassist <a href="Tina%20Weymouth">Tina Weymouth</a>, a married couple, discussed leaving Talking Heads after Weymouth suggested that Byrne was too controlling. Frantz did not want to leave, and the two took a long vacation in the Caribbean to ponder the state of the band and their marriage. They became involved in <a href="Haitian%20Vodou">Haitian Vodou</a> religious ceremonies, practised native <a href="percussion">percussion</a> instruments, and socialised with the <a href="reggae">reggae</a> <a href="rhythm%20section">rhythm section</a> of <a href="Sly%20and%20Robbie">Sly and Robbie</a>.

Frantz and Weymouth ended their holiday by purchasing an apartment above <a href="Compass%20Point%20Studios">Compass Point Studios</a> in <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>, the Bahamas, where Talking Heads had recorded their second album, "<a href="More%20Songs%20About%20Buildings%20and%20Food">More Songs About Buildings and Food</a>". Byrne joined the duo and Harrison there in early 1980. The band members realised that it had been solely up to Byrne to craft songs even though they were performed as a quartet. They had tired of the notion of a singer leading a backup band; the ideal they aimed for, according to Byrne, was "sacrificing our egos for mutual cooperation". Byrne additionally wanted to escape "the psychological paranoia and personal torment" he had been writing and feeling in New York. Instead of the band writing music to Byrne's lyrics, Talking Heads performed instrumental <a href="jam%20session">jams</a>, using the "Fear of Music" song "<a href="I%20Zimbra">I Zimbra</a>" as a starting point.

Eno arrived in the Bahamas three weeks after Byrne. He was reluctant to work with the band again after collaborating on the previous two albums. He changed his mind after being excited by the instrumental demo tapes. The band and Eno experimented with the communal African way of making music, in which individual parts mesh as <a href="polyrhythm">polyrhythm</a>s. "<a href="Afrodisiac%20%28Fela%20Kuti%20album%29">Afrodisiac</a>", the 1973 <a href="Afrobeat">Afrobeat</a> record by Nigerian musician <a href="Fela%20Kuti">Fela Kuti</a>, became the template for the album. Weymouth said that the beginnings of <a href="hip-hop%20music">hip-hop music</a> made Talking Heads realise that the musical landscape was changing. Before the studio sessions began, longtime friend <a href="David%20Gans%20%28musician%29">David Gans</a> instructed the band that "the things one doesn't intend are the seeds for a more interesting future". He encouraged them to experiment, improvise and make use of "mistakes".

Recording sessions started at Compass Point Studios in July 1980. The album's creation required the use of additional musicians, particularly percussionists. Talking Heads used the <a href="working%20title">working title</a> "Melody Attack" throughout the studio process after watching a Japanese game show of the same name. Harrison said the ambition was to blend rock and African genres, rather than simply imitate <a href="African%20music">African music</a>. Eno's production techniques and personal approach were key to the record's conception. The process was geared to promote the expression of instinct and spontaneity without overtly focusing on the sound of the final product. Eno compared the creative process to "looking out to the world and saying, 'What a fantastic place we live in. Let's celebrate it.'"

Sections and instrumentals were recorded one at a time in a discontinuous process. Loops played a key part at a time when computers could not yet adequately perform such functions. Talking Heads developed "Remain in Light" by recording jams, isolating the best parts, and learning to play them repetitively. The basic tracks focused wholly on rhythms and were all performed in a minimalist method using only one <a href="chord%20%28music%29">chord</a>. Each section was recorded as a long loop to enable the creation of compositions through the positioning or merging of loops in different ways. Byrne likened the process to modern <a href="Sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">sampling</a>: "We were human samplers."

After a few sessions in the Bahamas, engineer <a href="Rhett%20Davies">Rhett Davies</a> left following an argument with the producer over the fast speed of recording. <a href="Steven%20Stanley">Steven Stanley</a>, who since the age of 17 had engineered for musicians such as <a href="Bob%20Marley">Bob Marley</a>, stepped in to cover the workload. He is credited by Frantz with helping create "<a href="Once%20in%20a%20Lifetime%20%28Talking%20Heads%20song%29">Once in a Lifetime</a>", which was released as a single. A <a href="Lexicon%20%28company%29">Lexicon</a> 224 digital <a href="reverb">reverb</a> effects unit, obtained by engineer and mixer <a href="Dave%20Jerden">Dave Jerden</a>, was used on the album. The machine was one of the first of its kind and able to simulate environments such as <a href="echo%20chamber">echo chamber</a>s and rooms through interchangeable programs. Like Davies, Jerden was unhappy with the fast pace at which Eno wanted to record sonically complicated compositions, but did not complain.

The tracks made Byrne rethink his vocal style and he tried singing to the instrumental songs, but sounded "stilted". Few vocal sections were recorded in the Bahamas. The writing process for the lyrics occurred when the band returned to the US and was split between New York City and California. Harrison booked Talking Heads into Sigma Sound, which focused primarily on <a href="R%26amp%3BB">R&B</a> music, after convincing the owners that the band's work could bring them a new type of clientele. In New York City, Byrne struggled with <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a>. Harrison and Eno spent their time tweaking the compositions recorded in the Bahamas, while Frantz and Weymouth often did not show up at the studio. Doubts began to surface about whether the album would be completed. The recording sessions only built up pace after the recruitment of guitarist <a href="Adrian%20Belew">Adrian Belew</a> at the request of Byrne, Harrison and Eno. He was advised to add <a href="guitar%20solo">guitar solo</a>s to the Compass Point tracks, making use of a <a href="Roland%20Corporation">Roland</a> <a href="guitar%20synthesiser">guitar synthesiser</a>.

Byrne recorded all the tracks, as they were after Belew had performed on them, to a cassette and looked to Africa to break his writer's block. He realised that, when African musicians forget words, they often improvise and make new ones up. He used a portable tape recorder and tried to create <a href="onomatopoeic">onomatopoeic</a> rhymes in the style of Eno, who believed that lyrics were never the center of a song's meaning. Byrne continuously listened to his recorded <a href="scatting">scatting</a> until convinced that he was no longer "hearing nonsense". After he was satisfied, Harrison invited <a href="Nona%20Hendryx">Nona Hendryx</a> to Sigma Sound to record <a href="backing%20vocals">backing vocals</a> for the album. She was advised extensively on her vocal delivery by Byrne, Frantz, and Weymouth, and often sang in a trio with Byrne and Eno. The voice sessions were followed by the <a href="overdubbing">overdubbing</a> process. <a href="Brass%20%28instrument%29">Brass</a> player <a href="Jon%20Hassell">Jon Hassell</a>, who had been working on parts of "My Life in the Bush of Ghosts", was hired to perform <a href="trumpet">trumpet</a> and <a href="French%20horn">horn</a> sections. In August 1980, half of the album was mixed by Eno and engineer John Potoker in New York City with the assistance of Harrison, while the other half was mixed by Byrne and Jerden at <a href="Eldorado%20Recording%20Studios">Eldorado Studios</a> in Los Angeles.

"Remain in Light" features <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a>, <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a>, <a href="worldbeat">worldbeat</a>, <a href="dance-rock">dance-rock</a>, and different types of <a href="funk">funk</a>, specifically <a href="afrofunk">afrofunk</a> and <a href="avant-funk">avant-funk</a>. Critic <a href="Stephen%20Thomas%20Erlewine">Stephen Thomas Erlewine</a> described the album as a "dense amalgam of African percussion, funk bass and keyboards, pop songs, and electronics." It contains eight songs that possess a "striking <a href="free%20association%20%28psychology%29">free-associative</a> feel" according to <a href="psychoanalyst">psychoanalyst</a> Michael A. Brog, in that there is no long-lasting coherent thought process that can be followed in the <a href="stream%20of%20consciousness%20writing">stream-of-consciousness</a> lyrics. <a href="David%20Gans%20%28musician%29">David Gans</a> instructed Byrne to be freer with his lyrical content by advising him that "rational thinking has its limits". The frontman included a bibliography with the album press kit along with a statement that explained how the album was inspired by African <a href="mythologies">mythologies</a> and rhythms. The release stressed that the major inspiration to the lyrics was Professor John Miller Chernoff's "African Rhythm and African Sensibility", which examined the musical enhancement of life in the continent's rural communities. The academic travelled to Ghana in 1970 to study native percussion and wrote about how Africans have complicated conversations through drum patterns. One of the songs, "The Great Curve", exemplifies the African theme by including the line "The world moves on a woman's hips", which Byrne used after reading Professor <a href="Robert%20Farris%20Thompson">Robert Farris Thompson</a>'s book "African Art in Motion". He additionally studied straight speech, from <a href="John%20Dean">John Dean</a>'s <a href="Watergate">Watergate</a> testimony to the stories of <a href="African%20American">African American</a> former slaves.

Like all the other tracks, album opener "<a href="Born%20Under%20Punches%20%28The%20Heat%20Goes%20On%29">Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)</a>" borrows from "preaching, shouting and ranting". The expression "And the Heat Goes On", used in the title and repeated in the chorus, is based on a "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" headline Eno read in the summer of 1980 whilst Byrne rewrote the song title "Don't Worry About the Government" from Talking Heads' debut album, "", into the lyric "Look at the hands of a government man". The "rhythmical rant" in "Crosseyed and Painless"—"Facts are simple and facts are straight. Facts are lazy and facts are late."—is influenced by <a href="old%20school%20rap">old school rap</a>, specifically <a href="Kurtis%20Blow">Kurtis Blow</a>'s "<a href="The%20Breaks">The Breaks</a>" given to Byrne by Frantz. "Once in a Lifetime" borrows heavily from preachers' diatribes. Some critics have suggested that the song is "a kind of prescient jab at the excesses of the 1980s". Byrne disagreed with the categorisation and commented that its lyrics are meant to be taken literally; he stated, "We're largely unconscious. You know, we operate half awake or on autopilot and end up, whatever, with a house and family and job and everything else, and we haven't really stopped to ask ourselves, 'How did I get here?'."

Byrne has described the album's final mix as a "spiritual" piece of work, "joyous and ecstatic and yet it's serious"; he has pointed out that, in the end, there was "less Africanism in "Remain in Light" that we implied ... but the African ideas were far more important to get across than specific rhythms". According to Eno, the record uniquely blends <a href="funk">funk</a> and <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> or <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave music</a>. None of the compositions include chord changes and instead rely on the use of different <a href="harmonics">harmonics</a> and <a href="note%20%28music%29">notes</a>. "Spidery riffs" and layered tracks of bass and percussion are used extensively throughout the album. The first side contains the more rhythmic songs recorded—"Born Under Punches (The Heat Goes On)", "Crosseyed and Painless", and "The Great Curve"—which include long instrumental interludes. The last-named track contains extended synthesiser-treated guitar solos from Adrian Belew.

The second side of "Remain in Light" features more introspective songs. "Once in a Lifetime" pays homage to early <a href="rap">rap</a> techniques and the music of <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a> band <a href="The%20Velvet%20Underground">The Velvet Underground</a>. The track was originally called "Weird Guitar Riff Song" because of its composition. It was conceived as a single <a href="riff">riff</a> before the band added a second, boosted riff over the top of the first. Eno alternated eight <a href="bar%20%28music%29">bars</a> of each riff with corresponding bars of its counterpart. "Houses in Motion" incorporates lengthy brass performances from Jon Hassell, while "Listening Wind" features <a href="Arabic%20music">Arabic music</a> elements. The final track on the album, "The Overload," was Talking Heads' attempt to emulate the sound of British post-punk band <a href="Joy%20Division">Joy Division</a>. The song was made despite no band member having heard the music of Joy Division; rather, it was based on an idea of what the British quartet "might" sound like based on descriptions in the music press. The track features "tribal-cum-<a href="industrial%20music">industrial</a>" beats created primarily by Harrison and Byrne.

The cover art was conceived by Weymouth and Frantz with the help of Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher <a href="Walter%20Bender">Walter Bender</a> and his <a href="MIT%20Media%20Lab">MIT Media Lab</a> team. Using "Melody Attack" as inspiration, the couple created a collage of red warplanes flying in <a href="Formation%20%28military%29%23Commands%2C%20formations%2C%20and%20units">formation</a> over the <a href="Himalayas">Himalayas</a>. The planes are an artistic depiction of <a href="Grumman%20Avenger">Grumman Avenger</a> planes in honour of Weymouth's father, <a href="Ralph%20Weymouth">Ralph Weymouth</a>, who was a <a href="US%20Navy">US Navy</a> <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a>. The idea for the back cover included simple portraits of the band members. Weymouth attended MIT regularly during the summer of 1980 and worked with Bender's colleague, <a href="Scott%20Fisher%20%28technologist%29">Scott Fisher</a>, on the computer renditions of the ideas. The process was tortuous because computer power was limited in the early 1980s and the <a href="mainframe%20computer">mainframe</a> alone took up several rooms. Weymouth and Fisher shared a passion for masks and used the concept to experiment with the portraits. The faces (except for eyes, noses and mouths) were blotted out with blocks of red colour. Weymouth considered superimposing Eno's face on top of all four portraits to insinuate his egotism—the producer wanted to be on the cover art together with Talking Heads—but decided against it in the end.

The rest of the artwork and the <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> were crafted by the <a href="graphic%20design">graphic design</a>er <a href="Tibor%20Kalman">Tibor Kalman</a> and his company M&Co. Kalman was a fervent critic of <a href="formalism%20%28art%29">formalism</a> and professional design in art and advertisements. He offered his services for free to create publicity, and discussed using unconventional materials such as <a href="sandpaper">sandpaper</a> and <a href="velour">velour</a> for the LP sleeve. Weymouth, who was sceptical of hiring a designing firm, vetoed Kalman's ideas and held firm on the MIT computerised images. The designing process made the band members realise that the title "Melody Attack" was "too flippant" for the music recorded, and they adopted "Remain in Light" instead. Byrne has noted, "Besides not being all that melodic, the music had something to say that at the time seemed new, transcendent, and maybe even revolutionary, at least for funk rock songs." The image of the warplanes was relegated to the back of the sleeve and the doctored portraits became the front cover. Kalman later suggested that the planes were not removed altogether because they seemed appropriate during the <a href="Iranian%20hostage%20crisis">Iranian hostage crisis</a> of 1979–81.

Weymouth advised Kalman that she wanted simple <a href="typography">typography</a> in a bold <a href="sans%20serif">sans serif</a> font. M&Co. followed the instructions and came up with the idea of inverting the "A"s in "TALKING HEADS". Weymouth and Frantz decided to use the joint credit acronym C/T for the artwork, while Bender and Fisher used initials and code names because the project was not an official MIT venture. The design credits read "HCL, JPT, DDD, WALTER GP, PAUL, C/T". The final mass-produced version of "Remain in Light" boasted one of the first computer-designed record jackets. Psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog has called its front cover a "disarming image, which suggests both splitting and obliteration of identity" and which introduces the listener to the album's recurring theme of "identity disturbance"; he states, "The image is in bleak contrast to the title with the obscured images of the band members unable to 'remain in light'."

Talking Heads and Eno originally agreed to credit all songs in alphabetical order to "David Byrne, Brian Eno, Chris Frantz, Jerry Harrison and Tina Weymouth" after failing to devise an accurate mathematical formula for the split, but the album was released with the label credit: "all songs written by David Byrne & Brian Eno (except "Houses In Motion" and 'The Overload", written by David Byrne, Brian Eno & Jerry Harrison)". Frantz, Harrison, and Weymouth disputed Byrne and Eno's attempt to claim sole credits, especially for a process they had partly funded. According to Weymouth, Byrne told Kalman to doctor the credits on Eno's advice. Later editions rectified the error. In 2009, Frantz recalled, "we felt very burnt by the credits dispute".

Brian Eno advised Talking Heads that the music on "Remain in Light" was too dense for a quartet to perform. The band expanded to nine musicians for the tours in support of the album. The augmenting members recruited by Harrison were Belew, <a href="Funkadelic">Funkadelic</a> <a href="keyboardist">keyboardist</a> <a href="Bernie%20Worrell">Bernie Worrell</a>, <a href="bassist">bassist</a> <a href="Busta%20Jones">Busta "Cherry" Jones</a>, <a href="Ashford%20%26amp%3B%20Simpson">Ashford & Simpson</a> percussionist Steven Scales, and backing vocalist Dolette MacDonald. The larger group performed <a href="soundcheck">soundcheck</a>s in Frantz and Weymouth's loft by following the rhythms established by Worrell, who had studied at the <a href="New%20England%20Conservatory">New England Conservatory</a> and <a href="Juilliard%20School">Juilliard School</a>.

The expanded band's first appearance was on August 23, 1980 at the <a href="Heatwave%20%28festival%29">Heatwave festival</a> in Canada in front of 70,000 people; Robert Hilburn of the "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" called the band's new music a "rock-funk sound with dramatic, near show-stopping force". On August 27, the expanded Talking Heads performed a showcase of tracks to an audience of 125,000 at the <a href="Wollman%20Rink">Wollman Rink</a> in New York City's <a href="Central%20Park">Central Park</a>. The Canada and New York gigs were the only ones initially planned, but Sire Records decided to support the nine-member band on an extended tour. Following the promotional tour, the band went on hiatus for several years, leaving the individual members to pursue a variety of side projects.

"Remain in Light" was released worldwide on October 8, 1980. "Remain in Light" received its world premiere airing in its entirety on October 10, 1980 on <a href="WPSU%20%28FM%29">WDFM</a>. According to writer David Sheppard, "it was received as a great cultural event as much as a vivid art-pop record." It was certified Gold by the <a href="Canadian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Canadian Recording Industry Association</a> in February 1981 after shipping 50,000 copies, and by <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> in September 1985 after shipping 500,000 copies. Over one million copies have been sold worldwide.

The album attained widespread acclaim from media outlets. Ken Tucker of "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" felt it was a brave and absorbing attempt to locate a common ground in the early 1980s divergent and often hostile musical genres; he concluded, ""Remain in Light" yields scary, funny music to which you can dance and think, think and dance, dance and think, "<a href="ad%20infinitum">ad infinitum</a>"." <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", described the record as one "in which David Byrne conquers his fear of music in a visionary <a href="Afrofunk">Afrofunk</a> synthesis—clear-eyed, detached, almost mystically optimistic". Michael Kulp of the "<a href="Daily%20Collegian">Daily Collegian</a>" commented that the album deserves the tag "classic" like each of the band's three previous full-length releases, while <a href="John%20Rockwell">John Rockwell</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", suggested that it confirmed Talking Heads' position as "America's most venturesome rock band". Sandy Robertson of "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>" praised the record's innovation, while "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" wrote, "Just about every LP Talking Heads has released in the last four years has wound up on virtually every critics' best of list. "Remain in Light" should be no exception."

<a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>'s William Ruhlmann wrote that Talking Heads' musical transition, first witnessed in "Fear of Music", came to full fruition in "Remain in Light"; he stated, "Talking Heads were connecting with an audience ready to follow their musical evolution, and the album was so inventive and influential." In the 1995 "<a href="Spin%20Alternative%20Record%20Guide">Spin Alternative Record Guide</a>", Eric Weisbard praised Eno's production effort which helped rein in any excessive appropriations of African music by Talking Heads. In 2004, "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"s Barry Walsh labelled its results as "simply magical" after the band turned rock music into a more global entity in terms of its musical and lyrical scope. In a 2008 review, Sean Fennessey of "<a href="Vibe%20%28magazine%29">Vibe</a>" concluded, "Talking Heads took African polyrhythms to NYC and made a return trip with elegant, alien <a href="post-punk">post-punk</a> in tow."

"Remain in Light" was named the best album of 1980 by "<a href="Sounds%20%28magazine%29">Sounds</a>", ahead of <a href="The%20Skids">The Skids</a>' "<a href="The%20Absolute%20Game">The Absolute Game</a>", and by "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", while "The New York Times" included it in its unnumbered shortlist of the 10 best records issued that year. It figured highly in other end-of-year best album lists, notably at number two, behind <a href="The%20Clash">The Clash</a>'s "<a href="London%20Calling">London Calling</a>", by Robert Christgau, and at number six by "<a href="NME">NME</a>". It featured at number three—behind "London Calling" and <a href="Bruce%20Springsteen">Bruce Springsteen</a>'s "<a href="The%20River%20%28Bruce%20Springsteen%20album%29">The River</a>"—in "The Village Voice"s 1980 <a href="Pazz%20%26amp%3B%20Jop">Pazz & Jop</a> critics' poll, which aggregates the votes of hundreds of prominent reviewers.
In 1989, "Rolling Stone" named "Remain in Light" as the fourth best album of the decade. In 1993, it was included at number 11 in "NME"s list of The 50 Greatest Albums Of The '80s, and at number 68 in the publication's Greatest Albums Of All Time list. In 1997, "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" collated worldwide data from renowned critics, artists, and radio <a href="DJ">DJ</a>s, which placed the record at number 43 in the list of the 100 Best Albums Ever. In 1999, it was included by "Vibe" as one of its 100 Essential Albums Of The 20th Century. In 2002, <a href="Pitchfork%20Media">Pitchfork Media</a> featured "Remain in Light" at number two behind <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a>'s "<a href="Daydream%20Nation">Daydream Nation</a>" in its Top 100 Albums Of The 1980s list. In 2003, <a href="VH1">VH1</a> named the record at number 88 during its 100 Greatest Albums countdown, while "Slant" magazine included it in its unnumbered shortlist of 50 Essential Pop Albums. "Rolling Stone" placed it at number 129 in its December 2015 issue of "<a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>", higher than three other Talking Heads releases. In 2006, "<a href="Q%20magazine">Q</a>" ranked "Remain in Light" at number 27 in its list of the 40 Best Albums of the 80s. In 2012, "Slant" listed the album at number six on its list of the "Best Albums of the 1980s".

In 2018, Beninese singer <a href="Angelique%20Kidjo">Angelique Kidjo</a> released a song-for-song cover of "Remain in Light" (produced by <a href="Jeff%20Bhasker">Jeff Bhasker</a> and released on his Kravenworks label), describing herself as a longtime fan of the song "Once in a Lifetime" and wanting to pay tribute to the album by emphasizing its inspiration from African music.

Harmon Killebrew

Harmon Clayton Killebrew, Jr.(; June 29, 1936 – May 17, 2011), nicknamed "The Killer" and "Hammerin' Harmon", was an American professional <a href="baseball">baseball</a> <a href="first%20baseman">first baseman</a>, <a href="third%20baseman">third baseman</a>, and <a href="left%20fielder">left fielder</a>. During his 22-year career in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB), primarily with the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>, Killebrew was a prolific power hitter who, at the time of his retirement, had the fourth most home runs in major league history. He was second only to <a href="Babe%20Ruth">Babe Ruth</a> in <a href="American%20League">American League</a> (AL) <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s, and was the AL career leader in home runs by a right-handed batter . Killebrew was inducted into the <a href="National%20Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Baseball Hall of Fame</a> in 1984.

Killebrew was a <a href="wikt%3Astocky">stocky</a> tall, hitter with a compact swing that generated tremendous power. He became one of the AL's most feared power hitters of the 1960s, hitting 40 home runs in a season eight times. In 1965, he played in the <a href="1965%20World%20Series">World Series</a> with the Twins, who lost to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>. His finest season was 1969, when he hit 49 home runs, recorded 140 <a href="runs%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> (RBIs), and won the AL <a href="MLB%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20award">Most Valuable Player Award</a>. Killebrew led the league six times in home runs and three times in RBIs, and was named to thirteen <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star</a> teams.

With quick hands and exceptional upper body strength, Killebrew was known not just for the frequency of his home runs but also for their distance. He hit the longest measured home runs at Minnesota's <a href="Metropolitan%20Stadium">Metropolitan Stadium</a>, , and Baltimore's <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Baltimore%29">Memorial Stadium</a>, , and was the first of just four batters to hit a baseball over the <a href="left%20field">left field</a> roof at Detroit's <a href="Tiger%20Stadium%20%28Detroit%29">Tiger Stadium</a>. Despite his nicknames and his powerful style of play, Killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet, kind man. Asked once what hobbies he had, Killebrew replied, "Just washing the dishes, I guess."

After retiring from baseball, Killebrew became a television broadcaster for several baseball teams from 1976 to 1988, and also served as a hitting instructor for the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a>. 

Born and raised in <a href="Payette%2C%20Idaho">Payette, Idaho</a>, Killebrew was youngest of four children of Harmon Clayton, Sr. and Katherine Pearl (May) Killebrew. His father, a painter and <a href="Sheriffs%20in%20the%20United%20States">sheriff</a>, was a member of an undefeated <a href="Millikin%20College">Millikin College</a> <a href="American%20football">football</a> team who was later named an <a href="All-America">All-America</a>n under eventual <a href="Pro%20Football%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Pro Football Hall of Fame</a> coach <a href="Greasy%20Neale">Greasy Neale</a>. According to family legend, Harmon Killebrew's grandfather was the strongest man in the <a href="Union%20Army">Union Army</a>, winning every available <a href="Wrestling%20weight%20classes">heavyweight wrestling</a> championship. Clayton encouraged Harmon and his brothers to stay active in various sports before his sudden death in 1953 at age 59.

As a child, Killebrew played baseball at <a href="Walter%20Johnson">Walter Johnson</a> Memorial Field, named after the <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> pitcher who spent part of his childhood in Idaho. He worked as a farmworker in his youth, where he lifted ten-gallon milk cans, each weighing about . Killebrew earned twelve <a href="Letterman%20%28sports%29">letters</a> in various sports and was named an <a href="All-America%23High%20school%20sports">All-American</a> <a href="quarterback">quarterback</a> at <a href="Payette%20High%20School">Payette High School</a>; his uniform number was later retired by the school. He was offered an <a href="athletic%20scholarship">athletic scholarship</a> by the <a href="Oregon%20Ducks">University of Oregon</a>, but declined the offer.

In the early 1950s, <a href="List%20of%20United%20States%20Senators%20from%20Idaho">Senator</a> <a href="Herman%20Welker">Herman Welker</a> of Idaho told <a href="History%20of%20the%20Washington%20Senators%20%281901%E2%80%9360%29">Washington Senators</a> owner <a href="Clark%20Griffith">Clark Griffith</a> about Killebrew, who was hitting for an .847 <a href="batting%20average">batting average</a> for a <a href="semi-professional">semi-professional</a> baseball team at the time. Griffith told his <a href="Farm%20team">farm</a> director <a href="Ossie%20Bluege">Ossie Bluege</a> about the tip and Bluege flew to Idaho to watch Killebrew play. The <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a> also expressed interest but Bluege succeeded in signing him to a $50,000 ($ today) contract on June 19, 1954.

Killebrew signed his contract under <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> (MLB)'s <a href="Bonus%20Rule">Bonus Rule</a>, which required that he spend two full seasons on the major league roster. Making his major league debut four days after signing and six days from his 18th birthday (becoming the youngest active player in the majors at the time), Killebrew was called on to run for <a href="Clyde%20Vollmer">Clyde Vollmer</a>, who had been <a href="hit%20by%20pitch">hit by a pitch</a>, with the <a href="bases%20loaded">bases loaded</a>, by <a href="Chicago%20White%20Sox">Chicago White Sox</a> starter <a href="Jack%20Harshman">Jack Harshman</a> while <a href="pinch%20hitting">pinch hitting</a> for Senators <a href="relief%20pitcher">reliever</a> <a href="Chuck%20Stobbs">Chuck Stobbs</a>. On August 23, 1954, Killebrew made his first start in the second game of a <a href="Doubleheader%20%28baseball%29">doubleheader</a> against the <a href="Philadelphia%20Athletics">Philadelphia Athletics</a>, hitting two <a href="single%20%28baseball%29">singles</a> and a <a href="double%20%28baseball%29">double</a> as the Senators won the game, 10–3. A year and one day after making his major league debut, Killebrew hit his first major league home run on June 24, 1955 in the 5th inning off <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> starter <a href="Billy%20Hoeft">Billy Hoeft</a>, five days shy of his 19th birthday. In his first two seasons, Killebrew <a href="strikeout">struck out</a> 34 times in only 93 <a href="at%20bat">at bat</a>s, contributing to a .215 batting average with four <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s. Killebrew also had defensive difficulties at <a href="Third%20baseman">third base</a>, where he played behind veteran <a href="Eddie%20Yost">Eddie Yost</a>.
When Killebrew's bonus period expired in 1956, he was sent to the Senators' <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor league</a> affiliate in <a href="Charlotte%20Hornets%20%28baseball%29">Charlotte</a> of the <a href="South%20Atlantic%20League%20%281946%E2%80%9363%29">South Atlantic League</a>. He returned to the majors in early May. On May 29, after being forced into action when regular <a href="second%20baseman">second baseman</a> <a href="Pete%20Runnels">Pete Runnels</a> was injured early in the game, Killebrew hit two home runs in the game, including only the second ball ever hit over a wire barrier in <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Baltimore%29">Memorial Stadium</a>'s center field. Killebrew had a .115 average through June 16, and as a result was sent back to Charlotte; he finished the season there with a .325 batting average and 15 home runs in 70 games. Killebrew spent most of the 1957 season with the <a href="Southern%20Association">Southern Association</a>'s <a href="Chattanooga%20Lookouts">Chattanooga Lookouts</a>, where he hit a league-high 29 home runs with 101 RBIs and was named to the All-Star Game. While in Chattanooga, Killebrew became the only player to hit a home run over the center field wall at <a href="Engel%20Stadium">Engel Stadium</a>, from home plate. In 1958, he was briefly promoted to <a href="Indianapolis%20Indians">Indianapolis</a> of the <a href="American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29">American Association</a> but struggled and was sent back to Chattanooga for most of the season. Killebrew finished the season with 38 games played in Indianapolis and 86 in Chattanooga, where he hit .308 with 17 home runs. He also played a combined 22 games for the Senators in 1957 and 1958.

<a href="Calvin%20Griffith">Calvin Griffith</a> took over the Senators after his uncle <a href="Clark%20Griffith">Clark Griffith</a> died in 1955, and decided Killebrew was ready to become the Senators' regular third baseman. Griffith traded the 32-year-old Eddie Yost to the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a> on December 6, 1958, and Killebrew became the starting third baseman. From May 1 to May 17, he had five multi-home run games and his first five-RBI game on May 12. With 28 home runs by mid-season, he started the <a href="1959%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%20%28first%20game%29">first 1959 All-Star Game</a> and was a reserve in <a href="1959%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%20%28second%20game%29">the second</a>. Killebrew attracted so much attention in Washington that he was visited by President of the United States <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, who frequently attended games, and Griffith turned down a $500,000 offer for Killebrew from the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>. Killebrew finished the season with 42 home runs to tie for the <a href="List%20of%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20annual%20home%20run%20leaders">American League lead</a>; it also tied the Senator's single-season record set by his teammate <a href="Roy%20Sievers">Roy Sievers</a> two years earlier. Although 1959 proved his breakout season, he was ineligible for the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Rookie%20of%20the%20Year%20Award">Rookie of the Year Award</a> because of his previous sparse experience. Instead, the award went to teammate <a href="Bob%20Allison">Bob Allison</a>.

Killebrew was bothered by injury early in the 1960 season. In March, he had surgery for nasal irritation, and a recurring <a href="hamstring">hamstring</a> injury caused him to miss most of May. On his return, he remained in the lineup for the rest of the season, finishing the year with 31 home runs in 124 games. Killebrew's arrival and home runs did little to improve the Senators' record, as they finished in the <a href="first%20division%20%28baseball%29">second division</a> of the American League every year he played for Washington, including four years in last place. Following the 1960 season, the Senators moved to Minnesota and became the <a href="Minnesota%20Twins">Minnesota Twins</a>.

For the franchise's first year in Minnesota, Killebrew was named <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Team%20Captains">team captain</a> by <a href="manager%20%28baseball%29">manager</a> <a href="Cookie%20Lavagetto">Cookie Lavagetto</a>. He responded by hitting 46 home runs, breaking the franchise record he had tied two years earlier. Among his other accomplishments over the course of the season, Killebrew accumulated a team-leading 122 RBIs, achieved a career-best batting average of .288 and had a <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> of over .600 for the only time in his career. In addition, he had a career-high seven <a href="triple%20%28baseball%29">triples</a>, tying for the team lead, and led his team in runs, total bases and walks. On June 12, 1961, Killebrew had the only five-hit game of his career in a losing effort by the Twins. Killebrew was named to both 1961 All-Star games. He did not play in the second game, but in the <a href="1961%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20All-Star%20Game%20%28first%20game%29">first game</a>, he hit a <a href="pinch%20hitter">pinch hit</a> home run in the sixth inning. After the season ended, Killebrew took part in a home run hitting contest with <a href="Jim%20Gentile">Jim Gentile</a> and <a href="Roger%20Maris">Roger Maris</a>, whose 61 home runs that year broke the single-season record; Killebrew hit 20 to win the contest.

After his seven-triple season, his speed began to decrease and he could no longer regularly score triples due to pulling his <a href="Quadriceps%20femoris%20muscle">quadriceps</a> during the 1962 season. Killebrew moved to left field, where he started off the season slowly. He hit under .200 in both April and June, and because of this Killebrew was not selected to play in either 1962 All-Star Game, the last season he was not named an All-Star before 1972. On July 18 in a game against the <a href="Cleveland%20Indians">Cleveland Indians</a>, Killebrew and <a href="Bob%20Allison">Bob Allison</a> became the first teammates since 1890 to hit <a href="grand%20slam%20%28baseball%29">grand slams</a> in the same inning as the Twins scored 11 runs in the first. Over the course of the season, Killebrew hit 48 home runs, 126 RBIs, and had 107 <a href="base%20on%20balls">walks</a>, all career highs at the time. No one else in the AL managed even 40 home runs and he also led the league in RBIs. Killebrew's 48 home runs also broke the franchise record for the second year in a row. Not all of his stats were positive; Killebrew's batting average dropped from .288 in 1961 to .243 and he struck out a career-worst 142 times, leading the AL.

Killebrew's efforts were rewarded in 1963 when he agreed to a contract for about $40,000 ($ today). He started the season off slowly, and he missed the second half of April and early May due to a right knee injury that was slow to heal. Killebrew continued his hitting prowess for the Twins upon his return, and at one point led them on a six-game winning streak. On September 21, Killebrew hit three home runs in a game for the only time in his career in the first game of a doubleheader against the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>. Killebrew finished the season with a .258 batting average, 45 home runs, and 96 RBI, and led the league in home runs and <a href="slugging%20percentage">slugging percentage</a> (.555). He had surgery on his troublesome right knee after the season ended.
Having played left field for the previous three years with a below-average throwing arm, the additional complication of Killebrew's knee surgery necessitated a move to the infield. For the remainder of his career, he played only 19 games in the outfield. He finished the 1964 season with a .270 batting average, 49 home runs, and 111 RBI; he led the AL in home runs for the third consecutive year.

The Twins finally won the <a href="American%20League%20pennant%20winners%201901%E2%80%9368">American League pennant</a> during the 1965 season. On July 11, the day before the All-Star break, defending AL champion Yankees had a one-run lead over the Twins going into the bottom of the 9th inning, but Killebrew hit a two-run home run for the win. Two days later, Killebrew started the All-Star Game at his home field, <a href="Metropolitan%20Stadium">Metropolitan Stadium</a>, and hit a game-tying two-run home run, erasing what had been a 5–0 <a href="National%20League">National League</a> lead. Elected to play first base on his fifth All-Star team, Killebrew became the first player in All-Star game history to be elected at three different positions, having previously been selected to play third base (1959 and 1961) and left field (1963 and 1964).

Killebrew drove in the tying or winning run seven times in 1965 before suffering an injury on August 2. During a game against the Orioles, Twins third baseman <a href="Rich%20Rollins">Rich Rollins</a> made a poor throw to first and while trying to save the play, Killebrew collided with the runner and <a href="Joint%20dislocation">dislocated</a> his elbow, putting him out of action until mid-September. Despite his absence, the Twins had a win-loss record of 28–19 and even extended their first place lead. Killebrew ended the regular season with 25 home runs and 75 RBI, his lowest numbers in a full season due to the injury. In the <a href="1965%20World%20Series">1965 World Series</a> against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a>, Killebrew and <a href="Zoilo%20Versalles">Zoilo Versalles</a> led the Twins with .286 batting averages, and Killebrew hit a home run off <a href="Don%20Drysdale">Don Drysdale</a> in Game 4. Overall, Minnesota was shut out in three games and the Dodgers won the series in seven games.

At the start of the 1966 season, Killebrew hit few home runs; halfway through May, he had only hit two home runs, his lowest total at that point of a season since 1960, when he had missed the first two months of the season. He later increased his tally to 39 and finished the season with a .281 batting average and 110 RBIs. He led the AL with 103 walks and finished 4th in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player Award</a> (MVP) voting to <a href="Frank%20Robinson">Frank Robinson</a>, <a href="Brooks%20Robinson">Brooks Robinson</a>, and <a href="Boog%20Powell">Boog Powell</a>.

During the 1967 season, Killebrew showed his ability to hit long home runs when, on June 3, 1967, he struck the longest home run recorded at Metropolitan Stadium, a shot off Lew Burdette in the 4th inning that landed in the second deck of the bleachers. The Twins, led by Killebrew, were in the pennant race throughout the season, and had a one-game lead as the final two games of the season began against the <a href="Boston%20Red%20Sox">Boston Red Sox</a>. Having to win only once to clinch the pennant, Killebrew hit a home run in the first game and recorded two hits in each game, but Boston won twice and Minnesota finished in a second place tie with the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>. Killebrew finished the season with a .269 batting average and 113 RBIs, and led the AL with 44 home runs (tied with Carl Yastrzemski) and 131 walks. He also finished a distant second in MVP voting to Boston's <a href="triple%20crown%20%28baseball%29">Triple Crown</a> winner <a href="Carl%20Yastrzemski">Carl Yastrzemski</a>.

Killebrew started the 1968 season in a different venue; he served as a prosecution witness in a case where his name was being used to sell stocks in Idaho, unknown to him. Despite this, the season was unsuccessful for Killebrew, whose batting average barely passed .200 most of the year; after a strong start, he hit below .200 in both May and June and his average stood at .204 with 13 home runs going into the all-star break. Even so, he was selected as the starting first baseman in the All-Star Game and Killebrew stated that, owing to his poor start, he was "surprised" and "embarrassed" by the selection. In the All-Star Game itself, in the third inning he stretched for a ball thrown by shortstop Jim Fregosi and his foot slipped and he did the splits, rupturing his left medial hamstring. He was carried from the field by a stretcher. At the time, the injury was considered career-threatening, but after missing about six weeks, he returned to limited action in September.

After enduring seven months of rehabilitation for his injury, Killebrew remained in pain but rebounded to have his best season in 1969. On July 5, Killebrew set a career-high with six RBIs in a game against the <a href="Oakland%20Athletics">Oakland Athletics</a>. That personal best lasted barely two months: on September 7 he hit a three-run home run and a grand slam for seven RBIs, all in the first two innings, to defeat the Athletics again. Killebrew led the best offense in the league and rookie manager <a href="Billy%20Martin">Billy Martin</a>'s Twins won the new <a href="American%20League%20West">American League West</a> division as a result.

For the season, Killebrew set career highs in RBIs, runs, walks and <a href="on-base%20percentage">on-base percentage</a>, tied his career high with 49 home runs, and even registered eight of his 19 career stolen bases, en route to winning his only <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">Most Valuable Player Award</a>. He led the AL in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, walks, and intentional walks and knocked in the winning run 20 times while playing in all 162 games. As of 2011, Killebrew's home run, RBI, and walk totals from 1969 remain team records, and his 145 walks are tied for the 20th highest single season total in MLB history and 7th highest for a right-handed batter. In the <a href="1969%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1969 American League Championship Series</a>, the <a href="Baltimore%20Orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a> used their pitching staff, the best in the league, to defeat Minnesota and win the series three games to none. Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games to avoid pitching to him, which was as many times as they walked the rest of the Twins team.

After his MVP season, Killebrew signed a new contract with the Twins worth $90,000 ($ today). He was set to lead a team that had undergone a lot of change; Killebrew was one of only four Twins remaining from the 1965 pennant-winning club. He spent most of the season's first half continuing his success, and found Baltimore's <a href="Brooks%20Robinson">Brooks Robinson</a> rivalling him for the third base spot during the All-Star voting process; the two were neck-and-neck throughout. He continued his success through the second half of the year, and at season's end Killebrew had hit 41 home runs with 113 RBIs and finished third in MVP voting behind teammate and runner-up <a href="Tony%20Oliva">Tony Oliva</a> and Baltimore's <a href="Boog%20Powell">Boog Powell</a>. The Twins again faced Powell and the Orioles in the <a href="1970%20American%20League%20Championship%20Series">1970 American League Championship Series</a>, a rematch of the previous season. The Twins were again swept, though Killebrew's performance improved as he hit two home runs in three games.

Killebrew reached the 40 home runs for the final time in 1970 and also made his last appearance in the postseason. His contract continued to grow in value though, and before the 1971 season began he was awarded the first $100,000 ($ today) contract in Twins' history. Killebrew appeared in his last All-Star Game in 1971, hitting a two-run home run off <a href="Ferguson%20Jenkins">Ferguson Jenkins</a> to provide the margin of victory for the AL. He finished the season with a .254 batting average, 114 walks, 119 RBI, the latter two of which led the league, and 28 home runs. Killebrew hit his 498th home run on June 22, 1971, but a sprained right toe made his run to milestone number 500 a slow one. He hit number 499 more than a month later and finally hit number 500 off a <a href="Mike%20Cuellar">Mike Cuellar</a> slow <a href="curveball">curveball</a> in the first inning of an August 10 home game; at the time, he was the 10th player in history to hit 500 home runs. He then wasted no time in hitting number 501, knocking a Cuellar <a href="fastball">fastball</a> over the fences later in the same game.
In 1972, Killebrew showed signs of slowing down. He missed his first All-Star Game since 1962, but instead of expressing disappointment in his streak ending, he noted that Twins shortstop <a href="Danny%20Thompson%20%28baseball%29">Danny Thompson</a> should have had the opportunity to play instead; Thompson mentioned the same thing about Killebrew. Despite not making the team, Killebrew's home run total continued to climb, and by the end of July he had <a href="Jimmie%20Foxx">Jimmie Foxx</a> and <a href="Mickey%20Mantle">Mickey Mantle</a> career marks in his sights; he went on to pass both in August. Killebrew finished the season with a .231 batting average, 26 home runs, and 74 RBIs. There were questions about Killebrew's health as the 1973 season began, as he had surgery twice during the offseason to fix leg problems. He played through the first half of the season, but an injury to his left knee on June 25 sidelined him. A month later, the injury had not cleared up, and he underwent surgery to remove some torn cartilage; he did not return to the lineup until mid-September. Killebrew only played in 69 games that season, hitting five home runs.

Fully recovered for the 1974 season, Killebrew made his mark early on, hitting two home runs in a May 5 match against the <a href="Detroit%20Tigers">Detroit Tigers</a>; the second was career home run number 550. In his honor, the Twins held a Harmon Killebrew Day in August, where it was announced that they would retire his number; Killebrew responded by leading the Twins to a 5–4 victory over the Orioles. He finished the season with a .222 batting average, 13 home runs, and 54 RBIs. In December 1974, he was given the option of staying with the Twins as a coach and batting instructor, managing the AAA <a href="Tacoma%20Twins">Tacoma Twins</a>, or being released. He chose to be released, ending his 21-season tenure with the Twins.

On January 24, 1975, eight days after getting his release from the Twins, Killebrew signed a one-year contract with the <a href="Kansas%20City%20Royals">Kansas City Royals</a>. During his return to Minnesota in early May, the Twins formally retired his No. 3 jersey. In that game, Killebrew hit a home run against his former teammates and received a standing ovation from the crowd. In 106 games with the Royals, he had a batting average of .199, 14 home runs, and 44 RBIs. At the end of the season, the Royals decided to release Killebrew. In March 1976, he formally announced his retirement and stated that he would become an announcer and color commentator for Twins games. At the time of his retirement, he was fifth all-time on the home run list.

Killebrew was first eligible for the Hall of Fame in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201981">1981</a> and received 239 votes, or 59.6% of the vote; 75% of the vote is required for induction. While he did hit 573 home runs (5th all-time when he left the game), he amassed a relatively low hit total (2086), given the years he played, combined with a high number of strikeouts (1699), and a .256 batting average. In <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201982">1982</a>, Killebrew received 59.3% of the vote, taking a backseat to <a href="Hank%20Aaron">Hank Aaron</a> and <a href="Frank%20Robinson">Frank Robinson</a>, who made it in their first year of eligibility. After receiving 71.9% of the vote in <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201983">1983</a>, Killebrew said that not getting in that year was more difficult to accept than the previous two times, and asked "Why do the writers feel there only has to be a certain number inducted each time?" In <a href="Baseball%20Hall%20of%20Fame%20balloting%2C%201984">1984</a>, Killebrew received 83.1% of the vote and was elected to the Hall in his fourth year of eligibility, joining <a href="Luis%20Aparicio">Luis Aparicio</a> and <a href="Don%20Drysdale">Don Drysdale</a> as electees.

In his career, Killebrew hit 573 home runs, which as of 2015 is currently 11th all-time, 1,584 RBIs, 1,559 walks, which is currently 15th all-time, and he easily holds the all-time home run record among players born in the state of <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> with 573; <a href="Vance%20Law">Vance Law</a> is second with 71. He also finished with the record of having the most plate appearances (9,831) in his career without a sacrifice hit (since broken by <a href="Frank%20Thomas%20%28designated%20hitter%29">Frank Thomas</a> with 10,074 plate appearances).

<a href="Reggie%20Jackson">Reggie Jackson</a> once said, "If Harmon Killebrew isn't the league's best player, I've never seen one. The street along the south side of the <a href="Mall%20of%20America">Mall of America</a>, the former site of Metropolitan Stadium, in <a href="Bloomington%2C%20Minnesota">Bloomington, Minnesota</a> was named "Killebrew Drive" in his honor. Banners that hung above the Metrodome's outfield upper deck, resembling baseball cards, showed the retired numbers: Killebrew (3), <a href="Rod%20Carew">Rod Carew</a> (29), Tony Oliva (6), <a href="Kent%20Hrbek">Kent Hrbek</a> (14) and <a href="Kirby%20Puckett">Kirby Puckett</a> (34). In 1999, he was ranked 69th on The Sporting News list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players and was nominated as a finalist for Major League Baseball's All-Century Team. When the Twins moved into <a href="Target%20Field">Target Field</a> in 2010, Gate 3 on the southeast (centerfield) side of the stadium was named in his honor. There are also corresponding gates for the team's other retired numbers. Killebrew Canyon at <a href="Heavenly%20Mountain%20Resort">Heavenly Mountain Resort</a> is also named after the baseball star, who <a href="Alpine%20skiing">skied</a> the outer limits of the resort after his retirement from baseball.

Despite rumors that Killebrew was the player depicted in the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20logo">Major League Baseball logo</a>, according to the creator, <a href="Jerry%20Dior">Jerry Dior</a>, it was not patterned after Killebrew or any other specific player. Killebrew is the model for the <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Players%20Alumni%20Association">Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association</a>, an organization which Killebrew helped found in 1982.

Killebrew was known as an all-around gentleman during his playing career. He's one of the greatest of all time." He was even noted as being kind to the umpires:

Killebrew was known for his quick hands and exceptional upper-body strength, demonstrated by frequent "tape measure" home runs that he hit in the prime of his career. Killebrew said that his first home run in the Majors was his favorite, coming off <a href="Billy%20Hoeft">Billy Hoeft</a> at <a href="Griffith%20Stadium">Griffith Stadium</a>. He said of it, "<a href="Frank%20House%20%28baseball%29">Frank House</a> was the catcher. When I came to the plate, he said, 'Kid, we're going to throw you a fastball.' I didn't know whether to believe him or not. I hit it out. It was one of the longest home runs I ever hit. As I crossed the plate, House said, 'That's the last time I ever tell you what pitch is coming'."

On August 3, <a href="1962%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">1962</a>, he was the first batter ever to hit a baseball over the left field roof at <a href="Tiger%20Stadium%20%28Detroit%29">Tiger Stadium</a>, a seldom-reached target as contrasted with the old ballpark's smaller right field area. Only three others accomplished this feat during the next 37 seasons before the stadium was closed.
On May 24, <a href="1964%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">1964</a>, Harmon hit the longest measured homer at Baltimore's <a href="Memorial%20Stadium%20%28Baltimore%29">Memorial Stadium</a>, to deep left center. The ball landed in the far reaches of the bleachers. The only player to hit one completely out of the Orioles' stadium was <a href="Frank%20Robinson">Frank Robinson</a> in 1966; his blast was reported as about , or about less than Killebrew's. On June 3, <a href="1967%20Minnesota%20Twins%20season">1967</a>, Killebrew hit a home run, the longest measured home run ever hit at Metropolitan Stadium and, as of 2011, the longest in Twins history. That event is commemorated at the Mall of America in Bloomington, which includes a plaque marking home plate, and one red-painted seat from the Met which was placed at the location and elevation of the landing spot of the home run. The new Target Field has a statue of a Gold Glove outside Gate 34 and it is exactly from Target Field's home plate.

Following his retirement, Killebrew was a television broadcaster for the Twins at <a href="WTCN%20TV">WTCN TV</a> from 1976 to 1978, the Oakland Athletics from 1979 to 1982, the <a href="California%20Angels">California Angels</a> in 1983 and back with Minnesota from 1984 to 1988. While with Oakland, he also served as a major- and minor-league hitting instructor. In the late 1980s, Killebrew had financial problems. In July 1988, his house went into <a href="foreclosure">foreclosure</a> and, in 1989, the "<a href="Minneapolis%20Star%20Tribune">Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>" reported that he had fallen $700,000 into debt. He also divorced his first wife of over 30 years, Elaine, who he had married in 1955. Soon after, Killebrew's health failed. In May 1990, he was rushed to the hospital with a <a href="pneumothorax">collapsed lung</a> and damaged <a href="esophagus">esophagus</a>. Together with a subsequent <a href="abscess">abscess</a> and <a href="staph%20infection">staph infection</a>, Killebrew endured three surgeries and nearly died. He used a wheelchair for some time post-surgery. By December 1990, his health was improved and he was remarried to Nita.

Killebrew was involved in a <a href="Boise%2C%20Idaho">Boise</a>, Idaho insurance and securities business. He moved to <a href="Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona">Scottsdale</a>, Arizona in 1990, where he chaired the Harmon Killebrew Foundation, which he created in 1998. Killebrew founded the <a href="Danny%20Thompson%20%28baseball%29">Danny Thompson</a> Memorial Golf Tournament, now titled the Killebrew-Thompson Memorial in 1977 with former <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a> <a href="United%20States%20Congress">congressman</a> <a href="Ralph%20R.%20Harding">Ralph Harding</a>, which is played annually in late August in <a href="Sun%20Valley%2C%20Idaho">Sun Valley, Idaho</a>, and has donated more than $15.6 million to <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a> and cancer research. Thompson was a Twins teammate who continued his major league career while suffering from leukemia; he died in December 1976 at the age of 29.

Despite his nicknames and style of play, Killebrew was considered by his colleagues to be a quiet, kind man. While still an active major leaguer, Killebrew became a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, and never smoked or drank. He was once asked in an interview what hobbies he had, to which he replied, "Just washing the dishes, I guess." 

On December 29, 2010, Killebrew announced that he had been diagnosed with <a href="esophageal%20cancer">esophageal cancer</a> and started treatment. On May 13, 2011, a Minnesota Twins press release reported he was ceasing treatment and entering <a href="hospice%20care">hospice care</a>, because his illness had progressed beyond his doctors' expectation of cure. To honor Killebrew, the Twins wore their 1961 <a href="throwback%20uniform">throwback</a> <a href="alternate%20jersey">alternate jersey</a>s at home for the remainder of the 2011 season; he was also honored by the <a href="Washington%20Nationals">Washington Nationals</a>, who hung a jersey with Killebrew's name and number 3 in
their home dugout. Killebrew died on May 17, 2011 at his home in <a href="Scottsdale%2C%20Arizona">Scottsdale</a>, Arizona at the age of 74, a month and a half short of his 75th birthday. He was interred at Riverside Cemetery in Payette, Idaho. Following his death, the Twins released a statement:

Margaret Fuller

Sarah Margaret Fuller Ossoli (May 23, 1810 – July 19, 1850), commonly known as Margaret Fuller, was an American journalist, editor, critic, and <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a> advocate associated with the American <a href="transcendentalism">transcendentalism</a> movement. She was the first full-time American female book reviewer in journalism. Her book "<a href="Woman%20in%20the%20Nineteenth%20Century">Woman in the Nineteenth Century</a>" is considered the first major <a href="feminism">feminist</a> work in the United States.

Born Sarah Margaret Fuller in <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge, Massachusetts</a>, she was given a substantial early education by her father, <a href="Timothy%20Fuller">Timothy Fuller</a>. She later had more formal schooling and became a teacher before, in 1839, she began overseeing her Conversations series: classes for women meant to compensate for their lack of access to higher education. She became the first editor of the transcendentalist journal "<a href="The%20Dial">The Dial</a>" in 1840, before joining the staff of the "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>" under <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a> in 1844. By the time she was in her 30s, Fuller had earned a reputation as the <a href="wikt%3Awell-read">best-read</a> person in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>, male or female, and became the first woman allowed to use the library at <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a>. Her seminal work, "Woman in the Nineteenth Century", was published in 1845. A year later, she was sent to Europe for the "Tribune" as its first female <a href="correspondent">correspondent</a>. She soon became involved with the <a href="Revolutions%20of%201848%20in%20the%20Italian%20states">revolutions in Italy</a> and allied herself with <a href="Giuseppe%20Mazzini">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>. She had a relationship with Giovanni Ossoli, with whom she had a child. All three members of the family died in a shipwreck off <a href="Fire%20Island%2C%20New%20York">Fire Island, New York</a>, as they were traveling to the United States in 1850. Fuller's body was never recovered.

Fuller was an advocate of women's rights and, in particular, women's education and the right to employment. She also encouraged many other reforms in society, including <a href="prison%20reform">prison reform</a> and the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">emancipation of slaves</a> in the United States. Many other advocates for women's rights and feminism, including <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a>, cite Fuller as a source of inspiration. Many of her contemporaries, however, were not supportive, including her former friend <a href="Harriet%20Martineau">Harriet Martineau</a>. She said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist. Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded; the editors who prepared her letters to be published, believing her fame would be short-lived, censored or altered much of her work before publication.

Sarah Margaret Fuller was born on May 23, 1810, in <a href="Cambridgeport">Cambridgeport</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, the first child of Congressman <a href="Timothy%20Fuller">Timothy Fuller</a> and Margaret Crane Fuller. She was named after her paternal grandmother and her mother, but by age nine she dropped "Sarah" and insisted on being called "Margaret." The <a href="Margaret%20Fuller%20House">Margaret Fuller House</a>, in which she was born, is still standing. Her father taught her to read and write at the age of three and a half, shortly after the couple's second daughter, Julia Adelaide, died at 14 months old. He offered her an education as rigorous as any boy's at the time and forbade her to read the typical feminine fare of the time, such as <a href="etiquette">etiquette</a> books and sentimental novels. He incorporated <a href="Latin">Latin</a> into his teaching shortly after the birth of the couple's son Eugene in May 1815, and soon Margaret was translating simple passages from <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>. Later in life Margaret blamed her father's exacting love and his valuation of accuracy and precision for her childhood nightmares and sleepwalking. During the day Margaret spent time with her mother, who taught her household chores and <a href="sewing">sewing</a>. In 1817, her brother William Henry Fuller was born, and her father was elected as a representative in the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a>. For the next eight years, he spent four to six months a year in Washington, D.C. At age ten, Fuller wrote a cryptic note which her father saved: "On 23 May 1810, was born one foredoomed to sorrow and pain, and like others to have misfortunes."

Fuller began her formal education at the Port School in Cambridgeport in 1819 before attending the <a href="Boston%20Lyceum%20for%20Young%20Ladies">Boston Lyceum for Young Ladies</a> from 1821 to 1822. In 1824, she was sent to the School for Young Ladies in <a href="Groton%2C%20Massachusetts">Groton</a>, on the advice of aunts and uncles, though she resisted the idea at first. While she was there, Timothy Fuller did not run for re-election, in order to help <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> with his presidential campaign in 1824; he hoped Adams would return the favor with a governmental appointment. On June 17, 1825, Fuller attended the ceremony at which the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> hero <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20marquis%20de%20La%20Fayette">Marquis de Lafayette</a> laid the cornerstone of the <a href="Bunker%20Hill%20Monument">Bunker Hill Monument</a> 50 years after the battle. 15-year-old Fuller introduced herself to Lafayette in a letter which concluded: "Should we both live, and it is possible to a female, to whole the avenues of glory are seldom accessible, I will recal my name to your recollection." Early on, Fuller sensed herself to be a significant person and thinker. Fuller left the Groton school after two years and returned home at 16. At home she studied the <a href="classics">classics</a> and trained herself in several <a href="modern%20language">modern language</a>s and read world literature. By this time, she realized she did not fit in with other young women her age. She wrote, "I have felt that I was not born to the common womanly lot." <a href="Eliza%20Farrar">Eliza Farrar</a>, wife of Harvard professor <a href="John%20Farrar%20%28scientist%29">John Farrar</a> and author of "The Young Lady's Friend" (1836), attempted to train her in feminine etiquette until the age of 20, but was never wholly successful.

Fuller was an avid reader. By the time she was in her 30s, she had earned a reputation as the best-read person, male or female, in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. She used her knowledge to give private lessons based on the teaching style of <a href="Elizabeth%20Peabody">Elizabeth Palmer Peabody</a>. Fuller hoped to earn her living through journalism and translation; her first published work, a response to historian <a href="George%20Bancroft">George Bancroft</a>, appeared in November 1834 in the "<a href="North%20American%20Review">North American Review</a>". When she was 23, her father's law practice failed and he moved the family to a farm in Groton. On February 20, 1835, <a href="Frederic%20Henry%20Hedge">Frederic Henry Hedge</a> and <a href="James%20Freeman%20Clarke">James Freeman Clarke</a> asked her to contribute to each of their periodicals. Clarke helped her publish her first literary review in the "Western Messenger" in June: criticisms of recent biographies on <a href="George%20Crabbe">George Crabbe</a> and <a href="Hannah%20More">Hannah More</a>. In the fall of that year, she suffered a terrible <a href="migraine">migraine</a> with a fever that lasted nine days. Fuller continued to experience such headaches throughout her life. While she was still recovering, her father died of <a href="cholera">cholera</a> on October 2, 1835. She was deeply affected by his death: "My father's image follows me constantly", she wrote. She vowed to step in as the head of the family and take care of her widowed mother and younger siblings. Her father had not left a will, and two of her uncles gained control of his property and finances, later assessed at $18,098.15, and the family had to rely on them for support. Humiliated by the way her uncles were treating the family, Fuller wrote that she regretted being "of the softer sex, and never more than now".
Around this time, Fuller was hoping to prepare a biography of <a href="Johann%20Wolfgang%20von%20Goethe">Johann Wolfgang von Goethe</a>, but felt that she could work on it only if she traveled to Europe. Her father's death and her sudden responsibility for her family caused her to abandon this idea. In 1836, Fuller was given a job teaching at <a href="Amos%20Bronson%20Alcott">Bronson Alcott's</a> Temple School in <a href="Boston%2C%20Massachusetts">Boston</a>, where she remained for a year. She then accepted an invitation to teach under <a href="Hiram%20Fuller%20%28journalist%29">Hiram Fuller</a> (no relation) at the Greene Street School in <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence, Rhode Island</a>, in April 1837 with the unusually high salary of $1,000 per year. Her family sold the Groton farm and Fuller moved with them to <a href="Jamaica%20Plain%2C%20Massachusetts">Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts</a>. On November 6, 1839, Fuller held the first of her Conversations, discussions among local women who met in the Boston home of the Peabodys. Fuller intended to compensate for the lack of women's education with discussions and debates focused on subjects including the fine arts, history, mythology, literature, and nature. Serving as the "nucleus of conversation", Fuller also intended to answer the "great questions" facing women and encourage women "to question, to define, to state and examine their opinions". She asked her participants, "What were we born to do? How shall we do it? Which so few ever propose to themselves 'till their best years are gone by". In Conversations, Fuller was finally finding equal intellectual companions among her female contemporaries. A number of significant figures in the women's rights movement attended these gatherings, including <a href="Sophia%20Ripley">Sophia Dana Ripley</a>, <a href="Caroline%20Sturgis%20Tappan">Caroline Sturgis</a>, and <a href="Maria%20White%20Lowell">Maria White Lowell</a>.

In October 1839, <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson">Ralph Waldo Emerson</a> was seeking an editor for his <a href="transcendentalism">transcendentalist</a> journal "<a href="The%20Dial">The Dial</a>". After several declined the position, he offered it to Fuller, referring to her as "my vivacious friend." Emerson had met Fuller in Cambridge in 1835; of that meeting, he admitted: "she made me laugh more than I liked." The next summer, Fuller spent two weeks at <a href="Ralph%20Waldo%20Emerson%20House">Emerson's home</a> in Concord. Fuller accepted Emerson's offer to edit "The Dial" on October 20, 1839, and began work in the first week of 1840. She edited the journal from 1840 to 1842, though her promised annual salary of $200 was never paid. Because of her role, she was soon recognized as one of the most important figures of the transcendental movement and was invited to <a href="George%20Ripley%20%28transcendentalist%29">George Ripley's</a> <a href="Brook%20Farm">Brook Farm</a>, a communal experiment. Fuller never officially joined the community but was a frequent visitor, often spending New Year's Eve there. In the summer of 1843, she traveled to Chicago, <a href="Milwaukee">Milwaukee</a>, <a href="Niagara%20Falls">Niagara Falls</a>, and <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>; while there, she interacted with several Native Americans, including members of the <a href="Ottawa%20%28tribe%29">Ottawa</a> and the <a href="Ojibwa">Chippewa</a> tribes. She reported her experiences in a book called "<a href="Summer%20on%20the%20Lakes">Summer on the Lakes</a>", which she completed writing on her 34th birthday in 1844. The critic <a href="Evert%20Augustus%20Duyckinck">Evert Augustus Duyckinck</a> called it "the only genuine book, I can think of, this season." Fuller used the library at <a href="Harvard%20College">Harvard College</a> to do research on the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20region%20%28North%20America%29">Great Lakes region</a>, and became the first woman allowed to use Harvard's library.

Fuller's "<a href="Woman%20in%20the%20Nineteenth%20Century">The Great Lawsuit</a>" was written in serial form for "The Dial". She originally intended to name the work "The Great Lawsuit: Man 'versus' Men, Woman 'versus' Women"; when it was expanded and published independently in 1845, it was entitled "Woman in the Nineteenth Century". After completing it, she wrote to a friend: "I had put a good deal of my true self in it, as if, I suppose I went away now, the measure of my footprint would be left on earth." The work discussed the role that women played in American democracy and Fuller's opinion on possibilities for improvement. It has since become one of the major documents in American <a href="feminism">feminism</a>. It is considered the first of its kind in the United States. Soon after the American publication of "Woman in the Nineteenth Century", it was pirated and published by H.G. Clarke in England. Despite never receiving commissions due to a lack of international copyright laws, Fuller was "very glad to find it will be read by women" around the world.

Fuller left "The Dial" in 1844 in part because of ill health but also because of her disappointment with the publication's dwindling subscription list. She moved to New York that autumn and joined <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley's</a> "<a href="New%20York%20Tribune">New York Tribune</a>" as a literary critic, becoming the first full-time book reviewer in American journalism and, by 1846, the publication's first female editor. Her first article, a review of a collection of essays by Emerson, appeared in the December 1, 1844, issue. At this time, the "Tribune" had some 50,000 subscribers and Fuller earned $500 a year for her work. In addition to American books, she reviewed foreign literature, concerts, lectures, and art exhibits. During her four years with the publication, she published more than 250 columns, most signed with a "*" as a byline. In these columns, Fuller discussed topics ranging from art and literature to political and social issues such as the plight of slaves and women's rights. She also published poetry; her poems, styled after the work of Emerson, do not have the same intellectual vigor as her criticism.

Around this time, she was also involved in a scandal involving fellow literary critic <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>, who had been carrying on a public flirtation with the married poet <a href="Frances%20Sargent%20Osgood">Frances Sargent Osgood</a>. Another poet, <a href="Elizabeth%20F.%20Ellet">Elizabeth F. Ellet</a>, had become enamored of Poe and jealous of Osgood and suggested the relationship between Poe and Osgood was more than an innocent flirtation. Osgood then sent Fuller and <a href="Anne%20Lynch%20Botta">Anne Lynch Botta</a> to <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe%20Cottage">Poe's cottage</a> on her behalf to request that he return the personal letters she had sent him. Angered by their interference, Poe called them "Busy-bodies". A public scandal erupted and continued until Osgood's estranged husband <a href="Samuel%20Stillman%20Osgood">Samuel Stillman Osgood</a> stepped in and threatened to sue Ellet.

In 1846 the "New York Tribune" sent Fuller to Europe, specifically England and Italy, as its first female foreign correspondent. She traveled from Boston to <a href="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> in August on the "Cambria", a vessel that used both sail and steam to make the journey in ten days and sixteen hours. Over the next four years she provided the "Tribune" with thirty-seven reports. She interviewed many prominent writers including <a href="George%20Sand">George Sand</a> and <a href="Thomas%20Carlyle">Thomas Carlyle</a>—whom she found disappointing because of his <a href="reactionary">reactionary</a> politics, among other things. George Sand had previously been an idol of hers, but Fuller was disappointed when Sand chose not to run for the French National Assembly, saying that women were not ready to vote or to hold political office. Fuller was also given a letter of introduction to <a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett</a> by <a href="Cornelius%20Mathews">Cornelius Mathews</a>, but did not meet her at that time, because Barrett had just eloped with <a href="Robert%20Browning">Robert Browning</a>.

In England in the spring of 1846, she met <a href="Giuseppe%20Mazzini">Giuseppe Mazzini</a>, who had been in exile there from Italy since 1837. Fuller also met the Italian revolutionary Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, a marquis who had been disinherited by his family because of his support for Mazzini. Fuller and Ossoli moved in together in <a href="Florence">Florence, Italy</a>, likely before they were married, though whether they ever married is uncertain. Fuller was originally opposed to marrying him, in part because of the difference in their religions; she was <a href="Protestant">Protestant</a> and he was <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic</a>. Emerson speculated that the couple was "married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec" of 1847, though he did not explain his reasoning. Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4, 1848, to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting but one biographer provided evidence they first met on April 1 during the ceremony called "Lavanda degli Altari" (Altars Lavage). By the time the couple moved to Florence, they were referred to as husband and wife, though it is unclear if any formal ceremony took place. It seems certain that at the time their child was born, they were not married. By New Year's Day 1848, she suspected that she was pregnant but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks. Their child, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli, was born in early September 1848 and nicknamed Angelino. The couple was very secretive about their relationship but, after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness, they became less so. Fuller informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849 in a letter that explained that she had kept silent so as not to upset her "but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for us to live publicly and permanently together." Her mother's response makes it clear that she was aware that the couple was not legally married. Even so, she was happy for her daughter, writing: "I send my first kiss with my fervent blessing to my grandson."

The couple supported Giuseppe Mazzini's revolution for the establishment of a <a href="Roman%20Republic%20%2819th%20century%29">Roman Republic</a> in 1849. Ossoli fought in the struggle while Fuller volunteered at a supporting hospital. When the republicans they supported met defeat, they had to flee Italy and decided to move to the United States. En route, they returned to Paris, where she finally met Elizabeth Barrett Browning. Fuller used her experience in Italy to begin a book about the history of the Roman Republic—a work she may have begun as early as 1847— and hoped to find an American publisher after a British one rejected it. She believed the work would be her most important, referring to it in a March 1849 letter to her brother Richard as, "something good which may survive my troubled existence."

In the beginning of 1850, Fuller wrote to a friend: "It has long seemed that in the year 1850 I should stand on some important plateau in the ascent of life ... I feel however no marked and important change as yet." Also that year, Fuller wrote: "I am absurdly fearful and various omens have combined to give me a dark feeling ... It seems to me that my future upon earth will soon close ... I have a vague expectation of some crisis—I know not what". A few days after writing this, Fuller, Ossoli, and their child began a five-week return voyage to the United States aboard the ship "Elizabeth", an American merchant freighter carrying cargo that included mostly marble from <a href="Carrara">Carrara</a>. They set sail on May 17. At sea, the ship's captain, Seth Hasty, died of <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a>. Angelino contracted the disease and recovered.

Possibly because of the inexperienced first mate, now serving as captain, the ship slammed into a <a href="shoal">sandbar</a> less than 100 yards from <a href="Fire%20Island%2C%20New%20York">Fire Island, New York</a>, on July 19, 1850, around Many of the other passengers and crew members abandoned ship. The first mate, Mr. Bangs, urged Fuller and Ossoli to try to save themselves and their child as he himself jumped overboard, later claiming he believed Fuller had wanted to be left behind to die. On the beach, people arrived with carts hoping to salvage any cargo washed ashore. None made any effort to rescue the crew or passengers of the "Elizabeth", though they were only 50 yards from shore. Most of those aboard attempted to swim to shore, leaving Fuller and Ossoli and Angelino some of the last on the ship. Ossoli was thrown overboard by a massive wave and, after the wave had passed, a crewman who witnessed the event said Fuller could not be seen.

<a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> traveled to New York, at the urging of Emerson, to search the shore but neither Fuller's body nor that of her husband was ever recovered. Angelino's had washed ashore. Few of their possessions were found other than some of the child's clothes and a few letters. Fuller's manuscript on the rise and fall of the 1849 Roman Republic, which she described as, "what is most valuable to me if I live of any thing", was also <a href="Lost%20works">lost</a>. A memorial to Fuller was erected on the beach at Fire Island in 1901 through the efforts of <a href="Julia%20Ward%20Howe">Julia Ward Howe</a>. A <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> to Fuller and Ossoli, under which Angelino is buried, is in <a href="Mount%20Auburn%20Cemetery">Mount Auburn Cemetery</a>, Cambridge, Massachusetts. The inscription reads, in part:

Within a week after her death, Horace Greeley suggested to Emerson that a biography of Fuller, to be called "Margaret and Her Friends", be prepared quickly "before the interest excited by her sad decease has passed away". Many of her writings were soon collected together by her brother <a href="Arthur%20Buckminster%20Fuller">Arthur</a> as "At Home and Abroad" (1856) and "Life Without and Life Within" (1858). He also edited a new version of "Woman in the Nineteenth Century" in 1855. In February 1852, "The Memoirs of Margaret Fuller Ossoli" was published, edited by Emerson, <a href="James%20Freeman%20Clarke">James Freeman Clarke</a>, and <a href="William%20Henry%20Channing">William Henry Channing</a>, though much of the work was censored or reworded. It left out details about her love affair with Ossoli and an earlier relationship with a man named James Nathan. The three editors, believing the public interest in Fuller would be short-lived and that she would not survive as a historical figure, were not concerned about accuracy. For a time, it was the best-selling biography of the decade and went through thirteen editions before the end of the century. The book focused on her personality rather than her work. Detractors of the book ignored her status as a critic and instead criticized her personal life and her "unwomanly" arrogance.

Fuller was an early proponent of feminism and especially believed in providing education to women. Once equal educational rights were afforded women, she believed, women could push for equal political rights as well. She advocated that women seek any employment they wish, rather than catering to the stereotypical "feminine" roles of the time, such as teaching. She once said, "If you ask me what office women should fill, I reply—any ... let them be sea captains if you will. I do not doubt that there are women well fitted for such an office". She had great confidence in all women but doubted that a woman would produce a lasting work of art or literature in her time and disliked the popular female poets of her time. Fuller also warned women to be careful about marriage and not to become dependent on their husbands. As she wrote, "I wish woman to live, "first" for God's sake. Then she will not make an imperfect man for her god and thus sink to idolatry. Then she will not take what is not fit for her from a sense of weakness and poverty". By 1832, she had made a personal commitment to stay single. Fuller also questioned a definitive line between male and female: "There is no wholly masculine man ... no purely feminine" but that both were present in any individual. She suggested also that within a female were two parts: the intellectual side (which she called the <a href="Minerva">Minerva</a>) and the "lyrical" or "Femality" side (the <a href="Muse">Muse</a>). She admired the work of <a href="Emanuel%20Swedenborg">Emanuel Swedenborg</a>, who believed men and women shared "an angelic ministry", as she wrote, as well as <a href="Charles%20Fourier">Charles Fourier</a>, who placed "Woman on an entire equality with Man". Unlike several contemporary women writers, including "<a href="Lydia%20Sigourney">Mrs. Sigourney</a>" and "<a href="Harriet%20Beecher%20Stowe">Mrs. Stowe</a>", she was familiarly referred to in a less formal manner as "Margaret".

Fuller also advocated reform at all levels of society, including prison. In October 1844, she visited <a href="Sing%20Sing">Sing Sing</a> and interviewed the women prisoners, even staying overnight in the facility. Sing Sing was developing a more humane system for its women inmates, many of whom were prostitutes. Fuller was also concerned about the homeless and those living in dire poverty, especially in New York. She also admitted that, though she was raised to believe "that the Indian obstinately refused to be civilized", her travels in the American West made her realize that the white man unfairly treated the Native Americans; she considered Native Americans an important part of American heritage. She also supported the rights of African-Americans, referring to "this cancer of slavery", and suggested that those who were interested in the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolition</a> movement follow the same reasoning when considering the rights of women: "As the friend of the Negro assumes that one man cannot by right hold another in bondage, so should the Friend of Woman assume that Man cannot by right lay even well-meant restrictions on Woman." She suggested that those who spoke against the emancipation of slaves were similar to those who did not support the emancipation of Italy.

Fuller agreed with the transcendental concern for the psychological well-being of the individual, though she was never comfortable being labeled a transcendentalist. Even so, she wrote, if being labeled a transcendentalist means "that I have an active mind frequently busy with large topics I hope it is so". She criticized people such as Emerson, however, for focusing too much on individual improvement and not enough on social reform. Like other members of the so-called <a href="Transcendental%20Club">Transcendental Club</a>, she rebelled against the past and believed in the possibility of change. However, unlike others in the movement, her rebellion was not based on religion. Though Fuller occasionally attended <a href="Unitarianism">Unitarian</a> congregations, she did not entirely identify with that religion. As biographer <a href="Charles%20Capper">Charles Capper</a> has noted, she "was happy to remain on the Unitarian margins."

Margaret Fuller was especially known in her time for her personality and, in particular, for being overly self-confident and having a bad temper. This personality was the inspiration for the character Hester Prynne in <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne's</a> novel "<a href="The%20Scarlet%20Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a>", specifically her radical thinking about "the whole race of womanhood". She may also be the basis for the character Zenobia in another of Hawthorne's works, "<a href="The%20Blithedale%20Romance">The Blithedale Romance</a>". Hawthorne and his then-fiancée <a href="Sophia%20Hawthorne">Sophia</a> had first met Fuller in October 1839.

She was also an inspiration to poet <a href="Walt%20Whitman">Walt Whitman</a>, who believed in her call for the forging of a new national identity and a truly American literature. <a href="Elizabeth%20Barrett%20Browning">Elizabeth Barrett Browning</a> was also a strong admirer, but believed that Fuller's unconventional views were unappreciated in the United States and, therefore, she was better off dead. She also said that Fuller's history of the Roman Republic would have been her greatest work: "The work she was preparing upon Italy would probably have been more equal to her faculty than anything previously produced by her pen (her other writings being curiously inferior to the impressions her conversation gave you)". An 1860 essay collection, "Historical Pictures Retouched", by <a href="Caroline%20Healey%20Dall">Caroline Healey Dall</a>, called Fuller's "Woman in the Nineteenth Century" "doubtless the most brilliant, complete, and scholarly statement ever made on the subject". Despite his personal issues with Fuller, the typically harsh literary critic <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> wrote of the work as "a book which few women in the country could have written, and no woman in the country would have published, with the exception of Miss Fuller", noting its "independence" and "unmitigated radicalism". Thoreau also thought highly of the book, suggesting that its strength came in part from Fuller's conversational ability. As he called it, it was "rich extempore writing, talking with pen in hand".

Another admirer of Fuller was <a href="Susan%20B.%20Anthony">Susan B. Anthony</a>, a pioneer of women's rights, who wrote that Fuller "possessed more influence on the thought of American women than any woman previous to her time". Fuller's work may have partially inspired the <a href="Seneca%20Falls%20Convention">Seneca Falls Convention</a> in 1848. Anthony, along with <a href="Elizabeth%20Cady%20Stanton">Elizabeth Cady Stanton</a> and <a href="Matilda%20Joslyn%20Gage">Matilda Joslyn Gage</a> wrote in their "<a href="History%20of%20Woman%20Suffrage">History of Woman Suffrage</a>" that Fuller "was the precursor of the Women's Rights agitation". Modern scholars have suggested "Woman in the Nineteenth Century" was the first major women's rights work since <a href="Mary%20Wollstonecraft">Mary Wollstonecraft's</a> "<a href="A%20Vindication%20of%20the%20Rights%20of%20Woman">A Vindication of the Rights of Woman</a>" (1792), though an early comparison between the two women came from <a href="George%20Eliot">George Eliot</a> in 1855. It is unclear if Fuller was familiar with Wollstonecraft's works; in her childhood, her father prevented her from reading them. In 1995, Fuller was inducted into the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Women's Hall of Fame</a>.

Fuller, however, was not without her critics. A one-time friend, the English writer <a href="Harriet%20Martineau">Harriet Martineau</a> was one of her harshest detractors after Fuller's death. Martineau said that Fuller was a talker rather than an activist, that she had "shallow conceits" and often "looked down upon persons who acted instead of talking finely ... and despised those who, like myself, could not adopt her scale of valuation". The influential editor <a href="Rufus%20Wilmot%20Griswold">Rufus Wilmot Griswold</a>, who believed she went against his notion of feminine modesty, referred to "Woman in the Nineteenth Century" as "an eloquent expression of her discontent at having been created female". New York writer <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Briggs">Charles Frederick Briggs</a> said that she was "wasting the time of her readers", especially because she was an unmarried woman and therefore could not "truly represent the female character". English writer and critic <a href="Matthew%20Arnold">Matthew Arnold</a> scoffed at Fuller's conversations as well, saying, "My G–d, what rot did she and the other female dogs of Boston talk about Greek mythology!" Sophia Hawthorne, who had previously been a supporter of Fuller, was critical of her after "Woman of the Nineteenth Century" was published:
Fuller had angered fellow poet and critic <a href="James%20Russell%20Lowell">James Russell Lowell</a> when she reviewed his work, calling him "absolutely wanting in the true spirit and tone of poesy ... his verse is <a href="stereotype%20%28printing%29">stereotyped</a>, his thought sounds no depth; and posterity will not remember him." In response, Lowell took revenge in his <a href="satire">satirical</a> "<a href="A%20Fable%20for%20Critics">A Fable for Critics</a>", first published in October 1848. At first, he considered excluding her entirely but ultimately gave her what was called the "most wholly negative characterization" in the work. Referring to her as Miranda, Lowell wrote that she stole old ideas and presented them as her own, she was genuine only in her spite and "when acting as censor, she privately blows a censer of vanity 'neath her own nose".

Shortly after Fuller's death, her importance faded. Her obituary in the newspaper she had once edited, the "Daily Tribune", said that her works had a few great sentiments, "but as a whole they must commend themselves mainly by their vigor of thought and habitual fearlessness rather than freedom of utterance". As biographer Abby Slater wrote, "Margaret had been demoted from a position of importance in her own right to one in which her only importance was in the company she kept". Years later, Hawthorne's son <a href="Julian%20Hawthorne">Julian</a> wrote, "The majority of readers will, I think, not be inconsolable that poor Margaret Fuller has at last taken her place with the numberless other dismal frauds who fill the limbo of human pretension and failure." In the twentieth century, American writer <a href="Elizabeth%20Hardwick%20%28writer%29">Elizabeth Hardwick</a>, former wife of <a href="Robert%20Lowell">Robert Lowell</a>, wrote an essay called "The Genius of Margaret Fuller" (1986). She compared her own move from Boston to New York to Fuller's, saying that Boston was not a good place for intellectuals, despite the assumption that it was the best place for intellectuals.

In 1995, Fuller was inducted into the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Women's Hall of Fame</a>.

On June 21, 2016, a historical marker in honor of Fuller was placed in <a href="Polhill%20Park">Polhill Park</a> in <a href="Beacon%2C%20New%20York">Beacon, NY</a>, to commemorate her staying at Van Vliet boarding house. For the dedication ceremony, Fuller's poem, "Truth and Form," was set to music by Debra Kaye and performed by singer, Kelly Ellenwood.

Order of the Bath

The Most Honourable Order of the Bath (formerly the Most Honourable Military Order of the Bath) is a British <a href="order%20of%20chivalry">order of chivalry</a> founded by <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a> on 18 May 1725. The name derives from the elaborate <a href="medieval">medieval</a> ceremony for appointing a <a href="knight">knight</a>, which involved <a href="bathing">bathing</a> (as a symbol of purification) as one of its elements. The knights so created were known as "Knights of the Bath". George I "erected the Knights of the Bath into a regular Military Order". He did not (as is commonly believed) revive the Order of the Bath, since it had never previously existed as an Order, in the sense of a body of knights who were governed by a set of statutes and whose numbers were replenished when vacancies occurred.

The Order consists of the Sovereign (currently <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>), the (currently <a href="Charles%2C%20Prince%20of%20Wales">The Prince of Wales</a>), and three Classes of members:
Members belong to either the Civil or the Military Division. Prior to 1815, the order had only a single class, Knight Companion (KB), which no longer exists. Recipients of the Order are now usually senior military officers or senior civil servants. Commonwealth citizens who are not subjects of the Queen and foreign nationals may be made Honorary Members.

The Order of the Bath is the fourth-most senior of the <a href="British%20honours%20system%23Current%20orders%20of%20chivalry">British Orders of Chivalry</a>, after <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Garter">The Most Noble Order of the Garter</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Thistle">The Most Ancient and Most Noble Order of the Thistle</a>, and <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Patrick">The Most Illustrious Order of St Patrick</a> (dormant).

In the <a href="Middle%20Ages">Middle Ages</a>, knighthood was often conferred with elaborate ceremonies. These usually involved the knight-to-be taking a bath (possibly symbolic of spiritual purification) during which he was instructed in the duties of <a href="knighthood">knighthood</a> by more senior <a href="knight">knight</a>s. He was then put to bed to dry. Clothed in a special robe, he was led with music to the <a href="chapel">chapel</a> where he spent the night in a <a href="vigil">vigil</a>. At dawn he made <a href="Confession%20%28religion%29">confession</a> and attended <a href="Mass%20%28liturgy%29">Mass</a>, then retired to his bed to sleep until it was fully daylight. He was then brought before the <a href="King">King</a>, who after instructing two senior knights to buckle the <a href="spur">spur</a>s to the knight-elect's heels, fastened a belt around his waist, then struck him on the neck (with either a hand or a <a href="sword">sword</a>), thus making him a knight. It was this <a href="accolade">accolade</a> which was the essential act in creating a knight, and a simpler ceremony developed, conferring knighthood merely by striking or touching the knight-to-be on the shoulder with a sword, or "dubbing" him, as is still done today. In the early <a href="medieval">medieval</a> period the difference seems to have been that the full ceremonies were used for men from more prominent families.
From the <a href="coronation">coronation</a> of <a href="Henry%20IV%20of%20England">Henry IV</a> in 1399 the full ceremonies were restricted to major royal occasions such as <a href="coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">coronations</a>, investitures of the <a href="Prince%20of%20Wales">Prince of Wales</a> or <a href="Royal%20duke">Royal duke</a>s, and royal weddings, and the knights so created became known as "Knights of the Bath". <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knights Bachelor</a> continued to be created with the simpler form of ceremony. The last occasion on which Knights of the Bath were created was the coronation of <a href="Charles%20II%20of%20England">Charles II</a> in 1661.

From at least 1625, and possibly from the reign of <a href="James%20VI%20and%20I">James I</a>, Knights of the Bath were using the motto "Tria juncta in uno" (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> for "Three joined in one"), and wearing as a badge three crowns within a plain gold oval. These were both subsequently adopted by the Order of the Bath; a similar design of badge is still worn by members of the Civil Division. Their symbolism however is not entirely clear. The 'three joined in one' may be a reference to the kingdoms of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20England">England</a>, <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Scotland">Scotland</a> and either <a href="Kingdom%20of%20France">France</a> or <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Ireland">Ireland</a>, which were held (or claimed in the case of France) by English and, later, British monarchs. This would correspond to the three crowns in the badge. Another explanation of the motto is that it refers to the <a href="Holy%20Trinity">Holy Trinity</a>. Nicolas quotes a source (although he is sceptical of it) who claims that prior to James I the motto was "Tria numina juncta in uno" (three powers/gods joined in one), but from the reign of James I the word "numina" was dropped and the motto understood to mean "Tria [regna] juncta in uno" (three kingdoms joined in one).

The prime mover in the establishment of the Order of the Bath was <a href="John%20Anstis">John Anstis</a>, <a href="Garter%20Principal%20King%20of%20Arms">Garter King of Arms</a>, England's highest <a href="heraldry">heraldic</a> officer. <a href="Anthony%20Wagner">Sir Anthony Wagner</a>, a recent holder of the office of Garter, wrote of Anstis's motivations:

It was Martin Leake's opinion that the trouble and opposition Anstis met with in establishing himself as Garter so embittered him against the <a href="herald">herald</a>s that when at last in 1718 he succeeded, he made it his prime object to aggrandise himself and his office at their expense. It is clear at least that he set out to make himself indispensable to the <a href="Earl%20Marshal">Earl Marshal</a>, which was not hard, their political principles being congruous and their friendship already established, but also to <a href="Sir%20Robert%20Walpole">Sir Robert Walpole</a> and the <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> ministry, which can by no means have been easy, considering his known attachment to the <a href="Pretender">Pretender</a> and the circumstances under which he came into office ... The main object of Anstis's next move, the revival or institution of the Order of the Bath was probably that which it in fact secured, of ingratiating him with the all-powerful <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Great%20Britain">Prime Minister</a> Sir Robert Walpole.

The use of honours in the early eighteenth century differed considerably from the modern <a href="British%20honours%20system">honours system</a> in which hundreds, if not thousands, of people each year receive honours on the basis of deserving accomplishments. The only honours available at that time were hereditary (not life) <a href="peerage">peerage</a>s and <a href="baronet">baronet</a>cies, <a href="knighthoods">knighthoods</a> and the Order of the Garter (or the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Thistle">Order of the Thistle</a> for Scots), none of which were awarded in large numbers (the Garter and the Thistle are limited to 24 and 16 living members respectively.) The political environment was also significantly different from today:

The Sovereign still exercised a power to be reckoned with in the eighteenth century. The Court remained the centre of the political world. The King was limited in that he had to choose Ministers who could command a majority in <a href="Parliament%20of%20Great%20Britain">Parliament</a>, but the choice remained his. The leader of an administration still had to command the King's personal confidence and approval. A strong following in Parliament depended on being able to supply places, pensions, and other marks of Royal favour to the government's supporters.

The attraction of the new Order for Walpole was that it would provide a source of such favours to strengthen his political position. He made sure that most of the 36 new honorees were peers and MPs who would provide him with useful connections. George I having agreed to Walpole's proposal, Anstis was commissioned to draft statutes for the Order of the Bath. As noted above, he adopted the motto and badge used by the Knights of the Bath, as well as the colour of the riband and mantle, and the ceremony for creating a knight. The rest of the statutes were mostly based on those of the Order of the Garter, of which he was an officer (as Garter King of Arms). The Order was founded by <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> under the <a href="Great%20Seal%20of%20the%20Realm">Great Seal</a> dated 18 May 1725, and the statutes issued the following week.

The Order initially consisted of the Sovereign, a Prince of the blood Royal as Principal Knight, a Great Master and thirty-five Knights Companion. Seven officers (see below) were attached to the Order. These provided yet another opportunity for political patronage, as they were to be <a href="sinecure">sinecure</a>s at the disposal of the Great Master, supported by fees from the knights. Despite the fact that the Bath was represented as a military Order, only a few military officers were among the initial appointments (see <a href="List%20of%20Knights%20Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">List of Knights Companion of the Order of the Bath</a>). They may be broken down into categories as follows (note that some are classified in more than one category):

The majority of the new Knights Companions were knighted by the King and invested with their ribands and badges on 27 May 1725. Although the statutes set out the full medieval ceremony which was to be used for creating knights, this was not performed, and indeed was possibly never intended to be, as the original statutes contained a provision allowing the Great Master to dispense Knights Companion from these requirements. The original knights were dispensed from all the medieval ceremonies with the exception of the Installation, which was performed in the Order's Chapel, the <a href="Henry%20VII%20Lady%20Chapel">Henry VII Chapel</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>, on 17 June. This precedent was followed until 1812, after which the Installation was also dispensed with, until its revival in the twentieth century. The ceremonies however remained part of the Statutes until 1847.

Although the initial appointments to the Order were largely political, from the 1770s appointments to the Order were increasingly made for naval, military or diplomatic achievements. This is partly due to the conflicts Britain was engaged in over this period. The <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a> resulted in so many deserving candidates for the Bath that a statute was issued allowing the appointment of "Extra Knights" in time of war, who were to be additional to the numerical limits imposed by the statutes, and whose number was not subject to any restrictions. Another statute, this one issued some 80 years earlier, had also added a military note to the Order. Each knight was required, under certain circumstances, to supply and support four men-at-arms for a period not exceeding 42 days in any year, to serve in any part of Great Britain. This company was to be captained by the Great Master, who had to supply four trumpeters, and was also to appoint eight officers for this body, however the statute was never invoked.

In January 1815, after the end of the <a href="Peninsular%20War">Peninsular War</a>, the Prince Regent (later <a href="George%20IV%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">George IV</a>) expanded the Order of the Bath "to the end that those Officers who have had the opportunities of signalising themselves by eminent services during the late war may share in the honours of the said Order, and that their names may be delivered down to remote posterity, accompanied by the marks of distinction which they have so nobly earned."

The Order was now to consist of three classes: Knights Grand Cross, Knights Commander, and Companions. The existing Knights Companion (of which there were 60) became Knight Grand Cross; this class was limited to 72 members, of which twelve could be appointed for civil or diplomatic services. The military members had to be of the rank of at least Major-General or Rear Admiral. The Knights Commander were limited to 180, exclusive of foreign nationals holding British commissions, up to ten of whom could be appointed as honorary Knights Commander. They had to be of the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel or <a href="Post-Captain">Post-Captain</a>. The number of Companions was not specified, but they had to have received a medal or been mentioned in despatches since the start of the war in 1803. A list of about 500 names was subsequently published. Two further officers were appointed, an "Officer of arms attendant on the Knights Commanders and Companions", and a "Secretary appertaining to the Knights Commanders and Companions" The large increase in numbers caused some complaints that such an expansion would reduce the prestige of the Order.

In 1847, <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> issued new statutes eliminating all references to an exclusively military Order. As well as removing the word 'Military' from the full name of the Order, this opened up the grades of Knight Commander and Companion to civil appointments, and the Military and Civil Divisions of the Order were established. New numerical limits were imposed, and the opportunity also taken to regularise the 1815 expansion of the Order. The 1847 statutes also abolished all the medieval ritual, however they did introduce a formal Investiture ceremony, conducted by the Sovereign wearing the Mantle and insignia of the Order, attended by the Officers and as many GCBs as possible, in their Mantles.

In 1859 a further edition of the Statutes was issued; the changes related mainly to the costs associated with the Order. Prior to this date it had been the policy that the insignia (which were provided by the Crown) were to be returned on the death of the holder; the exception had been foreigners who had been awarded honorary membership. In addition foreigners had usually been provided with stars made of silver and diamonds, whereas ordinary members had only embroidered stars. The decision was made to award silver stars to all members, and only require the return of the Collar. The Crown had also been paying the fees due to the officers of the Order for members who had been appointed for the services in the recent war. The fees were abolished and replaced with a salary of approximately the same average value. The offices of Genealogist and Messenger were abolished, and those of Registrar and Secretary combined.

In 1910, after his accession to the throne, <a href="George%20V%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">George V</a> ordered the revival of the Installation ceremony, perhaps prompted by the first Installation ceremony of the more junior <a href="Order%20of%20St%20Michael%20and%20St%20George">Order of St Michael and St George</a>, held a few years earlier, and the building of a new chapel for the Order of the Thistle in 1911. The Installation ceremony took place on 22 July 1913 in the <a href="Henry%20VII%20Chapel">Henry VII Chapel</a>, and Installations have been held at regular intervals since.

Prior to the 1913 Installation it was necessary to adapt the chapel to accommodate the larger number of members. An appeal was made to the members of the Order, and following the Installation a surplus remained. A Committee was formed from the Officers to administer the 'Bath Chapel Fund', and over time this committee has come to consider other matters than purely financial ones.

Another revision of the statutes of the Order was undertaken in 1925, to consolidate the 41 additional statutes which had been issued since the 1859 revision.

Women were admitted to the Order in 1971. In the 1971 New Year Honours, <a href="Jean%20Nunn">Jean Nunn</a> became the first woman admitted to the order. In 1975, <a href="Princess%20Alice%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Gloucester">Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester</a>, an aunt of <a href="Elizabeth%20II">Elizabeth II</a>, became the first (and to date only) woman to reach the highest rank, Dame Grand Cross. Princess Alice (née Douglas-Montagu-Scott) was a direct descendant of the Order's first Great Master, and her husband, who had died the previous year, had also held that office.

The <a href="British%20monarchy">British Sovereign</a> is the Sovereign of the Order of the Bath.
As with all honours except those in the Sovereign's personal gift, the Sovereign makes all appointments to the Order on the advice of the Government.

The next-most senior member of the Order is the Great Master, of which there have been nine:

Originally a Prince of the Blood Royal, as the Principal Knight Companion, ranked next after the sovereign. This position was joined to that of the Great Master in the statutes of 1847. The Great Master and Principal Knight is now either a descendant of George I or "some other exalted personage"; the holder of the office has custody of the seal of the order and is responsible for enforcing the statutes.

The statutes also provide for the following:


Regular membership is limited to citizens of the United Kingdom and of other Commonwealth countries of which the Queen is Sovereign. Appointees are usually officers of the armed forces or senior civil servants, such as permanent secretaries.

Members appointed to the Civil Division must "by their personal services to [the] crown or by the performance of public duties have merited ... royal favour." Appointments to the Military Division are restricted by the minimum rank of the individual. GCBs hold the rank of <a href="Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">Admiral</a> in the Royal Navy, <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> or <a href="Royal%20Marines">Royal Marines</a>, or <a href="Air%20Chief%20Marshal">Air Chief Marshal</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Air%20Force">Royal Air Force</a>. KCBs must at least hold the rank of <a href="Vice%20Admiral%20%28Royal%20Navy%29">vice admiral</a>, <a href="Lieutenant%20General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant general</a> in the Army or Marines, or <a href="Air%20Marshal">Air Marshal</a>. CBs tend be of the rank of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a>, <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> in the Army, Royal Navy or Royal Marines, or <a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> in the Royal Air Force, and in addition must have been <a href="Mentioned%20in%20Despatches">Mentioned in Despatches</a> for distinction in a command position in a combat situation, although the latter is no longer a requirement. Non-line officers (e.g. engineers, medics) may be appointed only for meritorious service in wartime.

Commonwealth citizens not subjects of the Queen and foreigners may be made Honorary Members. Queen Elizabeth II has established the custom of awarding an honorary GCB to visiting (republican) heads of state, for example <a href="Gustav%20Heinemann">Gustav Heinemann</a> and <a href="Josip%20Broz%20Tito">Josip Broz Tito</a> (in 1972), <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Ronald Reagan</a> (in 1989), <a href="Lech%20Wa%C5%82%C4%99sa">Lech Wałęsa</a> (in 1991), <a href="Censu%20Tabone">Censu Tabone</a>, <a href="President%20of%20Malta">President of Malta</a>, in 1992, <a href="Fernando%20Henrique%20Cardoso">Fernando Henrique Cardoso</a>, <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H.

Honorary members do not count towards the numerical limits in each class. In addition the statutes allow the Sovereign to exceed the limits in time of war or other exceptional circumstances.

The Order of the Bath now has six officers:

The office of Dean is held by the <a href="Dean%20of%20Westminster">Dean of Westminster</a>. The King of Arms, responsible for <a href="heraldry">heraldry</a>, is known as Bath King of Arms; he is not, however, a member of the <a href="College%20of%20Arms">College of Arms</a>, like many heralds. The Order's Usher is known as the Gentleman Usher of the Scarlet Rod; he does not, unlike his Order of the Garter equivalent (the <a href="Black%20Rod">Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod</a>) perform any duties in the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>.

There were originally seven officers, each of whom was to receive fees from the Knights Companion both on appointment and annually thereafter. The office of Messenger was abolished in 1859. The office of Genealogist was abolished at the same time, but revived in 1913. The offices of Registrar and Secretary were formally merged in 1859, although the two positions had been held concurrently for the previous century. An Officer of Arms and a Secretary for the Knights Commander and Companions were established in 1815, but abolished in 1847. The office of Deputy Secretary was created in 1925.

Under the Hanoverian kings certain of the officers also held heraldic office. The office of <a href="Blanc%20Coursier%20Herald">Blanc Coursier Herald of Arms</a> was attached to that of the Genealogist, Brunswick Herald of Arms to the Gentleman Usher, and Bath King of Arms was also made Gloucester King of Arms with heraldic jurisdiction over Wales. This was the result of a move by Anstis to give the holders of these sinecures greater security; the offices of the Order of the Bath were held at the pleasure of the Great Master, while appointments to the heraldic offices were made by the King under the Great Seal and were for life.

Members of the Order wear elaborate costumes on important occasions (such as its quadrennial installation ceremonies and <a href="coronation%20of%20the%20British%20monarch">coronations</a>), which vary by rank:

The "mantle", worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross, is made of crimson <a href="satin">satin</a> lined with white <a href="taffeta">taffeta</a>. On the left side is a representation of the star (see below). The mantle is bound with two large tassels.

The "hat", worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights and Dames Commander, is made of black <a href="velvet">velvet</a>; it includes an upright plume of <a href="feather">feather</a>s.

The "collar", worn only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross, is made of gold and weighs 30 <a href="troy%20ounce">troy ounce</a>s (933 g). It consists of depictions of nine imperial crowns and eight sets of flowers (<a href="rose">rose</a>s for England, <a href="thistle">thistle</a>s for Scotland and <a href="shamrock">shamrock</a>s for Ireland), connected by seventeen silver knots.

On lesser occasions, simpler insignia are used:
The "star" is used only by Knights and Dames Grand Cross and Knights and Dames Commander. Its style varies by rank and division; it is worn pinned to the left breast:

The star for "military Knights and Dames Grand Cross" consists of a <a href="Maltese%20Cross%20%28symbol%29">Maltese Cross</a> on top of an eight-pointed silver star; the star for "military Knights and Dames Commander" is an eight-pointed silver cross pattée. Each bears in the centre three crowns surrounded by a red ring bearing the motto of the Order in gold letters. The circle is flanked by two laurel branches and is above a scroll bearing the words "Ich dien" (older German for "I serve") in gold letters.

The star for "civil Knights and Dames Grand Cross" consists of an eight-pointed silver star, "without" the Maltese cross; the star for "civil Knights and Dames Commander" is an eight-pointed silver cross pattée. The design of each is the same as the design of the military stars, except that the laurel branches and the words "Ich dien" are excluded.

The "badge" varies in design, size and manner of wearing by rank and division. The Knight and Dame Grand Cross' badge is larger than the Knight and Dame Commander's badge, which is in turn larger than the Companion's badge; however, these are all suspended on a crimson ribbon. Knights and Dames Grand Cross wear the badge on a riband or sash, passing from the right shoulder to the left hip. Knights Commander and male Companions wear the badge from a ribbon worn around the neck. Dames Commander and female Companions wear the badge from a bow on the left side:

The "military badge" is a gold Maltese Cross of eight points, enamelled in white. Each point of the cross is decorated by a small gold ball; each angle has a small figure of a lion. The centre of the cross bears three crowns on the obverse side, and a rose, a <a href="thistle">thistle</a> and a <a href="shamrock">shamrock</a>, emanating from a <a href="sceptre">sceptre</a> on the reverse side. Both emblems are surrounded by a red circular ring bearing the motto of the Order, which are in turn flanked by two laurel branches, above a scroll bearing the words "Ich dien" in gold letters.

The "civil badge" is a plain gold oval, bearing three crowns on the obverse side, and a rose, a <a href="thistle">thistle</a> and a <a href="shamrock">shamrock</a>, emanating from a <a href="sceptre">sceptre</a> on the reverse side; both emblems are surrounded by a ring bearing the motto of the Order.

On certain "<a href="collar%20day">collar day</a>s" designated by the Sovereign, members attending formal events may wear the Order's collar over their military uniform or eveningwear. When collars are worn (either on collar days or on formal occasions such as coronations), the badge is suspended from the collar.

The collars and badges of Knights and Dames Grand Cross are returned to the <a href="Central%20Chancery%20of%20the%20Orders%20of%20Knighthood">Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood</a> upon the decease of their owners. All other insignia may be retained by their owners.

The Chapel of the Order is the <a href="Henry%20VII%20Lady%20Chapel">Henry VII Lady Chapel</a> in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Every four years, an installation ceremony, presided over by the Great Master, and a religious service are held in the Chapel; the Sovereign attends every alternate ceremony. The last such service was Thursday, 24 May 2018, in the Order's 293rd year, and was presided over by the Prince of Wales The Sovereign and each knight who has been installed is allotted a stall in the <a href="Cathedral%20diagram">choir</a> of the chapel.

As there are a limited number of stalls in the Chapel, only the most senior Knights and Dames Grand Cross are installed. A stall made vacant by the death of a military Knight Grand Cross is offered to the next most senior uninstalled military GCB, and similarly for vacancies among civil GCBs. Waits between admission to the Order and installation may be very long; for instance, <a href="David%20Craig%2C%20Baron%20Craig%20of%20Radley">Marshal of the Air Force Lord Craig of Radley</a> was created a Knight Grand Cross in 1984, but was not installed until 2006.

Above each stall, the occupant's heraldic devices are displayed. Perched on the pinnacle of a knight's stall is his helm, decorated with a mantling and topped by his crest. Under English heraldic law, women other than monarchs do not bear helms or crests; instead, the <a href="coronet">coronet</a> appropriate to the dame's rank (if she is a peer or member of the Royal family) is used.

Above the crest or coronet, the knight's or dame's heraldic <a href="banner">banner</a> is hung, emblazoned with his or her <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a>. At a considerably smaller scale, to the back of the stall is affixed a piece of <a href="brass">brass</a> (a "stall plate") displaying its occupant's name, arms and date of admission into the Order.

Upon the death of a Knight, the banner, helm, mantling and crest (or coronet or crown) are taken down. The stall plates, however, are not removed; rather, they remain permanently affixed somewhere about the stall, so that the stalls of the chapel are festooned with a colourful record of the Order's Knights (and now Dames) throughout history.

When the grade of Knight Commander was established in 1815 the regulations specified that they too should have a banner and stall plate affixed in the chapel. This was never implemented (despite some of the KCBs paying the appropriate fees) primarily due to lack of space, although the 1847 statutes allow all three classes to request the erection of a plate in the chapel bearing the member's name, date of nomination, and (for the two higher classes) optionally the coat of arms.

Members of the Order of the Bath are assigned positions in the order of precedence. Wives of male members also feature on the order of precedence, as do sons, daughters and daughters-in-law of Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander; relatives of female members, however, are not assigned any special precedence. Generally, individuals can derive precedence from their fathers or husbands, but not from their mothers or wives. (See <a href="order%20of%20precedence%20in%20England%20and%20Wales">order of precedence in England and Wales</a> for the exact positions.)

Knights Grand Cross and Knights Commander prefix "Sir", and Dames Grand Cross and Dames Commander prefix "Dame", to their forenames. Wives of Knights may prefix "Lady" to their surnames, but no equivalent privilege exists for husbands of Dames. Such forms are not used by peers and princes, except when the names of the former are written out in their fullest forms. Furthermore, honorary foreign members and clergymen do not receive the accolade of knighthood, and so are not entitled to the prefix "Sir", unless the former subsequently become Commonwealth citizens.

Knights and Dames Grand Cross use the <a href="list%20of%20post-nominal%20letters">post-nominal</a> "GCB"; Knights Commander use "KCB"; Dames Commander use "DCB"; Companions use "CB".

Knights and Dames Grand Cross are also entitled to receive heraldic supporters. Furthermore, they may encircle their arms with a depiction of the circlet (a red circle bearing the motto) with the badge pendant thereto and the collar; the former is shown either outside or on top of the latter.

Knights and Dames Commander and Companions may display the circlet, but not the collar, around their arms. The badge is depicted suspended from the collar or circlet. Members of the Military division may encompass the circlet with "two laurel branches issuant from an escrol azure inscribed "Ich dien"", as appears on the badge. Members of the Order of the Bath and their children are able to be married in Westminster Abbey in London.

It is possible for membership in the Order to be revoked. Under the 1725 statutes the grounds for this were heresy, high treason, or fleeing from battle out of cowardice. Knights Companion could in such cases be degraded at the next Chapter meeting. It was then the duty of the Gentleman Usher to "pluck down the escocheon [i.e. stallplate] of such knight and spurn it out of the chapel" with "all the usual marks of infamy".

Only two people were ever degraded – <a href="Thomas%20Cochrane%2C%2010th%20Earl%20of%20Dundonald">Lord Cochrane</a> in 1813 and <a href="Sir%20Eyre%20Coote%2C%20GCB">General Sir Eyre Coote</a> in 1816, both for political reasons, rather than any of the grounds given in the statute. Lord Cochrane was subsequently reinstated, but Coote died a few years after his degradation.

Under Queen Victoria's 1847 statutes a member "convicted of treason, cowardice, felony, or any infamous crime derogatory to his honour as a knight or gentleman, or accused and does not submit to trial in a reasonable time, shall be degraded from the Order by a special ordinance signed by the sovereign". The Sovereign was to be the sole judge, and also had the power to restore such members.

The situation today is that membership may be cancelled or annulled, and the entry in the register erased, by an ordinance signed by the Sovereign and sealed with the seal of the Order, on the recommendation of the appropriate Minister. Such cancellations may be subsequently reversed.

In 1923 the Italian dictator <a href="Benito%20Mussolini">Benito Mussolini</a> was made an honorary Knight Grand Cross, by King George V. Mussolini was stripped of his GCB in 1940, after he had declared war on the UK.

<a href="William%20Pottinger">William Pottinger</a>, a senior civil servant, lost both his status of CB and <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Royal%20Victorian%20Order">Commander of the Royal Victorian Order</a> (CVO) in 1975 when he was gaoled for corruptly receiving gifts from the architect <a href="John%20Poulson">John Poulson</a>.

Romanian president <a href="Nicolae%20Ceau%C5%9Fescu">Nicolae Ceauşescu</a> was stripped of his honorary GCB status by Queen Elizabeth II on 24 December 1989, the day before his execution. <a href="Robert%20Mugabe">Robert Mugabe</a>, the <a href="President%20of%20Zimbabwe">President of Zimbabwe</a>, was stripped of his honorary GCB status by the Queen, on the advice of the <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Foreign%20and%20Commonwealth%20Affairs">Foreign Secretary</a>, <a href="David%20Miliband">David Miliband</a>, on 25 June 2008 "as a mark of revulsion at the abuse of human rights and abject disregard for the democratic process in <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a> over which President Mugabe has presided."

<a href="Vicky%20Pryce">Vicky Pryce</a>, former wife of <a href="Chris%20Huhne">Chris Huhne</a>, was stripped of her CB by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 July 2013, following her conviction for perverting the course of justice.

Queen Elizabeth Way

The Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) is a <a href="400-series%20highways">400-series highway</a> in the Canadian province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a> linking <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> with the <a href="Niagara%20Peninsula">Niagara Peninsula</a> and <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. The <a href="freeway">freeway</a> begins at the <a href="Peace%20Bridge">Peace Bridge</a> in <a href="Fort%20Erie%2C%20Ontario">Fort Erie</a> and travels around the western shore of <a href="Lake%20Ontario">Lake Ontario</a>, ending at <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20427">Highway 427</a>. The physical highway, however, continues as the <a href="Gardiner%20Expressway">Gardiner Expressway</a> into <a href="downtown%20Toronto">downtown Toronto</a>. The QEW is one of Ontario's busiest highways, with an average of close to 200,000 vehicles per day on some sections. Major highway junctions are at <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20420">Highway 420</a> in <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara Falls</a>, <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20405">Highway 405</a> in <a href="Niagara-On-The-Lake%2C%20Ontario">Niagara-on-the-Lake</a>, <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20406">Highway 406</a> in <a href="St.%20Catharines">St. Catharines</a>, the <a href="Red%20Hill%20Valley%20Parkway">Red Hill Valley Parkway</a> in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton</a>, <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20403">Highway 403</a> and <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20407">Highway 407</a> in <a href="Burlington%2C%20Ontario">Burlington</a>, Highway 403 at the <a href="Oakville%2C%20Ontario">Oakville</a>–<a href="Mississauga">Mississauga</a> boundary, and Highway 427 in <a href="Etobicoke">Etobicoke</a>. Within the <a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Halton">Regional Municipality of Halton</a>, between its two junctions with Highway 403, the QEW is signed <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrently</a> with Highway 403.

The history of the QEW dates back to 1931, when work began to widen <a href="the%20Middle%20Road">the Middle Road</a> in a similar fashion to the nearby <a href="Ontario%20Highway%205">Dundas Highway</a> and <a href="Lakeshore%20Road">Lakeshore Road</a> as a relief project during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. Following the <a href="Ontario%20general%20election%2C%201934">1934 provincial election</a>, Ontario Minister of Highways <a href="Thomas%20McQuesten">Thomas McQuesten</a> and his deputy minister <a href="Robert%20Melville%20Smith">Robert Melville Smith</a> changed the design to be similar to the <a href="autobahn">autobahn</a>s of Germany, dividing the opposite directions of travel and using <a href="grade-separated">grade-separated</a> interchanges at major crossroads. When opened to traffic in 1937, it was the first intercity divided highway in <a href="North%20America">North America</a> and featured the longest stretch of consistent illumination in the world. While not a true freeway at the time, it was gradually upgraded, widened, and modernized beginning in the 1950s, more or less taking on its current form by 1975. Since then, various projects have continued to widen the route. In 1997, the provincial government turned over the responsibility for the section of the QEW between Highway 427 and the <a href="Humber%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Humber River</a> to the City of Toronto. This section was subsequently redesignated as part of the Gardiner Expressway.
The Queen Elizabeth Way was named for the wife of <a href="George%20VI">King George VI</a> who would later become known as <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother</a>. It is sometimes referred to as the Queen E.
In 1939, the royal couple <a href="1939%20royal%20tour%20of%20Canada">toured Canada and the United States</a> in part to bolster support for the United Kingdom in anticipation of war with <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, and also to mark George VI's coronation. The highway received its name to commemorate the visit; it was unveiled on June 7 as the King and Queen ceremonially opened the highway at a site near the <a href="Henley%20Bridge%20%28Ontario%29">Henley Bridge</a> in St. Catharines. Originally, the highway featured stylized light standards with the letters ""ER"", the <a href="Royal%20Cypher">Royal Cypher</a> for "Elizabeth Regina", the Latin equivalent to "Queen Elizabeth." While mostly removed, they remain on three bridges along the highway: in Mississauga over the <a href="Credit%20River">Credit River</a>, in Oakville over <a href="Bronte%20Creek">Bronte Creek</a>, and in St. Catharines over <a href="Twelve%20Mile%20Creek%20%28Ontario%29">Twelve Mile Creek</a>. A short section of Highway 420 in Niagara Falls and its extension, Falls Avenue, had replicas of these light standards installed in 2002.

The <a href="reassurance%20marker">markers</a> identifying the QEW have always used blue lettering on a yellow background instead of the black-on-white scheme other provincial highway markers use. They originally showed the highway's full name only in small letters, with the large script letters "ER" placed where the highway number is on other signs. In 1955, these were changed to the current design, with the lettering "QEW." Although the QEW has no posted highway number, it is considered to be part of the Province of Ontario's 400-series highway network.
The Ministry of Transportation of Ontario designates the QEW as Highway 451 for internal, administrative purposes.

A <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20Way%20Monument">monument</a> was originally in the <a href="Median%20strip">highway median</a> at the Toronto terminus of the highway, dedicated to the 1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and known as the "Lucky Lion." The column, with a crown at the top and a lion at the base, was designed by <a href="William%20Lyon%20Somerville">W. L. Somerville</a> and sculptors <a href="Frances%20Loring">Frances Loring</a> and <a href="Florence%20Wyle">Florence Wyle</a> for $12,000 (equivalent to $ in ). The monument was removed in 1972 in order to accommodate widening of the original QEW, and relocated in August 1975 to the nearby Sir <a href="Casimir%20Gzowski">Casimir Gzowski</a> Park along Lake Ontario, on the east side of the Humber River.

The QEW is a route that travels from the Peace Bridge – which connects Fort Erie with Buffalo, New York – to Toronto, the economic hub of the province. The freeway circles the western lakehead of Lake Ontario, cutting through Niagara Falls, St. Catharines, Hamilton, Burlington, Oakville, and Mississauga en route. A portion of the freeway is signed concurrently with <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20403">Highway 403</a>. Unlike other provincial highways in Ontario, the QEW is directionally signed using locations along the route as opposed to <a href="cardinal%20direction">cardinal direction</a>s. Driving towards Toronto, the route is signed as "QEW Toronto" throughout its length. In the opposing direction, it is signed as "QEW Hamilton," "QEW Niagara," and "QEW Fort Erie" depending on the location.

The Queen Elizabeth Way begins at the foot of the Peace Bridge, which crosses the United States border and connects with <a href="Interstate%20190%20%28New%20York%29">I-190</a> in Buffalo, New York. A customs booth is between the bridge and the freeway, beyond which a toll is charged to Canada-bound drivers. West of there, access is provided to nearby <a href="Ontario%20Highway%203">Highway 3</a> and the <a href="Niagara%20Parkway">Niagara Parkway</a>. Through customs, the freeway proper begins, immediately curving northwest. Within Fort Erie, interchanges provide access to and from the QEW at Central Avenue, Concession Road, Thompson Road, Gilmore Road, and Bowen Road. While there is some urban development at the beginning of the freeway, the majority of the first are within lowland forests. Numerous creeks flow through these forests, often flooding them. The Willoughby Marsh Conservation Area lies southwest of the freeway, approximately south of Niagara Falls. After an interchange with Lyons Creek Road, the freeway turns northward.

After crossing the <a href="Welland%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Welland River</a>, the original route of the <a href="First%20Welland%20Canal">Welland Canal</a>, the freeway exits the forests and enters agricultural land surrounding the suburbs of Niagara Falls, which the highway enters north of the McLeod Road interchange. Within the city, <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20420">Highway 420</a> meets the QEW at a large <a href="stack%20interchange">stack interchange</a>, which replaced the former Lundy's Lane / <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2020">Highway 20</a> interchange. Exiting the northern fringe of Niagara Falls, the freeway again curves northwest and begins to descend through the <a href="Niagara%20Escarpment">Niagara Escarpment</a>, a <a href="World%20Network%20of%20Biosphere%20Reserves">World Biosphere Reserve</a>. <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20405">Highway 405</a> merges with the QEW along the short rural stretch between Niagara Falls and St. Catharines. While there is no Toronto-bound access to Highway 405, Niagara-bound drivers can follow this short freeway to the <a href="Lewiston%E2%80%93Queenston%20Bridge">Lewiston–Queenston Bridge</a>, which crosses the U.S. border into <a href="Lewiston%2C%20New%20York">Lewiston, New York</a>. The QEW continues west into St. Catharines.

As the Queen Elizabeth Way enters St. Catharines, it ascends the <a href="Garden%20City%20Skyway">Garden City Skyway</a> to cross the <a href="Welland%20Canal">Welland Canal</a>. This structure replaced the <a href="lift%20bridge">lift bridge</a> south of it, one of two major bottlenecks prior to the early 1960s, and is one of two high-level skyways along the route. As the QEW was the first long distance freeway in North America, several modern engineering concepts were not considered, and further expansion of the highway is inhibited by the proximity of properties throughout most of its length. Consequently, most of the route beyond the Welland Canal is wedged between <a href="service%20roads">service roads</a> which provide access to and from the QEW as well as to local businesses and residences. After passing the Ontario Street (Regional Road 42) interchange, the freeway crosses Martindale Pond, which forms the mouth of <a href="Twelve%20Mile%20Creek%20%28Ontario%29">Twelve Mile Creek</a>. West of the crossing is an interchange with Highway 406, which travels south to <a href="Welland">Welland</a>, after which the QEW crosses out of St. Catharines and into the town of <a href="Lincoln%2C%20Ontario">Lincoln</a> at Fifteen Mile Creek.

Throughout Lincoln, the QEW travels along the Lake Ontario shoreline through the Niagara <a href="Fruit%20Belt">Fruit Belt</a>; numerous wineries line the south side of the freeway. Interchanges at Victoria Road (Regional Road 24) and Ontario Street (Regional Road 18) provide access to the communities of <a href="Vineland%2C%20Ontario">Vineland</a> and <a href="Beamsville%2C%20Ontario">Beamsville</a>, respectively. The latter encroaches upon the south side of the QEW, interrupting the otherwise agricultural surroundings of the highway in Lincoln. Immediately east of the Bartlett Avenue interchange, the freeway enters <a href="Grimsby%2C%20Ontario">Grimsby</a>, where it becomes sandwiched between the Niagara Escarpment and Lake Ontario. The route passes under three overpasses that have remained unchanged since the highway was built: Maple Avenue, Ontario Street, and Christie Street, all served by a single <a href="diamond%20interchange">diamond interchange</a>. South of the 50 Point Conservation Area, the freeway exits the <a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Niagara">Niagara Region</a> and enters the city of Hamilton.

Within Hamilton, the highway passes almost entirely within an industrial park, with interchanges at 50 Road, Fruitland Road, and Centennial Parkway (formerly <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2020">Highway 20</a>). The third of these is intertwined with the <a href="Red%20Hill%20Valley%20Parkway">Red Hill Valley Parkway</a> interchange, completed in 2009. From here, the freeway curves northwest onto Burlington Beach and begins to ascend the <a href="Burlington%20Bay%20James%20N.%20Allan%20Skyway">Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway</a>, the second high-level bridge along the route. As it crosses over the entrance to <a href="Hamilton%20Harbour">Hamilton Harbour</a>, the freeway enters the <a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Halton">Regional Municipality of Halton</a> and descends into the city of Burlington.

After descending into Burlington, the QEW crosses former <a href="Ontario%20Highway%202">Highway 2</a> before it encounters the Freeman Interchange, opened in 1958 to allow construction of Highway 403 and expanded in 1999 to accommodate Highway 407. The freeway turns to the east, becoming concurrent with Highway 403 through Burlington and Oakville. The two routes travel straight though a commercial office area. <a href="Frontage%20road">Service roads</a> reappear through this stretch to serve businesses fronting the highway. The segment includes <a href="high-occupancy%20vehicle%20lane">high-occupancy vehicle lane</a>s (HOV lanes), opened in 2011, which required the construction of a second structure over <a href="Sixteen%20Mile%20Creek%20%28Ontario%29">Sixteen Mile Creek</a>. In the eastern end of Oakville, the route curves northeast, passing the <a href="Oakville%20Assembly">Ford Motor Assembly Plant</a>. Highway 403 then diverges north while the QEW turns back to the east, entering Mississauga and the <a href="Regional%20Municipality%20of%20Peel">Peel Region</a>.

Within Mississauga, the freeway encounters its narrowest <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a>, wedged between residential subdivisions on either side that prevent further expansion. It crosses the <a href="Credit%20River">Credit River</a> valley, where a second bridge is under construction. The segment east of the Credit River is being examined for expansion possibilities, but like the previous section, there is little room for more lanes without property acquisition. After crossing <a href="Etobicoke%20Creek">Etobicoke Creek</a>, which forms the boundary between Mississauga / Peel Region and Toronto, the route terminates at a sprawling interchange with Highway 427. The QEW formerly continued beyond this interchange to the <a href="Old%20Toronto">Old Toronto</a> city limits at the <a href="Humber%20River%20%28Ontario%29">Humber River</a>; this section was <a href="Ontario%20highway%20transfers">downloaded</a> from provincial to municipal ownership on April 1, 1997 and became part of the Gardiner Expressway.

As automobile use in southern Ontario grew in the early 20th century, road design and construction advanced significantly. A major issue faced by planners was the improvement of the routes connecting Toronto and Hamilton, which were consistently overburdened by the growing traffic levels.
Following frequent erosion of the former <a href="macadam">macadamized</a> <a href="Lakeshore%20Road">Lakeshore Road</a>,
a cement road known as the "Toronto–Hamilton Highway" was proposed in January 1914.
The highway was designed to run along the lake shore, instead of <a href="Dundas%20Street%20%28Toronto%29">Dundas Street</a> to the north, because the numerous hills encountered along Dundas would have increased costs without improving accessibility. Middle Road, a dirt lane named because of its position between the two, was not considered since Lakeshore and Dundas were both overcrowded and in need of serious repairs. Construction began on November 8, 1914, but dragged on throughout the <a href="World%20War%20I">ongoing war</a>. It was formally opened on November 24, 1917, wide and nearly long. It was the first concrete road in Ontario, as well as one of the longest stretches of concrete road between two cities in the world. Though many minor improvements in alignment were made, the original highway was without modern bridges for the crossings of the Credit River and Bronte, Etobicoke, and Mimico Creeks. Modern concrete arch bridges for all crossings except Bronte Creek were completed in 1919.

Over the next decade, vehicle usage increased substantially, and by 1920 Lakeshore Road was again highly congested on weekends.
In response, the Department of Highways examined improving another road between Toronto and Hamilton. The road was to be more than twice the width of Lakeshore Road at and would carry two lanes of traffic in either direction.
Construction on what was then known as the "Queen Street Extension" west of Toronto began in early 1931 as a Great Depression relief project.

Before the highway could be completed, <a href="Thomas%20McQuesten">Thomas McQuesten</a> was appointed the new minister of the Department of Highways, with Robert Melville Smith as deputy minister, following the <a href="Ontario%20general%20election%2C%201934">1934 provincial elections</a>.
Smith, inspired by the German autobahns—new "dual-lane <a href="divided%20highway">divided highway</a>s"—modified the design for Ontario roads,
and McQuesten ordered that the Middle Road be converted into this new form of highway.
A <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> was purchased along the Middle Road and construction began to convert the existing sections to a divided highway. Work also began on Canada's first interchange at <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2010">Highway 10</a>.

By the end of 1937, the Middle Road was open between Toronto and Burlington, and would soon connect with what was first known as the "Hamilton–Niagara Falls Highway". When it opened, it was the first intercity divided highway in North America
and boasted the longest continuous stretch of illumination in the world until World War II.
It soon came time to name the new highway, and an upcoming visit by King <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> and <a href="Queen%20Elizabeth%20The%20Queen%20Mother">Queen Elizabeth</a> proved to be the focal point for a dedication ceremony. On June 7, 1939, the two royal family members drove along the highway (which now connected to Niagara Falls) and passed through a light beam near the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines. This caused two <a href="Union%20Jack">Union Jack</a>s to swing out, revealing a sign which read "The Queen Elizabeth Way".

However, the ceremony only designated the highway between St. Catharines and Niagara Falls. The remainder of the road was known by various names, including the "Toronto–Burlington/Hamilton Highway" and "The New Middle Road Highway".

McQuesten also foresaw the financial opportunities that came with cross-border tourism and opening the "Ontario frontier" to Americans. In 1937, construction began on a new dual highway along the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment. This route was originally known as the New Niagara Falls Highway, but it was intended to connect with the Middle Road on the opposing shore of Lake Ontario. Work began at the end of March to <a href="grading%20%28engineering%29">grade</a> the route between <a href="Stoney%20Creek%2C%20Ontario">Stoney Creek</a> and <a href="Jordan%2C%20Ontario">Jordan</a>.
The prospect of removing hundreds of acres of farmland did not sit well with many, especially farmers in the path of the new highway. Rumours spread the prices paid for land were to be well below market value, and local protests erupted throughout the summer. However, the purpose of the new highway was to replace the congested, winding and hilly route of <a href="Ontario%20Highway%208">Highway 8</a> along the escarpment; several groups of collisions that summer gradually persuaded the public to support the new highway. By the autumn, of fruitland were cleared to make way for the route.

Over the next two years, numerous bridges and <a href="cloverleaf%20interchange">cloverleaf interchange</a>s along the new highway were constructed. In addition, a large traffic circle was built in Stoney Creek to connect with Highway 20. The majority of this structural work was completed before the royal visit in 1939. However, despite being opened to traffic between Stoney Creek and Jordan, the majority of the new route was gravelled. Over a ten-week period in the late spring and early summer of 1940, were paved, completing the four-lane highway between Hamilton and Niagara Falls. On August 23, 1940, McQuesten cut a ribbon at the Henley Bridge in St. Catharines and officially declared the Queen Elizabeth Way open between Toronto and Niagara Falls. Construction towards Fort Erie continued, but the ongoing war delayed its completion. As an interim measure, the unpaved highway was opened during the summer of 1941. Two lanes of pavement were laid in 1946, but the four-lane highway was not fully paved until 1956. The completed QEW was officially opened on October 14 of that year, completing the envisioned highway 25 years after work had begun.

Despite some modern infrastructure, including traffic circles, interchanges, and some grade-separations, the majority of the new superhighway was not controlled-access. This meant existing farmers and homeowners along several segments that were once <a href="concession%20road">concession road</a>s were permitted to build driveways and entrances onto the road. In addition, the majority of the crossroads encountered along the route were at-grade intersections. This, combined with the ever-increasing number of automobiles, traffic jams, accidents, and deteriorating pavement, led the Department of Highways to state it had begun "salvaging" the QEW in its 1953 annual report.

The first new interchange opened at Dixie Road in 1953, beginning a seven-year program to make the Hamilton–Toronto section into a full-fledged freeway.
Over the next three years, the route was improved west to Highway 10 (Hurontario Street). This work was completed in early 1956. <a href="Service%20road">Service road</a>s were installed and 13 intersections eliminated, resulting in a 50% reduction of the accident rate along that section.
In Toronto, work began in 1955 to construct the <a href="Gardiner%20Expressway">Gardiner Expressway</a>, which would tie in with the end of the QEW. The first section of the Gardiner, connecting the QEW to Jameson Avenue, was officially opened by Mayor <a href="Fred%20Gardiner">Fred Gardiner</a> and Premier <a href="Leslie%20Frost">Leslie Frost</a> on August 8, 1958.
Work was also underway on the Toronto Bypass, involving the upgrade of Highway 27 to a freeway between the QEW and the new <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20401">Highway 401</a>. Construction began in 1953,
and included an upgrade of the cloverleaf interchange with the QEW with larger loop ramps. This interchange would become one of the worst <a href="bottleneck%20%28traffic%29">bottlenecks</a> in the province a decade after its completion, according to Highways Minister <a href="Charles%20MacNaughton">Charles MacNaughton</a>.
On September 11, 1957, construction began to widen the QEW to six lanes between Highway 27 and the Humber River. It was completed by December 1958,
as were interchanges with Mississauga Road and Kerr Street.
Service roads allowed engineers to separate local access from the highway and avoid space-consuming interchanges in many places. Therefore, interchanges were only opened at Bronte Road (then <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2025">Highway 25</a>), Kerr Street, Royal Windsor Drive (then <a href="Ontario%20Highway%20122">Highway 122</a>), Southdown Road (now Erin Mills Parkway north of the interchange), Mississauga Road, <a href="Hurontario%20Street">Hurontario Street</a> (then <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2010">Highway 10</a>), Cawthra Road, Dixie Road, and <a href="Ontario%20Highway%2027">Highway 27</a>.

Two major projects were ongoing near Burlington at this point. On April 29, 1952, the "W.E. Fitzgerald" struck the two-lane <a href="Vertical-lift%20bridge">lift bridge</a> at the entrance to Hamilton Harbour.
Damage to the crossing resulted in the QEW's closure until a temporary bridge was erected. To remedy what was becoming a major delay and hazard, the Department of Highways began planning a high-level bridge to cross the shipping channel. Construction also began on the "Freeman Diversion" interchange to provide better access to this new structure as well as the proposed <a href="Chedoke%20Expressway">Chedoke Expressway</a>, bypassing the old trumpet interchange and creating a new <a href="Stack%20interchange">three-level stack</a>. Work on both proceeded over the next six years.
The Freeman Diversion opened to traffic in August 1958,
with the old route becoming an eastward extension of Plains Road.
Premier Frost opened the , four-lane skyway two months later on October 30. Although it greatly reduced traffic delays, it was not without controversy due to its height, cost, tolling, and most especially its name. Residents in Burlington demanded it be named the Burlington Skyway, while Hamilton residents countered with the Hamilton Skyway. As a compromise, the Thomas B. McQuesten Skyway was proposed. However, the provincial government had the final say in the matter, and opted to name it the Burlington Bay Skyway. Tolls were collected beginning on November 10.

Elsewhere, in St. Catharines, planning was already advanced on a second skyway to cross the Welland Canal. The Homer Lift Bridge, a longstanding feature along Highway 8, was another point where the QEW narrowed to two lanes and traffic faced regular delays. Construction of the Homer Skyway, as it was tentatively known, began in July 1960 and progressed over the following three years. The $20 million (in 1963, $ adjusted for inflation) structure was officially opened by Premier <a href="John%20Robarts">John Robarts</a> on November 15, 1963. However, traffic had already been flowing on the bridge since October 18.
As with the Burlington Bay Skyway, tolls were collected on the new bridge. However, the name was almost unanimously chosen by St. Catharines residents to be the Garden City Skyway. The collection of tolls on both skyways continued until December 28, 1973.

On September 15, 1960, the Shook's Hill interchange, a unique rotary junction, was completed at what is now <a href="Erin%20Mills%20Parkway">Erin Mills Parkway</a>. It was opened to traffic the following day, and completed the program to make the QEW a freeway between Burlington and Toronto.
A final project, to reconstruct the intersection with Brant Street into an interchange, was carried out in 1964 and made the QEW a freeway between Hamilton and Toronto.

By 1963, work was underway to improve the Niagara Falls–Hamilton stretch of the QEW into a controlled-access highway.
At the end of 1966, the QEW was six lanes wide through Mississauga and Toronto, as well as between the Freeman Interchange and east of Brant Street.
This six-laning was extended west from Ninth Line to Kerr Street by 1968. The remaining section of four-lane highway along the Burlington to Toronto stretch, between Brant Street and Kerr Street, was reconstructed beginning in 1970 and completed by 1972.

The late 1960s and early 1970s also saw the complete reconstruction of three important interchanges: the Rainbow Bridge Approach (later Highway 420) in Niagara Falls, Highway 20 (Centennial Parkway) in Hamilton, and Highway 27 in Toronto. The former two were traffic circles in place since the QEW was opened in 1940; the third was a large cloverleaf interchange that had become outdated with the expansion of Highway 27 to ten lanes throughout the 1960s. The connections with the Rainbow Bridge Approach and with Highway 27 required new massive high-speed interchanges to accommodate freeway-to-freeway traffic movements.
The junction with Highway 27 was built over and required the construction of 19 bridges and the equivalent of of two-lane roadway. Construction began in September 1968, although preliminary work had been ongoing since 1966;
the interchange opened to traffic on November 14, 1969, and included an expansion of the QEW to ten lanes between what would become known as Highway 427 and Lake Shore Boulevard.
Construction of the three-level stack interchange between the QEW and Rainbow Bridge Approach began in 1971, removing the two traffic circles along the approach at the QEW and Dorchester Road.
The interchange between the QEW and Lundy's Lane (Highway 20) was also removed; instead, the new stack interchange provided access to Montrose Road.
The work was completed by April 1972, at which point the Rainbow Bridge Approach was designated as Highway 420.
Planning for the removal of the Stoney Creek traffic circle was completed by 1970, and reconstruction began in 1974.
This involved the removal of a rail line which crossed through the circle, and was the demise of one of two major features along the route. The new interchange opened in 1978,
completing the transformation of the QEW into a controlled-access highway.

During the late 1970s, construction was carried out on several new interchanges between Hamilton and Toronto. A new interchange at Dorval Drive and Trafalgar Road replaced the one at Kerr Street. In Mississauga, work commenced at Cawthra Road, while in Burlington a new interchange was built at Appleby Line.

Now functioning as a freeway, the QEW was already overburdened by the ever-increasing number of vehicles. The Burlington Bay Skyway, the lone four-lane link on the route between Hamilton and Toronto, was initially designed to handle 50,000 vehicles daily, but by 1973 there were 60,000 vehicles crossing it. Preliminary work on a second parallel structure began a decade later in 1983. In July of that year, Transportation Minister <a href="James%20Snow">James Snow</a> broke ground for the new bridge. Construction was carried out over two years, and the twinned structure was opened on October 11, 1985. It was named the James N. Allan Skyway, in honour of <a href="James%20Allan%20%28Canadian%20politician%29">James Allan</a>, Minister of Highways during construction of the original skyway. The new name was not well received by locals, and debate erupted once again whilst the original bridge was closed and repaired for several years. It reopened on August 22, 1988, with Toronto-bound traffic crossing the original bridge. The twin structure was renamed the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway, though it is commonly referred to as simply the Burlington Skyway.

Alongside the twinning of the skyway, the QEW was widened to eight lanes between <a href="Burlington%20Street%20%28Hamilton%2C%20Ontario%29">Burlington Street</a> in Hamilton and Northshore Boulevard (then Highway 2) in Burlington, and to six lanes north to the Freeman Interchange and south to Centennial Parkway. A variable lighting system, <a href="changeable%20message%20sign">changeable message sign</a>s and traffic cameras were added to create a new <a href="Freeway%20Traffic%20Management%20System">traffic-management system called COMPASS</a>. Modern interchanges were constructed with Burlington Street, Northshore Boulevard, Fairview Street and Brant Street, and the interchange with Plains Road was removed. Eastport Drive was built at the same time to relieve traffic on <a href="Beach%20Boulevard%20%28Hamilton%2C%20Ontario%29">Beach Boulevard</a>. This work was completed between late 1984 and 1990.
With the expanded capacity of the skyway, and the unanticipated traffic volumes on Highway 403, the Freeman Interchange was now faced with a capacity problem. To resolve this, the renamed Ministry of Transportation began planning on Highway 403 between Burlington and Mississauga;
this right-of-way would be sold to the <a href="407%20ETR">407 ETR</a> consortium in 1995 and built as part of that route.
Work began in August 1991 to rebuild the interchange and add a fourth leg. The rebuilt interchange was opened on October 23, 1993; the first sod for what would open as Highway 407 was turned that day.

Budgetary restraints in the 1990s forced the provincial government to sell off or download many highways to lower levels of government, or, in the case of Highway 407, to a private consortium.
As part of recommendations, the QEW east of Highway 427 to the Humber River was transferred to the responsibility of the City of Toronto. The transfer took place on April 1, 1997.
The city subsequently renamed it as part of the Gardiner Expressway.

Beginning in May 1999, the grade-separated traffic circle junction with Erin Mills Parkway and Southdown Road, which dated back to the early 1960s, was completely reconstructed as a standard <a href="partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange">parclo A4 interchange</a>; it was reopened in 2001.
The nearby Hurontario Street interchange was upgraded from a cloverleaf to a parclo A4 on the south side and a diamond interchange on the north side. Work was completed in 2010.

The <a href="Red%20Hill%20Valley%20Parkway">Red Hill Valley Parkway</a> project, which opened on November 16, 2007, added a significant new interchange to the QEW.
The ramp to the southbound parkway did not open until December 2008.
As part of this project, the Burlington Street and Centennial Parkway interchanges were reconstructed, and the QEW widened to eight lanes from Burlington Street to Centennial Parkway. Construction was completed in 2009.

The highway was widened to permit an additional HOV lane in either direction between Guelph Line and Trafalgar Road starting in 2007. These lanes were opened to traffic on November 29, 2010.
In 2005,
work began to widen the QEW through St. Catharines from Highway 406 to the Garden City Skyway. This work was completed on August 26, 2011, at a cost of $186 million.

On December 7, 2015, Ontario's Transportation Ministry announced it was working on a plan to create permanent <a href="high-occupancy%20toll%20lanes">high-occupancy toll lanes</a> (HOT) on a stretch, in both ways, between Trafalgar Road in Oakville and Guelph Line in Burlington starting on September 15, 2016. This would require vehicles with a single occupant to purchase a permit for such use. (A portion of Highway 427 would also have HOT lanes.) Vehicles classified as environmentally-friendly and denoted with a green license plate would not be required to pay when using the HOT lanes. Prices for the permits had not yet been determined for this plan, described as a pilot project, said Transportation Minister Steven Del Duca during a press conference.

The following table lists the exits along the QEW. Exits are numbered from Fort Erie to Toronto.

William Sterndale Bennett

Sir William Sterndale Bennett (13 April 18161 February 1875) was an English composer, pianist, conductor and music educator. At the age of ten Bennett was admitted to the London <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> (RAM), where he remained for ten years. By the age of twenty, he had begun to make a reputation as a concert pianist, and his compositions received high praise. Among those impressed by Bennett was the German composer <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a>, who invited him to <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>. There Bennett became friendly with <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Robert Schumann</a>, who shared Mendelssohn's admiration for his compositions. Bennett spent three winters composing and performing in Leipzig.

In 1837 Bennett began to teach at the RAM, with which he was associated for most of the rest of his life. For twenty years he taught there, later also teaching at <a href="Queen%27s%20College%2C%20London">Queen's College, London</a>. Amongst his pupils during this period were <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a>, <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a>, and <a href="Tobias%20Matthay">Tobias Matthay</a>. Throughout the 1840s and 1850s he composed little, although he performed as a pianist and directed the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Philharmonic Society</a> for ten years. He also actively promoted concerts of chamber music. From 1848 onwards his career was punctuated by antagonism between himself and the conductor <a href="Michael%20Costa%20%28conductor%29">Michael Costa</a>.

In 1858 Bennett returned to composition, but his later works, though popular, were considered old-fashioned and did not arouse as much critical enthusiasm as his youthful compositions had done. He was Professor of Music at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> from 1856 until 1875. In 1866 he became Principal of the RAM, rescuing it from closure, and remained in this position until his death. He was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> in 1871. He died in London in 1875 and was buried in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>.

Bennett had a significant influence on English music, not solely as a composer but also as a teacher, as a promoter of standards of musical education and as an important figure in London concert life. In recent years, appreciation of Bennett's compositions has been rekindled and a number of his works, including a symphony, his piano concerti, some vocal music and many of his piano compositions, have been recorded. In his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts of his music and other related events took place.

Bennett was born in <a href="Sheffield">Sheffield</a>, <a href="Yorkshire">Yorkshire</a>, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of <a href="Sheffield%20Cathedral">Sheffield parish church</a>, and his wife Elizabeth, "née" Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a> by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional <a href="bass%20%28voice%20type%29">bass</a>, who sang as a <a href="lay%20clerk">lay clerk</a> in the choirs of <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">King's</a>, <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's</a> and <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity</a> colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of <a href="King%27s%20College%20Chapel%2C%20Cambridge">King's College Chapel</a> in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Music">Royal Academy of Music</a> (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.

Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under <a href="William%20Henry%20Holmes%20%28musician%29">W. H. Holmes</a>, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, <a href="William%20Crotch">William Crotch</a>, and then under <a href="Cipriani%20Potter">Cipriani Potter</a>, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic <a href="James%20William%20Davison">J. W. Davison</a>. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of "<a href="The%20Marriage%20of%20Figaro">The Marriage of Figaro</a>" in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the <a href="mezzo-soprano">mezzo-soprano</a> role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman "<a href="en%20travesti">en travesti</a>"). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" wryly commented, "of the page... we will not speak", but acknowledged that Bennett sang pleasingly and to the satisfaction of the audience. "<a href="The%20Harmonicon">The Harmonicon</a>", however, called his performance "in every way a blot on the piece".

Among Bennett's student compositions were a piano concerto (No. 1 in D minor, <a href="Opus%20number">Op.</a> 1), a symphony and an overture to "<a href="The%20Tempest">The Tempest</a>". The concerto received its public premiere at an orchestral concert in Cambridge on 28 November 1832, with Bennett as soloist. Performances soon followed in London and, by royal command, at <a href="Windsor%20Castle">Windsor Castle</a>, where Bennett played in April 1833 for <a href="William%20IV%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King William IV</a> and <a href="Adelaide%20of%20Saxe-Meiningen">Queen Adelaide</a>. The RAM published the concerto at its own expense as a tribute. A further London performance was given in June 1833. The critic of "The Harmonicon" wrote of this concert:
[T]he most complete and gratifying performance was that of young Bennett, whose composition would have conferred honour on any established master, and his execution of it was really surprising, not merely for its correctness and brilliancy, but for the feeling he manifested, which, if he proceed as he has begun, must in a few years place him very high in his profession.
In the audience was <a href="Felix%20Mendelssohn">Felix Mendelssohn</a>, who was sufficiently impressed to invite Bennett to the <a href="Lower%20Rhenish%20Music%20Festival">Lower Rhenish Music Festival</a> in <a href="D%C3%BCsseldorf">Düsseldorf</a>. Bennett asked, "May I come to be your pupil?" Mendelssohn replied, "No, no. You must come to be my friend".

In 1834 Bennett was appointed organist of St Ann's, <a href="Wandsworth">Wandsworth</a>, London, a <a href="chapel%20of%20ease">chapel of ease</a> to Wandsworth parish church. He held the post for a year, after which he taught private students in central London and at schools in <a href="Edmonton%2C%20London">Edmonton</a> and <a href="Hendon">Hendon</a>. Although by common consent the RAM had little more to teach him after his seventh or eighth year, he was permitted to remain as a free boarder there until 1836, which suited him well, as his income was small. In May 1835 Bennett made his first appearance at the <a href="Royal%20Philharmonic%20Society">Philharmonic Society of London</a>, playing the premiere of his Second Piano Concerto (in E-flat major, Op. 4), and in the following year he gave there the premiere of his Third Concerto (in C minor, Op. 9). Bennett was also a member of the Society of British Musicians, founded in 1834 to promote specifically British musicians and compositions. Davison wrote in 1834 that Bennett's overture named for <a href="Lord%20Byron">Lord Byron</a>'s "<a href="Parisina">Parisina</a>" was "the best thing that has been played at the Society's concerts".

In May 1836 Bennett travelled to Düsseldorf in the company of Davison to attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival for the first performance of Mendelssohn's <a href="oratorio">oratorio</a> "<a href="St.%20Paul%20%28oratorio%29">St Paul</a>". Bennett's visit was enabled by a subsidy by the piano-making firm of <a href="John%20Broadwood%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">John Broadwood & Sons</a>. Inspired by his journey up the Rhine, Bennett began work on his overture "The Naiads" (Op. 15). After Bennett left for home, Mendelssohn wrote to their mutual friend, the English organist and composer <a href="Thomas%20Attwood%20%28composer%29">Thomas Attwood</a>, "I think him the most promising young musician I know, not only in your country but also here, and I am convinced if he does not become a very great musician, it is not God's will, but his own".

After Bennett's first visit to Germany there followed three extended visits to work in <a href="Leipzig">Leipzig</a>. He was there from October 1836 to June 1837, during which time he made his debut at the <a href="Gewandhaus">Gewandhaus</a> as the soloist in his Third Piano Concerto with Mendelssohn conducting. He later conducted his "Naiads" overture. During this visit he also arranged the first <a href="cricket">cricket</a> match ever played in Germany, ("as fitting a Yorkshireman" as the musicologist <a href="Percy%20M.%20Young">Percy M. Young</a> comments). At this time Bennett wrote to Davison:[Mendelssohn] took me to his house and gave me the printed score of [his overture] 'Melusina', and afterwards we supped at the 'Hôtel de Bavière', where all the musical clique feed ... The party consist[ed] of Mendelssohn, [Ferdinand] <a href="Ferdinand%20David%20%28musician%29">David</a>, <a href="Camille-Marie%20Stamaty">Stamity</a> [sic] ... and a Mr. <a href="Robert%20Schumann">Schumann</a>, a musical editor, who expected to see me a "fat" man with "large black whiskers." 

Bennett had been at first slightly in awe of Mendelssohn, but no such formality ever attached to Bennett's friendship with Robert Schumann, with whom he went on long country walks by day and visited the local taverns by night. Each dedicated a large-scale piano work to the other: in August 1837 Schumann dedicated his "<a href="Symphonic%20Studies%20%28Schumann%29">Symphonic Studies</a>" to Bennett, who reciprocated the dedication a few weeks later with his "Fantasie", Op. 16. Schumann was eloquently enthusiastic about Bennett's music; in 1837 he devoted an essay to Bennett in the "<a href="Neue%20Zeitschrift%20f%C3%BCr%20Musik">Neue Zeitschrift für Musik</a>", praising amongst other works Bennett's Op. 10 "Musical Sketches" for piano, "three of Bennett's loveliest pictures". The essay ends: "For some time now he has been peering over my shoulder, and for the second time he has asked 'But what are you writing?' Dear friend, I shall write no more than: 'If only you knew!'" Bennett however had from the outset some reservations about Schumann's music, which, he told Davison in 1837, he thought "rather too eccentric".

On Bennett's return to London he took up a teaching post at the RAM which he held until 1858. During his second long stay in Germany, from October 1838 to March 1839, he played his Fourth Piano Concerto (Op. 19, in F minor) and the "Wood Nymphs" Overture, Op. 20. Returning to England, he wrote to his Leipzig publisher Friedrich Kistner in 1840, bemoaning the difference between England and Germany (and hoping that a German would redress the situation): You know what a dreadful place England is for music; and in London I have nobody who I can talk to about such things, all the people are mad with [Sigismond] <a href="Sigismond%20Thalberg">Thalberg</a> and [Johann] <a href="Johann%20Strauss%20I">Strauss</a> [I], and I have not heard a single Symphony or Overture in one concert since last June. I sincerely hope that <a href="Albert%2C%20Prince%20Consort">Prince Albert</a> ... will do something to improve our taste.

On Bennett's third trip, from January to March 1842, in which he also visited <a href="Kassel">Kassel</a>, <a href="Dresden">Dresden</a> and Berlin, he played his "Caprice" for piano and orchestra, Op. 22, in Leipzig. Despite his then-pessimistic view of music in England, Bennett missed his chance to establish himself in Germany. The musicologist Nicholas Temperley writes One might guess that the early loss of both parents produced in Bennett an exceptionally intense need for reassurance and encouragement. England could not provide this for a native composer in his time. He found it temporarily in German musical circles; yet, when the opportunity came to claim his earned place as a leader in German music, he was not quite bold enough to grasp it.

Bennett returned to London in March 1842, and continued his teaching at the RAM. The next year the post of professor of music at the <a href="University%20of%20Edinburgh">University of Edinburgh</a> became vacant. With Mendelssohn's strong encouragement Bennett applied for the position. Mendelssohn wrote to the principal of the university, "I beg you to use your powerful influence on behalf of that candidate whom I consider in every respect worthy of the place, a true ornament to his art and his country, and indeed one of the best and most highly gifted musicians now living: Mr. Sterndale Bennett." Despite this advocacy Bennett's application was unsuccessful.

Bennett had been impressed in Leipzig with the concept of chamber music concerts, which had been, apart from <a href="string%20quartet">string quartet</a> recitals, a rarity in London. He began in 1843 a series of such concerts including <a href="piano%20trio">piano trio</a>s of <a href="Louis%20Spohr">Louis Spohr</a> and <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Ludwig van Beethoven</a>, works for piano solo, and string sonatas by Mendelssohn and others. Amongst those taking part in these recitals were the piano virtuoso <a href="Alexander%20Dreyschock">Alexander Dreyschock</a> and <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Chopin">Frédéric Chopin</a>'s pupil, the 13-year old <a href="Carl%20Filtsch">Carl Filtsch</a>.

In 1844 Bennett married Mary Anne Wood (1824–1862), the daughter of a naval commander. Composition gave way to a ceaseless round of teaching and musical administration. The writer and composer <a href="Geoffrey%20Bush">Geoffrey Bush</a> sees the marriage as marking a break in Bennett's career; "from 1844 to 1856 [Bennett] was a freelance teacher, conductor and concert organiser; a very occasional pianist and a still more occasional composer." <a href="Clara%20Schumann">Clara Schumann</a> noted that Bennett spent too much time giving private lessons to keep up with changing trends in music: "His only chance of learning new music is in the carriage on the way from one lesson to another."

From 1842 Bennett had been a director of the Philharmonic Society of London. He helped to relieve the society's perilous finances by persuading Mendelssohn and Spohr to perform with the Society's orchestra, attracting full houses and much-needed income. In 1842 the orchestra, under the composer's baton, gave the London premiere of Mendelssohn's <a href="Symphony%20No.%203%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Third ("Scottish") Symphony</a>, two months after its world premiere in Leipzig. In 1844 Mendelssohn conducted the last six concerts of the society's season, in which among his own works and those of many others he included music by Bennett. From 1846 to 1854 the Society's conductor was <a href="Michael%20Costa%20%28conductor%29">Michael Costa</a>, of whom Bennett disapproved; Costa was too devoted to Italian opera and not a partisan of the German masters, as was Bennett. Bennett wrote to Mendelssohn on 24 July, displaying some querulousness, "The Philharmonic Directors have engaged Costa ... with which I am not very well pleased, but I could not persuade them to the contrary, and am tired of quarrelling with them. They are a worse set this year than we have ever had."

In May 1848, on the opening of <a href="Queen%27s%20College%2C%20London">Queen's College, London</a>, Bennett, as one of the Founding Directors, delivered an inaugural lecture and joined the staff, while continuing his work at the RAM and private teaching. He wrote the thirty "Preludes and Lessons", Op. 33, for his piano students at the college; they were published in 1853 and remained in widespread use by music students well into the twentieth century. In a profile of Bennett published in 1903 F. G. Edwards noted that Bennett's duties as a teacher severely reduced his opportunity to compose, although he maintained his reputation as a soloist in annual chamber music and piano recitals at the <a href="Hanover%20Square%20Rooms">Hanover Square Rooms</a>, which included chamber music and concerti by <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Johann Sebastian Bach</a> and Beethoven's "<a href="An%20die%20ferne%20Geliebte">An die ferne Geliebte</a>", "then almost novelties". Over the years he gave over forty concerts at this venue, and amongst those who took part were the violinists <a href="Henri%20Vieuxtemps">Henri Vieuxtemps</a> and <a href="Heinrich%20Wilhelm%20Ernst">Heinrich Ernst</a>, the pianists <a href="Stephen%20Heller">Stephen Heller</a>, <a href="Ignaz%20Moscheles">Ignaz Moscheles</a> and Clara Schumann, and the cellist <a href="Carlo%20Alfredo%20Piatti">Carlo Piatti</a> (for whom Bennett wrote his Sonata Duo); composers represented included—apart from Bennett's favourite classical masters and Mendelssohn—<a href="Domenico%20Scarlatti">Domenico Scarlatti</a>, <a href="Fanny%20Mendelssohn">Fanny Mendelssohn</a> and Schumann.

As well as the demands of his work as a teacher and pianist, there were other factors that may have contributed to Bennett's long withdrawal from large-scale composition. <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Charles Villiers Stanford</a> writes that the death of Mendelssohn in 1847 came to Bennett as "an irreparable loss". In the following year Bennett severed his hitherto close ties with the Philharmonic Society, which had presented many of his most successful compositions. This break resulted from an initially minor disagreement with Costa over his interpretation at the final rehearsal of Bennett's overture "Parisina". The intransigence of both parties inflated this into a furious row, and began a breach between them which was to last throughout Bennett's career. Bennett was disgusted at the Society's failure to back him up, and resigned.

From this point in his life Bennett was ever increasingly involved in the burdens of musical organization. In the opinion of Percy Young, he became "the prototype of the modern administrative musician ... he eventually built for himself an impregnable position, but in doing so destroyed his once considerable creative talent." Bennett became a victim as well as a beneficiary of a trend towards professionalization in the music industry in Britain; "The Principal and the Professor became powerful, whereas the status of the composer and the executant (unless foreign) was implicitly downgraded."

In 1849 Bennett became the founding president of the <a href="Bach%20Society">Bach Society</a> in London, whose early members included <a href="George%20Thomas%20Smart">Sir George Smart</a>, <a href="John%20Pyke%20Hullah">John Pyke Hullah</a>, <a href="William%20Horsley">William Horsley</a>, Potter and Davison. Under his direction the Society gave the first English performance of Bach's "<a href="St%20Matthew%20Passion">St Matthew Passion</a>" on 6 April 1854. Further performances of the "Passion" were given by the Society in 1858 and 1862, the latter coinciding with the publication of Bennett's own edition of the work, with a translation of the text into English by his pupil Helen Johnston.

For the <a href="1851%20Great%20Exhibition">1851 Great Exhibition</a> Bennett was appointed a Metropolitan Local Commissioner, Musical Juror and superintendent for the music at the opening Royal ceremony.

In June 1853 Bennett made his last public appearance as a soloist with orchestra in his own Fourth Piano Concerto. This performance was given with a new organization, the Orchestral Union, and followed a snub from Costa, who had refused to conduct the pianist <a href="Arabella%20Goddard">Arabella Goddard</a> (Davison's wife) in Bennett's Third Concerto at the Philharmonic Society. In the same year Bennett declined an invitation to become the conductor of the <a href="Leipzig%20Gewandhaus%20Orchestra">Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra</a>. He was greatly tempted by the offer, but felt it his duty to remain in England, as the offer came too late for Bennett to make alternative arrangements for some of his pupils, and he refused to let them down. After the controversial 1855 season of the Philharmonic Society at which <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a> conducted, Bennett was elected to take over the conductorship in 1856, a post which he held for ten years. At his first concert, on 14 April 1856, the piano soloist in Beethoven's "<a href="Piano%20Concerto%20No.%205%20%28Beethoven%29">Emperor</a>" Concerto was Clara Schumann, wife of his old friend. It was her first appearance in England.

Bennett's stewardship of the Philharmonic Society orchestra was not entirely happy, and the historian of the orchestra, Cyril Ehrlich, notes "a sense of drift and decline". Many leading members of the orchestra were also in the orchestra of the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Theatre">Italian Opera House</a> in London (and therefore partisans of the displaced Costa), and, in addition, Bennett proved unable to resolve personal animosities amongst his leading players. Costa took to arranging schedules for his musicians which made rehearsals (and sometimes performances) for the Society impractical. This gave an "impression that [Bennett] was capable of exerting only waning authority amongst professionals". Moreover, comparing London with other centres around the mid-century, Ehrlich notes "<a href="Giuseppe%20Verdi">Verdi</a> was in Milan, Wagner in Dresden, <a href="Giacomo%20Meyerbeer">Meyerbeer</a> in Paris, <a href="Johannes%20Brahms">Brahms</a> in Vienna, and <a href="Franz%20Liszt">Liszt</a> in <a href="Weimar">Weimar</a>. London had the richest of audiences, and was offered Sterndale Bennett." He instances the London premiere of Schumann's "<a href="Paradise%20and%20the%20Peri">Paradise and the Peri</a>" in the 1856 season, which, by engaging <a href="Jenny%20Lind">Jenny Lind</a> as soloist, and with Prince Albert in the audience, brought in a substantial subscription, but was musically disastrous (and was not helped by the chaos of a seriously overcrowded venue). One member of the audience thought Lind's voice was "worn and strained" and that there would have been "vehement demonstrations of derision had not the audience been restrained in the presence of Royalty". Newspaper critics were scarcely more complimentary.

Temperley writes: "After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence." Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral <a href="cantata">cantata</a>, "The May Queen", Op. 39, for the opening of the <a href="Leeds%20Town%20Hall">Leeds Town Hall</a> in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by <a href="Alfred%2C%20Lord%20Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a> for the opening of the <a href="1862%20International%20Exhibition">1862 International Exhibition</a> in London; an "Installation Ode for Cambridge University" (Op. 41) with words by <a href="Charles%20Kingsley">Charles Kingsley</a>, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,"The Woman of Samaria" for the <a href="Birmingham%20Triennial%20Music%20Festival">Birmingham Triennial Music Festival</a> of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata ("The Maid of Orleans", Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by <a href="Prosper%20Sainton">Prosper Sainton</a>, between works by Meyerbeer and <a href="Daniel%20Auber">Daniel Auber</a> also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.

In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting "<a href="oral%20exam">viva voce</a>" examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Music">Bachelor of Music</a>. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.

In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic <a href="John%20Fane%2C%2011th%20Earl%20of%20Westmorland">Earl of Westmorland</a>, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a <a href="Mass%20%28music%29">Mass</a> of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the heads of the Academy directors. Bennett resigned from the RAM at this overbearing behaviour, and was not to return until 1866. Towards the end of 1862 Bennett's wife died after a painful illness. His biographer <a href="William%20Barclay%20Squire">W. B. Squire</a> suggests that "he never recovered from the effects of Mrs. Bennett's death, and that henceforward a painful change in him became apparent to his friends." In 1865 Bennett again visited Leipzig where he was reunited with old friends including Ferdinand David, and his Op. 43 Symphony was performed.

In 1866 <a href="Charles%20Lucas%20%28musician%29">Charles Lucas</a>, the Principal of the RAM, announced his retirement. The position was first offered to Costa, who demanded a higher salary than the directors of the RAM could contemplate, and then to <a href="Otto%20Goldschmidt">Otto Goldschmidt</a>, who was then professor of piano at the RAM. He declined and urged the directors to appoint Bennett. Lind, who was Goldschmidt's wife, wrote that Bennett "is certainly the only man in England who ought to raise that institution from its present decay".

Bennett was to find that heading a leading music college was incompatible with a career as a composer. The post of Principal was traditionally not arduous. He was contractually required to attend for only six hours a week, teaching composition and arranging class-lists. But Bennett had not only to run the RAM but to save it from imminent dissolution. The RAM had been temporarily saved from bankruptcy by grants from the government, authorised by <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">Gladstone</a> as <a href="Chancellor%20of%20the%20Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>, in 1864 and 1865. The following year Gladstone was out of office, and the new Chancellor, <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Disraeli</a>, refused to renew the grant. The directors of the RAM decided to close it, over the head of Bennett as Principal. Bennett, with the support of the faculty and the students, assumed the Chairmanship of the board of directors.

In <a href="Charles%20Villiers%20Stanford">Stanford</a>'s words, "As Chairman he succeeded, after the Government had withdrawn its annual grant, in winning it back, restored the financial credit of the house, and during seven years bore the harassing anxiety of complex negotiations with various public bodies of great influence who were discussing schemes for the advance of national musical education." The schemes referred to were two proposals which would have undoubtedly undermined the viability and influence of the RAM, one to merge it in a proposed National School of Music, backed by the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Arts">Royal Society of Arts</a> under <a href="Henry%20Cole">Henry Cole</a>, the other to relocate it (without security of tenure) in the premises of the <a href="Royal%20Albert%20Hall">Royal Albert Hall</a>.

The RAM in 1866 was in poor shape in terms of influence and reputation as well as financially. The critic <a href="Henry%20Chorley">Henry Chorley</a> published data in that year showing that only 17 per cent of orchestral players in Britain had studied there. No alumni of the RAM were members of the orchestra at <a href="Royal%20Opera%20House">Covent Garden</a> opera house. Chorley added, "I cannot remember one great instrumental player the Academy has turned out during the last 25 years." Bennett himself was not entirely in accord with the emphasis Chorley placed on instrumental training for the RAM; he was concerned (and with reason) that such a policy could mean supply oustripping demand for graduates. Bennett himself taught composition at the RAM; this was undoubtedly where his greatest interests lay at this period, and it appears that the examples he gave to his pupils concentrated on his own 'conservative' favourites of Mendelssohn, Beethoven and Mozart. Nonetheless, the reputation and popularity of the RAM increased markedly under his stewardship. The number of pupils, which had dropped catastrophically at the time when the directors had proposed closing the institution, rose steadily. At the end of 1868 there had been 66 students. By 1870 the number was 121, and by 1872 it was 176.

Bennett received honorary degrees from the universities of Cambridge (1867) and <a href="University%20of%20Oxford">Oxford</a> (1870). The Philharmonic Society awarded him its Beethoven gold medal in 1867. In 1871 he was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> by Queen Victoria (two years after his old antagonist Costa had been accorded the same honour), and in 1872 he received a public testimonial before a large audience at <a href="St%20James%27s%20Hall">St James's Hall</a>, London. The money subscribed at this event founded a scholarship and prize at the RAM, which is still awarded. An <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> blue plaque has been placed at the house in 38 Queensborough Terrace, London, where Bennett lived during many of his later years.

Bennett died aged 58 on 1 February 1875 at his house in <a href="St%20John%27s%20Wood">St John's Wood</a>, London. According to his son the cause was "disease of the brain"; unable to rise one morning, he had fallen into a decline and died within a week. He was buried on 6 February, close to the tomb of <a href="Henry%20Purcell">Henry Purcell</a>, in <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. The <a href="a%20cappella">a cappella</a> quartet, "God is a Spirit", from his cantata "The Woman of Samaria", was sung to accompany the obsequies. The first concert of the Philharmonic Society's season, on 18 March, began with a tribute to its sometime conductor: pieces from his unfinished music for <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a>'s tragedy "<a href="Ajax%20%28play%29">Ajax</a>", and the complete "The Woman of Samaria", for which the choir was provided by the RAM. These were followed by Mendelssohn's <a href="Violin%20Concerto%20%28Mendelssohn%29">Violin Concerto</a>, for which the soloist was <a href="Joseph%20Joachim">Joseph Joachim</a>, to whom Mendelssohn had introduced Bennett at Joachim's London debut in 1844. The final concert of the season (5 July) included an "Idyll" in memory of Bennett composed by his old associate <a href="George%20Alexander%20Macfarren">George Alexander Macfarren</a>.

Bennett's son James Robert Sterndale Bennett (1847–1928) wrote a biography of his father. Many of the composer's descendants became musicians or performers, including his grandsons Robert (1880–1963), director of music at <a href="Uppingham">Uppingham</a> School, <a href="Rutland">Rutland</a>; Tom (T.C.) (1882–1944), composer and singer, whose daughter <a href="Joan%20Sterndale-Bennett">Joan Sterndale-Bennett</a> (1914–1996) was a well known West End actress; and <a href="Ernest%20Sterndale%20Bennett">Ernest Sterndale Bennett</a> (1884–1982), a theatre director in Canada. and <a href="Charlie%20Simpson">Charlie Simpson</a> b.1985, of <a href="Busted%20%28band%29">Busted</a> and <a href="Fightstar">Fightstar</a>.

Stanford wrote of Bennett: He maintained his British characteristics throughout his life ...The English take a kind of pride in concealing their feelings and emotions, and this is reflected in their folk-song. The <a href="River%20Thames">Thames</a> has no rapids and no falls; it winds along under its woods in a gentle stream, never dry and never halting; it is the type of the spirit of English folkmusic ... England is as remote from <a href="Celts">Keltic</a> fire and agony, as the Thames is from the <a href="River%20Spey">Spey</a>. Bennett was a typical specimen of this English characteristic. He was a poet, but of the school of <a href="William%20Wordsworth">Wordsworth</a> rather than of <a href="Lord%20Byron">Byron</a> and <a href="Percy%20Bysshe%20Shelley">Shelley</a>.

W. B. Squire wrote in 1885: 
Temperley suggests that, despite his reverence for Mendelssohn, Bennett took Mozart as his model. <a href="Geoffrey%20Bush">Geoffrey Bush</a> agrees that "[h]is best work, like his piano playing, was full of passion none the less powerful for being Mozartian (that is to say, perfectly controlled)", and characterizes him as "essentially a composer for the piano, a composer of the range (not necessarily the stature) of Chopin".
It would appear that Bennett displayed and aroused greater emotion through his piano technique than from his compositions. Stanford writes that "his playing ... was undoubtedly remarkable and had a fire and energy in it which does not appear on the gentle surface of his music", and notes that Bennett's performances were eulogized by, amongst others, <a href="John%20Field%20%28composer%29">John Field</a>, Clara Schumann, and <a href="Ferdinand%20Hiller">Ferdinand Hiller</a>.

Bennett's attitudes to the music of his continental contemporaries, aside from that of Mendelssohn, were cautious. <a href="Arthur%20Sullivan">Arthur Sullivan</a> claimed that Bennett was "bitterly prejudiced against the new school, as he called it. He would not have a note of Schumann; and as for Wagner, he was outside the pale of criticism." In Bennett's 1858 lecture on "The visits of illustrious foreign musicians to England", the latest mention is of Mendelssohn, bypassing Chopin, Wagner, Verdi and <a href="Hector%20Berlioz">Hector Berlioz</a>, (who all only came to England after Mendelssohn's last visit); Liszt (who visited London in 1827) is omitted. In a subsequent lecture he opined that Verdi was "immeasurably inferior" to <a href="Gioachino%20Rossini">Gioachino Rossini</a>, and could only say in favour of Berlioz that he "must be allowed the character of a successful and devoted artist ... it cannot be doubted that his treatment of a great orchestra is masterly in the extreme." Of Wagner, "the hero of the so-called '<a href="Music%20of%20the%20Future">music of the future</a>'", Bennett noted "I have no intention of treating him disrespectfully; that I entirely misunderstand him and his musical opinions may be my fault and not his. At any rate he possesses an influence at this moment over musical life, which it would be impossible to overlook."

Bennett's early period of composition was fruitful and includes those of his works which are most esteemed today. By the time of his first visit to Germany (1836) he had already written, amongst other works, five symphonies and three piano concerti. <a href="John%20Caldwell%20%28musicologist%29">John Caldwell</a> assesses his early songs as "exquisitely judged essentially Mendelssohnian affairs ... the integration and coherence of their accompaniments is a strong feature."

Firman writes that Bennett's finest works are those for the piano: "Rejecting the superficial virtuosity of many of his contemporaries, he developed a style ... peculiarly his own, essentially classical in nature, but with reference to a multiplicity of influences from his own performance repertory." The early piano works were all praised by Robert Schumann, and Temperley points out how Schumann himself was influenced by them, with (as examples) clear traces of Bennett's Op. 16 "Fantasie" (1837) (in effect a sonata) on Schumann's "<a href="Novelette%20%28music%29">Novelette</a>", Op. 21 no. 7 (1838), and parallels between Bennett's Op. 12 <a href="Impromptu">Impromptu</a>s (1836) and Schumann's Op. 18 "<a href="Arabeske%20%28Schumann%29">Arabesque</a>" (1838).

Temperley feels that the early symphonies are the weakest works of this period, but he suggests that "few piano concertos between Beethoven and Brahms are as successful as Bennett's in embodying the Classical spirit, not in a stiff frame to deck with festoons of virtuosity, but in a living form capable of organic growth, and even of structural surprise."

Bennett's style did not develop after his early years. In 1908 the musicologist <a href="William%20Henry%20Hadow">W. H. Hadow</a> assessed his later work as follows: "[W]hen "The May Queen" appeared [1858] the idiom of music had changed and he had not changed with it. ... He was too conservative to move with the times. ... [His last works] might all have been written in the forties; they are survivals of an earlier method, not developments but restatements of a tradition." Firman comments that later popular, and more superficial, pieces such as "Genevieve" (1839) came to overshadow the more innovative works of his earlier period such as the Sonata Op. 13, and the "Fantasia" Op. 16.

<a href="Percy%20M.%20Young">Young</a> suggests that the cantatas "The May Queen" and "The Woman of Samaria" enjoyed in their hey-day "a popularity that was in inverse relation to their intrinsic merit". Caldwell notes that "The Woman of Samaria" shows that "Bennett was a good craftsman whose only fault was a dread of the operatic ... One would probably tolerate the narrative <a href="recitative">recitative</a> more readily if the inserted movements showed any spark of life." As regards "The May Queen", Caldwell praises the overture (a Mendelssohn-style work originally written as a concert piece in 1844) "but the rest of the work is tame stuff". He comments that "both works received immense longstanding popularity and may be considered as the narrative prototype for the later Victorian secular and sacred forms ... conforming to the current standards of taste and respectability", anticipating such works as Arthur Sullivan's "<a href="The%20Masque%20at%20Kenilworth">Kenilworth</a>" (1864).

Bennett edited some of the keyboard works of Beethoven and <a href="George%20Frideric%20Handel">Handel</a> and co-edited the "<a href="Chorale">Chorale</a> Book for England" with Otto Goldschmidt (1863), based on German hymns collected by <a href="Catherine%20Winkworth">Catherine Winkworth</a>. He supervised the first British printed edition of the "St Matthew Passion". A <a href="Sheet%20music%23Types">full vocal score</a> (with piano accompaniment) was adapted from the German edition prepared by <a href="Adolf%20Bernhard%20Marx">Adolf Bernhard Marx</a> (Berlin 1830), which followed Mendelssohn's revival of the work; this was revised with reference to the score published by the Leipzig Bach Society in 1862. Bennett's additional <a href="tempo">tempo</a> and <a href="dynamics%20%28music%29">dynamic</a> markings were shown in parentheses for distinction. He provided <a href="harmony">harmonies</a> for the <a href="figured%20bass">figured bass</a> both in the solo music sections (based on the Leipzig full score) and elsewhere. Bennett also produced editions of Bach's "<a href="The%20Well-Tempered%20Clavier">The Well-Tempered Clavier</a>" and Handel's <a href="masque">masque</a> "<a href="Acis%20and%20Galatea%20%28Handel%29">Acis and Galatea</a>".

Bennett lectured both at Cambridge and the <a href="London%20Institute">London Institute</a>; texts of his lectures were edited and published in 2006. At a Sheffield lecture in 1859 he also played works of the composers he discussed, and "so may be regarded as the founder of the lecture-recital".

As a composer Bennett was acknowledged in his time in both Britain and (particularly in the first half of the century) in Germany, although many British music lovers and several leading critics remained reluctant to acknowledge the possibility that an English composer could be of the same stature as a German one. The Leipzig public, which had initially held that view, had been rapidly converted. Mendelssohn wrote to Bennett "... [M]y Countrymen became aware that music is the same in England as in Germany and everywhere, and so by your successes you have destroyed that prejudice which nobody could ever have destroyed but a true Genius."

Bennett's son, in his biography of his father, juxtaposes as illustrations English and German reviews of the overture "The Wood Nymphs". The London critic <a href="William%20Ayrton%20%28music%20critic%29">William Ayrton</a> wrote:

Schumann, by contrast, wrote:
"The overture is charming; indeed, save Spohr and Mendelssohn, what other living composer is so completely master of his pencil, or bestows with it such tenderness and grace of colour, as Bennett? ... Essay measure after measure; what a firm, yet delicate web it is from beginning to end!"

Outside these countries, Bennett remained almost unknown as a musician, although his reputation as a conductor led Berlioz to invite him to join his "Société Philharmonique", and the Dutch composer <a href="Johannes%20Verhulst">Johannes Verhulst</a> solicited his support for the Netherlands "Society for Encouragement of Music". Davison's attempts to interest the French composer <a href="Charles%20Gounod">Charles Gounod</a> in Bennett's music led to polite but sardonic responses.

Sir <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, in a 1975 lecture, rated Bennett as "<a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>'s Senior Musical Knight". Temperley assesses Bennett as the most distinguished British composer of the early Victorian era, "the only plausible rivals being <a href="Samuel%20Sebastian%20Wesley">Samuel Sebastian Wesley</a> (1810–76) and <a href="Michael%20William%20Balfe">Michael William Balfe</a> (1808–70)".

The novelist <a href="Elizabeth%20Sara%20Sheppard">Elizabeth Sara Sheppard</a> portrayed Bennett as 'Starwood Burney' in her popular eulogy of Mendelssohn, the 1853 novel "<a href="Charles%20Auchester">Charles Auchester</a>". Although Bennett's reputation in Germany did not notably survive the 1840s, his English pupils had significant influence on British music of the later 19th and earlier 20th century Britain. Among his pupils at the RAM and elsewhere were Arthur Sullivan, <a href="Joseph%20Parry">Joseph Parry</a>, <a href="Alice%20Mary%20Smith">Alice Mary Smith</a>, <a href="W.%20S.%20Rockstro">W. S. Rockstro</a>, <a href="Hubert%20Parry">Hubert Parry</a>, <a href="Tobias%20Matthay">Tobias Matthay</a>, <a href="Francis%20Edward%20Bache">Francis Edward Bache</a>, <a href="Eaton%20Faning">Eaton Faning</a> and <a href="William%20Cusins">William Cusins</a>. Bennett's contributions to elevating musical training standards at Cambridge and the RAM were part of a trend in England in the latter part of the 19th century whose "cumulative effect ... prior to World War I was incalculable", according to Caldwell.

Through his concert initiatives at the Hanover Rooms Bennett introduced a variety of chamber music to London audiences. His championship also significantly changed British opinion of the music of JS Bach. His "promotion of Bach was a story of perseverance against a contemporary perception that Bach's music was ... too difficult to listen to." Newspaper reviews of the chamber concerts in which he included the music of Bach would initially describe the music in terms such as "grandeur there is, but no beauty" (1847) or "somewhat antiquated ... [but] extremely interesting" (1854). A significant turning point was the attendance of Prince Albert at Bennett's 1858 performance of the "St. Matthew Passion".

Bennett left a substantial music library, a large proportion of which is owned by his great-great-grandson Barry Sterndale Bennett (b. 1939) and is on deposit at the <a href="Bodleian%20Library">Bodleian Library</a> in Oxford. Of his total of some 130 compositions, about a third have been recorded for CD; among these are symphonies, overtures, piano concerti, chamber music, songs and piano solo music. During his bicentenary year of 2016, several concerts and events dedicated to Bennett's works were performed, including concerts and seminars at the RAM. From April 11 to April 15, 2016 he was featured as 'Composer of the Week' on <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a>.

Dire wolf

The dire wolf ("Canis dirus", "fearsome dog") is an <a href="extinction">extinct</a> <a href="species">species</a> of the <a href="genus">genus</a> "<a href="Canis">Canis</a>". It is one of the most famous prehistoric <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>s in North America, along with its extinct competitor, the sabre-toothed cat "<a href="Smilodon">Smilodon fatalis</a>". The dire wolf lived in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a> during the <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a> and Early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> epochs (125,000–9,440 years ago). The species was named in 1858, four years after the first specimen had been found. Two <a href="subspecies">subspecies</a> are recognized: "Canis dirus guildayi" and "Canis dirus dirus". The dire wolf probably evolved from <a href="Armbruster%27s%20wolf">Armbruster's wolf</a> ("Canis armbrusteri") in North America. The largest collection of its <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s has been obtained from the Rancho <a href="La%20Brea%20Tar%20Pits">La Brea Tar Pits</a> in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a>.

Dire wolf remains have been found across a broad range of habitats including the plains, grasslands, and some forested mountain areas of North America, and in the arid savannah of South America. The sites range in elevation from sea level to . Dire wolf fossils have rarely been found north of <a href="42nd%20parallel%20north">42°N latitude</a>; there have been only five unconfirmed reports above this latitude. This range restriction is thought to be due to temperature, prey, or habitat limitations imposed by proximity to the <a href="Laurentide%20Ice%20Sheet">Laurentide</a> and <a href="Cordilleran%20Ice%20Sheet">Cordilleran</a> ice sheets that existed at the time.

The dire wolf was about the same size as the largest modern <a href="gray%20wolf">gray wolves</a> ("Canis lupus"): the <a href="Yukon%20wolf">Yukon wolf</a> and the <a href="northwestern%20wolf">northwestern wolf</a>. "C.d.guildayi" weighed on average and "C.d.dirus" was on average . Its skull and dentition matched those of "C.lupus", but its teeth were larger with greater shearing ability, and its bite force at the <a href="canine%20tooth">canine tooth</a> was the strongest of any known "Canis" species. These characteristics are thought to be adaptations for preying on <a href="Late%20Pleistocene">Late Pleistocene</a> <a href="Pleistocene%20megafauna">megaherbivores</a>, and in North America its prey are known to have included <a href="Equus%20occidentalis">horse</a>s, <a href="ground%20sloth">ground sloth</a>s, <a href="mastodon">mastodon</a>s, <a href="Bison%20antiquus">bison</a>, and <a href="Camelops">camels</a>. As with other large "Canis" <a href="hypercarnivore">hypercarnivore</a>s today, the dire wolf is thought to have been a pack hunter. Its extinction occurred during the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">Quaternary extinction event</a> along with most of the American megafauna of the time, including a number of other carnivores, that occurred soon after the appearance of humans in the New World. Its reliance on megaherbivores has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the cause remains controversial. Dire wolves lived as recently as 9,440 years ago, according to dated remains.

From the 1850s, the fossil remains of extinct large wolves were being found in the United States, and it was not immediately clear that these all belonged to one species. The first specimen of what would later become associated with "Canis dirus" was found in mid-1854 in the bed of the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> near <a href="Evansville%2C%20Indiana">Evansville, Indiana</a>. The fossilized jawbone with cheek-teeth was obtained by the geologist <a href="Joseph%20Granville%20Norwood">Joseph Granville Norwood</a> from an Evansville collector, Francis A. Linck. The paleontologist <a href="Joseph%20Leidy">Joseph Leidy</a> determined that the specimen represented an extinct species of wolf and reported it under the name of "Canis primaevus". Norwood's letters to Leidy are preserved along with the <a href="type%20specimen">type specimen</a> (the first of a species that has a written description) at the <a href="Academy%20of%20Natural%20Sciences%20of%20Drexel%20University">Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia</a>. In 1857, while exploring the <a href="Niobrara%20River">Niobrara River</a> valley in Nebraska, Leidy found the vertebrae of an extinct "Canis" species that he reported the following year under the name "C.dirus". The name "C.primaevus" (Leidy 1854) was later renamed "Canis indianensis" (Leidy 1869) when Leidy found out that the name "C.primaevus" had previously been used by the British naturalist <a href="Brian%20Houghton%20Hodgson">Brian Houghton Hodgson</a> for the <a href="dhole">dhole</a>.

In 1876 the zoologist <a href="Joel%20Asaph%20Allen">Joel Asaph Allen</a> discovered the remains of "Canis mississippiensis" (Allen 1876) and associated these with "C.dirus" (Leidy 1858) and "Canis indianensis" (Leidy 1869). As so little was found of these three specimens, Allen thought it best to leave each specimen listed under its provisional name until more material could be found to reveal their relationship. In 1908 the paleontologist <a href="John%20Campbell%20Merriam">John Campbell Merriam</a> began retrieving numerous fossilized bone fragments of a large wolf from the Rancho LaBrea tar pits. By 1912 he had found a skeleton sufficiently complete to be able to formally recognize these and the previously found specimens under the name "C.dirus" (Leidy 1858). Because the rules of <a href="nomenclature">nomenclature</a> stipulated that the name of a species should be the oldest name ever applied to it, Merriam therefore selected the name of Leidy's 1858 specimen, "C.dirus". In 1915 the paleontologist Edward Troxell indicated his agreement with Merriam when he declared "C.indianensis" a synonym of "C.dirus". In 1918, after studying these fossils, Merriam proposed consolidating their names under the separate genus "Aenocyon" (from "Aenos", terrible and "cyon", wolf) to become "Aenocyon dirus", but not everyone agreed with this extinct wolf being placed in a new genus separate from the genus "Canis". "Canis ayersi" (Sellards 1916) and "Aenocyon dirus" (Merriam 1918) were recognized as synonyms of "C.dirus" by the paleontologist Ernest Lundelius in 1972. All of the above taxa were declared synonyms of "C.dirus" in 1979, according to the paleontologist Ronald M. Nowak.

In 1984 a study by <a href="Bj%C3%B6rn%20Kurten">Björn Kurten</a> recognized a geographic variation within the dire wolf populations and proposed two subspecies: "Canis dirus guildayi" (named by Kurten in honor of the paleontologist John E. Guilday) for specimens from California and Mexico that exhibited shorter limbs and longer teeth, and "Canis dirus dirus" for specimens east of the North American <a href="Continental%20Divide%20of%20the%20Americas">Continental Divide</a> that exhibited longer limbs and shorter teeth. Kurten designated a <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> found in Hermit's Cave, New Mexico as representing the nominate subspecies "C. d. dirus".

Both the <a href="Canidae">canid</a> family and its genus "Canis" are thought to have originated in North America, roughly 40 and 6 million years ago, respectively. Members of both radiations subsequently emigrated to the Old World. Wolf-like species of "Canis" apparently originated there, and then returned to North America.

In 1974 RobertA.Martin proposed that the large North American wolf "C.armbrusteri" (Armbruster's wolf) was "C.lupus". Nowak, Kurten, and Annalisa Berta proposed that "C.dirus" was not derived from "C.lupus". In 1987, a new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could give rise to a larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant, but when food later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and <a href="speciation">speciation</a>a process by which a new species splits from an older onecould occur together during periods of climatic extremes. Gloria D. Goulet agreed with Martin, proposing further that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of "C.dirus" in North America and, judging from the similarities in their skull shapes, that "C.lupus" had given rise to the "C.dirus" hypermorph due to an abundance of game, a stable environment, and large competitors.

The three paleontologists <a href="Xiaoming%20Wang%20%28paleontologist%29">Xiaoming Wang</a>, <a href="Richard%20H.%20Tedford">Richard H. Tedford</a>, and Ronald M. Nowak have proposed that "C.dirus" evolved from "Canis armbrusteri", with Nowak stating that specimens found in <a href="Cumberland%20Bone%20Cave">Cumberland Cave, Maryland</a>, appear to be "C.armbrusteri" diverging into "C.dirus". The early wolf from China, "<a href="Evolution%20of%20the%20wolf%23Canis%20chihliensis">Canis chihliensis</a>", may have been the ancestor of both "C.armbrusteri" and the gray wolf "C.lupus". The sudden appearance of "C.armbrusteri" in North America during the <a href="Early%20Pleistocene">Early Pleistocene</a> suggests that this was an immigrant from Asia, as was "C.lupus" later in the <a href="Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>. In 2010 Francisco Prevosti proposed that "C.dirus" was a <a href="sister%20taxon">sister taxon</a> to "C.lupus".

"Canis dirus" lived in the late Pleistocene to the early <a href="Holocene">Holocene</a> (125,000–10,000 <a href="years%20before%20present">years before present</a> or YBP) in North and South America (although no members of "Canis" survive in the latter continent). The majority of fossils from the eastern "C.d.dirus" have been dated 125,000–75,000YBP, but the western "C.d.guildayi" fossils are not only smaller in size but more recent; thus it has been proposed that "C.d.guildayi" derived from "C.d.dirus". However, there are disputed specimens of "C.dirus" that date to 250,000YBP. Fossil specimens of "C.dirus" discovered at four sites in the <a href="Hay%20Springs%2C%20Nebraska">Hay Springs</a> area of Sheridan County, Nebraska, were named "Aenocyon dirus nebrascensis" (Frick 1930, undescribed), but Frick did not publish a description of them. Nowak later referred to this material as "C.armbrusteri"; then, in 2009, Tedford formally published a description of the specimens and noted that, although they exhibited some morphological characteristics of both "C.armbrusteri" and "C.dirus", he referred to them only as "C.dirus". These Nebraskan fossil specimens may represent the earliest record of "C.dirus".

A fossil discovered in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the <a href="Black%20Hills">Black Hills</a> of South Dakota may possibly be "C.dirus"; if so, this fossil is one of the earliest specimens on record. It was catalogued as "Canis cf. C.dirus" (where <a href="Open%20nomenclature%23Usage%20of%20open%20nomenclature">cf.</a> in Latin means confer, uncertain). The fossil of a horse found in the Horse Room provided a <a href="Uranium-thorium%20dating">uranium-series dating</a> of 252,000 yearsYBP and the "Canis cf. dirus" specimen was assumed to be from the same period. "C.armbrusteri" and "C.dirus" share some characteristics (<a href="synapomorphies">synapomorphies</a>) that imply the latter's descent from the former. The fossil record suggests "C.dirus" originated around 250,000YBP in the open terrain of the mid-continent before expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor "C.armbrusteri". The first appearance of "C.dirus" would therefore be 250,000YBP in California and Nebraska, and later in the rest of the United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, but the identity of these earliest fossils is not confirmed.

In South America, "C.dirus" specimens dated to the Late Pleistocene were found along the north and west coasts, but none have been found in Argentina, an area that was inhabited by "<a href="Canis%20nehringi%23Canis%20gezi">Canisgezi</a>" and "<a href="Canis%20nehringi">Canis nehringi</a>". One study found that "C.dirus" was the most <a href="Synapomorphy">evolutionarily derived</a> "Canis" species in the New World, and compared to "C.nehringi" was larger in the size and construction of its lower molars for more efficient predation. For this reason, some researchers have proposed that "C.dirus" may have originated in South America. In 2009 a proposal was made that "C.armbrusteri" was the common ancestor for both the North and South American wolves. The following year, a study yielded evidence that led to the conclusion that "C.dirus" and "C.nehringi" were the same species and thus that "C.dirus" had migrated from North America into South America, making it a late participant in the <a href="Great%20American%20Interchange">Great American Interchange</a>.

In 1992 an attempt was made to extract a <a href="mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial DNA</a> sequence from the skeletal remains of "C.d.guildayi" to compare its relationship to other "Canis" species. The attempt was unsuccessful because these remains had been removed from the LaBrea pits and tar could not be removed from the bone material. In 2014 an attempt to extract DNA from a <a href="Columbian%20mammoth">Columbian mammoth</a> from the tar pits also failed, with the study concluding that organic compounds from the asphalt permeate the bones of all ancient samples from the LaBrea pits, hindering the extraction of DNA samples.

The age of most dire wolf localities is determined solely by <a href="biostratigraphy">biostratigraphy</a>, but biostratigraphy is an unreliable indicator within asphalt deposits. Some sites have been <a href="Radiocarbon%20dating">radiocarbon dated</a>, with "C.dirus" specimens from LaBrea pits dated in calendar years as follows: 82 specimens dated 13,000–14,000YBP; 40 specimens dated 14,000–16,000YBP; 77 specimens dated 14,000–18,000YBP; 37 specimens dated 17,000–18,000YBP; 26 specimens dated 21,000–30,000YBP; 40 specimens dated 25,000–28,000YBP; and 6specimens dated 32,000–37,000YBP. A specimen from Powder Mill Creek Cave, Missouri, was dated at 13,170YBP.

The dire wolf is the largest species of the genus "<a href="Canis">Canis</a>" known to have existed. Its shape and proportions were similar to those of two modern North American wolves: the <a href="Yukon%20wolf">Yukon wolf</a> ("Canis lupus pambasileus") and the <a href="Northwestern%20wolf">Northwestern wolf</a> ("Canis lupus occidentalis"). The largest northern wolves today have a shoulder height of and a body length of . Some dire wolf specimens from Rancho LaBrea are smaller than this, and some are larger.

The dire wolf had smaller feet and a larger head when compared with a northern wolf of the same body size. The skull length could reach up to or longer, with a broader <a href="palate">palate</a>, <a href="frontal%20region">frontal region</a>, and <a href="zygomatic%20arches">zygomatic arches</a> compared with the Yukon wolf. These dimensions make the skull very massive. Its <a href="sagittal%20crest">sagittal crest</a> was higher, with the <a href="external%20occipital%20protuberance">inion</a> showing a significant backward projection, and with the rear ends of the <a href="nasal%20bones">nasal bones</a> extending relatively far back into the skull. A connected skeleton of a dire wolf from Rancho LaBrea is difficult to find because the tar allows the bones to disassemble in many directions. Parts of a <a href="vertebral%20column">vertebral column</a> have been assembled, and it was found to be similar to that of the modern wolf, with the same number of vertebrae.

Geographic differences in dire wolves were not detected until 1984, when a study of skeletal remains showed differences in a few cranio-dental features and limb proportions between specimens from California and Mexico ("C.d.guildayi") and those found from the east of the <a href="Continental%20Divide">Continental Divide</a> ("C.d.dirus"). A comparison of limb size shows that the rear limbs of "C.d.guildayi" were 8% shorter than the Yukon wolf due to a significantly shorter <a href="tibia">tibia</a> and <a href="metatarsus">metatarsus</a>, and that the front limbs were also shorter due to their slightly shorter lower bones. With its comparatively lighter and smaller limbs and massive head, "C.d.guildayi" was not as well adapted for running as timber wolves and coyotes. "C.d.dirus" possessed significantly longer limbs than "C.d.guildayi". The forelimbs were 14% longer than "C.d.guildayi" due to 10% longer <a href="Humeris">humeri</a>, 15% longer <a href="Radius%20%28bone%29">radii</a>, and 15% longer <a href="metacarpals">metacarpals</a>. The rear limbs were 10% longer than "C.d.guildayi" due to 10% longer <a href="Femur">femora</a> and tibiae, and 15% longer <a href="metatarsals">metatarsals</a>. "C.d.dirus" is comparable to the Yukon wolf in limb length. The largest "C.d.dirus" femur was found in Carroll Cave, Missouri, and measured .

"C.d.guildayi" is estimated to have weighed on average , and "C.d.dirus" weighed on average with some specimens being larger, but these could not have exceeded due to skeletal limits. In comparison, the average weight of the Yukon wolf is for males and for females. Individual weights for Yukon wolves can vary from to , with one Yukon wolf weighing . These figures show the average dire wolf to be similar in size to the largest modern gray wolf.

The remains of a complete male "C. dirus" are sometimes easy to identify compared to other "Canis" specimens because the <a href="baculum">baculum</a> (penis bone) of the dire wolf is very different from that of all other living <a href="Canidae">canids</a>.

Ecological factors such as habitat type, climate, prey specialization, and predatory competition have been shown to greatly influence gray wolf craniodental <a href="Phenotypic%20plasticity">plasticity</a>, which is an adaptation of the <a href="cranium">cranium</a> and teeth due to the influences of the environment. Similarly, the dire wolf was a hypercarnivore, with a skull and dentition adapted for hunting large and struggling prey; the shape of its skull and snout changed across time, and changes in the size of its body have been correlated to climate fluctuations.

The <a href="last%20glacial%20period">last glacial period</a>, commonly referred to as the "Ice Age", spanned 125,000–14,500YBP and was the most recent <a href="glacial%20period">glacial period</a> within the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">current ice age</a>, which occurred during the last years of the Pleistocene era. The Ice Age reached its peak during the <a href="Last%20Glacial%20Maximum">Last Glacial Maximum</a>, when <a href="ice%20sheet">ice sheet</a>s began advancing from 33,000YBP and reached their maximum limits 26,500YBP. Deglaciation commenced in the Northern Hemisphere approximately 19,000YBP and in Antarctica approximately 14,500 yearsYBP, which is consistent with evidence that glacial meltwater was the primary source for an abrupt rise in sea level 14,500YBP. Access into northern North America was blocked by the <a href="Wisconsin%20glaciation">Wisconsin glaciation</a>. The fossil evidence from the Americas points to the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">extinction</a> mainly of large animals, termed <a href="Pleistocene%20megafauna">Pleistocene megafauna</a>, near the end of the last glaciation.

Coastal southern California from 60,000YBP to the end of the Last Glacial Maximum was cooler and with a more balanced supply of moisture than today. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the mean annual temperature decreased from down to degrees, and annual precipitation had decreased from down to . This region was unaffected by the climatic effects of the Wisconsin glaciation, and is thought to have been an Ice Age <a href="Refugium%20%28population%20biology%29">refugium</a> for animals and cold-sensitive plants. By 24,000YBP, the abundance of oak and chaparral decreased, but pines increased, creating open parklands similar to today's coastal <a href="montane">montane</a>/juniper woodlands. After 14,000YBP, the abundance of conifers decreased, and those of the modern coastal plant communities, including oak woodland, chaparral, and <a href="coastal%20sage%20scrub">coastal sage scrub</a>, increased. The Santa Monica Plain lies north of the city of <a href="Santa%20Monica">Santa Monica</a> and extends along the southern base of the <a href="Santa%20Monica%20Mountains">Santa Monica Mountains</a>, and 28,000–26,000YBP it was dominated by coastal sage scrub, with cypress and pines at higher elevations. The Santa Monica Mountains supported a chaparral community on its slopes and isolated coast redwood and dogwood in its protected canyons, along with river communities that included willow, red cedar, and sycamore. These plant communities suggest a winter rainfall similar to that of modern coastal southern California, but the presence of coast redwood now found to the north indicates a cooler, moister, and less seasonal climate than today. This environment supported large herbivores that were prey for dire wolves and their competitors.

A range of animal and plant specimens that became entrapped and were then preserved in tar pits have been removed and studied so that researchers can learn about the past. The Rancho LaBrea tar pits located near Los Angeles in southern California are a collection of pits of sticky asphalt deposits that differ in deposition time from 40,000 to 12,000YBP. Commencing 40,000YBP, trapped asphalt has been moved through fissures to the surface by methane pressure, forming seeps that can cover several square meters and be deep. The dire wolf has been made famous because of the large number of its fossils recovered there. Over 200,000 specimens (mostly fragments) have been recovered from the tar pits, with the remains ranging from "Smilodon" to squirrels, invertebrates, and plants. The time period represented in the pits includes the Last Glacial Maximum when global temperatures were lower than today, the Pleistocene–Holocene transition (<a href="B%C3%B8lling-Aller%C3%B8d">Bølling-Allerød</a> interval), the <a href="Oldest%20Dryas">Oldest Dryas</a> cooling, the <a href="Younger%20Dryas">Younger Dryas</a> cooling from 12,800 to 11,500YBP, and the American megafaunal extinction event 12,700YBP when 90 genera of mammals weighing over became extinct.

<a href="Isotope%20analysis">Isotope analysis</a> can be used to identify some chemical elements, allowing researchers to make inferences about the diet of the species found in the pits. An isotope analysis of bone <a href="collagen">collagen</a> extracted from LaBrea specimens provides evidence that the dire wolf, "Smilodon", and the <a href="American%20lion">American lion</a> ("Panthera leo atrox") competed for the same prey. Their prey included <a href="Camelops">"yesterday's camel"</a> ("Camelops hesternus"), the <a href="Bison%20antiquus">Pleistocene bison</a> ("Bison antiquus"), the <a href="Capromeryx%20minor">"dwarf" pronghorn</a> ("Capromeryx minor"), the <a href="Equus%20occidentalis">western horse</a> ("Equus occidentalis"), and the <a href="Paramylodon">"grazing" ground sloth</a> ("Paramylodon harlani") native to North American grasslands. The <a href="Columbian%20mammoth">Columbian mammoth</a> ("Mammuthus columbi") and the <a href="American%20mastodon">American mastodon</a> ("Mammut americanum") were rare at LaBrea. The horses remained mixed feeders and the pronghorns mixed browsers, but at the Last Glacial Maximum and its associated shift in vegetation the camels and bison were forced to rely more heavily on conifers.

A study of isotope data of La Brea dire wolf fossils dated 10,000YBP provides evidence that the horse was an important prey species at the time, and that sloth, mastodon, bison, and camel were less common in the dire wolf diet. This indicates that the dire wolf was not a prey specialist, and at the close of the late Pleistocene before its extinction it was hunting or scavenging the most available herbivores.

A study of <a href="Canis%23Dentition%20and%20biteforce">"Canis" dentition</a> concluded that the dire wolf was the most advanced, or evolutionary derived, "Canis" species in the Americas. The dire wolf could be identified separately from all other "Canis" species by its possession of: "P2 with a posterior cusplet; P3 with two posterior cusplets; M1 with a mestascylid, entocristed, entoconulid, and a transverse crest extending from the metaconid to the hyperconular shelf; M2 with entocristed and entoconulid."

A study of the estimated bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for <a href="placental">placental</a> mammals the bite force at the canines (in <a href="newton%20%28unit%29">newtons</a>/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the <a href="African%20hunting%20dog">African hunting dog</a> (142), the <a href="gray%20wolf">gray wolf</a> (136), the <a href="dhole">dhole</a> (112), and the <a href="dingo">dingo</a> (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf was similar to that of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming <a href="spotted%20hyena">spotted hyena</a> (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.

A study of the <a href="Morphometrics%23Landmark-based%20geometric%20morphometrics">cranial measurements</a> and jaw muscles of dire wolves found no significant differences with modern gray wolves in all but 4 of 15 measures. Upper dentition was the same except that the dire wolf had larger dimensions, and the P4 had a relatively larger, more massive blade that enhanced slicing ability at the carnassial. The jaw of the dire wolf had a relatively broader and more massive <a href="temporalis">temporalis</a> muscle, able to generate slightly more bite force than the gray wolf. Due to the jaw arrangement, the dire wolf had less temporalis leverage than the gray wolf at the lower carnassial (m1) and lower p4, but the functional significance of this is not known. The lower premolars were relatively slightly larger than those of the gray wolf, and the dire wolf m1 was much larger and had more shearing ability. The dire wolf canines had greater bending strength than those of living canids of equivalent size and were similar to those of hyenas and felids. All these differences indicate that the dire wolf was able to deliver stronger bites than the gray wolf, and with its flexible and more rounded canines was better adapted for struggling with its prey.

At La Brea, predatory birds and mammals were attracted to dead or dying herbivores that had become mired, and then these predators became trapped themselves. Herbivore entrapment was estimated to have occurred once every fifty years, and for every instance of herbivore remains found in the pits there were an estimated ten carnivores. "C.d.guildayi" is the most common carnivoran found at LaBrea, followed by "Smilodon". Remains of dire wolves outnumber remains of gray wolves in the tar pits by a ratio of five to one. During the Last Glacial Maximum, coastal California, with a climate slightly cooler and wetter than today, is thought to have been a refuge, and a comparison of the frequency of dire wolves and other predator remains at LaBrea to other parts of California and North America indicates significantly greater abundances; therefore, the higher dire wolf numbers in the LaBrea region did not reflect the wider area. Assuming that only a few of the carnivores that were feeding became trapped, it is likely that fairly sizeable groups of dire wolves fed together on these occasions.
The difference between the male and female of a species apart from their sex organs is called <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, and in this regard little variance exists among the canids. A study of dire wolf remains dated 15,360–14,310YBP and taken from one pit that focused on skull length, canine tooth size, and lower molar length showed little dimorphism, similar to that of the gray wolf, indicating that dire wolves lived in monogamous pairs. Their large size and highly carnivorous dentition supports the proposal that the dire wolf was a predator that fed on large prey. To kill ungulates larger than themselves, the African wild dog, the dhole, and the gray wolf depend on their jaws as they cannot use their forelimbs to grapple with prey, and they work together as a pack consisting of an alpha pair and their offspring from the current and previous years. It can be assumed that dire wolves lived in packs of relatives that were led by an alpha pair. Large and social carnivores would have been successful at defending carcasses of prey trapped in the tar pits from smaller solitary predators, and thus the most likely to become trapped themselves. The many "C.d.guildayi" and "Smilodon" remains found in the tar pits suggests that both were social predators.

All social terrestrial mammalian predators prey mostly on terrestrial herbivorous mammals with a body mass similar to the combined mass of the social group members attacking the prey animal. The large size of the dire wolf provides an estimated prey size in the range. Stable isotope analysis of dire wolf bones provides evidence that they had a preference for consuming <a href="ruminants">ruminants</a> such as bison rather than other herbivores but moved to other prey when food became scarce, and occasionally scavenged on beached whales along the Pacific coast when available. A pack of timber wolves can bring down a moose that is their preferred prey, and a pack of dire wolves bringing down a bison is conceivable. Although some studies have suggested that because of tooth breakage, the dire wolf must have gnawed bones and may have been a scavenger, its widespread occurrence and the more gracile limbs of "C.d.dirus" indicate a predator. Like the gray wolf today, the dire wolf probably used its post-carnassial molars to gain access to marrow, but the dire wolf's larger size enabled it to crack larger bones.

Tooth breakage is related to a carnivore's behavior. A study of nine modern carnivores found that one in four adults had suffered tooth breakage and that half of these breakages were of the canine teeth. The most breakage occurred in the spotted hyena that consumes all of its prey including the bone; the least breakage occurred in the <a href="African%20wild%20dog">African wild dog</a>, and the gray wolf ranked in between these two. The eating of bone increases the risk of accidental fracture due to the relatively high, unpredictable stresses that it creates. The most commonly broken teeth are the canines, followed by the premolars, carnassial molars, and incisors. Canines are the teeth most likely to break because of their shape and function, which subjects them to bending stresses that are unpredictable in both direction and magnitude. The risk of tooth fracture is also higher when killing large prey.

A study of the fossil remains of large carnivores from LaBrea pits dated 36,000–10,000YBP shows tooth breakage rates of 5–17% for the dire wolf, coyote, American lion, and "Smilodon", compared to 0.5–2.7% for ten modern predators. These higher fracture rates were across all teeth, but the fracture rates for the canine teeth were the same as in modern carnivores. The dire wolf broke its incisors more often when compared to the modern gray wolf; thus, it has been proposed that the dire wolf used its incisors more closely to the bone when feeding. Dire wolf fossils from Mexico and Peru show a similar pattern of breakage. A 1993 study proposed that the higher frequency of tooth breakage among Pleistocene carnivores compared with living carnivores was not the result of hunting larger game, something that might be assumed from the larger size of the former. When there is low prey availability, the competition between carnivores increases, causing them to eat faster and thus consume more bone, leading to tooth breakage. As their prey became extinct around 10,000 years ago, so did these Pleistocene carnivores, except for the coyote (which is an <a href="omnivore">omnivore</a>).

A later La Brea pits study compared tooth breakage of dire wolves in two time periods. One pit contained fossil dire wolves dated 15,000YBP and another dated 13,000YBP. The results showed that the 15,000YBP dire wolves had three times more tooth breakage than the 13,000YBP dire wolves, whose breakage matched those of nine modern carnivores. The study concluded that between 15,000–14,000YBP prey availability was less or competition was higher for dire wolves, and that by 13,000YBP, as the prey species moved towards extinction, predator competition had declined and therefore the frequency of tooth breakage in dire wolves had also declined.

Carnivores include both <a href="pack%20hunter">pack hunter</a>s and solitary hunters. The solitary hunter depends on a powerful bite at the canine teeth to subdue their prey, and thus exhibits a strong <a href="mandibular%20symphysis">mandibular symphysis</a>. In contrast, a pack hunter, which delivers many shallower bites, has a comparably weaker mandibular symphysis. Thus, researchers can use the strength of the mandibular symphysis in fossil carnivore specimens to determine what kind of hunter it wasa pack hunter or a solitary hunterand even how it consumed its prey. The mandibles of canids are buttressed behind the carnassial teeth to enable the animals to crack bones with their post-carnassial teeth (molars M2 and M3). A study found that the mandible buttress profile of the dire wolf was lower than that of the gray wolf and the red wolf, but very similar to the coyote and the African hunting dog. The dorsoventrally weak symphyseal region (in comparison to premolars P3 and P4) of the dire wolf indicates that it delivered shallow bites similar to its modern relatives and was therefore a pack hunter. This suggests that the dire wolf may have processed bone but was not as well adapted for it as was the gray wolf. The fact that the incidence of fracture for the dire wolf reduced in frequency in the late Pleistocene to that of its modern relatives suggests that reduced competition had allowed the dire wolf to return to a feeding behavior involving a lower amount of bone consumption, a behavior for which it was best suited.

The results of a study of dental microwear on tooth enamel for specimens of the carnivore species from LaBrea pits, including dire wolves, suggest that these carnivores were not food-stressed just before their extinction. The evidence also indicated that the extent of carcass utilization (i.e., amount consumed relative to the maximum amount possible to consume, including breakup and consumption of bones) was less than among large carnivores today. These finding indicates that tooth breakage was related to hunting behavior and the size of prey.

Past studies proposed that changes in dire wolf body size correlated with climate fluctuations. A later study compared dire wolf craniodental morphology from four LaBrea pits, each representing four different time periods. The results are evidence of a change in dire wolf size, dental wear and breakage, skull shape, and snout shape across time. Dire wolf body size had decreased between the start of the Last Glacial Maximum and near its ending at the warm <a href="Aller%C3%B8d%20oscillation">Allerød oscillation</a>. Evidence of food stress (food scarcity leading to lower nutrient intake) is seen in smaller body size, skulls with a larger cranial base and shorter snout (shape <a href="neoteny">neoteny</a> and size neoteny), and more tooth breakage and wear. Dire wolves dated 17,900YBP showed all of these features, which indicates food stress. Dire wolves dated 28,000YBP also showed to a degree many of these features but were the largest wolves studied, and it was proposed that these wolves were also suffering from food stress and that wolves earlier than this date were even bigger in size. Nutrient stress is likely to lead to stronger bite forces to more fully consume carcasses and to crack bones, and with changes to skull shape to improve mechanical advantage. North American climate records reveal cyclic fluctuations during the glacial period that included rapid warming followed by gradual cooling, called <a href="Dansgaard%E2%80%93Oeschger%20event">Dansgaard–Oeschger event</a>s. These cycles would have caused increased temperature and aridity, and at LaBrea would have caused ecological stress and therefore food stress. A similar trend was found with the gray wolf, which in the Santa Barbara basin was originally massive, robust, and possibly <a href="Convergent%20evolution">convergent</a> with the dire wolf, but was replaced by more gracile forms by the start of the Holocene.

Just before the appearance of the dire wolf, North America was invaded by the genus "<a href="Xenocyon">Xenocyon</a>" (ancestor of the Asian dhole and the African hunting dog) that was as large as the dire wolf and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare, and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived dire wolf. Stable isotope analysis provides evidence that the dire wolf, "Smilodon", and the American lion competed for the same prey. Other large carnivores included the extinct North American giant <a href="short-faced%20bear">short-faced bear</a> ("Arctodus simus"), the modern <a href="cougar">cougar</a> ("Puma concolor"), the <a href="Pleistocene%20coyote">Pleistocene coyote</a> ("Canis latrans"), and the Pleistocene gray wolf that was more massive and robust than today. These predators may have competed with humans who hunted for similar prey.

Specimens that have been identified by morphology as <a href="Beringian%20wolf">Beringian wolves</a> ("C.lupus") and radiocarbon dated 25,800–14,300 YBP have been found in the <a href="Natural%20Trap%20Cave">Natural Trap Cave</a> at the base of the <a href="Bighorn%20Mountains">Bighorn Mountains</a> in <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, in the western United States. The location is directly south of what would at that time have been a division between the <a href="Laurentide%20Ice%20Sheet">Laurentide Ice Sheet</a> and the <a href="Cordilleran%20Ice%20Sheet">Cordilleran Ice Sheet</a>. A temporary channel between the glaciers may have existed that allowed these large, Alaskan direct competitors of the dire wolf, which were also adapted for preying on megafauna, to come south of the ice sheets. Dire wolves were absent north of 42°Nlatitude in the Late Pleistocene; therefore, this region would have been available for Beringian wolves to expand south along the glacier line. How widely they were then distributed is not known. These also became extinct at the end of the Late Pleistocene, as did the dire wolf.

Dire wolf remains have been found across a broad range of habitats including the plains, grasslands, and some forested mountain areas of North America, and in the arid savannah of South America. The sites range in elevation from sea level to . The location of these fossil remains suggests that dire wolves lived predominantly in the open lowlands along with its prey the large herbivores. Dire wolf remains do not occur at high latitudes, unlike its close relative the gray wolf.

In the United States, dire wolf fossils have been reported in Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wyoming, and Nevada. The identity of fossils reported farther north than California is not confirmed. There have been five reports of unconfirmed dire wolf fossils north of 42°Nlatitude at <a href="Fossil%20Lake%20%28Oregon%29">Fossil Lake, Oregon</a> (125,000–10,000YBP), <a href="American%20Falls%20Reservoir">American Falls Reservoir, Idaho</a> (125,000–75,000YBP), Salamander Cave, South Dakota (250,000YBP), and four closely grouped sites in northern Nebraska (250,000YBP). This suggests a range restriction on dire wolves due to temperature, prey, or habitat. The major fossil-producing sites for "C.d.dirus" are located east of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rocky Mountains</a> and include Friesenhahn Cave, near San Antonio, Texas; Carroll Cave, near Richland, Missouri; and <a href="Reddick%2C%20Florida">Reddick, Florida</a>.

Localities in Mexico where dire wolf remains have been collected include ElCedazo in <a href="Aguascalientes">Aguascalientes</a>, <a href="Comond%C3%BA%20Municipality">Comondú Municipality</a> in <a href="Baja%20California%20Sur">Baja California Sur</a>, ElCedral in <a href="San%20Luis%20Potos%C3%AD">San Luis Potosí</a>, ElTajo Quarry near <a href="Tequixquiac">Tequixquiac</a>, <a href="state%20of%20Mexico">state of Mexico</a>, Valsequillo in <a href="Puebla">Puebla</a>, <a href="Lago%20de%20Chapala">Lago de Chapala</a> in <a href="Jalisco">Jalisco</a>, <a href="Loltun%20Cave">Loltun Cave</a> in <a href="Yucat%C3%A1n">Yucatán</a>, Potrecito in <a href="Sinaloa">Sinaloa</a>, San Josecito Cave near <a href="Aramberri">Aramberri</a> in <a href="Nuevo%20Le%C3%B3n">Nuevo León</a> and Térapa in <a href="Sonora">Sonora</a>. The specimens from Térapa were confirmed as "C.d.guildayi". The finds at San Josecito Cave and ElCedazo have the greatest number of individuals from a single locality.

In South America, dire wolves have been dated younger than 17,000 YBP and reported from only three localities: Muaco in <a href="Falc%C3%B3n">Falcón</a> state, <a href="Venezuela">Venezuela</a>; <a href="Talara%20Province">Talara Province</a> in <a href="Peru">Peru</a>; and <a href="Tarija%20Department">Tarija Department</a> in <a href="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>. If the dire wolf originated in North America, the species likely dispersed into South America via the Andean corridor, a proposed pathway for temperate mammals to migrate from Central to South America because of the favorable cool, dry, and open habitats that characterized the region at times. This most likely happened during a glacial period because the pathway then consisted of open, arid regions and savanna, whereas during inter-glacial periods it would have consisted of tropical rain forest.

During the <a href="Quaternary%20extinction%20event">American megafaunal extinction event</a> around 12,700YBP, 90genera of mammals weighing over became extinct. The extinction of the large carnivores and scavengers is thought to have been caused by the extinction of the megaherbivore prey upon which they depended. The cause of the extinction of the megafauna is debated but has been attributed to the impact of <a href="climate%20change">climate change</a>, <a href="competition%20%28biology%29">competition</a> with other species including <a href="overexploitation">overexploitation</a> by newly arrived human hunters, or a combination of both. One study proposes that several extinction models should be investigated because so little is known about the biogeography of the dire wolf and its potential competitors and prey, nor how all these species interacted and responded to the environmental changes that occurred at the time of extinction.

Ancient DNA and radiocarbon data indicates that local genetic populations were replaced by others within the same species or by others within the same genus. Both the dire wolf and the Beringian wolf went extinct in North America, leaving only the less carnivorous and more gracile form of the wolf to thrive, which may have outcompeted the dire wolf. Dire wolf remains having the youngest geological ages are dated at 9,440YBP at Brynjulfson Cave, <a href="Boone%20County%2C%20Missouri">Boone County, Missouri</a>, 9,860YBP at Rancho La Brea, California, and 10,690YBP at <a href="La%20Mirada%2C%20California">La Mirada, California</a>. Dire wolf remains have been radiocarbon dated to 8,200YBP from <a href="Whitewater%20Draw">Whitewater Draw</a> in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, However, one author has stated that radiocarbon dating of bone carbonate is known to be unreliable, and that while many dire wolf remains are found in fossil assemblages dated to the terminal Pleistocene, there are no confirmed Holocene finds.

Campaign history of the Roman military

From its origin as a city-state on the peninsula of <a href="History%20of%20Italy%20during%20Roman%20times">Italy</a> in the 8th century BC, to its rise as an <a href="Roman%20Empire">empire</a> covering much of <a href="Southern%20Europe">Southern Europe</a>, <a href="Western%20Europe">Western Europe</a>, the <a href="Middle%20East">Middle East</a> and <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a> to its fall in the 5th century AD, the political history of <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a> was closely entwined with its <a href="military%20history">military history</a>. The core of the campaign history of the Roman military is an aggregate of different accounts of the <a href="Roman%20military">Roman military</a>'s land battles, from its initial defense against and subsequent conquest of the city's hilltop neighbors on the <a href="Italian%20peninsula">Italian peninsula</a>, to the ultimate struggle of the <a href="Western%20Roman%20Empire">Western Roman Empire</a> for its existence against invading <a href="Hun">Hun</a>s, <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> and <a href="Germanic%20Wars">Germanic tribes</a>. These accounts were written by various authors throughout and after the history of the Empire. Following the <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First Punic War</a>, <a href="naval%20warfare">naval battles</a> were less significant than land battles to the military history of Rome due to its encompassment of lands of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">periphery</a> and its unchallenged dominance of the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>.

The Roman army battled first against its tribal neighbours and <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan</a> towns within Italy, and later came to dominate the Mediterranean and at its height the provinces of <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britannia</a> and <a href="History%20of%20Anatolia">Asia Minor</a>. As with most ancient civilizations, Rome's military served the triple purpose of securing its borders, exploiting peripheral areas through measures such as imposing <a href="tribute">tribute</a> on conquered peoples, and maintaining internal order. From the outset, Rome's military typified this pattern, and the majority of Rome's campaigns were characterised by one of two types. The first is the territorial <a href="expansionist">expansionist</a> campaign, normally begun as a counter-offensive, in which each victory brought subjugation of large areas of territory and allowed Rome to grow from a small town to a population of 55 million in the early empire when expansion was halted. The second is the <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a>, which plagued Rome from its foundation to its eventual demise.

Roman armies were not invincible, despite their formidable reputation and host of victories, Romans "produced their share of incompetents" who led Roman armies into catastrophic defeats. Nevertheless, it was generally the fate of even the greatest of Rome's enemies, such as <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus</a> and <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>, to win the battle but lose the war. The history of Rome's campaigning is, if nothing else, a history of obstinate persistence overcoming appalling losses.

Knowledge of Roman history stands apart from other civilizations in the ancient world. Its chronicles, military and otherwise, document <a href="Founding%20of%20Rome">the city's very foundation</a> to its <a href="Decline%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">eventual demise</a>. Although some histories have been lost, such as <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a>'s account of the <a href="Trajan%27s%20Dacian%20Wars">Dacian Wars</a>, and others, such as Rome's earliest histories, are at least semi-<a href="apocryphal">apocryphal</a>, the extant histories of Rome's military history are extensive.

Rome's earliest history, from the time of its founding as a small tribal village, to the downfall of its kings, is the least well preserved. Although the early Romans were literate to some degree, this void may be due to the lack of will to record their history at that time, or such histories as they did record were lost.

Although the Roman historian <a href="Livy">Livy</a> (59 BC – 17 AD) lists a series of seven kings of early Rome in his work "<a href="Ab%20urbe%20condita%20libri%20%28Livy%29">Ab urbe condita</a>", from its establishment through its earliest years, the first four kings (<a href="Romulus">Romulus</a>, <a href="Numa%20Pompilius">Numa</a>, <a href="Tullus%20Hostilius">Tullus Hostilius</a> and <a href="Ancus%20Marcius">Ancus Marcius</a>) may be apocryphal. A number of points of view have been proposed. <a href="Michael%20Grant%20%28author%29">Grant</a> and others argue that prior to the establishment of the <a href="Etruscan%20civilisation">Etruscan</a> kingdom of Rome under the traditional fifth king, <a href="Tarquinius%20Priscus">Tarquinius Priscus</a>, Rome would have been led by a religious leader of some sort. Very little is known of Rome's military history from this era, and what history has come down to us is more of a <a href="legend">legend</a>ary than of factual nature. Traditionally, Romulus, after founding the city, fortified the <a href="Palatine%20Hill">Palatine Hill</a>, and shortly thereafter, Rome was ""equal to any of the surrounding cities in her prowess in war"".

The first of the campaigns fought by the Romans in this legendary account are the <a href="The%20Rape%20of%20the%20Sabine%20Women%23War%20with%20the%20Latins%20and%20Sabines%20after%20the%20Rape%20of%20the%20Sabine%20Women">wars with various Latin cities and the Sabines</a>. According to Livy, the Latin village of Caenina responded to the event of the abduction of the Sabine women by invading Roman territory, but were routed and their village captured. The Latins of <a href="Antemnae">Antemnae</a> and those of <a href="Crustumerium">Crustumerium</a> were defeated next in a similar fashion. The remaining main body of the <a href="Sabines">Sabines</a> attacked Rome and briefly captured the citadel, but were then convinced to conclude a treaty with the Romans under which the Sabines became Roman citizens.

There was a further war in the 8th century BC against <a href="Roman-Etruscan%20Wars%23War%20with%20Fidenae%20and%20Veii%20under%20Romulus">Fidenae and Veii</a>. In the 7th century BC there was a <a href="Alba%20Longa%23Alban%20war%20with%20Rome">war with Alba Longa</a>, a <a href="Roman-Etruscan%20Wars%23Second%20War%20with%20Fidenae%20and%20Veii.2C%20under%20Tullus%20Hostilius">second war with Fidenae and Veii</a> and a <a href="Roman-Sabine%20wars%23War%20with%20Tullus%20Hostilius">second Sabine War</a>. Ancus Marcius led Rome to <a href="Latin%20league%23First%20war%20with%20Rome">victory</a> against the Latins and, according to the <a href="Fasti%20Triumphales">Fasti Triumphales</a>, over the <a href="Veii">Veientes</a> and <a href="Sabines">Sabines</a> also.

<a href="Lucius%20Tarquinius%20Priscus">Lucius Tarquinius Priscus</a>' first war was waged against the <a href="Latin%20League%23War%20with%20Rome%20under%20Tarquinius%20Priscus">Latins</a>. Tarquinius took the Latin town of <a href="Apiolae">Apiolae</a> by storm and took great booty from there back to Rome. According to the "<a href="Fasti%20Triumphales">Fasti Triumphales</a>", the war occurred prior to 588 BC.

His military ability was tested by an <a href="Roman-Sabine%20wars%23War%20with%20Tarquinius%20Priscus">attack</a> from the <a href="Sabines">Sabines</a>. Tarquinius doubled the numbers of <a href="equites">equites</a> to help the war effort, and defeat the Sabines. In the peace negotiations that followed, Tarquinius received the town of <a href="Collatia">Collatia</a> and appointed his nephew, <a href="Arruns%20Tarquinius%20%28Egerius%29">Arruns Tarquinius</a>, also known as "Egerius", as commander of the garrison which he stationed in that city. Tarquinius returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph for his victories that, according to the "Fasti Triumphales", occurred on 13 September 585 BC.

Subsequently, the Latin cities of <a href="Corniculum%20%28ancient%20Latin%20town%29">Corniculum</a>, old <a href="Ficulea%20%28ancient%20Latin%20town%29">Ficulea</a>, <a href="Cameria">Cameria</a>, <a href="Crustumerium">Crustumerium</a>, <a href="Ameriola">Ameriola</a>, <a href="Medullia">Medullia</a> and <a href="Nomentum">Nomentum</a> were subdued and became Roman.

Early in his reign, <a href="Servius%20Tullius">Servius Tullius</a> <a href="Roman-Etruscan%20Wars%23War%20with%20Veii%20and%20the%20Etruscans.2C%20under%20Servius%20Tullius">warred</a> against Veii and the Etruscans. He is said to have shown valour in the campaign, and to have routed a great army of the enemy. The war helped him to cement his position at Rome. According to the "<a href="Fasti%20Triumphales">Fasti Triumphales</a>", Servius celebrated three <a href="Roman%20triumph">triumphs</a> over the Etruscans, including on 25 November 571 BC and 25 May 567 BC (the date of the third triumph is not legible on the "Fasti").

Early in his reign <a href="Tarquinius%20Superbus">Tarquinius Superbus</a>, Rome's seventh and final king, called a meeting of the <a href="Latin%20League">Latin</a> leaders at which he persuaded them to renew their treaty with Rome and become her allies rather than her enemies, and it was agreed that the troops of the Latins would attend at a grove sacred to the goddess <a href="Ferentina">Ferentina</a> on an appointed day to form a united military force with the troops of Rome. This was done, and Tarquin formed combined units of Roman and Latin troops.

Tarquin next began a <a href="Volsci%23Conflict%20with%20ancient%20Rome">war</a> against the <a href="Volsci">Volsci</a>. He took the wealthy town of <a href="Suessa%20Pometia">Suessa Pometia</a>, with the spoils of which he commenced the erection of the <a href="Temple%20of%20Jupiter%20Optimus%20Maximus">Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus</a> which his father had vowed. He also celebrated a triumph for his victory.

He was next engaged in a <a href="Gabii%23War%20with%20Rome%20under%20Tarquinius%20Superbus">war</a> with <a href="Gabii">Gabii</a>, one of the Latin cities, which had rejected the Latin treaty with Rome. Unable to take the city by force of arms, Tarquin had his son, <a href="Sextus%20Tarquinius">Sextus Tarquinius</a>, infiltrate the city, gain the trust of its people and command of its army. In time he killed or exiled the city's leaders, and handed control of the city over to his father.

Tarquin also agreed to a peace with the <a href="Aequi">Aequi</a>, and renewed the treaty of peace between Rome and the <a href="Etruscans">Etruscans</a>. According to the <a href="Fasti%20Triumphales">Fasti Triumphales</a>, Tarquin also won a victory over the <a href="Sabines">Sabines</a>.

Tarquinius later went to <a href="Rutuli%23War%20with%20Rome%20under%20Tarquinius%20Superbus">war</a> with the <a href="Rutuli">Rutuli</a>. According to Livy, the Rutuli were, at that time, a very wealthy nation. Tarquinius was desirous of obtaining the booty which would come with victory over the Rutuli. Tarquin unsuccessfully sought to take the Rutulian capital, <a href="Ardea%2C%20Lazio">Ardea</a>, by storm, and subsequently began an extensive siege of the city. The war was interrupted by the revolution which overthrew the Roman monarchy. The Roman army, camped outside Ardea, welcomed <a href="Lucius%20Junius%20Brutus">Lucius Junius Brutus</a> as their new leader, and expelled the king's sons. It is unclear what was the outcome of the siege, or indeed the war.

The first non-apocryphal Roman wars were wars of both expansion and defence, aimed at protecting Rome itself from neighbouring cities and nations and establishing its territory in the region. Florus writes that at this time "their neighbours, on every side, were continually harassing them, as they had no land of their own ... and as they were situated, as it were, at the junction of the roads to Latium and Eturia, and, at whatever gate they went out, were sure to meet a foe."

In the semi-legendary period of the early republic, sources record Rome was twice attacked by Etruscan armies. About 509 BC <a href="Roman-Etruscan%20Wars%23War%20with%20Veii%20and%20Tarquinii.2C%20after%20the%20overthrow%20of%20the%20monarchy%20in%20509%20BC">war with Veii and Tarquinii</a> was said to have been instigated by the recently overthrown king Tarquinius Superbus. Again in 508 BC Tarquin persuaded the king of <a href="Clusium">Clusium</a>, <a href="Lars%20Porsenna">Lars Porsenna</a>, to wage <a href="Roman-Etruscan%20Wars%23War%20with%20Clusium%20in%20508%20BC">war</a> on Rome, resulting in a siege of Rome and afterwards a peace treaty.

Initially, Rome's immediate neighbours were either <a href="Latins%20%28Italic%20tribe%29">Latin</a> towns and villages on a tribal system similar to that of Rome, or else tribal Sabines from the Apennine hills beyond. One by one, Rome defeated both the persistent Sabines and the local cities that were either under Etruscan control or else Latin towns that had cast off their Etruscan rulers, as had Rome. Rome defeated the <a href="Lavinium">Lavinii</a> and <a href="Tusculum">Tusculi</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Regillus">Battle of Lake Regillus</a> in 496 BC, were defeated by the <a href="Veii">Veientes</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Cremera">Battle of the Cremera</a> in 477 BC, the <a href="Sabines">Sabines</a> in an unnamed battle in 449 BC, the <a href="Aequi">Aequi</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Algidus">Battle of Mount Algidus</a> in 458 BC, the Aequi and <a href="Volsci">Volsci</a> in 446 BC, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Corbio">Battle of Corbio</a>, in 446 BC the <a href="Aurunci">Aurunci</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aricia">Battle of Aricia</a>, the <a href="Capture%20of%20Fidenae">Capture of Fidenae</a> in 435 BC and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Veii">Siege of Veii</a> in 396 BC, and the <a href="Capture%20of%20Antium">Capture of Antium</a> in 377 BC. After defeating the Veientes, the Romans had effectively completed the conquest of their immediate Etruscan neighbours, as well as secured their position against the immediate threat posed by the tribespeople of the Apennine hills.

However, Rome still controlled only a very limited area and the affairs of Rome were minor even to those in Italy and Rome's affairs were only just coming to the attention of the Greeks, the dominant cultural force at the time. At this point the bulk of Italy remained in the hands of <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="Sabine">Sabine</a>, <a href="Samnium">Samnite</a> and other peoples in the central part of Italy, <a href="Ancient%20Greeks">Greek</a> colonies to the south, and the <a href="Celts">Celtic people</a>, including the <a href="Gauls">Gauls</a>, to the north.

By 390 BC, several Gallic tribes had begun invading Italy from the north as their culture expanded throughout Europe. Most of this was unknown to the Romans at this time, who still had purely local security concerns, but the Romans were alerted when a particularly warlike tribe, the <a href="Senones">Senones</a>, invaded the Etruscan province of Siena from the north and attacked the town of <a href="Clusium">Clusium</a>, not far from Rome's sphere of influence. The Clusians, overwhelmed by the size of the enemy in numbers and ferocity, called on Rome for help. Perhaps unintentionally the Romans found themselves not just in conflict with the Senones, but their primary target. The Romans met them in pitched battle at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Allia">Battle of the Allia</a> around 390–387 BC. The Gauls, under their chieftain <a href="Brennus%20%284th%20century%20BC%29">Brennus</a>, defeated the Roman army of around 15,000 troops and proceeded to pursue the fleeing Romans back to Rome itself and partially sacked the town before being either driven off or bought off.

Now that the Romans and Gauls had blooded one another, intermittent <a href="Roman-Gallic%20wars">Roman-Gallic wars</a> were to continue between the two in Italy for more than two centuries, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Vadimo%20%28283%20BC%29">Battle of Lake Vadimo</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Faesulae">Battle of Faesulae</a> in 225 BC, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Telamon">Battle of Telamon</a> in 224 BC, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Clastidium">Battle of Clastidium</a> in 222 BC, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cremona%20%28200%20BC%29">Battle of Cremona</a> in 200 BC, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mutina%20%28194%20BC%29">Battle of Mutina</a> in 194 BC, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arausio">Battle of Arausio</a> in 105 BC, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vercellae">Battle of Vercellae</a> in 101 BC. The Celtic problem would not be resolved for Rome until the final subjugation of all Gaul following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alesia">Battle of Alesia</a> in 52 BC.

After swiftly recovering from the sack of Rome, the Romans immediately resumed their expansion within Italy. Despite their successes, their mastery of the whole of Italy was by no means assured. The <a href="Samnites">Samnites</a> were a people just as martial and as rich as the Romans and had the objective of their own to secure more lands in the fertile Italian plains on which Rome itself lay. The <a href="First%20Samnite%20War">First Samnite War</a> of between 343 BC and 341 BC that followed widespread Samnite incursions into Rome's territory was a relatively short affair: the Romans beat the Samnites in both the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mount%20Gaurus">Battle of Mount Gaurus</a> in 342 BC and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Suessula">Battle of Suessula</a> in 341 BC but were forced to withdraw from the war before they could pursue the conflict further due to the revolt of several of their Latin allies in the <a href="Latin%20War">Latin War</a>.

Rome was therefore forced to contend by around 340 BC against both Samnite incursions into their territory and, simultaneously, in a bitter war against their former allies. Rome bested the Latins in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vesuvius">Battle of Vesuvius</a> and again in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Trifanum">Battle of Trifanum</a>, after which the Latin cities were obliged to submit to Roman rule. Perhaps due to Rome's lenient treatment of their defeated foe, the Latins submitted largely amicably to Roman rule for the next 200 years.

The <a href="Second%20Samnite%20War">Second Samnite War</a>, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a much longer and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites, running for over twenty years and incorporating twenty-four battles that led to massive casualties on both sides. The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course: the Samnites seized Neapolis in the <a href="Capture%20of%20Neapolis">Capture of Neapolis</a> in 327 BC, which the Romans then re-captured before losing at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Caudine%20Forks">Battle of the Caudine Forks</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lautulae">Battle of Lautulae</a>. The Romans then proved victorious at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bovianum">Battle of Bovianum</a> and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to <a href="Suing%20for%20peace">sue for peace</a> with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. This pattern of meeting aggression in force and so inadvertently gaining territory in strategic counter-attacks was to become a common feature of Roman military history.

Seven years after their defeat, with Roman dominance of the area looking assured, the Samnites rose again and defeated the Romans at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Camerinum">Battle of Camerinum</a> in 298 BC, to open the <a href="Third%20Samnite%20War">Third Samnite War</a>. With this success in hand they managed to bring together a coalition of several previous enemies of Rome, all of whom were probably keen to prevent any one faction dominating the entire region. The army that faced the Romans at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Sentinum">Battle of Sentinum</a> in 295 BC included Samnites, Gauls, Etruscans and Umbrians. When the Roman army won a convincing victory over these combined forces it must have become clear that little could prevent Roman dominance of Italy and in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Populonia">Battle of Populonia</a> (282 BC) Rome destroyed the last vestiges of Etruscan power in the region.

By the beginning of the 3rd century, Rome had established itself in 282 BC as a major power on the <a href="Italian%20Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a>, but had not yet come into conflict with the dominant military powers in the <a href="Mediterranean%20Basin">Mediterranean</a> at the time: <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthage</a> and the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek kingdoms</a>. Rome had all but completely defeated the <a href="Samnites">Samnites</a>, mastered its fellow Latin towns, and greatly reduced <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan</a> power in the region. However, the south of Italy was controlled by the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> colonies of <a href="Magna%20Grecia">Magna Grecia</a> who had been allied to the Samnites, and continued <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Italy">Roman expansion</a> brought the two into inevitable conflict.

In the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Thurii">Battle of Thurii</a>, <a href="Taranto">Tarentum</a> appealed for military aid to <a href="Pyrrhus%20of%20Epirus">Pyrrhus</a>, ruler of <a href="Epirus">Epirus</a>. Motivated by his diplomatic obligations to Tarentum, and a personal desire for military accomplishment, Pyrrhus landed a Greek army of some 25,000 men and a contingent of <a href="war%20elephant">war elephant</a>s on Italian soil in 280 BC, where his forces were joined by some Greek colonists and a portion of the <a href="Samnites">Samnites</a> who revolted against Roman control, taking up arms against Rome for the fourth time in seventy years.

The Roman army had not yet seen elephants in battle, and their inexperience turned the tide in Pyrrhus' favour at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Heraclea">Battle of Heraclea</a> in 280 BC, and again at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ausculum">Battle of Ausculum</a> in 279 BC. Despite these victories, Pyrrhus found his position in Italy untenable. Rome steadfastly refused to negotiate with Pyrrhus as long as his army remained in Italy. Furthermore, Rome entered into a treaty of support with <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthage</a>, and Pyrrhus found that despite his expectations, none of the other <a href="Ancient%20Italic%20peoples">Italic peoples</a> would defect to the Greek and Samnite cause. Facing <a href="Pyrrhic%20victory">unacceptably heavy losses</a> with each encounter with the Roman army, and failing to find further allies in Italy, Pyrrhus withdrew from the peninsula and campaigned in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> against Carthage, abandoning his allies to deal with the Romans.

When his Sicilian campaign was also ultimately a failure, and at the request of his Italian allies, Pyrrhus returned to Italy to face Rome once more. In 275 BC, Pyrrhus again met the Roman army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beneventum%20%28275%20BC%29">Battle of Beneventum</a>. This time the Romans had devised methods to deal with the war elephants, including the use of javelins, fire and, one source claims, simply hitting the elephants heavily on the head. While Beneventum was indecisive, Pyrrhus realised that his army had been exhausted and reduced by years of foreign campaigns, and seeing little hope for further gains, he withdrew completely from Italy.

The conflicts with Pyrrhus would have a great effect on Rome. It had shown that it was capable of pitting its armies successfully against the dominant military powers of the Mediterranean, and further showed that the Greek kingdoms were incapable of defending their colonies in Italy and abroad. Rome quickly moved into southern Italia, subjugating and dividing Magna Grecia. Effectively dominating the Italian peninsula, and with a proven international military reputation, Rome now began to look to expand from the Italian mainland. Since the Alps formed a natural barrier to the north, and Rome was none too keen to meet the fierce Gauls in battle once more, the city's gaze turned to Sicily and the islands of the Mediterranean, a policy that would bring it into direct conflict with its former ally <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthage</a>.

Rome first began to make war outside the Italian peninsula during the <a href="Punic%20wars">Punic wars</a> against <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthage</a>, a former <a href="Phoenicia">Phoenicia</a>n colony that had established on the north coast of Africa and developed into a powerful state. These wars, starting in 264 BC were probably the largest conflicts of the ancient world yet and saw Rome become the most powerful state of the Western Mediterranean, with territory in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a>, <a href="North%20Africa">North Africa</a>, <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberia</a>, and with the end of the <a href="Macedonian%20wars">Macedonian wars</a> (which ran concurrently with the Punic wars) <a href="Greece">Greece</a> as well. After the defeat of the Seleucid Emperor <a href="Antiochus%20III%20the%20Great">Antiochus III the Great</a> in the <a href="Roman-Syrian%20War">Roman-Syrian War</a> (Treaty of Apamea, 188 BC) in the eastern sea, Rome emerged as the dominant Mediterranean power and the most powerful city in the classical world.

The <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First Punic War</a> began in 264 BC when settlements on Sicily began to appeal to the two powers between which they lay – Rome and Carthage – in order to solve internal conflicts. The willingness of both Rome and Carthage to become embroiled on the soil of a third party may indicate a willingness to test each other's power without wishing to enter a full war of annihilation; certainly there was considerable disagreement within Rome about whether to prosecute the war at all. The war saw land battles in Sicily early on, such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Agrigentum">Battle of Agrigentum</a>, but the theatre shifted to naval battles around Sicily and Africa. For the Romans, naval warfare was a relatively unexplored concept. Before the <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First Punic War</a> in 264 BC there was no Roman navy to speak of, as all previous Roman wars had been fought on land in <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. The new war in <a href="Sicily">Sicily</a> against <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthage</a>, a great naval power, forced Rome to quickly build a fleet and train sailors.

Rome took to naval warfare "like a brick to water" and the first few naval battles of the <a href="First%20Punic%20War">First Punic War</a> such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Lipari%20Islands">Battle of the Lipari Islands</a> were catastrophic disasters for <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, as might fairly be expected from a city that had no real prior experience of naval warfare. However, after training more sailors and inventing a grappling engine known as a <a href="Corvus%20%28weapon%29">Corvus</a>, a Roman naval force under C. Duillius was able to roundly defeat a Carthaginian fleet at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mylae">Battle of Mylae</a>. In just four years, a state without any real naval experience had managed to better a major regional maritime power in battle. Further naval victories followed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tyndaris">Battle of Tyndaris</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cape%20Ecnomus">Battle of Cape Ecnomus</a>.

After having won control of the seas, a Roman force landed on the African coast under <a href="Marcus%20Atilius%20Regulus">Marcus Regulus</a>, who was at first victorious, winning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adys">Battle of Adys</a> and forcing Carthage to sue for peace. However, the terms of peace that Rome proposed were so heavy that negotiations failed, and in response, the Carthaginians hired <a href="Xanthippus%20of%20Carthage">Xanthippus of Carthage</a>, a mercenary from the martial Greek city-state of Sparta, to reorganise and lead their army. Xanthippus managed to cut off the Roman army from its base by re-establishing Carthaginian naval supremacy and then defeated and captured Regulus at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tunis">Battle of Tunis</a>.

Despite being defeated on African soil, the Romans with their newfound naval abilities, roundly beat the Carthaginians in naval battle again – largely through the tactical innovations of the Roman fleet – at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Aegates%20Islands">Battle of the Aegates Islands</a>. Carthage was left without a fleet or sufficient coin to raise a new one. For a maritime power, the loss of their access to the Mediterranean stung financially and psychologically, and the Carthaginians again sued for peace, during which negotiations, Rome battled the "Ligures" tribe in the Ligurian War and the "Insubres" in the <a href="Gallic%20War">Gallic War</a>.

Continuing distrust led to the renewal of hostilities in the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a> when <a href="Hannibal%20Barca">Hannibal Barca</a>, a member of the <a href="Barcid">Barcid</a> family of Carthaginian nobility, attacked <a href="Saguntum">Saguntum</a>, a city with diplomatic ties to Rome. Hannibal then raised an army in Iberia and famously crossed the Italian Alps with elephants to invade Italy. In the first battle on Italian soil at <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Ticinus">Ticinus</a> in 218 BC Hannibal defeated the Romans under <a href="Publius%20Cornelius%20Scipio">Scipio the Elder</a> in a small cavalry fight. Hannibal's success continued with victories in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Trebia">Battle of the Trebia</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Trasimene">Battle of Lake Trasimene</a>, where he ambushed an unsuspecting Roman army, and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cannae">Battle of Cannae</a>, in what is considered one of the great masterpieces of tactical art, and for a while "Hannibal seemed invincible", able to beat Roman armies at will.

In the three battles of Nola, Roman general <a href="Marcus%20Claudius%20Marcellus">Marcus Claudius Marcellus</a> managed to hold off Hannibal but then Hannibal smashed a succession of Roman consular armies at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Capua">First Battle of Capua</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Silarus">Battle of the Silarus</a>, the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Herdonia">Second Battle of Herdonia</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Numistro">Battle of Numistro</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Asculum%20%28209%20BC%29">Battle of Asculum</a>. By this time Hannibal's brother <a href="Hasdrubal%20Barca">Hasdrubal Barca</a> sought to cross the Alps into Italy and join his brother with a second army. Despite being defeated in Iberia in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Baecula">Battle of Baecula</a>, Hasdrubal managed to break through into Italy only to be defeated decisively by <a href="Gaius%20Claudius%20Nero">Gaius Claudius Nero</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Livius%20Salinator">Marcus Livius Salinator</a> on the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Metaurus">Metaurus River</a>.

Unable to defeat Hannibal himself on Italian soil, and with Hannibal savaging the Italian countryside but unwilling or unable to destroy Rome itself, the Romans boldly sent an army to Africa with the intention of threatening the Carthaginian capital. In 203 BC at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bagbrades">Battle of Bagbrades</a> the invading Roman army under <a href="Scipio%20Africanus%20Major">Scipio Africanus Major</a> defeated the Carthaginian army of <a href="Hasdrubal%20Gisco">Hasdrubal Gisco</a> and <a href="Syphax">Syphax</a> and Hannibal was recalled to Africa. At the famous <a href="Battle%20of%20Zama">Battle of Zama</a> Scipio decisively defeated – perhaps even "annihilated" – <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a>'s army in North Africa, ending the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>.

Carthage never managed to recover after the Second Punic War and the <a href="Third%20Punic%20War">Third Punic War</a> that followed was in reality a simple punitive mission to raze the city of Carthage to the ground. Carthage was almost defenceless and when besieged offered immediate surrender, conceding to a string of outrageous Roman demands. The Romans refused the surrender, demanding as their further terms of surrender the complete destruction of the city and, seeing little to lose, the Carthaginians prepared to fight. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carthage%20%28c.149%20BC%29">Battle of Carthage</a> the city was stormed after a short siege and completely destroyed, its culture "almost totally extinguished".

Rome's conflict with the <a href="Ancient%20Carthage">Carthaginian</a>s in the <a href="Punic%20Wars">Punic Wars</a> led them into expansion in the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a> of modern-day <a href="Spain">Spain</a> and <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. The Punic empire of the Carthaginian <a href="Barcids">Barcid family</a> consisted of territories in Iberia, many of which Rome gained control of during the Punic Wars. Italy remained the main theatre of war for much of the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a>, but the Romans also aimed to destroy the Barcid Empire in Iberia and prevent major Punic allies from linking up with forces in Italy.

Over the years, Rome had expanded along the southern Iberian coast until in 211 BC it captured the city of <a href="Saguntum">Saguntum</a>. Following two major military expeditions to Iberia, the Romans finally crushed Carthaginian control of the peninsula in 206 BC, at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ilipa">Battle of Ilipa</a>, and the peninsula became a Roman province known as <a href="Hispania">Hispania</a>. From 206 BC onwards the only opposition to Roman control of the peninsula came from within the native <a href="Celtiberians">Celtiberian</a> tribes themselves, whose disunity prevented their security from Roman expansion. Following two small-scale rebellions in 197 BC, in 195–194 BC war broke out between the Romans and the <a href="Lusitani">Lusitani</a> people in the <a href="Lusitanian%20War">Lusitanian War</a>, in modern-day Portugal. By 179 BC, the Romans had mostly succeeded in pacifying the region and bringing it under their control.

About 154 BC, a major revolt was re-ignited in <a href="Numantia">Numantia</a>, which is known as the <a href="First%20Numantine%20War">First Numantine War</a>, and a long war of resistance was fought between the advancing forces of the Roman Republic and the Lusitani tribes of Hispania. The <a href="praetor">praetor</a> <a href="Servius%20Sulpicius%20Galba%20%28consul%20144%20BC%29">Servius Sulpicius Galba</a> and the <a href="proconsul">proconsul</a> <a href="Lucius%20Licinius%20Lucullus%20%28consul%20151%20BC%29">Lucius Licinius Lucullus</a> arrived in 151 BC and began the process of subduing the local population. In 150 BC, Galba betrayed the Lusitani leaders he had invited to peace talks and had them killed, ingloriously ending the first phase of the war.

The Lusitani revolted again in 146 BC under a new leader called <a href="Viriathus">Viriathus</a>, invading <a href="Turdetania">Turdetania</a> (southern Iberia) in a <a href="guerrilla%20war">guerrilla war</a>. The Lusitanians were initially successful, defeating a Roman army at the Battle of Tribola and going on to sack nearby <a href="Carpetani">Carpetania</a>, and then besting a second Roman army at the First Battle of Mount Venus in 146 BC, again going on to sack another nearby city. In 144 BC, the general <a href="Quintus%20Fabius%20Maximus%20Aemilianus">Quintus Fabius Maximus Aemilianus</a> campaigned successfully against the Lusitani, but failed in his attempts to arrest Viriathus.

In 144 BC, Viriathus formed a league against Rome with several Celtiberian tribes and persuaded them to rise against Rome too, in the <a href="Second%20Numantine%20War">Second Numantine War</a>. Viriathus' new coalition bested Roman armies at the Second Battle of Mount Venus in 144 BC and again at the failed Siege of Erisone. In 141 BC, Viriathus enjoyed his greatest victory when he surrounded a consular army and forced it to surrender on condition that its men did not fight in Spain again. No sooner were they free than the Romans reneged on the agreement and returned to the attack. In 139 BC, Viriathus was finally killed in his sleep by three of his companions who had been promised gifts by Rome. The Celtiberians continued to resist, forcing the surrender of another Roman army at Numantia in 137 BC. In 134 BC, the Consul <a href="Scipio%20Aemilianus">Scipio Aemilianus</a> finally succeeded in suppressing the rebellion following the successful <a href="Siege%20of%20Numantia">Siege of Numantia</a>. In 105 BC, the Celtiberians still retained enough of their native vigour and ferocity to drive the <a href="Cimbri">Cimbri</a> and <a href="Teutones">Teutones</a> from Spain, though these had crushed Roman arms in Narbonese Gaul, inflicting 80,000 casualties on the Roman army which opposed them.

Since the Roman invasion of the Iberian peninsula had begun in the south in the territories around the Mediterranean controlled by the Barcids, the last region of the peninsula to be subdued lay in the far north. The <a href="Cantabrian%20Wars">Cantabrian Wars</a> or Astur-Cantabrian Wars, from 29 BC to 19 BC, occurred during the Roman conquest of these northern provinces of <a href="Cantabria">Cantabria</a> and <a href="Asturias">Asturias</a>. Iberia was fully occupied by 25 BC and the last revolt put down by 19 BC—but at heavy cost and severe losses.

Rome's preoccupation with its war with Carthage provided an opportunity for <a href="Philip%20V%20of%20Macedon">Philip V</a> of the kingdom of <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a> in northern <a href="Greece">Greece</a> to attempt to extend his power westward. Philip sent ambassadors to Hannibal's camp in Italy, to negotiate an alliance as common enemies of Rome. However, Rome discovered the agreement when Philip's emissaries, along with emissaries from Hannibal, were captured by a Roman fleet. Desiring to prevent Philip from aiding Carthage in Italy and elsewhere, Rome sought out land allies in Greece to fight a <a href="proxy%20war">proxy war</a> against Macedon on its behalf and found partners in the <a href="Aetolian%20League">Aetolian League</a> of Greek city-states, the <a href="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> to the north of Macedon and the <a href="kingdom%20of%20Pergamon">kingdom of Pergamon</a> and the city-state of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, which lay across the Aegean from Macedon.

The <a href="First%20Macedonian%20War">First Macedonian War</a> saw the Romans involved directly in only limited land operations. When the Aetolians sued for peace with Philip, Rome's small expeditionary force, with no more allies in Greece, was ready to make peace. Rome had achieved its objective of pre-occupying Philip and preventing him from aiding Hannibal. A treaty was drawn up between Rome and Macedon at Phoenice in 205 BC which promised Rome a small indemnity, formally ending the First Macedonian War.

Macedon began to encroach on territory claimed by several other Greek city states in 200 BC and these pleaded for help from their newfound ally Rome. Rome gave Philip an ultimatum that he must submit Macedonia to being essentially a Roman province. Philip, unsurprisingly, refused and, after initial internal reluctance for further hostilities, Rome declared war against Philip in the <a href="Second%20Macedonian%20War">Second Macedonian War</a>. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Aous%20%28198%20BC%29">Battle of the Aous</a> Roman forces under <a href="Titus%20Quinctius%20Flamininus">Titus Quinctius Flamininus</a> defeated the Macedonians, and in a second larger battle under the same opposing commanders in 197 BC, in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cynoscephalae">Battle of Cynoscephalae</a>, Flamininus again beat the Macedonians decisively. Macedonia was forced to sign the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Tempea">Treaty of Tempea</a>, in which it lost all claim to territory in Greece and Asia, and had to pay a war indemnity to Rome.

Between the second and third Macedonian wars Rome faced further conflict in the region due to a tapestry of shifting rivalries, alliances and leagues all seeking to gain greater influence. After the Macedonians had been defeated in the Second Macedonian War in 197 BC, the Greek city-state of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a> stepped into the partial power vacuum in Greece. Fearing the Spartans would take increasing control of the region, the Romans drew on help from allies to prosecute the <a href="Roman-Spartan%20War">Roman-Spartan War</a>, defeating a Spartan army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Gythium">Battle of Gythium</a> in 195 BC. They also fought their former allies the Aetolian League in the <a href="Aetolian%20War">Aetolian War</a>, against the <a href="Istrians">Istrians</a> in the Istrian War, against the Illyrians in the <a href="Illyrian%20War">Illyrian War</a>, and against <a href="Achaea">Achaia</a> in the <a href="Achaean%20War">Achaean War</a>.

Rome now turned its attentions to <a href="Antiochus%20III%20the%20Great">Antiochus III</a> of the <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a> to the east. After campaigns as far abroad as Bactria, India, Persia and Judea, Antiochus moved to Asia Minor and Thrace to secure several coastal towns, a move that brought him into conflict with Roman interests. A Roman force under <a href="Manius%20Acilius%20Glabrio%20%28consul%20191%20BC%29">Manius Acilius Glabrio</a> defeated Antiochus at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Thermopylae%20%28191%20BC%29">Battle of Thermopylae</a> and forced him to evacuate Greece: the Romans then pursued the Seleucids beyond Greece, beating them again in naval battles at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Eurymedon%20%28190%20BC%29">Battle of the Eurymedon</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Myonessus">Battle of Myonessus</a>, and finally in a decisive engagement of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Magnesia">Battle of Magnesia</a>.

In 179 BC Philip died and his talented and ambitious son, <a href="Perseus%20of%20Macedon">Perseus of Macedon</a>, took his throne and showed a renewed interest in Greece. He also allied himself with the warlike <a href="Bastarnae">Bastarnae</a>, and both this and his actions in Greece possibly violated the treaty signed with the Romans by his father or, if not, certainly was not "behaving as [Rome considered] a subordinate ally should". Rome declared war on Macedonia again, starting the <a href="Third%20Macedonian%20War">Third Macedonian War</a>. Perseus initially had greater military success against the Romans than his father, winning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Callicinus">Battle of Callicinus</a> against a Roman consular army. However, as with all such ventures in this period, Rome responded by simply sending another army. The second consular army duly defeated the Macedonians at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna">Battle of Pydna</a> in 168 BC and the Macedonians, lacking the reserve of the Romans and with King Perseus captured, duly capitulated, ending the <a href="Third%20Macedonian%20War">Third Macedonian War</a>.

The Fourth Macedonian War, fought from 150 BC to 148 BC, was the final war between Rome and Macedon and began when <a href="Andriscus">Andriscus</a> usurped the Macedonian throne. The Romans raised a consular army under <a href="Quintus%20Caecilius%20Metellus%20Macedonicus">Quintus Caecilius Metellus</a>, who swiftly defeated Andriscus at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pydna%20%28148%20BC%29">Second battle of Pydna</a>.

Under <a href="Lucius%20Mummius%20Achaicus">Lucius Mummius</a>, <a href="Ancient%20Corinth">Corinth</a> was destroyed following a siege in 146 BC, leading to the surrender and thus conquest of the <a href="Achaean%20League">Achaean League</a> (see <a href="Battle%20of%20Corinth%20%28146%20BC%29">Battle of Corinth</a>).

Rome had, in the earlier Punic Wars, gained large tracts of territory in Africa, which they consolidated in the following centuries. Much of that land had been granted to the kingdom of Numidia, a kingdom on the north African coast approximating to modern Algeria, in return for its past military assistance. The Jugurthine War of 111–104 BC was fought between Rome and <a href="Jugurtha">Jugurtha</a> of <a href="Numidia">Numidia</a> and constituted the final Roman pacification of Northern Africa, after which Rome largely ceased expansion on the continent after reaching natural barriers of desert and mountain. In response to Jugurtha's usurpation of the Numidian throne, a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars, Rome intervened. Jugurtha impudently bribed the Romans into accepting his usurpation and was granted half the kingdom. Following further aggression and further bribery attempts, the Romans sent an army to depose him. The Romans were defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Suthul">Battle of Suthul</a> but fared better at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Muthul">Battle of the Muthul</a> and finally defeated Jugurtha at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Thala">Battle of Thala</a>, the Battle of Mulucha, and the Battle of Cirta (104 BC). Jugurtha was finally captured not in battle but by treachery, ending the war.

Memories of the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Allia">sack of Rome</a> by Celtic tribes from Gaul in 390/387 BC, had been made into a legendary account that was taught to each generation of Roman youth, were still prominent despite their historical distance. In 121 BC, Rome came into contact with the Celtic tribes of the <a href="Allobroges">Allobroges</a> and the <a href="Arverni">Arverni</a>, both of which they defeated with apparent ease in the First Battle of Avignon near the Rhone river and the Second Battle of Avignon, the same year.

The <a href="Cimbrian%20War">Cimbrian War</a> (113–101 BC) was a far more serious affair than the earlier clashes of 121 BC. The <a href="Germanic%20peoples">Germanic</a> tribes of the "<a href="Cimbri">Cimbri</a>" and the "<a href="Teutons">Teutons</a>" or "Teutones" migrated from northern Europe into Rome's northern territories, where they clashed with Rome and her allies. The Cimbrian War was the first time since the <a href="Second%20Punic%20War">Second Punic War</a> that <a href="Italia%20%28Roman%20province%29">Italia</a> and <a href="Rome">Rome</a> itself had been seriously threatened, and caused great fear in Rome. The opening action of the Cimbrian War, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Noreia">Battle of Noreia</a> in 112 BC, ended in defeat and near disaster for the Romans. In 105 BC the Romans were defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arausio">Battle of Arausio</a> and was the costliest Rome had suffered since the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cannae">Battle of Cannae</a>. After the Cimbri inadvertently granted the Romans a reprieve by diverting to plunder Iberia, Rome was given the opportunity to carefully prepare for and successfully meet the Cimbri and Teutons in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Aquae%20Sextiae">Battle of Aquae Sextiae</a> (102 BC) and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vercellae">Battle of Vercellae</a> (101 BC) where both tribes were virtually annihilated, ending the threat.

The extensive campaigning abroad by Rome, and the rewarding of soldiers with plunder from those campaigns, led to the trend of soldiers becoming increasingly loyal to their commanders rather than to the state, and a willingness to follow their generals in battle against the state. Rome was plagued by several slave uprisings during this period, in part because in the past century vast tracts of land had been given to veterans who farmed by use of slaves and who came to greatly outnumber their Roman masters. In the last century BC, at least twelve <a href="Roman%20Republican%20civil%20wars">civil wars</a> and rebellions occurred. This pattern did not break until Octavian (later "<a href="Caesar%20Augustus">Caesar Augustus</a>") ended it by becoming a successful challenger to the Senate's authority, and was made "<a href="princeps">princeps</a>" (emperor).

Between 135 BC and 71 BC there were three <a href="Roman%20Servile%20Wars">Servile Wars</a> against the Roman state; the <a href="Third%20Servile%20War">third</a>, and most serious, may have involved the revolution of 120,000 to 150,000 slaves. Additionally, in 91 BC the <a href="Social%20War%20%2891%E2%80%9388%20BC%29">Social War</a> broke out between Rome and its former allies in Italy, collectively known as the "Socii", over the grievance that they shared the risk of Rome's military campaigns, but not its rewards. Despite defeats such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fucine%20Lake">Battle of Fucine Lake</a>, Roman troops defeated the Italian <a href="militia">militia</a>s in decisive engagements, notably the <a href="Battle%20of%20Asculum%20%2889%20BC%29">Battle of Asculum</a>. Although they lost militarily, the "Socii" achieved their objectives with the legal proclamations of the "<a href="Lex%20Julia">Lex Julia</a>" and "<a href="Lex%20Plautia%20Papiria">Lex Plautia Papiria</a>", which granted citizenship to more than 500,000 Italians.

The internal unrest reached its most serious stage in the two civil wars or marches upon Rome by the consul <a href="Lucius%20Cornelius%20Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a> at the beginning of 82 BC. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Colline%20Gate%20%2882%20BC%29">Battle of the Colline Gate</a> at the very door of the city of Rome, a Roman army under Sulla bested an army of the Roman senate and its Samnite allies. Whatever the merits of his grievances against those in power of the state, his actions marked a watershed of the willingness of Roman troops to wage war against one another that was to pave the way for the wars of the <a href="triumvirate">triumvirate</a>, the overthrowing of the Senate as the "de facto" head of the Roman state, and the eventual <a href="Roman%20usurper">endemic usurpation of power</a> by contenders for the emperor-ship in the later Empire.

<a href="Mithridates%20the%20Great">Mithridates the Great</a> was the ruler of <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Pontus">Pontus</a>, a large kingdom in <a href="Asia%20Minor">Asia Minor</a>, from 120 to 63 BC. He is remembered as one of Rome's most formidable and successful enemies who engaged three of the most prominent generals of the late Roman Republic: <a href="Sulla">Sulla</a>, <a href="Lucullus">Lucullus</a>, and <a href="Pompey%20the%20Great">Pompey the Great</a>. In a pattern familiar from the Punic Wars, the Romans came into conflict with him after the two states' spheres of influence began to overlap. Mithridates antagonised Rome by seeking to expand his kingdom, and Rome for her part seemed equally keen for war and the spoils and prestige that it might bring. After conquering western <a href="Anatolia">Anatolia</a> (modern Turkey) in 88 BC, Roman sources claim that Mithridates ordered the killing of the majority of the 80,000 Romans living there. In the subsequent <a href="First%20Mithridatic%20War">First Mithridatic War</a>, the Roman general <a href="Lucius%20Cornelius%20Sulla">Lucius Cornelius Sulla</a> forced Mithridates out of Greece proper after the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chaeronea%20%2886%20BC%29">Battle of Chaeronea</a> and later <a href="Battle%20of%20Orchomenus">Battle of Orchomenus</a> but then had to return to Italy to answer the internal threat posed by his rival Marius; consequently, Mithridates VI was defeated but not destroyed. A peace was made between Rome and Pontus, but this proved only a temporary lull.

The <a href="Second%20Mithridatic%20War">Second Mithridatic War</a> began when Rome tried to annex <a href="Bithynia">Bithynia</a> as a province. In the <a href="Third%20Mithridatic%20War">Third Mithridatic War</a>, first <a href="Lucius%20Licinius%20Lucullus%20%28consul%2074%20BC%29">Lucius Licinius Lucullus</a> and then <a href="Pompey%20the%20Great">Pompey the Great</a> were sent against Mithridates. Mithridates was finally defeated by Pompey in the night-time <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Lycus">Battle of the Lycus</a>. After defeating Mithridates, Pompey <a href="Pompey%27s%20campaign%20in%20Iberia%20and%20Albania">invaded Caucacus</a>, subjugated the <a href="Caucasian%20Iberia">Kingdom of Iberia</a> and established Roman control over <a href="Colchis">Colchis</a>.

The Mediterranean had at this time fallen into the hands of <a href="pirates">pirates</a>, largely from <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. Rome had destroyed many of the states that had previously policed the Mediterranean with fleets, but had failed to step into the gap created. The pirates had seized the opportunity of a relative power vacuum and had not only strangled shipping lanes but had plundered many cities on the coasts of Greece and Asia, and had even made descents upon Italy itself. After the Roman admiral <a href="Marcus%20Antonius%20Creticus">Marcus Antonius Creticus</a> (father of the <a href="triumvir">triumvir</a> <a href="Marcus%20Antonius">Marcus Antonius</a>) failed to clear the pirates to the satisfaction of the Roman authorities, <a href="Pompey">Pompey</a> was nominated his successor as commander of a special naval task force to campaign against them. It supposedly took Pompey just forty days to clear the western portion of the western Mediterranean of pirates, and restore communication between Iberia, Africa, and Italy. Plutarch describes how Pompey first swept their craft from the Mediterranean in a series of small actions and through the promise of honouring the surrender of cities and craft. He then followed the main body of the pirates to their strongholds on the coast of <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, and destroyed them there in the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Korakesion">Battle of Korakesion</a>.

During a term as praetor in Iberia, Pompey's contemporary <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Julius Caesar</a> of the Roman Julii clan defeated the <a href="Calaici">Calaici</a> and <a href="Lusitani">Lusitani</a> in battle. Following a consular term, he was then appointed to a five-year term as Proconsular Governor of Transalpine Gaul (current southern France) and Illyria (the coast of Dalmatia). Not content with an idle governorship, Caesar strove to find reason to invade Gaul, which would give him the dramatic military success he sought. To this end he stirred up popular nightmares of the first sack of Rome by the Gauls and the more recent spectre of the Cimbri and Teutones. When the <a href="Helvetii">Helvetii</a> and <a href="Tigurini">Tigurini</a> tribes began to migrate on a route that would take them near (not into) the Roman province of Transalpine Gaul, Caesar had the barely sufficient excuse he needed for his <a href="Gallic%20Wars">Gallic Wars</a>, fought between 58 BC and 49 BC. After slaughtering the Helvetii tribe, Caesar prosecuted a "long, bitter and costly" campaign against other tribes across the breadth of Gaul, many of whom had fought alongside Rome against their common enemy the <a href="Helvetii">Helvetii</a>, and annexed their territory to that of Rome. Although "fierce and able" the Gauls were handicapped by internal disunity and fell in a series of battles over the course of a decade.

Caesar defeated the "<a href="Helvetii">Helvetii</a>" in 58 BC at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Arar">Battle of the Arar</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Bibracte">Battle of Bibracte</a>, the Belgic confederacy known as the "Belgae" at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Axona">Battle of the Axona</a>, the "Nervii" in 57 BC at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Sabis">Battle of the Sabis</a>, the "Aquitani", "Treviri", "Tencteri", "Aedui" and "Eburones" in unknown battles, and the "Veneti" in 56 BC. In 55 and 54 BC he made <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">two expeditions to Britain</a>. In 52 BC, following the <a href="Siege%20of%20Avaricum">Siege of Avaricum</a> and a string of inconclusive battles, Caesar defeated a union of Gauls led by <a href="Vercingetorix">Vercingetorix</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alesia">Battle of Alesia</a>, completing the Roman conquest of Transalpine Gaul. By 50 BC, the entirety of Gaul lay in Roman hands. Caesar recorded his own accounts of these campaigns in "<a href="Commentarii%20de%20Bello%20Gallico">Commentarii de Bello Gallico</a>" ("Commentaries on the Gallic War").

According to Plutarch and the writings of scholar Brendan Woods, the whole campaign resulted in 800 conquered cities, 300 subdued tribes, one million men sold into <a href="Slavery%20in%20ancient%20Rome">slavery</a>, and another three million dead in battle.

Gaul never regained its Celtic identity, never attempted another nationalist rebellion, and remained loyal to Rome until the fall of the Western Empire in 476 AD. However, although Gaul itself was to thereafter remain loyal, cracks were appearing in the political unity of Rome's governing figures – partly over concerns over the loyalty of Caesar's Gallic troops to his person rather than the state – that were soon to drive Rome into a lengthy series of civil wars.

By 59 BC an unofficial political alliance known as the <a href="First%20Triumvirate">First Triumvirate</a> was formed between <a href="Julius%20Caesar">Gaius Julius Caesar</a>, <a href="Marcus%20Licinius%20Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a>, and <a href="Gnaeus%20Pompeius%20Magnus">Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus</a> to share power and influence. It was always an uncomfortable alliance given that Crassus and Pompey intensely disliked one another. In 53 BC, Crassus launched a Roman invasion of the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>. After initial successes, he marched his army deep into the desert; but here his army was cut off deep in enemy territory, surrounded and slaughtered at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrhae">Battle of Carrhae</a> in "the greatest Roman defeat since Hannibal" in which Crassus himself perished. The death of Crassus removed some of the balance in the Triumvirate and, consequently, Caesar and Pompey began to move apart. While Caesar was fighting against Vercingetorix in Gaul, Pompey proceeded with a legislative agenda for Rome that revealed that he was at best ambivalent towards Caesar and perhaps now covertly allied with Caesar's political enemies. In 51 BC, some Roman senators demanded that Caesar would not be permitted to stand for Consul unless he turned over control of his armies to the state, and the same demands were made of Pompey by other factions. Relinquishing his army would leave Caesar defenceless before his enemies. Caesar chose Civil War over laying down his command and facing trial. The triumvirate was shattered and conflict was inevitable.

Pompey initially assured Rome and the senate that he could defeat Caesar in battle should he march on Rome. However, by the spring of 49 BC, when Caesar crossed the Rubicon river with his invading forces and swept down the Italian peninsula towards Rome, Pompey ordered the abandonment of Rome. Caesar's army was still under-strength, with certain units remaining in Gaul, but on the other hand Pompey himself only had a small force at his command, and that with uncertain loyalty having served under Caesar. Tom Holland attributes Pompey's willingness to abandon Rome to waves of panicking refugees as an attempt to stir ancestral fears of invasions from the north. Pompey's forces retreated south towards Brundisium, and then fled to Greece. Caesar first directed his attention to the Pompeian stronghold of Iberia but following campaigning by Caesar in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Massilia">Siege of Massilia</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Ilerda">Battle of Ilerda</a> he decided to attack Pompey in Greece. Pompey initially defeated Caesar at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Dyrrhachium%20%2848%20BC%29">Battle of Dyrrachium</a> in 48 BC but failed to follow up on the victory. Pompey was decisively defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pharsalus">Battle of Pharsalus</a> in 48 BC despite outnumbering Caesar's forces two to one. Pompey fled again, this time to Egypt, where he was murdered in an attempt to ingratiate the country with Caesar and avoid a war with Rome.

Pompey's death did not see the end of the civil wars since initially Caesar's enemies were manifold and Pompey's supporters continued to fight on after his death. In 46 BC Caesar lost perhaps as much as a third of his army when his former commander <a href="Titus%20Labienus">Titus Labienus</a>, who had defected to the Pompeians several years earlier, defeated him at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ruspina">Battle of Ruspina</a>. However, after this low point Caesar came back to defeat the Pompeian army of <a href="Metellus%20Scipio">Metellus Scipio</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Thapsus">Battle of Thapsus</a>, after which the Pompeians retreated yet again to Iberia. Caesar defeated the combined forces of Titus Labienus and Gnaeus Pompey the Younger at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Munda">Battle of Munda</a> in Iberia. Labienus was killed in the battle and the Younger Pompey captured and executed.

Despite his military success, or probably because of it, fear spread of Caesar, now the primary figure of the Roman state, becoming an autocratic ruler and ending the Roman Republic. This fear drove a group of senators naming themselves <a href="Liberatores">The Liberators</a> to assassinate him in 44 BC. Further civil war followed between those loyal to Caesar and those who supported the actions of the Liberators. Caesar's supporter <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> condemned Caesar's assassins and war broke out between the two factions. Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and <a href="Augustus">Octavian</a> was entrusted with the command of the war against him. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Forum%20Gallorum">Battle of Forum Gallorum</a> Antony, besieging Caesar's assassin Decimus Brutus in <a href="Mutina">Mutina</a>, defeated the forces of the consul Pansa, who was killed, but Antony was then immediately defeated by the army of the other consul, Hirtius. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mutina">Battle of Mutina</a> Antony was again defeated in battle by Hirtius, who was killed. Although Antony failed to capture Mutina, Decimus Brutus was murdered shortly thereafter.

Octavian betrayed his party, and came to terms with Caesarians Antony and <a href="Marcus%20Aemilius%20Lepidus%20%28triumvir%29">Lepidus</a> and on 26 November 43 BC the <a href="Second%20Triumvirate">Second Triumvirate</a> was formed, this time in an official capacity. In 42 BC <a href="Triumvir">Triumvir</a>s <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> and <a href="Augustus">Octavian</a> fought the indecisive <a href="Battle%20of%20Philippi">Battle of Philippi</a> with Caesar's assassins <a href="Marcus%20Brutus">Marcus Brutus</a> and <a href="Gaius%20Cassius%20Longinus">Cassius</a>. Although Brutus defeated Octavian, Antony defeated Cassius, who committed suicide. Brutus also committed suicide shortly afterwards.

Civil war flared again when the Second Triumvirate of Octavian, Lepidus and <a href="Mark%20Antony">Mark Antony</a> failed just as the first had almost as soon as its opponents had been removed. The ambitious Octavian built a power base and then launched a campaign against Mark Antony. Together with Lucius Antonius, Mark Antony's wife <a href="Fulvia">Fulvia</a> raised an army in Italy to fight for Antony's rights against Octavian but she was defeated by Octavian at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Perugia">Battle of Perugia</a>. Her death led to partial reconciliation between Octavian and Antony who went on to crush the army of <a href="Sextus%20Pompeius">Sextus Pompeius</a>, the last focus of opposition to the second triumvirate, in the naval <a href="Battle%20of%20Naulochus">Battle of Naulochus</a>.

As before, once opposition to the triumvirate was crushed, it started to tear at itself. The triumvirate expired on the last day of 33 BC and was not renewed in law and in 31 BC, war began again. At the <a href="Battle%20of%20Actium">Battle of Actium</a>, <a href="Augustus">Octavian</a> decisively defeated Antony and <a href="Cleopatra%20VII%20of%20Egypt">Cleopatra</a> in a naval battle near Greece, using fire to destroy the enemy fleet.

Octavian went on to become Emperor under the name Augustus and, in the absence of political assassins or usurpers, was able to greatly expand the borders of the Empire.

Secure from interior enemies, Rome achieved great territorial gains in both the East and the West. In the West, following humiliating <a href="Clades%20Lolliana">defeat</a>s at the hands of the <a href="Sugambri">Sugambri</a>, <a href="Tencteri">Tencteri</a> and <a href="Usipetes">Usipetes</a> tribes in 16 BC, Roman armies <a href="Early%20Imperial%20campaigns%20in%20Germania">pushed</a> north and east out of Gaul to subdue much of Germania. The <a href="Pannonian%20revolt">Pannonian revolt</a> in 6 AD forced the Romans to cancel their plan to cement their conquest of Germania. Despite the loss of a large army almost to the man of <a href="Publius%20Quinctilius%20Varus">Varus</a>' famous defeat at the hands of the Germanic leader <a href="Arminius">Arminius</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Teutoburg%20Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg Forest</a> in 9 AD, Rome recovered and continued its expansion up to and beyond the borders of the known world. Roman armies under <a href="Germanicus">Germanicus</a> pursued several more campaigns against the Germanic tribes of the <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a>, <a href="Hermunduri">Hermunduri</a>, <a href="Chatti">Chatti</a>, <a href="Cherusci">Cherusci</a>, <a href="Bructeri">Bructeri</a>, and <a href="Marsi">Marsi</a>. Overcoming several mutinies in the armies along the Rhine, Germanicus defeated the Germanic tribes of Arminius in a series of battles culminating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Weser%20River">Battle of the Weser River</a>.

After Caesar's <a href="Caesar%27s%20invasions%20of%20Britain">preliminary low-scale invasions of Britain</a>, the Romans <a href="Roman%20conquest%20of%20Britain">invaded in force</a> in 43 AD, forcing their way inland through several battles against British tribes, including the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Medway">Battle of the Medway</a>, the Battle of the Thames, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Caer%20Caradoc">Battle of Caer Caradoc</a> and the Battle of Mona. Following a general uprising in which the Britons sacked <a href="Sack%20of%20Camulodunum">Colchester</a>, <a href="Sack%20of%20Verulamium">St Albans</a> and <a href="Sack%20of%20Londinium">London</a>, the Romans suppressed the rebellion in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Watling%20Street">Battle of Watling Street</a> and went on to push as far north as central Scotland in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons%20Graupius">Battle of Mons Graupius</a>. The Britons fought with determination and resilience, but faced a superior, professional army, and it is likely that between 100,000 and 250,000 may have perished in the conquest period.

Tribes in modern-day Scotland and Northern England repeatedly rebelled against Roman rule and two military bases were established in <a href="Roman%20Britain">Britannia</a> to protect against rebellion and incursions from the north, from which Roman troops built and manned <a href="Hadrian%27s%20Wall">Hadrian's Wall</a>.

On the continent, the extension of the Empire's borders beyond the Rhine hung in the balance for some time, with the emperor <a href="Caligula">Caligula</a> apparently poised to invade Germania in 39 AD, and <a href="Cnaeus%20Domitius%20Corbulo">Cnaeus Domitius Corbulo</a> crossing the Rhine in 47 AD and marching into the territory of the <a href="Frisii">Frisii</a> and <a href="Chauci">Chauci</a>. Caligula's successor, <a href="Claudius">Claudius</a>, ordered the suspension of further attacks across the Rhine, setting what was to become the permanent limit of the Empire's expansion in this direction.

Further east, <a href="Trajan">Trajan</a> turned his attention to <a href="Dacia">Dacia</a>, an area north of Macedon and Greece and east of the Danube that had been on the Roman agenda since before the days of Caesar when they had beaten a Roman army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Histria">Battle of Histria</a>. In 85 AD, the Dacians had swarmed over the Danube and pillaged <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> and initially defeated an army the Emperor <a href="Domitian">Domitian</a> sent against them, but the Romans were victorious in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tapae%2088">Battle of Tapae</a> in AD 88 and a truce was drawn up.

Emperor Trajan recommenced hostilities against Dacia and, following an uncertain number of battles, defeated the Dacian general <a href="Decebalus">Decebalus</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tapae%20%28101%29">Second Battle of Tapae</a> in 101 AD. With Trajan's troops pressing towards the Dacian capital <a href="Sarmizegethusa">Sarmizegethusa</a>, Decebalus once more sought terms. Decebalus rebuilt his power over the following years and attacked Roman garrisons again in 105 AD. In response Trajan again marched into Dacia, besieging the Dacian capital in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Sarmizethusa">Siege of Sarmizethusa</a>, and razing it to the ground. With Dacia quelled, Trajan subsequently <a href="Roman-Parthian%20Wars%23Roman%20Empire%20vs%20Parthia">invaded the Parthian empire</a> to the east, his conquests taking the Roman Empire to its greatest extent. Rome's borders in the east were indirectly governed through a system of <a href="client%20states">client states</a> for some time, leading to less direct campaigning than in the west in this period.

The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Armenia%20%28antiquity%29">Kingdom of Armenia</a> between the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and <a href="Caspian%20Sea">Caspian Sea</a> became a focus of contention between Rome and the Parthian Empire, and control of the region was repeatedly gained and lost. The Parthians forced <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> into submission from 37 AD but in 47 AD the Romans retook control of the kingdom and offered it <a href="client%20state">client kingdom</a> status. Under <a href="Nero">Nero</a>, the Romans fought a <a href="Roman-Parthian%20War%20of%2058%E2%80%9363">campaign between 55 and 63 AD</a> against the Parthian Empire, which had again invaded Armenia. After gaining Armenia once more in 60 AD and subsequently losing it again in 62 AD, the Romans sent <a href="Gnaeus%20Domitius%20Corbulo">Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo</a> in 63 AD into the territories of <a href="Vologases%20I">Vologases I</a> of <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>. Corbulo succeeded in returning Armenia to Roman client status, where it remained for the next century.

In 69 AD, <a href="Marcus%20Salvius%20Otho">Marcus Salvius Otho</a>, governor of <a href="Lusitania">Lusitania</a>, had the Emperor <a href="Galba">Galba</a> murdered and claimed the throne for himself. However, <a href="Vitellius">Vitellius</a>, governor of the province of <a href="Germania%20Inferior">Germania Inferior</a>, had also claimed the throne and marched on Rome with his troops. Following an inconclusive battle near Antipolis, Vitellius' troops attacked the city of Placentia in the <a href="Assault%20of%20Placentia">Assault of Placentia</a>, but were repulsed by the Othonian garrison.

Otho left Rome on March 14, and marched north towards Placentia to meet his challenger. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Locus%20Castorum">Battle of Locus Castorum</a> the Othonians had the better of the fighting, and Vitellius' troops retreated to Cremona. The two armies met again on the Via Postunia, in the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Bedriacum">First Battle of Bedriacum</a>, after which the Othonian troops fled back to their camp in Bedriacum, and the next day surrendered to the Vitellian forces. Otho decided to commit suicide rather than fight on.

Meanwhile, the forces stationed in the Middle East provinces of <a href="Iudaea%20Province">Judaea</a> and <a href="Syria%20%28Roman%20province%29">Syria</a> had acclaimed <a href="Vespasian">Vespasian</a> as emperor and the Danubian armies of the provinces of <a href="Raetia">Raetia</a> and <a href="Moesia">Moesia</a> also acclaimed Vespasian as emperor. Vespasian's and Vitellius' armies met in the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Bedriacum">Second Battle of Bedriacum</a>, after which the Vitellian troops were driven back into their camp outside Cremona, which was taken. Vespasian's troops then attacked Cremona itself, which surrendered.

Under pretence of siding with Vespasian, <a href="Gaius%20Julius%20Civilis">Civilis</a> of <a href="Batavians">Batavia</a> had taken up arms and induced the inhabitants of his native country to rebel. The rebelling Batavians were immediately joined by several neighbouring German tribes including the <a href="Frisii">Frisii</a>. These forces drove out the Roman garrisons near the Rhine and defeated a Roman army at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Castra%20Vetera">Battle of Castra Vetera</a>, after which many Roman troops along the Rhine and in Gaul defected to the Batavian cause. However, disputes soon broke out amongst the different tribes, rendering co-operation impossible; Vespasian, having successfully ended the civil war, called upon Civilis to lay down his arms, and on his refusal his legions met him in force, defeating him in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Augusta%20Treverorum">Battle of Augusta Treverorum</a>.

The first Jewish-Roman War, sometimes called The Great Revolt, was the first of three major rebellions by the Jews of Judaea Province against the Roman Empire. Judea was already a troubled region with bitter violence among several competing Jewish sects and a long history of rebellion The Jews' anger turned on Rome following robberies from their temples and Roman insensitivity – Tacitus says disgust and repulsion – towards their religion. The Jews began to prepare for armed revolt. Early successes, including the repulse of the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%2866%29">First Siege of Jerusalem</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beth%20Horon%20%2866%29">Battle of Beth-Horon</a>, only attracted greater attention from Rome and Emperor Nero appointed general Vespasian to crush the rebellion. Vespasian led his forces in a methodical clearance of the areas in revolt. By the year 68 AD, Jewish resistance in the North had been crushed. A few towns and cities held out for a few years before falling to the Romans, leading to the <a href="Siege%20of%20Masada">Siege of Masada</a> in 73 AD and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Jerusalem%20%2870%29">Second Siege of Jerusalem</a>. Jerusalem was sacked and much of the population killed or dispersed. <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a> claims that 1,100,000 people were killed during the siege, of which a majority were Jewish. 97,000 were captured and enslaved, including <a href="Simon%20bar%20Giora">Simon bar Giora</a> and <a href="John%20of%20Giscala">John of Giscala</a>.

In 115 AD, revolt broke out again in the province, leading to the second Jewish-Roman war known as the <a href="Kitos%20War">Kitos War</a>, and again in 132 AD in what is known as <a href="Bar%20Kokhba%27s%20revolt">Bar Kokhba's revolt</a>. Both were brutally crushed.

By the 2nd century AD the territories of Persia were controlled by the Arsacid dynasty and known as the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthian Empire</a>. Due in large part to their employment of <a href="cataphract">powerful heavy cavalry</a> and mobile <a href="horse%20archer">horse archer</a>s, Parthia was the most formidable enemy of the Roman Empire in the east. As early as 53 BC, the Roman general Crassus had invaded Parthia, but he was killed and his army was defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carrhae">Battle of Carrhae</a>. In the years following Carrhae, the Romans were divided in civil war and hence unable to campaign against Parthia. Trajan also campaigned against the Parthians from 114–117 AD and briefly captured their capital <a href="Ctesiphon">Ctesiphon</a>, putting the puppet ruler <a href="Parthamaspates%20of%20Parthia">Parthamaspates</a> on the throne. However, rebellions in <a href="Babylonia">Babylonia</a> and the Jewish revolts in Judea made it difficult to maintain the captured province and the territories were abandoned.

A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its assault in 161 AD, defeating two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor <a href="Lucius%20Verus">Lucius Verus</a> and general <a href="Gaius%20Avidius%20Cassius">Gaius Avidius Cassius</a> were sent in 162 AD to counter the resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was burned to the ground by <a href="Avidius%20Cassius">Avidius Cassius</a> in 164 AD. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.

In 197 AD, Emperor <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a> waged a brief and successful war against the Parthian Empire in retaliation for the support given to a rival for the imperial throne <a href="Pescennius%20Niger">Pescennius Niger</a>. The Parthian capital Ctesiphon was sacked by the Roman army, and the northern half of Mesopotamia was restored to Rome.

Emperor <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>, the son of Severus, marched on Parthia in 217 AD from Edessa to begin a war against them, but he was assassinated while on the march. In 224 AD, the Parthian Empire was crushed not by the Romans but by the rebellious Persian vassal king <a href="Ardashir%20I">Ardashir I</a>, who revolted, leading to the establishment of <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a> of Persia, which replaced Parthia as Rome's major rival in the East.

Throughout the Parthian wars, tribal groups along the Rhine and Danube took advantage of Rome's preoccupation with the eastern frontier (and the plague that the Romans suffered from after bringing it back from the east) and launched a series of incursions into Roman territories, including the <a href="Marcomannic%20Wars">Marcomannic Wars</a>.

After Varus' defeat in Germania in the 1st century, Rome had adopted a largely defensive strategy along the border with Germania, constructing a line of defences known as "<a href="limes">limes</a>" along the Rhine. Although the exact historicity is unclear, since the Romans often assigned one name to several distinct tribal groups, or conversely applied several names to a single group at different times, some mix of Germanic peoples, Celts, and tribes of mixed Celto-Germanic ethnicity were settled in the lands of Germania from the 1st century onwards. The <a href="Cherusci">Cherusci</a>, <a href="Bructeri">Bructeri</a>, <a href="Tencteri">Tencteri</a>, <a href="Usipi">Usipi</a>, <a href="Marsi">Marsi</a>, and <a href="Chatti">Chatti</a> of Varus' time had by the 3rd century either evolved into or been displaced by a confederacy or alliance of Germanic tribes collectively known as the <a href="Alamanni">Alamanni</a>, first mentioned by Cassius Dio describing the campaign of Caracalla in 213 AD.

In around 166 AD, several Germanic tribes pushed across the Danube, striking as far as Italy itself in the <a href="Siege%20of%20Aquileia">Siege of Aquileia</a> in 166 AD, and the heartland of Greece in the <a href="Sack%20of%20Eleusis">Sack of Eleusis</a>.

Although the essential problem of large tribal groups on the frontier remained much the same as the situation Rome faced in earlier centuries, the 3rd century saw a marked increase in the overall threat, although there is disagreement over whether external pressure increased, or Rome's ability to meet it declined. The <a href="Carpians">Carpi</a> and <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a> whom Rome had held at bay were replaced by the <a href="Goths">Goths</a> and likewise the <a href="Quadi">Quadi</a> and <a href="Marcomanni">Marcomanni</a> that Rome had defeated were replaced by the greater confederation of the <a href="Alamanni">Alamanni</a>.

The assembled warbands of the Alamanni frequently crossed the "limes", attacking Germania Superior such that they were almost continually engaged in conflicts with the Roman Empire, whilst Goths attacked across the Danube in battles such as the <a href="Battle%20of%20Beroa">Battle of Beroa</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Philippopolis%20%28250%29">Battle of Philippopolis</a> in 250 AD and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Abrittus">Battle of Abrittus</a> in 251 AD, and both Goths and <a href="Heruli">Heruli</a> ravaged the Aegean and, later, Greece, Thrace and Macedonia. However, their first major assault deep into Roman territory came in 268 AD. In that year the Romans were forced to denude much of their German frontier of troops in response to a massive invasion by another new Germanic tribal confederacy, the <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, from the east. The pressure of tribal groups pushing into the Empire was the end result of a chain of migrations with its roots far to the east: <a href="Huns">Huns</a> from the Russian steppe attacked the <a href="Goths">Goths</a>, who in turn attacked the <a href="Dacians">Dacians</a>, <a href="Alans">Alans</a> and <a href="Sarmatians">Sarmatians</a> at or within Rome's borders. The Goths first appeared in history as a distinct people in this invasion of 268 AD when they swarmed over the Balkan peninsula and overran the Roman provinces of Pannonia and Illyricum and even threatened Italia itself.

The Alamanni seized the opportunity to launch a major invasion of Gaul and northern Italy. However, the Visigoths were defeated in battle that summer near the modern Italian-Slovenian border and then routed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Naissus">Battle of Naissus</a> that September by <a href="Gallienus">Gallienus</a>, <a href="Claudius%20II">Claudius</a> and <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a>, who then turned and defeated the Alemanni at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lake%20Benacus">Battle of Lake Benacus</a>. Claudius' successor <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a> defeated the Goths twice more in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fanum%20Fortunae">Battle of Fanum Fortunae</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ticinum">Battle of Ticinum</a>. The Goths remained a major threat to the Empire but directed their attacks away from Italy itself for several years after their defeat. By 284 AD, Gothic troops were serving on behalf of the Roman military as federated troops.

The Alamanni on the other hand resumed their drive towards Italy almost immediately. They defeated <a href="Aurelian">Aurelian</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Placentia%20%28271%29">Battle of Placentia</a> in 271 AD but were beaten back for a short time after they lost the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Fano">Fano</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Pavia%20%28271%29">Pavia</a> later that year. They were beaten again in 298 AD at the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Lingones">Lingones</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Vindonissa">Vindonissa</a> but fifty years later they were resurgent again, making incursions in 356 AD at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Reims%20%28356%29">Battle of Reims</a>, in 357 AD at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Strasbourg">Battle of Strasbourg</a>, in 367 AD at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Solicinium">Battle of Solicinium</a> and in 378 AD at <a href="Battle%20of%20Argentovaria">Battle of Argentovaria</a>. In the same year the <a href="Goths">Goths</a> inflicted a crushing defeat on the Eastern Empire at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople">Battle of Adrianople</a>, in which the Eastern Emperor <a href="Valens">Valens</a> was massacred along with tens of thousands of Roman troops.

At the same time, <a href="Franks">Franks</a> raided through the North Sea and the <a href="English%20Channel">English Channel</a>, <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a> pressed across the Rhine, <a href="Iuthungi">Iuthungi</a> against the Danube, <a href="Iazyges">Iazyges</a>, <a href="Carpians">Carpi</a> and <a href="Taifali">Taifali</a> harassed Dacia, and <a href="Gepids">Gepids</a> joined the Goths and Heruli in attacks round the Black Sea. At around the same time, lesser-known tribes such as the <a href="Bavares">Bavares</a>, <a href="Baquates">Baquates</a> and <a href="Quinquegentanei">Quinquegentanei</a> raided Africa.

At the start of the 5th century, the pressure on Rome's western borders was growing intense. However, it was not only the western borders that were under threat: Rome was also under threat both internally and on its eastern borders.

An army that was often willing to support its general over its emperor, meant that if commanders could establish sole control of their army, they could usurp the imperial throne from that position. The so-called <a href="Crisis%20of%20the%20Third%20Century">Crisis of the Third Century</a> describes the turmoil of murder, usurpation and in-fighting that followed the murder of the Emperor <a href="Alexander%20Severus">Alexander Severus</a> in 235 AD. However, <a href="Cassius%20Dio">Cassius Dio</a> marks the wider imperial decline as beginning in 180 AD with the ascension of <a href="Commodus">Commodus</a> to the throne, a judgement with which <a href="Edward%20Gibbon">Gibbon</a> concurred, and <a href="Philip%20Matyszak">Matyszak</a> states that "the rot ... had become established long before" even that.

Although the crisis of the 3rd century was not the absolute beginning of Rome's decline, it nevertheless did impose a severe strain on the empire as Romans waged war on one another as they had not done since the last days of the Republic. Within the space of a single century, twenty-seven military officers declared themselves emperors and reigned over parts of the empire for months or days, all but two meeting with a violent end. The time was characterized by a Roman army that was as likely to be attacking itself as it was an outside invader, reaching a low point around 258 AD. Ironically, while it was these usurpations that led to the breakup of the Empire during the crisis, it was the strength of several frontier generals that helped reunify the empire through force of arms.

The situation was complex, often with three or more usurpers in existence at once. <a href="Septimius%20Severus">Septimius Severus</a> and <a href="Pescennius%20Niger">Pescennius Niger</a>, both rebel generals declared to be emperors by the troops they commanded, clashed for the first time in 193 AD at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cyzicus%20%28193%29">Battle of Cyzicus</a>, in which Niger was defeated. However, it took two further defeats at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Nicaea">Battle of Nicaea</a> later that year and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Issus%20%28194%29">Battle of Issus</a> the following year, for Niger to be destroyed. Almost as soon as Niger's usurpation had been ended, Severus was forced to deal with another rival for the throne in the person of <a href="Clodius%20Albinus">Clodius Albinus</a>, who had originally been allied to Severus. Albinus was proclaimed emperor by his troops in Britain and, crossing over to Gaul, defeated Severus' general <a href="Virius%20Lupus">Virius Lupus</a> in battle, before being in turn defeated and killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lugdunum">Battle of Lugdunum</a> by Severus himself.

After this turmoil, Severus faced no more internal threats for the rest of his reign, and the reign of his successor <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a> passed uninterrupted for a while until he was murdered by <a href="Macrinus">Macrinus</a>, who proclaimed himself emperor. Despite Macrinus having his position ratified by the Roman senate, the troops of <a href="Elagabalus">Varius Avitus</a> declared him to be emperor instead, and the two met in battle at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Antioch%20%28218%29">Battle of Antioch</a> in 218 AD, in which Macrinus was defeated. However, Avitus himself, after taking the imperial name Elagabalus, was murdered shortly afterwards and <a href="Alexander%20Severus">Alexander Severus</a> was proclaimed emperor by both the Praetorian Guard and the senate who, after a short reign, was murdered in turn. His murderers were working on behalf of the army who were unhappy with their lot under his rule and who raised in his place <a href="Maximinus%20Thrax">Maximinus Thrax</a>. However, just as he had been raised by the army, Maximinus was also brought down by them and despite winning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Carthage%20%28238%29">Battle of Carthage</a> against the senate's newly proclaimed <a href="Gordian%20II">Gordian II</a>, he too was murdered when it appeared to his forces as though he would not be able to best the next senatorial candidate for the throne, <a href="Gordian%20III">Gordian III</a>.

Gordian III's fate is not certain, although he may have been murdered by his own successor, <a href="Philip%20the%20Arab">Philip the Arab</a>, who ruled for only a few years before the army again raised a general, <a href="Decius">Decius</a>, by their proclamation to emperor, who then defeated Philip in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verona%20%28251%29">Battle of Verona</a>. Several succeeding generals avoided battling usurpers for the throne by being murdered by their own troops before battle could commence. The lone exception to this rule was <a href="Gallienus">Gallienus</a>, emperor from 260 to 268 AD, who confronted a <a href="Gallienus%20usurpers">remarkable array of usurpers</a>, most of whom he defeated in pitched battle. The army was mostly spared further infighting until around 273 AD, when Aurelian defeated the Gallic usurper <a href="Tetricus%20I">Tetricus</a> in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chalons%20%28273%29">Battle of Chalons</a>. The next decade saw an incredible number of usurpers, sometimes three at the same time, all vying for the imperial throne. Most of the battles are not recorded, due primarily to the turmoil of the time, until <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a>, a usurper himself, defeated <a href="Carinus">Carinus</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Margus">Battle of the Margus</a> and become emperor.

Some small measure of stability again returned at this point, with the empire split into a Tetrarchy of two greater and two lesser emperors, a system that staved off civil wars for a short time until 312 AD. In that year, relations between the tetrarchy collapsed for good and <a href="Constantine%20I">Constantine I</a>, <a href="Licinius">Licinius</a>, <a href="Maxentius">Maxentius</a> and <a href="Maximinus%20II">Maximinus</a> jostled for control of the empire. In the <a href="Battle%20of%20Turin%20%28312%29">Battle of Turin</a> Constantine defeated Maxentius, and in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Tzirallum">Battle of Tzirallum</a>, <a href="Licinius">Licinius</a> defeated <a href="Maximinus%20II">Maximinus</a>. From 314 AD onwards, Constantine defeated Licinius in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cibalae">Battle of Cibalae</a>, then the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mardia">Battle of Mardia</a>, and then again at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Adrianople%20%28324%29">Battle of Adrianople</a>, the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Hellespont">Battle of the Hellespont</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chrysopolis">Battle of Chrysopolis</a>.

Constantine then turned upon Maxentius, beating him in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verona%20%28312%29">Battle of Verona</a> and the <a href="Battle%20of%20Milvian%20Bridge">Battle of Milvian Bridge</a> in the same year. Constantine's son <a href="Constantius%20II">Constantius II</a> inherited his father's rule and later defeated the usurper <a href="Magnentius">Magnentius</a> in first the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mursa%20Major">Battle of Mursa Major</a> and then the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons%20Seleucus">Battle of Mons Seleucus</a>.

Successive emperors <a href="Valens">Valens</a> and <a href="Theodosius%20I">Theodosius I</a> also defeated usurpers in, respectively, the <a href="Battle%20of%20Thyatira">Battle of Thyatira</a>, and the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Save">the Save</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Frigidus">the Frigidus</a>.

After overthrowing the Parthian confederacy, the <a href="Sassanid%20Empire">Sassanid Empire</a> that arose from its remains pursued a more aggressive expansionist policy than their predecessors and continued to make war against Rome. In 230 AD, the first Sassanid emperor attacked Roman territory first in <a href="Armenia">Armenia</a> and then in <a href="Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a> but Roman losses were largely restored by <a href="Alexander%20Severus">Severus</a> within a few years. In 243 AD, Emperor <a href="Gordian%20III">Gordian III</a>'s army retook the Roman cities of Hatra, Nisibis and Carrhae from the Sassanids after defeating the Sassanids at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Resaena">Battle of Resaena</a> but what happened next is unclear: Persian sources claim that Gordian was defeated and killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Misikhe">Battle of Misikhe</a> but Roman sources mention this battle only as an insignificant setback and suggest that Gordian died elsewhere.

Certainly, the Sassanids had not been cowed by the previous battles with Rome and in 253 AD the Sassanids under <a href="Shapur%20I">Shapur I</a> penetrated deeply into Roman territory several times, defeating a Roman force at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Barbalissos">Battle of Barbalissos</a> and conquering and plundering <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>ia in 252 AD following the <a href="Antioch">Siege of Antiochia</a>. The Romans recovered Antioch by 253 AD, and Emperor Valerian gathered an army and marched eastward to the Sassanid borders. In 260 AD at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edessa">Battle of Edessa</a> the Sassanids defeated the Roman army and captured the Roman Emperor <a href="Valerian%20%28emperor%29">Valerian</a>.

By the late 3rd century, Roman fortunes on the eastern frontier improved dramatically. During a period of civil upheaval in Persia, emperor <a href="Carus">Carus</a> led a successful campaign into Persia essentially uncontested, sacking Ctesiphon in 283 AD. During the reign of the <a href="Tetrarchy">Tetrarchy</a>, emperors <a href="Diocletian">Diocletian</a> and <a href="Galerius">Galerius</a> brought a decisive conclusion to the war, sacking Ctesiphon in 299 AD and expanding the Roman eastern frontier dramatically with the <a href="Peace%20of%20Nisibis%20%28299%29">Treaty of Nisibis</a>. The treaty brought lasting peace between Rome and the Sassanids for almost four decades until the end of <a href="Constantine%20the%20Great">Constantine the Great</a>'s reign. In 337 AD, <a href="Shapur%20II">Shapur II</a> broke the peace and began a 26-year conflict, attempting with little success to conquer Roman fortresses in the region. After early Sassanid successes including the <a href="Battle%20of%20Amida">Battle of Amida</a> in 359 AD and the <a href="Siege%20of%20Pirisabora">Siege of Pirisabora</a> in 363 AD, Emperor <a href="Julian%20the%20Apostate">Julian</a> met Shapur in 363 AD in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Ctesiphon%20%28363%29">Battle of Ctesiphon</a> outside the walls of the Persian capital. The Romans were victorious but were unable to take the city, and were forced to retreat due to their vulnerable position in the middle of hostile territory. Julian was killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Samarra">Battle of Samarra</a> during the retreat, possibly by one of his own men.

There were several future wars, although all brief and small-scale, since both the Romans and the Sassanids were forced to deal with threats from other directions during the 5th century. A war against <a href="Bahram%20V">Bahram V</a> in 420 AD over the persecution of the Christians in Persia led to a brief war that was soon concluded by treaty and in 441 AD a war with <a href="Yazdegerd%20II">Yazdegerd II</a> was again swiftly concluded by treaty after both parties battled threats elsewhere.

Many theories have been advanced in way of explanation for <a href="decline%20of%20the%20Roman%20Empire">decline of the Roman Empire</a>, and many dates given for its fall, from the onset of its decline in the 3rd century to the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Militarily, however, the Empire finally fell after first being overrun by various non-Roman peoples and then having its heart in Italy seized by Germanic troops in a revolt. The historicity and exact dates are uncertain, and some historians do not consider that the Empire fell at this point.

The Empire became gradually less Romanised and increasingly Germanic in nature: although the Empire buckled under Visigothic assault, the overthrow of the last Emperor <a href="Romulus%20Augustus">Romulus Augustus</a> was carried out by federated Germanic troops from within the Roman army rather than by foreign troops. In this sense had Odoacer not renounced the title of Emperor and named himself "King of Italy" instead, the Empire might have continued in name. Its identity, however, was no longer Roman – it was increasingly populated and governed by Germanic peoples long before 476 AD. The Roman people were by the 5th century "bereft of their military ethos" and the Roman army itself a mere supplement to federated troops of Goths, Huns, Franks and others fighting on their behalf.

Rome's last gasp began when the Visigoths revolted around 395 AD. Led by <a href="Alaric%20I">Alaric I</a>, they attempted to seize Constantinople, but were rebuffed and instead plundered much of Thrace in northern Greece. In 402 AD they besieged Mediolanum, the capital of Roman Emperor <a href="Honorius%20%28emperor%29">Honorius</a>, defended by Roman Gothic troops. The arrival of the Roman <a href="Stilicho">Stilicho</a> and his army forced Alaric to lift his siege and move his army towards Hasta (modern Asti) in western Italy, where Stilicho attacked it at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Pollentia">Battle of Pollentia</a>, capturing Alaric's camp. Stilicho offered to return the prisoners in exchange for the Visigoths returning to Illyricum but upon arriving at Verona, Alaric halted his retreat. Stilicho again attacked at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Verona%20%28402%29">Battle of Verona</a> and again defeated Alaric, forcing him to withdraw from Italy.

In 405 AD, the Ostrogoths invaded Italy itself, but were defeated. However, in 406 AD an unprecedented number of tribes took advantage of the freezing of the Rhine to cross "en masse": Vandals, Suevi, Alans and Burgundians swept across the river and met little resistance in the <a href="Sack%20of%20Moguntiacum">Sack of Moguntiacum</a> and the <a href="Sack%20of%20Treviri">Sack of Treviri</a>, completely overrunning Gaul. Despite this grave danger, or perhaps because of it, the Roman army continued to be wracked by usurpation, in one of which Stilicho, Rome's foremost defender of the period, was put to death.

It is in this climate that, despite his earlier setback, Alaric returned again in 410 AD and managed to <a href="Sack%20of%20Rome%20%28410%29">sack Rome</a>. The Roman capital had by this time moved to the Italian city of <a href="Ravenna">Ravenna</a>, but some historians view 410 AD as an alternative date for the true fall of the Roman Empire. Without possession of Rome or many of its former provinces, and increasingly Germanic in nature, the Roman Empire after 410 AD had little in common with the earlier Empire. By 410 AD, Britain had been mostly denuded of Roman troops, and by 425 AD was no longer part of the Empire, and much of western Europe was beset "by all kinds of calamities and disasters", coming under barbarian kingdoms ruled by <a href="Vandals">Vandals</a>, <a href="Suebians">Suebians</a>, <a href="Visigoths">Visigoths</a> and <a href="Burgundians">Burgundians</a>.

The remainder of Rome's territory—if not its nature—was defended for several decades following 410 AD largely by <a href="Flavius%20A%C3%ABtius">Flavius Aëtius</a>, who managed to play off each of Rome's barbarian invaders against one another. In 436 AD he led a Hunnic army against the Visigoths at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Arles">Battle of Arles</a>, and again in 436 AD at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Narbonne%20%28436%29">Battle of Narbonne</a>. In 451 AD he led a combined army, including his former enemy the Visigoths, against the Huns at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Catalaunian%20Plains">Battle of the Catalaunian Plains</a>, beating them so soundly that although they later sacked Concordia, <a href="Altinum">Altinum</a>, <a href="Mediolanum">Mediolanum</a>, <a href="Ticinum">Ticinum</a>, and <a href="Patavium">Patavium</a>, they never again directly threatened Rome. Despite being the only clear champion of the Empire at this point Aëtius was slain by the Emperor <a href="Valentinian%20III">Valentinian III</a>'s own hand, leading <a href="Sidonius%20Apollinaris">Sidonius Apollinaris</a> to observe, "I am ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only know that you have acted like a man who has cut off his right hand with his left".

Carthage, the second largest city in the empire, was <a href="Battle%20of%20Carthage%20%28439%29">lost</a> along with much of North Africa in 439 AD to the Vandals, and the fate of Rome seemed sealed. By 476 AD, what remained of the Empire was completely in the hands of federated Germanic troops and when they revolted, led by <a href="Odoacer">Odoacer</a> and deposed the Emperor <a href="Romulus%20Augustus">Romulus Augustus</a> there was nobody to stop them. Odoacer happened to hold the part of the Empire around Italy and Rome but other parts of the Empire were ruled by Visigoths, Ostrogoths, Franks, Alans and others. The Empire in the West had fallen, and its remnant in Italy was no longer Roman in nature. The <a href="Byzantine%20Empire">Eastern Roman Empire</a> and the Goths continued to fight over Rome and the surrounding area for many years, though by this point Rome's importance was primarily symbolic.

Mark Oliphant

Sir Marcus Laurence Elwin "Mark" Oliphant (8 October 1901 – 14 July 2000) was an Australian <a href="physicist">physicist</a> and <a href="Humanitarianism">humanitarian</a> who played an important role in the first experimental demonstration of <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a> and in the development of <a href="nuclear%20weapon">nuclear weapon</a>s.

Born and raised in <a href="Adelaide">Adelaide</a>, <a href="South%20Australia">South Australia</a>, Oliphant graduated from the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> in 1922. He was awarded an <a href="1851%20Exhibition%20Scholarship">1851 Exhibition Scholarship</a> in 1927 on the strength of the research he had done on <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, and went to England, where he studied under Sir <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>'s <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a>. There, he used a <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a> to fire <a href="heavy%20hydrogen">heavy hydrogen</a> <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> (<a href="deuteron">deuteron</a>s) at various targets. He discovered the respective nuclei of <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a> (helions) and of <a href="tritium">tritium</a> (tritons). He also discovered that when they <a href="neutron%E2%80%93proton%20ratio">reacted with each other</a>, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. Energy had been liberated from inside the nucleus, and he realised that this was a result of nuclear fusion.

Oliphant left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1937 to become the <a href="John%20Henry%20Poynting">Poynting</a> Professor of Physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>. He attempted to build a <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> at the university, but its completion was postponed by the outbreak of the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a> in <a href="Europe">Europe</a> in 1939. He became involved with the development of <a href="radar">radar</a>, heading a group at the University of Birmingham that included <a href="John%20Randall%20%28physicist%29">John Randall</a> and <a href="Harry%20Boot">Harry Boot</a>. They created a radical new design, the <a href="cavity%20magnetron">cavity magnetron</a>, that made <a href="microwave%20radar">microwave radar</a> possible. Oliphant also formed part of the <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a>, which reported in July 1941, that an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a> was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. Oliphant was instrumental in spreading the word of this finding in the United States, thereby starting what became the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>. Later in the war, he worked on it with his friend <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a> at the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a> in <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>, developing <a href="electromagnetic%20isotope%20separation">electromagnetic isotope separation</a>, which provided the <a href="fissile">fissile</a> component of the <a href="Little%20Boy">Little Boy</a> atomic bomb used in the <a href="atomic%20bombing%20of%20Hiroshima">atomic bombing of Hiroshima</a> in August 1945.

After the war, Oliphant returned to Australia as the first director of the <a href="Research%20School%20of%20Physical%20Sciences%20and%20Engineering">Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering</a> at the new <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> (ANU), where he initiated the design and construction of the world's largest (500 megajoule) <a href="homopolar%20generator">homopolar generator</a>. He retired in 1967, but was appointed <a href="Governor%20of%20South%20Australia">Governor of South Australia</a> on the advice of <a href="Premier%20of%20South%20Australia">Premier</a> <a href="Don%20Dunstan">Don Dunstan</a>. He assisted in the founding of the <a href="Australian%20Democrats">Australian Democrats</a> political party, and he was the chairman of the meeting in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> in 1977 at which the party was launched. Late in life he witnessed his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary <a href="euthanasia">euthanasia</a>. He died in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> in 2000.

Marcus "Mark" Laurence Elwin Oliphant was born on 8 October 1901 in <a href="Kent%20Town%2C%20South%20Australia">Kent Town</a>, a suburb of Adelaide. His father was Harold George "Baron" Oliphant, a <a href="civil%20servant">civil servant</a> with the <a href="SA%20Water">South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department</a> and part-time lecturer in Economics with the <a href="Workers%27%20Educational%20Association">Workers' Educational Association</a>. His mother was Beatrice Edith Fanny Oliphant, née Tucker, an artist. He was named after <a href="Marcus%20Clarke">Marcus Clarke</a>, the Australian author, and <a href="Laurence%20Oliphant%20%28author%29">Laurence Oliphant</a>, the British traveller and mystic. Most people called him Mark; this became official when he was knighted in 1959. He had four younger brothers, Roland, Keith, Nigel and Donald. His parents were <a href="theosophist">theosophist</a>s, and as such were opposed to eating meat. Marcus became a lifelong <a href="vegetarian">vegetarian</a> while a boy, after witnessing the slaughter of pigs on a farm. He was found to be completely deaf in one ear and he needed glasses for severe <a href="astigmatism">astigmatism</a> and short-sightedness.

Oliphant was first educated at primary schools in <a href="Goodwood%2C%20South%20Australia">Goodwood</a> and <a href="Mylor%2C%20South%20Australia">Mylor</a>, after the family moved there in 1910. He attended <a href="Unley%20High%20School">Unley High School</a> in Adelaide, and, for his final year in 1918, <a href="Adelaide%20High%20School">Adelaide High School</a>. After graduation he failed to obtain a <a href="bursary">bursary</a> to attend university, and so got a job cleaning floors for a jewellery manufacturer. He then got a <a href="cadetship">cadetship</a> with the <a href="State%20Library%20of%20South%20Australia">State Library of South Australia</a>, which allowed him to take courses at the <a href="University%20of%20Adelaide">University of Adelaide</a> at night.

In 1919, Oliphant began studying at the University of Adelaide. At first he was interested in a career in medicine, but later in the year <a href="Kerr%20Grant">Kerr Grant</a>, the physics professor, offered him a cadetship in the Physics Department. It paid 10 <a href="shilling%20%28Australian%29">shilling</a>s a week (), the same amount that Oliphant received for working at the State Library, but it allowed him to take any university course that did not conflict with his work for the department. He received his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Science">Bachelor of Science</a> (BSc) degree in 1921 and then did <a href="honours%20degree">honours</a> the following year, supervised by Grant. Roy Burdon, who acted as head of the department when Grant went on sabbatical in 1925, worked with Oliphant to produce two papers in 1927 on the properties of <a href="Mercury%20%28element%29">mercury</a>, "The Problem of the Surface Tension of Mercury and the Action of Aqueous Solutions on a Mercury Surface" and "Absorption of Gases on the Surface of Mercury". Oliphant later recalled that Burdon taught him "the extraordinary exhilaration there was in even minor discoveries in the field of physics".

Oliphant married Rosa Louise Wilbraham, who was also from Adelaide, on 23 May 1925. The two had known each other since they were teenagers. He made Rosa's wedding ring in the laboratory from a gold nugget (from the <a href="Coolgardie">Coolgardie</a> Goldfields) that his father had given him.

In 1925, Oliphant heard a speech given by the New Zealand physicist Sir <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a>, and he decided he wanted to work for him – an ambition that he fulfilled by earning a position at the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> in 1927. He applied for an <a href="1851%20Exhibition%20Scholarship">1851 Exhibition Scholarship</a> on the strength of the research he had done on mercury with Burdon. It came with a living allowance of £250 per annum (). When word came through that he had been awarded a fellowship, he <a href="electrical%20telegraph">wired</a> Rutherford and <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College</a>, Cambridge. Both accepted him.
Rutherford's Cavendish Laboratory was carrying out some of the most advanced research into <a href="nuclear%20physics">nuclear physics</a> in the world at the time. Oliphant was invited to afternoon tea by Rutherford and Lady Rutherford. He soon got to meet other researchers at the Cavendish Laboratory, including <a href="Patrick%20Blackett">Patrick Blackett</a>, <a href="Edward%20Bullard">Edward Bullard</a>, <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a>, <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a>, <a href="Charles%20Drummond%20Ellis">Charles Ellis</a>, <a href="Peter%20Kapitza">Peter Kapitza</a>, <a href="Philip%20Moon">Philip Moon</a> and <a href="Ernest%20Walton">Ernest Walton</a>. There were two fellow Australians: <a href="Harrie%20Massey">Harrie Massey</a> and <a href="John%20Keith%20Roberts">John Keith Roberts</a>. Oliphant would become especially close friends with Cockcroft. The laboratory had considerable talent but not a lot of money to spare, and tended to use a "string and sealing wax" approach to experimental equipment. Oliphant had to buy his own equipment, at one point spending £24 () of his allowance on a vacuum pump.

Oliphant submitted his <a href="PhD">PhD</a> thesis on "The Neutralization of Positive Ions at Metal Surfaces, and the Emission of Secondary Electrons" in December 1929. For his "<a href="oral%20exam">viva</a>", he was examined by Rutherford and Ellis. Receiving his degree was the attainment of a major life goal, but it also meant the end of his 1851 Exhibition Scholarship. Oliphant secured an 1851 Senior Studentship, of which there were five awarded each year. It came with a living allowance of £450 per annum () for two years, with the possibility of a one-year extension in exceptional circumstances, which Oliphant was also awarded.

A son, Geoffrey Bruce Oliphant, was born 6 October 1930, but he died of <a href="meningitis">meningitis</a> on 5 September 1933, and was interred in an unmarked grave in the <a href="Ascension%20Parish%20Burial%20Ground%2C%20Cambridge">Ascension Parish Burial Ground</a> in Cambridge alongside Timothy Cockcroft, the infant son of Sir John and Lady Elizabeth Cockcroft, who had died the year before. Unable to have more children, the Oliphants adopted a four-month-old boy, Michael John, in 1936, and a daughter, Vivian, in 1938.
In 1932 and 1933, the scientists at the Cavendish Laboratory made a series of ground-breaking discoveries. Cockcroft and Walton bombarded <a href="lithium">lithium</a> with high energy <a href="proton">proton</a>s and succeeded in <a href="nuclear%20transmutation">transmuting</a> it into energetic <a href="atomic%20nucleus">nuclei</a> of <a href="helium">helium</a>. This was one of the earliest experiments to change the <a href="atomic%20nucleus">atomic nucleus</a> of one element to another by artificial means. Then Chadwick devised an experiment that discovered a new, uncharged particle with roughly the same mass as the proton: the <a href="neutron">neutron</a>. In 1933, Blackett discovered tracks in his <a href="cloud%20chamber">cloud chamber</a> that confirmed the existence of the <a href="positron">positron</a> and revealed the opposing spiral traces of positron–electron <a href="pair%20production">pair production</a>.

Oliphant followed up the work by constructing a <a href="particle%20accelerator">particle accelerator</a> that could fire protons with up to 600,000 <a href="electronvolts">electronvolts</a> of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockcroft and Walton on the <a href="artificial%20disintegration">artificial disintegration</a> of the nucleus and positive <a href="ion">ion</a>s. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received a gift from the American <a href="physical%20chemist">physical chemist</a> <a href="Gilbert%20N.%20Lewis">Gilbert N. Lewis</a> of a few drops of <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a>. The accelerator was used to fire <a href="heavy%20hydrogen">heavy hydrogen</a> nuclei ("<a href="deuteron">deuteron</a>s", which Rutherford called "diplons") at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of <a href="helium-3">helium-3</a> ("helions") and <a href="tritium">tritium</a> ("tritons").

Oliphant used <a href="electromagnetic%20separation">electromagnetic separation</a> to separate the isotopes of lithium. He was the first to experimentally demonstrate <a href="nuclear%20fusion">nuclear fusion</a>. He found that when deuterons reacted with nuclei of helium-3, tritium or with other deuterons, the particles that were released had far more energy than they started with. <a href="Binding%20energy">Binding energy</a> had been liberated from inside the nucleus. Following <a href="Arthur%20Eddington">Arthur Eddington</a>'s 1920 prediction that energy released by <a href="nuclear%20fusion">fusing</a> small nuclei together could provide the energy source that powers the stars, Oliphant speculated that nuclear fusion reactions might be what powered the sun. With its higher <a href="cross%20section%20%28physics%29%23Nuclear%20physics">cross section</a>, the deuterium–tritium nuclear fusion reaction became the basis of a <a href="hydrogen%20bomb">hydrogen bomb</a>. Oliphant had not foreseen this development:

In 1934, Cockcroft arranged for Oliphant to become a fellow of <a href="St%20John%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">St John's College, Cambridge</a>, which paid about £600 a year. When Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory for the <a href="University%20of%20Liverpool">University of Liverpool</a> in 1935, Oliphant and Ellis both replaced him as Rutherford's assistant director for research. The job came with a salary of £600 (). With the money from St John's, this gave him a comfortable income. Oliphant soon fitted out a new accelerator laboratory with a 1.23 <a href="Electronvolt">MeV</a> generator at a cost of £6,000 () while he designed an even larger 2 MeV generator. He was the first to conceive of the proton <a href="synchrotron">synchrotron</a>, a new type of cyclic particle accelerator. In 1937, he was elected to the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>. When he died he was its longest-serving fellow.

<a href="Samuel%20Walter%20Johnson%20Smith">Samuel Walter Johnson Smith</a>'s imminent mandatory retirement at age 65 prompted a search for a new <a href="John%20Henry%20Poynting">Poynting</a> Professor of Physics at the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>. The University wanted not just a replacement, but a well-known name, and was willing to spend lavishly in order to build up nuclear physics expertise at Birmingham. Neville Moss, its Professor of <a href="Mining%20Engineering">Mining Engineering</a> and the Dean of its Faculty of Science approached Oliphant, who presented his terms. In addition to his salary of £1,300 (), he wanted the University to spend £2,000 () to upgrade the laboratory, and another £1,000 per annum () on it. And he did not wish to start until October 1937, to enable him to wrap up his work at the Cavendish Laboratory. Moss agreed to Oliphant's terms.

To obtain funding for the <a href="cyclotron">cyclotron</a> that he wanted, Oliphant wrote to the British prime minister, <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a>, who was from <a href="Birmingham">Birmingham</a>. Chamberlain took up the matter with his friend <a href="Lord%20Nuffield">Lord Nuffield</a>, who provided £60,000 () for the project, enough for the cyclotron, a new building to house it, and a trip to <a href="Berkeley%2C%20California">Berkeley, California</a>, so Oliphant could confer with <a href="Ernest%20Lawrence">Ernest Lawrence</a>, the inventor of the cyclotron. Lawrence supported the project, sending Oliphant the plans of the cyclotron that he was constructing at Berkeley, and inviting Oliphant to visit him at the <a href="Lawrence%20Berkeley%20National%20Laboratory">Radiation Laboratory</a>. Oliphant sailed for New York on 10 December 1938, and met Lawrence in Berkeley. The two men got along very well, dining at "<a href="Trader%20Vic%27s">Trader Vic's</a>" in <a href="Oakland">Oakland</a>. Oliphant was aware of the problems in building cyclotrons encountered by Chadwick at the University of Liverpool and Cockcroft at the Cavendish Laboratory, and intended to avoid these and get his cyclotron built on time and on budget by following Lawrence's specifications as closely as possible. He hoped that it would be running by Christmas 1939, but the outbreak of the Second World War quashed his hopes. The Nuffield Cyclotron would not be completed until after the war.

In 1938, Oliphant became involved with the development of <a href="radar">radar</a>, then still a secret. While visiting prototype radar stations, he realised that shorter-wavelength <a href="radio%20waves">radio waves</a> were needed urgently, especially if there was to be any chance of building a radar set small enough to fit into an aircraft. In August 1939, he took a small group to <a href="Ventnor">Ventnor</a>, on the <a href="Isle%20of%20Wight">Isle of Wight</a>, to examine the <a href="Chain%20Home">Chain Home</a> system first hand. He obtained a grant from the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> to develop radar systems with wavelengths less than ; the best available at the time was .

Oliphant's group at Birmingham worked on developing two promising devices, the <a href="klystron">klystron</a> and the <a href="magnetron">magnetron</a>. Working with <a href="James%20Sayers%20%28physicist%29">James Sayers</a>, Oliphant managed to produce an improved version of the klystron capable of generating 400W. Meanwhile, two more members of his Birmingham team, <a href="John%20Randall%20%28physicist%29">John Randall</a> and <a href="Harry%20Boot">Harry Boot</a>, worked on a radical new design, a cavity magnetron. By February 1940, they had an output of 400W with a wavelength of , just the kind of <a href="microwaves">short wavelengths</a> needed for good airborne radars. The magnetron's power was soon increased a hundred-fold, and Birmingham concentrated on magnetron development. The first operational magnetrons were delivered in August 1941. This invention was one of the key scientific breakthroughs during the war and played a major part in defeating the German <a href="U-boats">U-boats</a>, intercepting enemy bombers, and in directing Allied bombers.

In 1940, the <a href="Fall%20of%20France">Fall of France</a>, and the possibility that Britain might be invaded, prompted Oliphant to send his wife and children to Australia. The <a href="Fall%20of%20Singapore">Fall of Singapore</a> in February 1942 led him to offer his services to <a href="John%20Madsen%20%28physicist%29">John Madsen</a>, the Professor of Electrical Engineering at the <a href="University%20of%20Sydney">University of Sydney</a>, and the head of the Radiophysics Laboratory at the <a href="Council%20for%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research">Council for Scientific and Industrial Research</a>, which was responsible for developing radar. He embarked from Glasgow for Australia on on 20 March. The voyage, part of a 46-ship convoy, was a slow one, with the convoy frequently zigzagging to avoid U-boats, and the ship did not reach Fremantle until 27 May.

The Australians were already preparing to produce radar sets locally. Oliphant persuaded Professor <a href="Thomas%20Laby">Thomas Laby</a> to release <a href="Eric%20Burhop">Eric Burhop</a> and <a href="Leslie%20H.%20Martin">Leslie Martin</a> from their work on optical munitions to work on radar, and they succeeded in building a cavity magnetron in their laboratory at the <a href="University%20of%20Melbourne">University of Melbourne</a> in May 1942. Oliphant worked with Martin on the process of moving the magnetrons for the laboratory to the production line. Over 2,000 radar sets were produced in Australia during the war.

At the University of Birmingham in March 1940, <a href="Otto%20Frisch">Otto Frisch</a> and <a href="Rudolf%20Peierls">Rudolf Peierls</a> examined the theoretical issues involved in developing, producing and using <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>s in a paper that became known as the <a href="Frisch%E2%80%93Peierls%20memorandum">Frisch–Peierls memorandum</a>. They considered what would happen to a sphere of pure uranium-235, and found that not only could a <a href="chain%20reaction">chain reaction</a> occur, but it might require as little as of uranium-235 to unleash the energy of hundreds of tons of <a href="TNT">TNT</a>. The first person they showed their paper to was Oliphant, and he immediately took it to Sir <a href="Henry%20Tizard">Henry Tizard</a>, the chairman of the Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Warfare (CSSAW). As a result, a special subcommittee of the CSSAW known as the <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a> was created to investigate the matter further. It was chaired by Sir <a href="George%20Paget%20Thomson">George Thomson</a>, and its original membership included Oliphant, Chadwick, Cockcroft and Moon. In its final report in July 1941, the MAUD Committee concluded that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943.
Great Britain was at war and authorities there thought that the development of an atomic bomb was urgent, but there was much less urgency in the United States. Oliphant was one of the people who pushed the American program into motion. On 5 August 1941, Oliphant flew to the United States in a <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> bomber, ostensibly to discuss the radar-development program, but was assigned to find out why the United States was ignoring the findings of the MAUD Committee. He later recalled: "the minutes and reports had been sent to <a href="Lyman%20Briggs">Lyman Briggs</a>, who was the Director of the Uranium Committee, and we were puzzled to receive virtually no comment. I called on Briggs in Washington [DC], only to find out that this inarticulate and unimpressive man had put the reports in his safe and had not shown them to members of his committee. I was amazed and distressed."

Oliphant then met with the Uranium Committee at its meeting in New York on 26 August 1941. <a href="Samuel%20King%20Allison">Samuel K. Allison</a>, a new member of the Committee, was an experimental physicist and a protégé of <a href="Arthur%20Compton">Arthur Compton</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. He recalled that Oliphant "came to a meeting and said 'bomb' in no uncertain terms. He told us we must concentrate every effort on the bomb, and said we had no right to work on power plants or anything but the bomb. The bomb would cost 25 million dollars, he said, and Britain did not have the money or the manpower, so it was up to us." Allison was surprised that Briggs had kept the committee in the dark. Oliphant then travelled to Berkeley, where he met his friend Lawrence on 23 September, giving him a copy of the Frisch–Peierls memorandum. Lawrence had <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> check the figures, bringing him into the project for the first time. Oliphant found another ally in Oppenheimer, and he not only managed to convince Lawrence and Oppenheimer that an atomic bomb was feasible, but inspired Lawrence to convert his cyclotron into a giant <a href="mass%20spectrometer">mass spectrometer</a> for <a href="electromagnetic%20isotope%20separation">electromagnetic isotope separation</a>, a technique Oliphant had pioneered in 1934. <a href="Leo%20Szilard">Leo Szilard</a> later wrote, "if Congress knew the true history of the atomic energy project, I have no doubt but that it would create a special medal to be given to meddling foreigners for distinguished services, and that Dr Oliphant would be the first to receive one."
On 26 October 1942, Oliphant embarked from Melbourne, taking Rosa and the children back with him. The wartime sea voyage on the French "Desirade" was again a slow one, and they did not reach Glasgow until 29 February 1943. He had to leave them behind once more in November 1943 after the British <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> effort was merged with the American <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a> by the <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a>, and he left for the United States as part of the <a href="British%20contribution%20to%20the%20Manhattan%20Project">British Mission</a>. Oliphant was one of the scientists whose services the Americans were most eager to secure. Oppenheimer, who was now the director of the <a href="Los%20Alamos%20Laboratory">Los Alamos Laboratory</a> attempted to persuade him to join the team there, but Oliphant preferred to head a team assisting his friend Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley to develop the electromagnetic <a href="uranium%20enrichment">uranium enrichment</a>—a vital but less overtly military part of the project.

Oliphant secured the services of fellow Australian physicist <a href="Harrie%20Massey">Harrie Massey</a>, who had been working for the Admiralty on <a href="magnetic%20mines">magnetic mines</a>, along with James Stayers and Stanley Duke, who had worked with him on the <a href="cavity%20magnetron">cavity magnetron</a>. This initial group set out for Berkeley in a <a href="B-24%20Liberator">B-24 Liberator</a> bomber in November 1943. Oliphant became Lawrence's "de facto" deputy, and was in charge of the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. Although based in Berkeley, he often visited <a href="Oak%20Ridge%2C%20Tennessee">Oak Ridge, Tennessee</a>, where the separation plant was, and was an occasional visitor to Los Alamos. He made efforts to involve Australian scientists in the project, and had Sir <a href="David%20Rivett">David Rivett</a>, the head of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, release Eric Burhop to work on the Manhattan Project. He briefed <a href="Stanley%20Bruce">Stanley Bruce</a>, the <a href="Australian%20High%20Commissioner%20to%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom</a>, on the project, and urged the Australian government to secure Australian uranium deposits.

A meeting with <a href="Major%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Leslie%20Groves">Leslie Groves</a>, the director of the Manhattan Project, at Berkeley in September 1944, convinced Oliphant that the Americans intended to monopolise nuclear weapons after the war, restricting British research and production to Canada, and not permitting nuclear weapons technology to be shared with Australia. Characteristically, Oliphant bypassed Chadwick, the head of the British Mission, and sent a report direct to <a href="Wallace%20Akers">Wallace Akers</a>, the head of the <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> Directorate in London. Akers summoned Oliphant back to London for consultation. En route, Oliphant met with Chadwick and other members of the British Mission in Washington, where the prospect of resuming an independent British project was discussed. Chadwick was adamant that the cooperation with the Americans should continue, and that Oliphant and his team should remain until the task of building an atomic bomb was finished. Akers sent Chadwick a telegram directing that Oliphant should return to the UK by April 1945. 

Oliphant returned to England in March 1945, and resumed his post as a professor of physics at the University of Birmingham. He was on holiday in Wales with his family when he first heard of the <a href="atomic%20bombing%20of%20Hiroshima%20and%20Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>. He was later to remark that he felt "sort of proud that the bomb had worked, and absolutely appalled at what it had done to human beings". Oliphant became a harsh critic of nuclear weapons and a member of the <a href="Pugwash%20Conferences%20on%20Science%20and%20World%20Affairs">Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs</a>, saying, "I, right from the beginning, have been terribly worried by the existence of nuclear weapons and very much against their use." His wartime work would have earned him a <a href="Medal%20of%20Freedom%20%281945%29">Medal of Freedom</a> with Gold Palm, but the Australian government vetoed this honour, as government policy at the time was not to confer honours on civilians.

In April 1946, the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Ben%20Chifley">Ben Chifley</a>, asked Oliphant if he would be a technical advisor to the Australian delegation to the newly formed <a href="United%20Nations%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">United Nations Atomic Energy Commission</a> (UNAEC), which was debating international control of nuclear weapons. Oliphant agreed, and joined the <a href="Minister%20for%20Foreign%20Affairs%20%28Australia%29">Minister for External Affairs</a>, <a href="H.%20V.%20Evatt">H. V. Evatt</a> and the Australian Representative at the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>, <a href="Paul%20Hasluck">Paul Hasluck</a>, to hear the <a href="Baruch%20Plan">Baruch Plan</a>. The attempt at international control was unsuccessful, and no agreement was reached.

Chifley, and the Minister for <a href="Department%20of%20Post-War%20Reconstruction">Post-War Reconstruction</a>, Dr <a href="H.%20C.%20Coombs">H. C. "Nugget" Coombs</a>, also discussed with Oliphant a plan to create a new research institute that would attract the world's best scholars to Australia and lift the standard of university education nationwide. They hoped to start by attracting three of Australia's most distinguished expatriates: Oliphant, <a href="Howard%20Florey">Howard Florey</a> and <a href="Sir%20%28William%29%20Keith%20Hancock">Keith Hancock</a>. It was academic suicide; Australia was far from the centres where the latest research was being carried out, and communications were much poorer at that time. But Oliphant accepted, and in 1950 returned to Australia as the first Director of the <a href="Research%20School%20of%20Physical%20Sciences%20and%20Engineering">Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering</a> at the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a>. Within the school he created a Department of Particle Physics, which he headed himself, a Department of Nuclear Physics under <a href="Ernest%20Titterton">Ernest Titterton</a>, a Department of Geophysics under John Jaeger, a Department of Astronomy under <a href="Bart%20Bok">Bart Bok</a>, a Department of Theoretical Physics under <a href="Kenneth%20Le%20Couteur">Kenneth Le Couteur</a> and a Department of Mathematics under <a href="Bernhard%20Neumann">Bernhard Neumann</a>.
Oliphant was an advocate of nuclear weapons research. He served on the post-war Technical Committee that advised the British government on nuclear weapons, and publicly declared that Britain needed to develop its own nuclear weapons independent of the United States to "avoid the danger of becoming a lesser power". The establishment of a world-class nuclear physics research capability in Australia was intimately linked with the government's plans to develop nuclear power and weapons. Locating the new research institute in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a> would place it close to the <a href="Snowy%20Mountains%20Scheme">Snowy Mountains Scheme</a>, which was planned to be the centrepiece of a new nuclear power industry. Oliphant hoped that Britain would assist with the Australian program, and the British were interested in cooperation because Australia had uranium ore and weapons testing sites, and there were concerns that Australia was becoming too closely aligned with the United States. Arrangements were made for Australian scientists to be seconded to the British <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Research%20Establishment">Atomic Energy Research Establishment</a> at Harwell, but the close cooperation he sought was stymied by security concerns arising from Britain's commitments to the United States.

Oliphant envisaged Canberra one day becoming a <a href="college%20town">university town</a> like Oxford or Cambridge. A threat to the future of the University arose in the wake of the <a href="Australian%20federal%20election%2C%201949">1949 election</a>, when the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party of Australia</a> led by <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> won. Many Liberals were opposed to the University, which they saw as an extravagance. Menzies defended it, but in 1954 he announced that it had entered a period of consolidation, with a funding ceiling, ending the possibility of successful competition with universities in Europe and North America. A further blow came in 1959, when the <a href="Menzies%20government">Menzies government</a> amalgamated it with the <a href="Canberra%20University%20College">Canberra University College</a>. Henceforth, it would no longer be a research university, but a regular one, with responsibility for teaching undergraduates. Nonetheless, parts of the university stayed committed to the old mission, and the ANU remained a university where research is central to its activities. Despite the setbacks, by 2014 the vision of Canberra as a university town would be well on its way to becoming a reality.

In September 1951, Oliphant applied for a visa to travel to the United States for a nuclear physics conference in Chicago. The visa was not refused, nor was Oliphant accused of subversive activities, but neither was it issued. This was the height of the <a href="Red%20Scare">Red Scare</a>. The American <a href="McCarran%20Act">McCarran Act</a> restricted travel to the United States, and in Australia the Menzies government was <a href="Australian%20referendum%2C%201951">attempting to ban the Communist Party</a>, and was not inclined to support Oliphant against the American government. A subsequent request to travel to Canada via Hawaii in September 1954 was refused by the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20State">United States Department of State</a>. Although Oliphant was granted a special waiver that allowed him to transit the US, he preferred to cancel the trip rather than accept this humiliation. The Menzies government subsequently excluded him from participating in or observing the <a href="British%20nuclear%20tests%20at%20Maralinga">British nuclear tests at Maralinga</a>, nor was he allowed access to classified nuclear information for fear of antagonising the US.

In 1955, Oliphant initiated the design and construction of a 500 megajoule <a href="homopolar%20generator">homopolar generator</a> (HPG), the world's largest. This massive machine contained three discs in diameter and weighing . He obtained £40,000 () initial funding from the <a href="Australian%20Atomic%20Energy%20Commission">Australian Atomic Energy Commission</a>. Completed in 1963, the HPG was intended to be the power source for a synchrotron, but this was not built. Instead, it was used to power the LT-4 <a href="Tokamak">Tokamak</a> and a large-scale <a href="railgun">railgun</a> that was used as a scientific instrument for experiments with <a href="plasma%20physics">plasma physics</a>. It was decommissioned in 1985.
Oliphant founded the <a href="Australian%20Academy%20of%20Science">Australian Academy of Science</a> in 1954, teaming up with <a href="David%20Martyn">David Martyn</a> to overcome the obstacles that had frustrated previous attempts. Oliphant was its president until 1956. Deciding that the Academy of Science should have its own special building, Oliphant raised the required money from donations. As chairman of the Building Design Committee, he selected and oversaw the construction of one of Canberra's most striking architectural designs. He also delivered the Academy of Science's 1961 <a href="Matthew%20Flinders">Matthew Flinders</a> Lecture, on the subject of "<a href="Michael%20Faraday">Faraday</a> in his time and today".

Oliphant retired as Professor of Particle Physics in 1964, and was appointed Professor of Ionised Gases. In this chair he produced his first research papers since the 1930s. He was appointed <a href="Professor%20Emeritus">Professor Emeritus</a> in 1967. He was invited by the <a href="Premier%20of%20South%20Australia">premier</a>, <a href="Don%20Dunstan">Don Dunstan</a>, to become the <a href="Governor%20of%20South%20Australia">Governor of South Australia</a>, a position he held from 1971 to 1976. During this period, he caused great concern to Dunstan when he strongly supported the decision of the <a href="Governor-General%20of%20Australia">Governor-General</a>, <a href="John%20Kerr%20%28governor-general%29">Sir John Kerr</a>, in the <a href="1975%20Australian%20constitutional%20crisis">1975 Australian constitutional crisis</a>.

"<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>" reported in 1981 that "Sir Mark Oliphant warned the Dunstan Government of the 'grave dangers' of appointing an <a href="Australian%20Aborigine">Australian Aborigine</a>, Sir <a href="Douglas%20Nicholls">Douglas Nicholls</a>, to succeed him as South Australia's Governor". Oliphant had secretly written, "[t]here is something inherent in the personality of the Aborigine which makes it difficult for him to adapt fully to the ways of the white man." The authors of Oliphant's biography noted that "that was the prevailing attitude of almost the entire white population of Australia until well after World War II".

Oliphant was created a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE) in 1959, and was made a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Companion of the Order of Australia</a> (AC) in 1977 "for eminent achievement and merit of the highest degree in the field of public service and in service to the crown".

Late in life Oliphant watched his wife, Rosa, suffer before her death in 1987, and he became an advocate for voluntary euthanasia. On 14 July 2000, he died in <a href="Canberra">Canberra</a>, at the age of 98. His body was cremated. He was survived by his adopted daughter Vivian, his son Michael having died from colon cancer in 1971.

Places and things named in honour of Oliphant include the Oliphant Building at the Australian National University, the <a href="Mark%20Oliphant%20Conservation%20Park">Mark Oliphant Conservation Park</a>, a South Australian high schools science competition, the Oliphant Wing of the Physics Building at the University of Adelaide, a <a href="Mark%20Oliphant%20College">school</a> in <a href="Munno%20Para%20West%2C%20South%20Australia">Munno Para West, South Australia</a>, and a bridge on Parkes Way in Canberra near his old laboratory at the ANU. His papers are in the Adolph Basser Library at the Australian Academy of Science, and the Barr Smith Library at the University of Adelaide. Oliphant's nephew, <a href="Pat%20Oliphant">Pat Oliphant</a>, is a <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning cartoonist. His daughter-in-law, <a href="Monica%20Oliphant">Monica Oliphant</a>, is a distinguished Australian physicist specialising in the field of renewable energy, for which she was made an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20Australia">Officer of the Order of Australia</a> in 2015.

Goblin shark

The goblin shark ("Mitsukurina owstoni") is a rare <a href="species">species</a> of deep-sea <a href="shark">shark</a>. Sometimes called a "<a href="living%20fossil">living fossil</a>", it is the only <a href="Extant%20taxon">extant</a> representative of the <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Mitsukurinidae">Mitsukurinidae</a>, a lineage some 125 million years old. This pink-skinned animal has a distinctive profile with an elongated, flattened snout, and highly protrusible jaws containing prominent nail-like teeth. It is usually between long when mature, though it can grow considerably larger. Goblin sharks inhabit upper <a href="continental%20slope">continental slope</a>s, <a href="submarine%20canyon">submarine canyon</a>s, and <a href="seamount">seamount</a>s throughout the world at depths greater than , with adults found deeper than juveniles.

Various anatomical features of the goblin shark, such as its flabby body and small fins, suggest that it is sluggish in nature. This species hunts for <a href="teleost">teleost</a> fishes, <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s both near the <a href="sea%20floor">sea floor</a> and in the middle of the <a href="water%20column">water column</a>. Its long snout is covered with <a href="ampullae%20of%20Lorenzini">ampullae of Lorenzini</a> that enable it to sense minute <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a>s produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are <a href="bycatch">unintentionally caught</a> by deepwater <a href="fisheries">fisheries</a>. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has assessed it as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.

American <a href="ichthyologist">ichthyologist</a> <a href="David%20Starr%20Jordan">David Starr Jordan</a> described the goblin shark in an 1898 issue of "Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences", recognizing the peculiar fish not only as a new species, but also a new <a href="genus">genus</a> and family. He based his account on an immature male long caught in <a href="Sagami%20Bay">Sagami Bay</a> near <a href="Yokohama">Yokohama</a>, Japan. The specimen had been acquired by <a href="shipmaster">shipmaster</a> and <a href="naturalist">naturalist</a> <a href="Alan%20Owston">Alan Owston</a>, who had given it to Professor <a href="Kakichi%20Mitsukuri">Kakichi Mitsukuri</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Tokyo">University of Tokyo</a>, who in turn had brought it to Jordan. Thus, Jordan named the shark "Mitsukurina owstoni" in honor of these two men. The <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "goblin shark" is a translation of its old Japanese name "tenguzame", a "<a href="tengu">tengu</a>" being a Japanese mythical creature often depicted with a long nose and red face. Another name for this species is elfin shark.

Soon after Jordan's description was published, several scientists noted the similarity between "Mitsukurina" and the extinct <a href="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> shark "<a href="Scapanorhynchus">Scapanorhynchus</a>". For a time, the prevailing opinion was to treat "Mitsukurina" as a <a href="junior%20synonym">junior synonym</a> of "Scapanorhynchus". Eventually, more complete <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s revealed many anatomical differences between "Scapanorhynchus" and "Mitsukurina", causing modern authors to again regard them as distinct genera. Several goblin shark specimens were described as separate species from 1904 to 1937, none of which are now considered valid. This <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> confusion began because the specimens' jaws were fixed at varying degrees of protrusion during preservation, giving the appearance of proportional differences among the heads.

<a href="Phylogenetic">Phylogenetic</a> studies based on <a href="morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a> have generally classified the goblin shark as the most <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> member of the <a href="order%20%28biology%29">order</a> <a href="Lamniformes">Lamniformes</a>, known as mackerel sharks. Studies using <a href="molecular%20phylogenetics">genetic data</a> have also confirmed a basal classification for this species. The family Mitsukurinidae, represented by "Mitsukurina", "Scapanorhynchus", and "<a href="Anomotodon">Anomotodon</a>", dates back to the <a href="Aptian">Aptian</a> age of the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> period ("c." 125–113 <a href="Ma%20%28unit%29">Ma</a>). "Mitsukurina" itself first appears in the <a href="fossil%20record">fossil record</a> during the period <a href="Middle%20Eocene">Middle Eocene</a> ("c." 49–37 Ma); extinct species include "<a href="Mitsukurina%20lineata">M. lineata</a>" and "<a href="Mitsukurina%20maslinensis">M. maslinensis</a>". "<a href="Striatolamia%20macrota">Striatolamia macrota</a>", which lived in warm shallow waters during the <a href="Paleogene">Paleogene</a> period ("c." 66–23 Ma), may also be a "Mitsukurina" species. As the last member of an ancient lineage, and one that retains several "<a href="primitive%20%28phylogenetics%29">primitive</a>" traits, the goblin shark has been described as a "<a href="living%20fossil">living fossil</a>".

The goblin shark has a distinctively long and flat snout, resembling a sword blade. The proportional length of the snout decreases with age. The eyes are small and lack protective <a href="nictitating%20membrane">nictitating membrane</a>s; behind the eyes are <a href="spiracle">spiracle</a>s. The large mouth is <a href="parabola">parabolic</a> in shape. The jaws are very protrusible and can be extended almost to the end of the snout, though normally they are held flush against the underside of the head. It has 35–53 upper and 31–62 lower tooth rows. The teeth in the main part of the jaws are long and narrow, particularly those near the symphysis (jaw midpoint), and are finely grooved lengthwise. The rear teeth near the corners of the jaw are small and have a flattened shape for crushing. Much individual variation of tooth length and width occurs, as for whether the teeth have a smaller cusplet on each side of the main <a href="cusp%20%28dentistry%29">cusp</a>, and regarding the presence of toothless gaps at the symphysis or between the main and rear teeth. The five pairs of <a href="gill%20slit">gill slit</a>s are short, with the <a href="gill%20filament">gill filament</a>s inside partly exposed; the fifth pair is above the origin of the <a href="pectoral%20fin">pectoral fin</a>s.

The body is fairly slender and flabby. The two <a href="dorsal%20fin">dorsal fin</a>s are similar in size and shape, both being small and rounded. The pectoral fins are also rather small and rounded. The <a href="pelvic%20fin">pelvic</a> and <a href="anal%20fin">anal fin</a>s have long bases and are larger than the dorsal fins. The <a href="caudal%20peduncle">caudal peduncle</a> is flattened from side-to-side and lacks keels or notches. The asymmetric <a href="caudal%20fin">caudal fin</a> has a long upper lobe with a shallow ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe. The soft, semitranslucent skin has a rough texture from a covering of <a href="dermal%20denticle">dermal denticle</a>s, each shaped like a short upright spine with lengthwise ridges. Living sharks of this species are pink or tan due to visible <a href="blood%20vessel">blood vessel</a>s beneath the skin; the color deepens with age, and young sharks may be almost white. The fins' margins are translucent gray or blue, and the eyes are black with bluish streaks in the <a href="iris%20%28anatomy%29">irises</a>. After death, the coloration fades quickly to dull gray or brown. Adult sharks usually measure between long. However, the capture of an enormous female estimated at long during 2000 showed this species can grow far larger than suspected previously. The maximum weight recorded is for a 3.8-m-long shark.

The generic name honors Keigo Mitsukuri, a Japanese zoologist who studied at University College London during the 1860s. The specific name honors <a href="Alan%20Owston">Alan Owston</a>, an English collector of Asian wildlife.

The goblin shark has been caught in all three major oceans, indicating a wide global distribution. In the Atlantic Ocean, it has been recorded from the northern <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, Suriname, French Guiana, and southern Brazil in the west, and France, Portugal, <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a>, and Senegal in the east. It has also been collected from <a href="seamount">seamount</a>s along the <a href="Mid-Atlantic%20Ridge">Mid-Atlantic Ridge</a>. In the <a href="Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> and <a href="Oceania">Oceania</a>, it has been found off South Africa, Mozambique, Japan, Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand. This species has been recorded from off <a href="East%20Cape">East Cape</a> to <a href="Kaikoura%20Canyon">Kaikoura Canyon</a> and from the <a href="Challenger%20Plateau">Challenger Plateau</a> near New Zealand. A single eastern Pacific specimen is known, collected off southern <a href="California">California</a>. This species is most often found over the upper <a href="continental%20slope">continental slope</a> at depths of . It has been caught as deep as , and a tooth has been found lodged in an undersea cable at a depth of . Adults inhabit greater depths than juveniles. Immature goblin sharks frequent the <a href="submarine%20canyon">submarine canyon</a>s off southern Japan at depths of , with individuals occasionally wandering into <a href="inshore">inshore</a> waters as shallow as . On the 19 April 2014 fishermen in <a href="Key%20West">Key West</a>, <a href="Florida">Florida</a>, while fishing in the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>, caught a goblin shark in their fishing net, only the second one ever to be caught in the Gulf. The shark was photographed and released back into the water.

During July 2014, a goblin shark was found in a fishery net in <a href="Sri%20Lanka">Sri Lanka</a>, near the eastern coast of Sri Lanka. The shark was about long and weighed about The shark was given to the NARA (National Aquatic Resource Research & Development Agency) for further research.

Although observations of living goblin sharks are scant, its anatomy suggests its lifestyle is inactive and sluggish. Its skeleton is reduced and poorly <a href="calcification">calcified</a>, the muscle blocks along its sides (<a href="myomere">myomere</a>s) are weakly developed, and its fins are soft and small. Its long caudal fin, held at a low angle, is also typical of a slow-swimming shark. The long snout appears to have a sensory function, as it bears numerous <a href="ampullae%20of%20Lorenzini">ampullae of Lorenzini</a> that can <a href="electroreception">detect</a> the weak <a href="electric%20field">electric field</a>s produced by other animals. Due to the snout's softness, it is unlikely to be used for stirring up prey from the bottom as has been proposed. Vision seems to be less important than other senses, considering the relatively small <a href="optic%20tectum">optic tectum</a> in the shark's brain. Yet unlike most deep-sea sharks, it can change the size of its <a href="pupil">pupil</a>s, thus probably does use its sight in some situations. Goblin sharks may the prey of <a href="blue%20shark">blue shark</a>s ("Prionace glauca"). <a href="Parasite">Parasite</a>s documented from this species include the <a href="copepod">copepod</a> "<a href="Echthrogaleus%20mitsukurinae">Echthrogaleus mitsukurinae</a>", and the <a href="tapeworm">tapeworm</a>s "<a href="Litobothrium%20amsichensis">Litobothrium amsichensis</a>" and "<a href="Marsupiobothrium%20gobelinus">Marsupiobothrium gobelinus</a>".

The goblin shark feeds mainly on <a href="teleost">teleost</a> fishes such as <a href="rattail">rattail</a>s and <a href="Stomiidae">dragonfishes</a>. It also consumes <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s and <a href="crustacean">crustacean</a>s, including <a href="Decapoda">decapods</a> and <a href="isopod">isopod</a>s. Garbage has been recorded from the stomachs of some specimens. Its known prey includes bottom-dwelling species such as the <a href="blackbelly%20rosefish">blackbelly rosefish</a> ("Helicolenus dactylopterus"), and midwater species such as the <a href="squid">squid</a> "<a href="Teuthowenia%20pellucida">Teuthowenia pellucida</a>" and the <a href="ostracod">ostracod</a> "<a href="Macrocypridina%20castanea%20rotunda">Macrocypridina castanea rotunda</a>". Thus, the goblin shark appears to forage for food both near the sea floor and far above it.

Since it is not a fast swimmer, the goblin shark may be an <a href="ambush%20predator">ambush predator</a>. Its low-density flesh and large <a href="shark%20liver%20oil">oily</a> <a href="liver">liver</a> make it <a href="neutral%20buoyancy">neutrally buoyant</a>, allowing it to drift towards its prey with minimal motions so as to avoid detection. Once prey comes into range, the shark's specialized jaws can snap forward to capture it. The protrusion of the jaw is assisted by two pairs of elastic <a href="ligament">ligament</a>s associated with the <a href="mandible">mandibular</a> joint, which are pulled taut when the jaws are in their normal retracted position; when the shark bites, the ligaments release their tension and essentially "catapult" the jaws forward. At the same time, the well-developed basihyal (analogous to a tongue) on the floor of the mouth drops, expanding the oral cavity and sucking in water and prey. Striking and prey capture events were videotaped and recorded for the first time during 2008 and 2011 and helped to confirm the use and systematics of the protrusible jaws of goblin sharks. The video evidence suggests that while the jaws are definitely unique, goblin sharks use ram feeding, a type of prey capture that is typical of many mackerel sharks. What makes the goblin shark unique is the kinematics of their jaw when feeding. The lower jaw seems to undergo more complex movements and is important in capturing the prey. The measured protrusions of the upper and lower jaw combined put the goblin shark jaws at 2.1–9.5 times more protrusible than other sharks. The lower jaw has a velocity about two times greater than the upper jaw because it not only protrudes forward, but also swings upward to capture the prey, and the maximum velocity of the jaws is 3.14 m/s. The goblin shark has a re-opening and re-closing pattern during the strike, a behavior that has never been seen in other sharks before and could be related to the extent with which the goblin shark protrudes its jaws. This “slingshot” style of feeding could be an adaptation to compensate for poor swimming ability by allowing the goblin shark to catch elusive, fast prey without having to chase the prey.

Little is known about goblin shark reproduction because a pregnant female has yet to be found and studied. It likely shares the reproductive characteristics of other mackerel sharks, which are <a href="viviparous">viviparous</a> with small litter sizes and <a href="embryo">embryo</a>s that grow during <a href="gestation">gestation</a> by eating undeveloped <a href="ovum">eggs</a> (<a href="oophagy">oophagy</a>). The birth size is probably close to , the length of the smallest known specimen. Males <a href="mature%20sexually">mature sexually</a> at about long, while female maturation size is unknown. No data is available concerning growth and aging.

Given the depths at which it lives, the goblin shark poses little danger to humans. A few specimens have been collected alive and brought to <a href="public%20aquarium">public aquarium</a>s, though they only survived briefly. One was kept at <a href="Tokai%20University">Tokai University</a> and lived for a week, while another was kept at Tokyo Sea Life Park and lived for two days. Its economic significance is minimal; the meat may be dried and salted, while the jaws fetch high prices from collectors. At one time, the Japanese also used it for liver oil and <a href="fertilizer">fertilizer</a>. This shark is not targeted by any <a href="fisheries">fisheries</a>, but is occasionally found as <a href="bycatch">bycatch</a> in bottom <a href="gillnet">gillnet</a>s and <a href="trawl">trawl</a>s, hooked on <a href="longline%20fishing">longlines</a>, or entangled in fishing gear. Most captures are isolated incidents; one of the few areas where it is caught regularly is off southern Japan, where around 30 individuals (mostly juveniles) are taken each year. A <a href="black%20scabbardfish">black scabbardfish</a> ("Aphanopus carbo") fishery off <a href="Madeira">Madeira</a> also takes two or three goblin sharks annually. During April 2003, more than a hundred goblin sharks were caught off northwestern Taiwan; the cause of the event was unknown, though observers noted it was preceded by a major <a href="earthquake">earthquake</a>. The species had never been recorded in the area before, nor has it been found in such numbers since. The <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) has categorized the goblin shark as <a href="Least%20Concern">Least Concern</a>. In addition to its wide range, most of its population is thought to reside in unfished environments because few adults are caught. Therefore, it is not believed to be threatened by human activity. However during June 2018 the New Zealand <a href="Department%20of%20Conservation%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Department of Conservation</a> classified the goblin shark as "At Risk – Naturally Uncommon" with the qualifiers "Data Poor" and "Secure Overseas" using the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Threat%20Classification%20System">New Zealand Threat Classification System</a>.

Anne Hutchinson

Anne Hutchinson (née Marbury; July 1591 – August 1643) was a <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> spiritual adviser, mother of 15, and an important participant in the <a href="Antinomian%20Controversy">Antinomian Controversy</a> which shook the infant <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> from 1636 to 1638. Her strong religious convictions were at odds with the established Puritan clergy in the <a href="Boston">Boston</a> area, and her popularity and charisma helped create a theological <a href="schism%20%28religion%29">schism</a> that threatened to destroy the Puritans' religious community in New England. She was eventually tried and convicted, then banished from the colony with many of her supporters.

Hutchinson was born in <a href="Alford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Alford</a>, <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a>, England, the daughter of <a href="Francis%20Marbury">Francis Marbury</a>, an Anglican cleric and school teacher who gave her a far better education than most other girls received. She lived in London as a young adult, and there married her old friend from home <a href="William%20Hutchinson%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">William Hutchinson</a>. The couple moved back to Alford where they began following dynamic preacher <a href="John%20Cotton%20%28Puritan%29">John Cotton</a> in the nearby port of <a href="Boston%2C%20Lincolnshire">Boston, Lincolnshire</a>. Cotton was compelled to emigrate in 1633, and the Hutchinsons followed a year later with their 11 children and soon became well established in the growing settlement of Boston in <a href="New%20England">New England</a>. Anne was a <a href="midwife">midwife</a> and very helpful to those needing her assistance, as well as forthcoming with her personal religious understandings. Soon she was hosting women at her house weekly, providing commentary on recent sermons. These meetings became so popular that she began offering meetings for men as well, including the young governor of the colony <a href="Henry%20Vane%20the%20younger">Henry Vane</a>.

She began to accuse the local ministers (except for Cotton and her husband's brother-in-law <a href="John%20Wheelwright">John Wheelwright</a>) of preaching a "covenant of works" rather than a "covenant of grace," and many ministers began to complain about her increasingly blatant accusations, as well as certain theological teachings that did not accord with orthodox Puritan theology. The situation eventually erupted into what is commonly called the <a href="Antinomian%20Controversy">Antinomian Controversy</a>, culminating in her 1637 trial, conviction, and banishment from the colony. This was followed by a March 1638 church trial in which she was put out of her congregation.

Hutchinson and many of her supporters established the settlement of <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Portsmouth</a> with encouragement from <a href="Providence%20Plantations">Providence Plantations</a> founder <a href="Roger%20Williams">Roger Williams</a> in what became the <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a>. After her husband's death a few years later, threats of Massachusetts taking over Rhode Island compelled Hutchinson to move totally outside the reach of Boston into the lands of the <a href="New%20Netherland">Dutch</a>. Five of her older surviving children remained in New England or in England, while she settled with her younger children near an ancient landmark called <a href="Split%20Rock%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Split Rock</a> in what later became <a href="The%20Bronx">The Bronx</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Tensions were high at the time with the <a href="Siwanoy">Siwanoy</a> Indian tribe. In August 1643, Hutchinson, six of her children, and other household members were massacred by Siwanoys during <a href="Kieft%27s%20War">Kieft's War</a>. The only survivor was her nine year-old daughter <a href="Susanna%20Cole">Susanna</a>, who was taken captive.

Hutchinson is a key figure in the history of religious freedom in England's <a href="Thirteen%20Colonies">American colonies</a> and the history of women in ministry, challenging the authority of the ministers. She is honored by Massachusetts with a <a href="Massachusetts%20State%20House">State House</a> monument calling her a "courageous exponent of civil liberty and religious toleration." She has been called the most famous—or infamous—English woman in colonial American history.

Anne Hutchinson was born Anne Marbury in <a href="Alford%2C%20Lincolnshire">Alford</a>, Lincolnshire, England, and baptised there on 20 July 1591, the daughter of <a href="Francis%20Marbury">Francis Marbury</a> and Bridget Dryden. Her father was an <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican</a> <a href="Clergy">cleric</a> in <a href="London">London</a> with strong <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> leanings, who felt strongly that clergy should be well educated and clashed with his superiors on this issue. Marbury's repeated challenges to the Anglican authorities led to his censure and imprisonment several years before Anne was born. In 1578, he was given a public trial, of which he made a transcript from memory during a period of house arrest. He later used this transcript to educate and amuse his children, he being the hero and the Bishop of London being portrayed as a buffoon. For his conviction of heresy, Marbury spent two years in <a href="Marshalsea">Marshalsea</a> Prison on the south side of the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a> across from London. In 1580, at the age of 25, he was released and was considered sufficiently reformed to preach and teach. He moved to the remote market town of Alford in Lincolnshire, about north of London.

Anne's father was soon appointed curate (deputy vicar) of <a href="St.%20Wilfrid%27s%20Church%2C%20Alford">Saint Wilfrid's</a>, the local church in Alford, and in 1585 he also became the schoolmaster at the Alford <a href="Free%20Grammar%20School">Free Grammar School</a>, one of many such public schools, free to the poor and begun by <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Queen Elizabeth</a>. About this time, Marbury married his first wife Elizabeth Moore, who bore three children, then died. Within a year of his first wife's death, Marbury married Bridget Dryden, about ten years younger than he and from a prominent <a href="Northampton">Northampton</a> family. Bridget's brother Erasmus was the grandfather of <a href="John%20Dryden">John Dryden</a>, the famous playwright and <a href="Poet%20Laureate%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Poet Laureate</a>. Anne was the third of 15 children born to this marriage, 12 of whom survived early childhood. The Marburys lived in Alford for the first 15 years of Anne's life, and she received a better education than most girls of her time, with her father's strong commitment to learning, and she also became intimately familiar with scripture and Christian tenets. Education at that time was almost exclusively offered to boys and men. One possible reason why Marbury taught his daughters may have been that six of his first seven children were girls. Another reason may have been that the ruling class in Elizabethan England began realising that girls could be schooled, looking to the example of the queen, who spoke six foreign languages.

The family moved from Alford to the heart of London in 1605 when Anne was 15, where her father was given the position of vicar of the Church of <a href="St%20Martin%20Vintry">Saint Martin's in the Vintry</a>. Here his expression of puritan views was tolerated, though somewhat muffled, because of a shortage of pastors. Marbury took on additional work in 1608, preaching in the parish of <a href="St%20Pancras%2C%20Soper%20Lane">Saint Pancras</a>, several miles northwest of the city, travelling there by horseback twice a week. In 1610, he replaced that position with one much closer to home and became rector of <a href="St%20Margaret%2C%20New%20Fish%20Street">Saint Margaret's</a> on New Fish Street, only a short walk from Saint Martin in the Vintry. He was at a high point in his career, but he died suddenly at the age of 55 in February 1611, when Anne was 19 years old.

The year after her father's death, Anne Marbury, aged 21, married <a href="William%20Hutchinson%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">William Hutchinson</a>, a familiar acquaintance from Alford who was a fabric merchant then working in London. The couple was married at <a href="St%20Mary%20Woolnoth">St Mary Woolnoth</a> Church in London on 9 August 1612, shortly after which they moved back to their hometown of Alford.

Soon they heard about an engaging minister named <a href="John%20Cotton%20%28puritan%29">John Cotton</a> who preached at <a href="St%20Botolph%27s%20Church%2C%20Boston">Saints Botolph's Church</a> in the large port of <a href="Boston%2C%20Lincolnshire">Boston</a>, about from Alford. Cotton was installed as minister at Boston the year that the Hutchinsons were married, after having been a tutor at <a href="Emmanuel%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Emmanuel College</a> in <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>. He was only 27 years old, yet he had gained a reputation as one of the leading Puritans in England. Once the Hutchinsons heard Cotton preach, the couple made the trip to Boston as often as possible, enduring the ride by horseback when the weather and circumstances allowed. Cotton's spiritual message was different from that of his fellow Puritans, as he placed less emphasis on one's behaviour to attain God's salvation and more emphasis on the moment of religious conversion "in which mortal man was infused with a divine grace." Anne Hutchinson was greatly attracted to Cotton's theology of "absolute grace", which caused her to question the value of "works" and to view the Holy Spirit as "indwelling in the elect saint". This allowed her to identify as a "mystic participant in the transcendent power of the Almighty"; such a theology was empowering to women, according to Eve LaPlante, whose status was otherwise determined by their husbands or fathers.

Another strong influence on Hutchinson was closer to her home in the nearby town of <a href="Bilsby">Bilsby</a>. Her brother-in-law, the young minister <a href="John%20Wheelwright">John Wheelwright</a>, preached a message like that of Cotton. As reformers, both Cotton and Wheelwright encouraged a sense of religious rebirth among their parishioners, but their weekly sermons did not satisfy the yearnings of some Puritan worshippers. This led to the rise of <a href="conventicle">conventicle</a>s, which were gatherings of "those who had found grace" to listen to sermon repetitions, discuss and debate scripture, and pray. These gatherings were particularly important to women because they allowed women to take on roles of religious leadership that were otherwise denied them in a male-dominated church hierarchy, according to some modern scholars. Hutchinson was inspired by Cotton and by other women who ran conventicles, and she began holding meetings in her own home, where she reviewed recent sermons with her listeners, and provided her own explanations of the message.

The Puritans wanted to do away with the ceremony of the Church of England and govern their churches based on a consensus of the parishioners. They preferred to eliminate bishops appointed by the monarchs, choose their own church elders (or governors), and provide for a lay leader and two ministers—one a teacher in charge of doctrine, and the other a pastor in charge of people's souls. By 1633, Cotton's inclination toward such Puritan practices had attracted the attention of Archbishop <a href="William%20Laud">William Laud</a>, who was on a campaign to suppress any preaching and practices that did not conform to the practices of the <a href="established%20church">established</a> <a href="Anglican%20Church">Anglican Church</a>. In that year, Cotton was removed from his ministry, and he went into hiding. Threatened with imprisonment, he made a hasty departure for <a href="New%20England">New England</a> aboard the ship "Griffin", taking his pregnant wife. She gave birth to their child during the voyage to the colonies, whom they named Seaborn.

When Cotton left England, Anne Hutchinson described it as a "great trouble unto her," and said that she "could not be at rest" until she followed her minister to New England. Hutchinson believed that the <a href="Holy%20Spirit">Spirit</a> instructed her to follow Cotton to America, "impressed by the evidence of divine providence". She was well into her 14th pregnancy, however, so she did not travel until after the baby was born. With the intention of soon going to New England, the Hutchinsons allowed their oldest son <a href="Edward%20Hutchinson%20%28captain%29">Edward</a> to sail with Cotton before the remainder of the family made the voyage. In 1634, 43-year-old Anne Hutchinson set sail from England with her 48-year-old husband William and their other ten surviving children, aged about eight months to 19 years. They sailed aboard the <a href="Griffin%20%28ship%29">"Griffin"</a>, the same ship that had carried Cotton and their oldest son a year earlier.

William Hutchinson was highly successful in his mercantile business and brought a considerable estate with him to New England, arriving in Boston in the late summer of 1634. The Hutchinson family purchased a half-acre lot on the Shawmut Peninsula, now downtown Boston. Here they had a house built, one of the largest on the peninsula, with a timber frame and at least two stories. (The house stood until October 1711, when it was consumed in the <a href="Great%20Fire%20of%20Boston">great fire of Boston</a>, after which the <a href="Old%20Corner%20Bookstore">Old Corner Bookstore</a> was built on the site.) The Hutchinsons soon were granted Taylor's Island in the Boston harbour, where they grazed their sheep, and they also acquired 600 acres of land at Mount Wollaston, south of Boston in the area that later became <a href="Quincy%2C%20Massachusetts">Quincy</a>. Once established, William Hutchinson continued to prosper in the cloth trade, and made land purchases and investments. He became a town <a href="selectman">selectman</a> and deputy to the General Court. Anne Hutchinson likewise fit into her new home with ease, devoting many hours to those who were ill or in need. She became an active <a href="midwife">midwife</a>, and while tending to women in childbirth, she provided them with spiritual advice. Magistrate <a href="John%20Winthrop">John Winthrop</a> noted that "her ordinary talke was about the things of the Kingdome of God," and "her usuall conversation was in the way of righteousness and kindnesse."

The Hutchinsons became members of the <a href="First%20Church%20of%20Boston">Boston church</a>, the most important church in the colony. With its location and harbour, Boston was New England's centre of commerce, and its church was characterised by Winthrop as "the most publick, where Seamen and all Strangers came." The church membership had grown from 80 to 120 during Cotton's first four months there. In his journal, Winthrop proclaimed, "more were converted & added to that Churche, than to all the other Churches in the Baye." Historian Michael Winship noted in 2005 that the church seemed to approach the Puritan ideal of a Christian community. Early Massachusetts historian <a href="William%20Hubbard%20%28clergyman%29">William Hubbard</a> found the church to be "in so flourishing a condition as were scarce any where else to be paralleled." Winship considers it an exceptional twist of fate that the colony's most important church also had the most unconventional minister in <a href="John%20Cotton%20%28Puritan%29">John Cotton</a>. The more extreme religious views of Hutchinson and <a href="Henry%20Vane%20the%20Younger">Henry Vane</a>, the colony's young governor, did not much stand out because of Cotton's divergence from the theology of his fellow ministers.

Hutchinson's visits to women in childbirth led to discussions along the lines of the conventicles in England. She soon began hosting weekly meetings at her home for women who wanted to discuss Cotton's sermons and hear her explanations and elaborations. Her meetings for women became so popular that she had to organise meetings for men, as well, and she was hosting 60 or more people per week. These gatherings brought women, as well as their husbands, "to enquire more seriously after the Lord Jesus Christ."

As the meetings continued, Hutchinson began offering her own religious views, stressing that only "an intuition of the Spirit" would lead to one's <a href="Predestination">election</a> by God, and not good works. Her theological interpretations began diverging from the more legalistic views found among the colony's ministers, and the attendance increased at her meetings and soon included Governor Vane. Her ideas that one's outward behaviour was not necessarily tied to the state of one's soul became attractive to those who might have been more attached to their professions than to their religious state, such as merchants and craftsmen. The colony's ministers became more aware of Hutchinson's meetings, and they contended that such "unauthorised" religious gatherings might confuse the faithful. Hutchinson responded to this with a verse from <a href="Epistle%20to%20Titus">Titus</a>, saying that "the elder women should instruct the younger."

Hutchinson's gatherings were seen as unorthodox by some of the colony's ministers, and differing religious opinions within the colony eventually became public debates. The resulting religious tension erupted into what has traditionally been called the Antinomian Controversy, but has more recently been labelled the Free Grace Controversy.

The Reverend <a href="Zechariah%20Symmes">Zechariah Symmes</a> had sailed to New England on the same ship as the Hutchinsons. In September 1634, he told another minister that he doubted Anne Hutchinson's orthodoxy, based on questions that she asked him following his shipboard sermons. This issue delayed Hutchinson's membership to the Boston church by a week, until a pastoral examination determined that she was sufficiently orthodox to join the church.

In 1635, a difficult situation occurred when senior pastor <a href="John%20Wilson%20%28Puritan%29">John Wilson</a> returned from a lengthy trip to England where he had been settling his affairs. Hutchinson was exposed to his teaching for the first time, and she immediately saw a big difference between her own doctrines and his. She found his emphasis on morality and his doctrine of "evidencing justification by sanctification" to be disagreeable. She told her followers that Wilson lacked "the seal of the Spirit." Wilson's theological views were in accord with all of the other ministers in the colony except for Cotton, who stressed "the inevitability of God's will" ("free grace") as opposed to <a href="Preparationism">preparation</a> (works). Hutchinson and her allies had become accustomed to Cotton's doctrines, and they began disrupting Wilson's sermons, even finding excuses to leave when Wilson got up to preach or pray.

<a href="Thomas%20Shepard%20%28minister%29">Thomas Shepard</a>, the minister of Newtown (which later became <a href="Cambridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Cambridge</a>), began writing letters to Cotton as early as the spring of 1636. He expressed concern about Cotton's preaching and about some of the unorthodox opinions found among his Boston parishioners. Shepard went even further when he began criticising the Boston opinions to his Newtown congregation during his sermons. In May 1636, the Bostonians received a new ally when the Reverend <a href="John%20Wheelwright">John Wheelwright</a> arrived from England and immediately aligned himself with Cotton, Hutchinson, and other "free grace" advocates. Wheelwright had been a close neighbor of the Hutchinsons in Lincolnshire, and his wife was <a href="Edward%20Hutchinson%20%28mercer%29%23Mary%20Hutchinson">a sister</a> of Hutchinson's husband. Another boost for the free grace advocates came during the same month, when the young aristocrat <a href="Henry%20Vane%20the%20Younger">Henry Vane</a> was elected as the governor of the colony. Vane was a strong supporter of Hutchinson, but he also had his own ideas about theology that were considered not only unorthodox, but radical by some.

Hutchinson and the other free grace advocates continued to question the orthodox ministers in the colony. Wheelwright began preaching at <a href="Quincy%2C%20Massachusetts">Mount Wollaston</a>, about ten miles south of the Boston meetinghouse, and his sermons began to answer Shepard's criticisms with his own criticism of the covenant of works. This mounting "pulpit aggression" continued throughout the summer, along with the lack of respect shown Boston's Reverend Wilson. Wilson endured these religious differences for several months before deciding that the affronts and errors were serious enough to require a response. He is the one who likely alerted magistrate John Winthrop, one of his parishioners, to take notice. On or shortly after 21 October 1636, Winthrop gave the first public warning of the problem that consumed him and the leadership of the <a href="Massachusetts%20Bay%20Colony">Massachusetts Bay Colony</a> for much of the next two years. In his journal he wrote, "One Mrs. Hutchinson, a member of the church at Boston, a woman of a ready wit and a bold spirit, brought over with her two dangerous errors: 1. That the person of the Holy Ghost dwells in a justified person. 2. That no sanctification can help to evidence to us our justification." He went on to elaborate these two points, and the Antinomian Controversy began with this journal entry.

On 25 October 1636, seven ministers gathered at the home of Cotton to confront the developing discord; they held a "private conference" which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church. Some agreement was reached, and Cotton "gave satisfaction to them [the other ministers], so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so did Mr. Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification." Another issue was that some of the ministers had heard that Hutchinson had criticised them during her conventicles for preaching a covenant of works and said that they were not able ministers of the <a href="New%20Testament">New Testament</a>. Hutchinson responded to this only when prompted, and only to one or two ministers at a time. She believed that her response, which was largely coaxed from her, was private and confidential. A year later, her words were used against her in a trial that resulted in her banishment from the colony.

By late 1636, as the controversy deepened, Hutchinson and her supporters were accused of two heresies in the Puritan church: <a href="antinomianism">antinomianism</a> and <a href="Familia%20Caritatis">familism</a>. The word "antinomianism" literally means "against or opposed to the law"; in a theological context, it means "the moral law is not binding upon Christians, who are under the law of grace." According to this view, if one was under the law of grace, then moral law did not apply, allowing one to engage in immoral acts. Familism was named for a 16th-century sect called the <a href="Familia%20Caritatis">Family of Love</a>, and it involved one's perfect union with God under the Holy Spirit, coupled with freedom both from sin and from the responsibility for it. Hutchinson and her supporters were sometimes accused of engaging in immoral behaviour or "free love" in order to discredit them, but such acts were antithetical to their doctrine. Hutchinson, Wheelwright, and Vane all took leading roles as antagonists of the orthodox party, but theologically, it was Cotton's differences of opinion with the colony's other ministers that was at the centre of the controversy.

By winter, the theological schism had become great enough that the General Court called for a day of fasting to help ease the colony's difficulties. During the appointed fast-day on Thursday, 19 January 1637, Wheelwright preached at the Boston church in the afternoon. To the Puritan clergy, his sermon was "censurable and incited mischief." The colony's ministers were offended by the sermon, but the free grace advocates were encouraged, and they became more vociferous in their opposition to the "legal" ministers. Governor Vane began challenging the doctrines of the colony's divines, and supporters of Hutchinson refused to serve during the <a href="Pequot%20War">Pequot War</a> of 1637 because Wilson was the chaplain of the expedition. Ministers worried that the bold stand of Hutchinson and her supporters began to threaten the "Puritan's holy experiment." Had they succeeded, historian Dunn believes that they would have profoundly changed the thrust of Massachusetts history.

By March, the political tide began to turn against the free grace advocates. Wheelwright was tried for contempt and sedition that month for his fast-day sermon and was convicted in a close vote, but not yet sentenced. During the election of May 1637, Henry Vane was replaced as governor by John Winthrop; in addition, all the other Boston magistrates who supported Hutchinson and Wheelwright were voted out of office. By the summer of 1637, Vane sailed back to England, never to return. With his departure, the time was ripe for the orthodox party to deal with the remainder of their rivals.

The autumn court of 1637 convened on 2 November and sentenced Wheelwright to banishment, ordering him to leave the colony within 14 days. Several of the other supporters of Hutchinson and Wheelwright were tried and given varied sentences. Following these preliminaries, it was Anne Hutchinson's turn to be tried.

Hutchinson was brought to trial on 7 November 1637, with Wheelwright banished and other court business taken care of. The trial was presided over by Governor John Winthrop, on the charge of "traducing [slandering] the ministers". Other charges against her were laid out by Winthrop, including being one who "troubled the peace of the commonwealth and churches", promoting and divulging opinions that had caused recent troubles, and continuing to hold meetings at her home despite a recent <a href="Antinomian%20Controversy%23Synod%20of%201637">synod</a> that had condemned them.

They found it difficult to charge her because she had never spoken her opinions in public, unlike Wheelwright and the other men who had been tried, nor had she ever signed any statements about them. Winthrop's first two lines of prosecution were to portray her as a co-conspirator of others who had openly caused trouble in the colony, and then to fault her for holding conventicles. Question by question, Hutchinson effectively stonewalled him in her responses, and Winthrop was unable to find a way to convert her known membership in a seditious faction into a convictable offence. Deputy governor <a href="Thomas%20Dudley">Thomas Dudley</a> had a substantial background in law, and he stepped in to assist the prosecution. Dudley questioned Hutchinson about her conventicles and her association with the other conspirators. With no answer by Hutchinson, he moved on to the charge of her slandering the ministers.

The remainder of the trial was spent on this last charge. The prosecution intended to demonstrate that Hutchinson had made disparaging remarks about the colony's ministers, and to use the October meeting as their evidence. Six ministers had presented to the court their written versions of the October conference, and Hutchinson agreed with the substance of their statements. Her defence was that she had spoken reluctantly and in private, that she "must either speak false or true in my answers" in the ministerial context of the meeting. In those private meetings, she had cited Proverbs 29:25, "The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe." The court was not interested in her distinction between public and private statements.

At the end of the first day of the trial, Winthrop recorded, "Mrs. Hutchinson, the court you see hath labored to bring you to acknowledge the error of your way that so you might be reduced. The time now grows late. We shall therefore give you a little more time to consider of it and therefore desire that you attend the court again in the morning." The first day had gone fairly well for Hutchinson, who had held her own in a battle of wits with the magistrates. Biographer Eve LaPlante suggests, "Her success before the court may have astonished her judges, but it was no surprise to her. She was confident of herself and her intellectual tools, largely because of the intimacy she felt with God."

During the morning of the second day of the trial, it appeared that Hutchinson had been given some legal counsel the previous evening, and she had more to say. She continued to criticise the ministers of violating their mandate of confidentiality. She said that they had deceived the court by not telling about her reluctance to share her thoughts with them. She insisted that the ministers testify under oath, which they were very hesitant to do. Magistrate <a href="Simon%20Bradstreet">Simon Bradstreet</a> said that "she would make the ministers sin if they said something mistaken under oath", but she answered that if they were going to accuse her, "I desire it may be upon oath." As a matter of due process, the ministers would have to be sworn in, but would agree to do so only if the defence witnesses spoke first.

There were three such witnesses, all from the Boston church: deacon <a href="John%20Coggeshall">John Coggeshall</a>, lay leader Thomas Leverett, and minister John Cotton. The first two witnesses made brief statements that had little effect on the court, but Cotton was grilled extensively. When Cotton testified, he tended to not remember many events of the October meeting, and attempted to soften the meaning of statements that Hutchinson was being accused of. He stressed that the ministers were not as upset about any Hutchinson remarks at the end of the October meeting as they appeared to be later. Dudley reiterated that Hutchinson had told the ministers that they were not able ministers of the New Testament; Cotton replied that he did not remember her saying that.

There was more parrying between Cotton and the court, but the exchanges were not picked up in the transcript of the proceedings. Hutchinson asked the court for leave to "give you the ground of what I know to be true." She then addressed the court with her own judgment:

This was the "dramatic high point of the most analyzed event of the free grace controversy", wrote historian Michael Winship. Historians have given a variety of reasons for this seemingly impulsive statement, including an "exultant impulse", "hysteria", "cracking under the strain of the inquest", and being "possessed of the Spirit". Winship, citing the work of historian <a href="Mary%20Beth%20Norton">Mary Beth Norton</a>, suggests that Hutchinson consciously decided to explain why she knew that the divines of the colony were not able ministers of the New Testament. This was "not histrionics, but pedagogy," according to Winship; it was Hutchinson's attempt to teach the Court, and doing so was consistent with her character.

Hutchinson simplified the task of her opponents, whose prosecution had been somewhat shaky. Her revelation was considered not only seditious, but also in <a href="contempt%20of%20court">contempt of court</a>. Cotton was pressed by Dudley on whether or not he supported Hutchinson's revelation; he said that he could find theological justification for it. Cotton may have still been angry over the zeal with which some opponents had come after the dissidents within his congregation. Winthrop was not interested in this quibbling, though; he was using Hutchinson's bold assertions to lead the court in the direction of rewriting history, according to the historical interpretations of Winship. Many of the Puritans had been convinced that there was a single destructive prophetic figure behind all of the difficulties that the colony had been having, and Hutchinson had just become the culprit. Winthrop addressed the court, "if therefore it be the mind of the court, looking at [her] as the principal cause of all our trouble, that they would now consider what is to be done with her."

The Bostonians made a final effort to slow the proceedings. <a href="William%20Coddington">William Coddington</a> rose, asserting, "I do not see any clear witness against her, and you know it is a rule of the court that no man may be a judge and an accuser too," ending with, "Here is no law of God that she hath broken nor any law of the country that she hath broke, and therefore deserve no censure." The court wanted a sentence but could not proceed until some of the ministers spoke. Three of the ministers were sworn in, and each testified against Hutchinson. Winthrop moved to have her banished; in the ensuing tally, only the Boston deputies voted against conviction. Hutchinson challenged the sentence's legitimacy, saying, "I desire to know wherefore I am banished." Winthrop responded, "The court knows wherefore and is satisfied."

Hutchinson was called a heretic and an instrument of the devil, and was condemned to banishment by the Court "as being a woman not fit for our society". The Puritans sincerely believed that, in banishing Hutchinson, they were protecting God's eternal truth. Winthrop summed up the case with genuine feeling:

Following her civil trial, Hutchinson was put under house arrest and ordered to be gone by the end of the following March. In the interim, she was not allowed to return home, but was detained at the house of Joseph Weld, brother of the Reverend <a href="Thomas%20Weld%20%28minister%29">Thomas Weld</a>, located in <a href="Roxbury%2C%20Boston">Roxbury</a>, about two miles from her home in Boston. The distance was not great, yet Hutchinson was rarely able to see her children because of the weather, which was particularly harsh that winter. Winthrop referred to Hutchinson as "the prisoner" and was determined to keep her isolated so that others would not be inspired by her, according to LaPlante. She was frequently visited by various ministers, whose intent, according to LaPlante, was to reform her thinking but also to collect evidence against her. <a href="Thomas%20Shepard%20%28minister%29">Thomas Shepard</a> was there to "collect errors", and concluded that she was a dangerous woman. Shepard and the other ministers who visited her drew up a list of her theological errors and presented them to the Boston church, which decided that she should stand trial for these views.

Hutchinson was called to trial on Thursday, 15 March 1638, weary and in poor health following a four-month detention. The trial took place at her home church in Boston, though many of her supporters were gone. Her husband and other friends had already left the colony to prepare a new place to live. Her only family members present were her oldest son <a href="Edward%20Hutchinson%20%28captain%29">Edward</a> and his wife, her daughter Faith and son-in-law <a href="Thomas%20Savage%20%28major%29">Thomas Savage</a>, and her sister <a href="Katherine%20Marbury%20Scott">Katherine</a> with her husband <a href="Richard%20Scott%20%28settler%29">Richard Scott</a>.

The ministers intended to defend their orthodox doctrine and to examine Hutchinson's theological errors. Ruling elder Thomas Leverett was charged with managing the examination. He called Hutchinson and read the numerous errors with which she had been charged, and a nine-hour interrogation followed in which the ministers delved into some weighty points of theology. At the end of the session, only four of the many errors were covered, and Cotton was put in the uncomfortable position of delivering the admonition to his admirer. He said, "I would speake it to Gods Glory [that] you have bine an Instrument of doing some good amongst us… he hath given you a sharp apprehension, a ready utterance and abilitie to exprese yourselfe in the Cause of God." The ministers overwhelmingly concluded that Hutchinson's unsound beliefs outweighed all the good which she had done, and that she endangered the spiritual welfare of the community. 
Cotton continued,

Here Cotton was making a link between Hutchinson's theological ideas and the more extreme behaviour credited to the antinomians and familists. He concluded:
With this, Hutchinson was instructed to return in one week on the next lecture day.

Cotton had not yet given up on his parishioner. With the permission of the court, Hutchinson was allowed to spend the week at his home, where the recently arrived Reverend <a href="John%20Davenport%20%28Puritan%29">John Davenport</a> was also staying. All week, the two ministers worked with her and, under their supervision, she wrote out a formal recantation of her unsound opinions that had formerly brought objection. Hutchinson stood at the next meeting on Thursday, 22 March and read her recantation in a subdued voice to the congregation. She admitted to having been wrong about the soul and spirit, wrong about the resurrection of the body, wrong in prophesying the destruction of the colony, and wrong in her demeanour toward the ministers, and she agreed that sanctification could be evidence of justification (what she called a "covenant of works") "as it flowes from Christ and is witnessed to us by the Spirit". Had the trial ended there, she would likely have remained in good standing with the Boston church, and had the possibility of returning some day.

Wilson explored an accusation made by Shepard at the end of the previous meeting, and new words brought on new assaults. The outcome of her trial was uncertain following the first day's grilling, but her downfall came when she would not acknowledge that she held certain theological errors before her four-month imprisonment. With this, she was accused of lying but, even at this point, Winthrop and a few of the ministers wanted her soul redeemed because of her significant evangelical work before she "set forth her owne stuffe". To these sentiments, Shepard vehemently argued that Hutchinson was a "Notorious Imposter" in whose heart there was never any grace. He admonished the "heinousness of her lying" during a time of supposed humiliation.

Shepard had swayed the proceedings, with Cotton signalling that he had given up on her, and her sentence was presented by Wilson:
Hutchinson was now banished from the colony and removed from the congregation, and her leading supporters had been given three months to leave the colony, including Coddington and Coggeshall, while others were disenfranchised or dismissed from their churches. The court in November had ordered that 58 citizens of Boston and 17 from adjacent towns be disarmed unless they repudiated the "seditious label" given them, and many of these people followed Hutchinson into exile.

During Hutchinson's imprisonment, several of her supporters prepared to leave the colony and settle elsewhere. One such group of men, including her husband Will, met on 7 March 1638 at the home of wealthy Boston merchant William Coddington. Ultimately, <a href="List%20of%20early%20settlers%20of%20Rhode%20Island%23Founders%20of%20Portsmouth">23 men signed</a> what is known as the <a href="Portsmouth%20Compact">Portsmouth Compact</a>, forming themselves into a "Bodie Politick" and electing Coddington as their governor, but giving him the Biblical title of "judge". Nineteen of the signers initially planned to move to New Jersey or Long Island, but <a href="Roger%20Williams%20%28theologian%29">Roger Williams</a> convinced them to settle in the area of his <a href="Providence%20Plantations">Providence Plantations</a> settlement. Coddington purchased <a href="Aquidneck%20Island">Aquidneck Island</a> (later named Rhode Island) in the <a href="Narragansett%20Bay">Narragansett Bay</a> from the <a href="Narragansett%20people">Narragansetts</a>, and the settlement of Pocasset was founded (soon renamed <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Portsmouth</a>). Anne Hutchinson followed in April, after the conclusion of her church trial.

Hutchinson, her children, and others accompanying her travelled for more than six days by foot in the April snow to get from Boston to Roger Williams' settlement at Providence. They took boats to get to Aquidneck Island, where many men had gone ahead of them to begin constructing houses. In the second week of April, she reunited with her husband, from whom she had been separated for nearly six months.

Hutchinson went into labour in May 1638, following the stress of her trial, her imprisonment all winter, and the difficult trip to Aquidneck Island. She delivered what her doctor <a href="John%20Clarke%20%28Baptist%20minister%29">John Clarke</a> described as a handful of transparent grapes. This is known now as a <a href="hydatidiform%20mole">hydatidiform mole</a>, a condition occurring most often in women over 45, resulting from one or two sperm cells fertilising a blighted egg. Hutchinson had been ill most of the winter, with unusual weakness, throbbing headaches, and bouts of vomiting. Most writers on the subject agree that she had been pregnant during her trial. Historian Emery Battis, citing expert opinion, suggests that she may not have been pregnant at all during that time, but displaying acute symptoms of <a href="menopause">menopause</a>. The following April after reuniting with her husband, she became pregnant, only to miscarry the hydatidiform mole. A woman could have suffered severe menopausal symptoms who had undergone a continuous cycle of pregnancies, deliveries, and lactations for 25 years, with the burdens of raising a large family and subjected to the extreme stress of her trials.

The Puritan leaders of the Massachusetts Bay Colony gloated over Hutchinson's suffering and also that of <a href="Mary%20Dyer">Mary Dyer</a>, a follower who suffered the premature and stillbirth of a severely deformed infant. The leaders classified the women's misfortunes as the judgement of God. Winthrop wrote, "She brought forth not one, but thirty monstrous births or thereabouts", then continued, "see how the wisdom of God fitted this judgment to her sin every way, for look—as she had vented misshapen opinions, so she must bring forth deformed monsters." Massachusetts continued to persecute Hutchinson's followers who stayed in the Boston area. Laymen were sent from the Boston church to Portsmouth to convince Hutchinson of her errors; she shouted at them, "the Church at Boston? I know no such church, neither will I own it. Call it the whore and strumpet of Boston, but no Church of Christ!"

Less than a year after Pocasset was settled, it suffered rifts and civil difficulties. Coddington had openly supported Hutchinson following her trial, but he had become autocratic and began to alienate his fellow settlers. Early in 1639, Hutchinson became acquainted with <a href="Samuel%20Gorton">Samuel Gorton</a>, who attacked the legitimacy of the magistrates. On 28 April 1639, Gorton and a dozen other men ejected Coddington from power. Hutchinson may not have supported this rebellion, but her husband was chosen as the new governor. Two days later, <a href="List%20of%20early%20settlers%20of%20Rhode%20Island%23Residents%20of%20Portsmouth%20after%20split%20with%20Newport">over 30 men</a> signed a document forming a new "civil body politic". Winthrop noted in his journal that at Aquidneck,
Coddington and several others left the colony, establishing the settlement of <a href="Newport%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Newport</a> at the south end of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed the name of their town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, <a href="Nicholas%20Easton">Nicholas Easton</a>, <a href="William%20Brenton">William Brenton</a>, <a href="Jeremy%20Clarke%20%28governor%29">Jeremy Clarke</a>, and <a href="Henry%20Bull%20%28governor%29">Henry Bull</a>. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.

During her tenure in Portsmouth, Hutchinson developed a new philosophy concerning religion. She persuaded her husband to resign from his position as a magistrate, as Roger Williams put it, "because of the opinion, which she had newly taken up, of the unlawfulness of magistracy."

Hutchinson's husband William died some time after June 1641 at the age of 55, the same age at which Anne's father had died. He was buried in Portsmouth. No record of his death exists because there was no established church, which would have been the customary repository for such records.

Not long after the settlement of Aquidneck Island, the Massachusetts Bay Colony made some serious threats to take over the island and the entire Narragansett Bay area, causing Hutchinson and other settlers much anxiety. This compelled her to move totally out of the reach of the Bay colony and its sister colonies in <a href="Connecticut%20Colony">Connecticut</a> and <a href="New%20Haven%20Colony">New Haven</a> and move into the jurisdiction of the Dutch. Hutchinson went to <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a> some time after the summer of 1642 with seven of her children, a son-in-law, and several servants—16 total persons by several accounts. There they settled near an ancient landmark called <a href="Split%20Rock%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Split Rock</a>, not far from what became the <a href="Hutchinson%20River">Hutchinson River</a> in northern <a href="Bronx">Bronx</a>, <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Other Rhode Island families were in the area, including the Throckmortons and the Cornells. By one account, Hutchinson bought her land from <a href="John%20Throckmorton%20%28settler%29">John Throckmorton</a> (for whom <a href="Throggs%20Neck">Throggs Neck</a> is named) who had earlier been a settler of <a href="Providence%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Providence</a> with <a href="Roger%20Williams%20%28theologian%29">Roger Williams</a>, but was now living in New Netherland.

The Hutchinsons stayed temporarily in an abandoned house while a permanent house was being built with the help of <a href="James%20Sands">James Sands</a>, who had married Katherine Walker, a granddaughter of William Hutchinson's brother Edward. Sands later became a settler of <a href="Block%20Island">Block Island</a> (later <a href="Shoreham-by-Sea">New Shoreham</a>, <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Rhode Island</a>), and the Reverend Samuel Niles, another early settler of Block Island, recorded the following about Sands' experience in New Netherland:
Thus the natives gave overt clues that they were displeased with the settlement being formed there. The property had supposedly been secured by an agent of the Dutch West India Company in 1640, but the negotiation was transacted with members of the <a href="Siwanoy">Siwanoy</a> people in distant <a href="Norwalk%2C%20Connecticut">Norwalk</a>, and the local natives likely had little to do with that transaction, if they even knew of it at all. Hutchinson was therefore taking a considerable risk in putting a permanent dwelling at this site.

The exact location of the Hutchinson house has been a source of great interest for several centuries. LaPlante hints in her biography of Hutchinson that the homestead was near the Indian Trail that went through modern-day <a href="Pelham%20Bay%20Park">Pelham Bay Park</a>, on the east side of the Hutchinson River. Lockwood Barr offers another hypothesis, citing the extensive land title research of Otto Hufeland published by the Westchester Historical Society in 1929. He concluded that the site of the homestead was on the west side of the Hutchinson River in Eastchester. A map in Barr's book that appeared in the 1929 work shows the property bordering the river in an area that is now called <a href="Baychester%2C%20Bronx">Baychester</a>, between two creeks called Rattlesnake Brook and Black Dog Brook. This area of the Bronx is now highly developed; Rattlesnake Brook is extant, mostly in underground culverts, but Black Dog Brook is defunct.

The Hutchinsons' settlement in this area coincided with the local unrest between the Colonists and the Indians. Governor <a href="Willem%20Kieft">Willem Kieft</a> had aroused the ire of the Indians with his inhumanity and treachery, according to the opinion of some modern writers. Mrs. Hutchinson had a favorable relationship with the <a href="Narragansett%20people">Narragansetts</a> in Rhode Island, and she may have felt a false sense of safety among the Siwanoy of New Netherland. The Hutchinsons had been friendly to them, but the Indians destroyed the New Netherland colony in a series of incidents known as <a href="Kieft%27s%20War">Kieft's War</a>. The fate of the Hutchinson family was summarized by LaPlante:

The warriors then dragged the bodies into the house, along with the cattle, and burned the house to the ground. During the attack, Hutchinson's nine year-old daughter <a href="Susanna%20Cole">Susanna</a> was out picking blueberries; she was found, according to legend, hidden in the crevice of <a href="Split%20Rock%20%28Bronx%2C%20New%20York%29">Split Rock</a> nearby. She is believed to have had red hair, which was unusual to the Indians, and perhaps because of this curiosity her life was spared. She was taken captive, was named "Autumn Leaf" by one account, and lived with the Indians for two to six years (accounts vary) until ransomed back to her family members, most of whom were living in Boston.

The exact date of the Hutchinson massacre is not known. The first definitive record of the occurrence was in John Winthrop's journal, where it was the first entry made for the month of September, though not dated. It took days or even weeks for Winthrop to receive the news, so the event almost certainly occurred in August 1643, and this is the date found in most sources.

The reaction in Massachusetts to Hutchinson's death was harsh. The Reverend <a href="Thomas%20Weld%20%28minister%29">Thomas Weld</a> wrote, "The Lord heard our groans to heaven, and freed us from our great and sore affliction…. I never heard that the Indians in those parts did ever before this commit the like outrage upon any one family or families; and therefore God's hand is the more apparently seen herein, to pick out this woeful woman". <a href="Peter%20Bulkley">Peter Bulkley</a>, the pastor at Concord, wrote, "Let her damned heresies, and the just vengeance of God, by which she perished, terrify all her seduced followers from having any more to do with her leaven."

<a href="Wampage">Wampage</a> claimed to have slain Hutchinson, and legend has it that he assumed her name after the massacre, calling himself "Anne Hoeck" to be honored by using the name of his most famous victim. Eleven years after the event, he confirmed a deed transferring the Hutchinsons' property to Thomas Pell, with his name on the document being given as "Ann Hoeck alias Wampage."

Hutchinson claimed that she was a prophetess, receiving direct revelation from God. In this capacity, she prophesied during her trial that God would send judgment upon the Massachusetts Bay Colony and would wipe it from existence. She further taught her followers that <a href="direct%20revelation">personal revelation</a> from God was as authoritative in a person's life as the Bible, a teaching that was strongly antithetical to Puritan theology. She also claimed that she could identify "the elect" among the colonists. These positions ultimately caused John Cotton, John Winthrop, and other former friends to view her as an <a href="Antinomianism">antinomian</a> heretic.

According to modern historian Michael Winship, Hutchinson is famous, not so much for what she did or said during the <a href="Antinomian%20Controversy">Antinomian Controversy</a>, but for what John Winthrop made of her in his journal and in his account of the controversy called the "Short Story". According to Winship, Hutchinson became the reason in Winthrop's mind for all of the difficulties that the colony had gone through, though inaccurately portrayed and, with her departure, any other lingering issues were swept under the carpet. Winthrop's account has given Hutchinson near legendary status and, as with all legends, what exactly she stood for has shifted over the centuries. Winthrop described her as "a woman of ready wit and bold spirit". In the words of Winship, to Winthrop, Hutchinson was a "hell-spawned agent of destructive anarchy". The close relationship between church and state in Massachusetts Bay meant that a challenge to the ministers was quickly interpreted as challenge to established authority of all kinds. To 19th century America, she was a crusader for religious liberty, as the nation celebrated its new achievement of the separation of church and state. Finally, in the 20th century, she became a feminist leader, credited with terrifying the patriarchs, not because of her religious views but because she was an assertive, highly visible woman. According to feminist Amy Lang, Hutchinson failed to understand that "the force of the female heretic vastly exceeds her heresy". Lang argues that it was difficult for the court to pin a crime on her; her true crime in their eyes, according to Lang's interpretation, was the violation of her role in Puritan society, and she was condemned for undertaking the roles of teacher, minister, magistrate, and husband. (However, the Puritans themselves clearly stated that the threat which they perceived was entirely theological, and no direct mention was ever made to indicate that they were threatened by her gender.)

Winship calls Hutchinson "a prophet, spiritual adviser, mother of fifteen, and important participant in a fierce religious controversy that shook the infant Massachusetts Bay Colony from 1636 to 1638", upheld as a symbol of religious freedom, liberal thinking, and <a href="Christian%20feminism">Christian feminism</a>. Anne Hutchinson is a contentious figure, having been lionized, mythologized, and demonized by various writers. In particular, historians and other observers have interpreted and re-interpreted her life within the following frameworks: the status of women, power struggles within the Church, and a similar struggle within the secular political structure. As to her overall historical impact, Winship writes, "Hutchinson's well-publicized trials and the attendant accusations against her made her the most famous, or infamous, English woman in colonial American history."

In front of the <a href="Massachusetts%20State%20House">State House</a> in Boston, Massachusetts stands a statue of Anne Hutchinson with her daughter Susanna as a child. The statue, dedicated in 1922, has an inscription on the marble <a href="pediment">pediment</a> that reads:

The memorial is featured on the <a href="Boston%20Women%27s%20Heritage%20Trail">Boston Women's Heritage Trail</a>.

Another memorial to Hutchinson was erected south of Boston in <a href="Quincy%2C%20Massachusetts">Quincy, Massachusetts</a>, at the corner of Beale Street and Grandview Avenue. This is near the location where the Hutchinsons owned a 600-acre farm with a house, and this is where they stayed for several days in early spring 1638 while making the trip from Boston to their new home on <a href="Aquidneck%20Island">Aquidneck Island</a>.

Anne Hutchinson was inducted into the <a href="National%20Women%27s%20Hall%20of%20Fame">National Women's Hall of Fame</a> in 1994.

According to Hutchinson biographer <a href="Eve%20LaPlante">Eve LaPlante</a>, some literary critics trace the character of <a href="Hester%20Prynne">Hester Prynne</a> in <a href="Nathaniel%20Hawthorne">Nathaniel Hawthorne</a>'s "<a href="The%20Scarlet%20Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a>" to Hutchinson's persecution in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Historian Amy Lang wrote that Hester Prynne was the embodiment of a fictional Anne Hutchinson—a Hutchinson created by the early Puritan chroniclers. Lang notes that Hester was what orthodox Puritans said Hutchinson was, either in reality or at least spiritually. The parallel is that Hutchinson was the heretic who metaphorically seduced the Puritan community, while in Hawthorne's novel Hester Prynne literally seduced the minister of her community.

Anne Hutchinson and her political struggle with Governor Winthrop are depicted in the 1980 play "Goodly Creatures" by <a href="William%20Gibson%20%28playwright%29">William Gibson</a>. Other notable historical characters who appear in the play are Reverend <a href="John%20Cotton%20%28Puritan%29">John Cotton</a>, Governor <a href="Henry%20Vane%20the%20Younger">Harry Vane</a>, and future Quaker martyr <a href="Mary%20Dyer">Mary Dyer</a>. In January 2014, <a href="Dan%20Shore">Dan Shore</a>'s opera "Anne Hutchinson", with libretto by William A. Fregosi and Fritz Bell, was performed twice in Boston, Massachusetts by the Intermezzo Opera Company. In February 2015, researcher Claire Bellerjeau discovered and positively identified a tribute poem to Anne Hutchinson written in 1770 by <a href="Jupiter%20Hammon">Jupiter Hammon</a>, the first published Black American poet.

In southern New York, Hutchinson's most prominent namesakes are the <a href="Hutchinson%20River">Hutchinson River</a>, one of the very few rivers named after a woman, and a highway, the <a href="Hutchinson%20River%20Parkway">Hutchinson River Parkway</a>. Elementary schools are named for her, such as in the <a href="Westchester%20County%2C%20New%20York">Westchester County</a> towns of <a href="Pelham%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Pelham</a> and <a href="Eastchester%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Eastchester</a>.

In Portsmouth, Rhode Island, Anne Hutchinson and her friend <a href="Mary%20Dyer">Mary Dyer</a>, the Quaker martyr, have been remembered at Founders Brook Park with the Anne Hutchinson/Mary Dyer Memorial Herb Garden, a medicinal botanical garden set by a scenic waterfall and historical marker for the early settlement of Portsmouth. The garden was created by artist and herbalist Michael Steven Ford, who is a descendant of both women. The memorial was a grass roots effort by a local Newport organisation, the Anne Hutchinson Memorial Committee headed by Newport artist Valerie Debrule. The organization is called Friends of Anne Hutchinson; it meets annually at the memorial in Portsmouth on the Sunday nearest to 20 July, the date of Anne's baptism, to celebrate her life and the local colonial history of the women of Aquidneck Island. Hutchinson Hall, an underclassmen residence hall at the <a href="University%20of%20Rhode%20Island">University of Rhode Island</a>, is named in her honor.
Hutchinson is honoured together with <a href="Roger%20Williams%20%28theologian%29">Roger Williams</a> with a <a href="feast%20day">feast day</a> on the <a href="Calendar%20of%20saints%20%28Episcopal%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States%20of%20America%29">liturgical calendar</a> of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America on 5 February.

In 1987, Massachusetts Governor <a href="Michael%20Dukakis">Michael Dukakis</a> pardoned Anne Hutchinson, revoking the order of banishment by <a href="John%20Winthrop">Governor Winthrop</a> 350 years earlier.

Anne and <a href="William%20Hutchinson%20%28Rhode%20Island%29">William Hutchinson</a> had 15 children, all of them born and baptized in Alford except for the last child, who was baptized in Boston, Massachusetts. Of the 14 children born in England, 11 lived to sail to <a href="New%20England">New England</a>.

The oldest child <a href="Edward%20Hutchinson%20%28captain%29">Edward</a> was baptized 28 May 1613. He signed the <a href="Portsmouth%20Compact">Portsmouth Compact</a> and settled on Aquidneck Island with his parents, but he soon made peace with the Massachusetts authorities and returned to Boston. He was an officer in the colonial militia, and died from wounds received during <a href="King%20Philip%27s%20War">King Philip's War</a>. Susanna was baptised 4 September 1614 and died in Alford during the <a href="plague%20%28disease%29">plague</a> in 1630. Richard (baptized 8 December 1615) was admitted to the Boston church in 1634, but he returned to England and no further record has been found. Faith (baptized 14 August 1617) married <a href="Thomas%20Savage%20%28major%29">Thomas Savage</a> and lived in Boston, dying about 1651. Bridget (baptised 15 January 1618/9) married <a href="John%20Sanford%20%28governor%29">John Sanford</a> and lived in <a href="Portsmouth%2C%20Rhode%20Island">Portsmouth, Rhode Island</a>, where her husband was briefly governor of the island; she died by 1698.

Francis (baptized 24 December 1620) was the oldest of the children to perish in the massacre in <a href="New%20Netherland">New Netherland</a>. Elizabeth (baptized 17 February 1621/2) died during the plague in Alford and was buried there on 4 October 1630. William (baptized 22 June 1623) died during infancy. Samuel (baptized 17 December 1624) lived in Boston, married, and had a child, but left behind few records. Anne (baptized 5 May 1626) married William Collins, and both of them went to New Netherland and perished in the massacre with her mother. Mary (baptized 22 February 1627/8), Katherine (baptized 7 February 1629/30), William (baptized 28 September 1631), and daughter Zuriel (baptized in Boston 13 March 1635/6) were all children when they went with their mother to New Netherland, and were killed during the Indian massacre in the late summer of 1643. <a href="Susanna%20Cole">Susanna</a> was the 14th child of the Hutchinsons and the youngest born in England, baptized 15 November 1633. She survived the Indian attack in 1643, was taken captive, and eventually was traded to the English, after which she married John Cole and had 11 children with him.

Of Hutchinson's dozen or more siblings who survived childhood, only one other came to New England; her youngest sister, <a href="Katherine%20Marbury%20Scott">Katherine</a>, the wife of <a href="Richard%20Scott%20%28settler%29">Richard Scott</a>, came to Boston and then Providence. With her husband, Katherine was a Puritan, Baptist, and then Quaker, and was whipped in Boston for supporting her future son-in-law <a href="Christopher%20Holder">Christopher Holder</a> who had his right ear cut off for his Quaker evangelism.

A number of Anne Hutchinson's descendants have reached great prominence. Among them are United States Presidents <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, and <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a>, as are presidential aspirants <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a>, <a href="George%20W.%20Romney">George W. Romney</a>, and <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a>. Her grandson <a href="Peleg%20Sanford">Peleg Sanford</a> was a governor of the <a href="Colony%20of%20Rhode%20Island%20and%20Providence%20Plantations">Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</a>. Other descendants include Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court <a href="Melville%20Weston%20Fuller">Melville Weston Fuller</a> and Associate Justice <a href="Oliver%20Wendell%20Holmes%2C%20Jr.">Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.</a>; <a href="Lord%20Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> of England John Singleton Copley, Jr., who was the first <a href="Lord%20Lyndhurst">Lord Lyndhurst</a>; President of Harvard University <a href="Charles%20William%20Eliot">Charles William Eliot</a>; actor <a href="Ted%20Danson">Ted Danson</a>; and opera singer and socialite Madam Lillie Fay Moulton De Hegermann-Lindencrone. One descendant bearing the Hutchinson name was her ill-fated great-great-grandson <a href="Thomas%20Hutchinson%20%28governor%29">Thomas Hutchinson</a>, who was a <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">loyalist</a> Governor of the <a href="Province%20of%20Massachusetts%20Bay">Province of Massachusetts Bay</a> at the time of the <a href="Boston%20Tea%20Party">Boston Tea Party</a>, an event leading to the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>.

In 1914, <a href="John%20Denison%20Champlin%2C%20Jr.">John Champlin</a> published the bulk of the currently known ancestry of Anne Hutchinson, showing her descent on her father's side of the family from <a href="Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> and <a href="Alfred%20the%20Great">Alfred the Great</a>. <a href="Gary%20Boyd%20Roberts">Gary Boyd Roberts</a> and others have published her line of descent on her mother's side from <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I of England</a>, thus connecting her with Edward's great grandparents, <a href="Henry%20II%20of%20England">Henry II of England</a> and his wife, <a href="Eleanor%20of%20Aquitaine">Eleanor of Aquitaine</a>. Most of the material in the following ancestor chart is from Champlin, except for the Williamson line which was published in "<a href="The%20American%20Genealogist">The American Genealogist</a>" by F. N. Craig in 1992.

George W. Romney

George Wilcken Romney (July 8, 1907 – July 26, 1995) was an American businessman and <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> politician. He was chairman and president of <a href="American%20Motors">American Motors Corporation</a> from 1954 to 1962, the <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Michigan">43rd</a> <a href="Governor%20of%20Michigan">Governor of Michigan</a> from 1963 to 1969, and the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Housing%20and%20Urban%20Development">United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</a> from 1969 to 1973. He was the father of <a href="Governor%20of%20Massachusetts">Governor of Massachusetts</a>, <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202012">2012 Republican presidential nominee</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senator">United States Senator</a> from <a href="Utah">Utah</a> <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Mitt Romney</a>, husband of 1970 U.S. Senate candidate <a href="Lenore%20Romney">Lenore Romney</a>, and grandfather of current <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> chair <a href="Ronna%20McDaniel">Ronna McDaniel</a>.

Romney was born to American parents living in the <a href="Mormon%20colonies%20in%20Mexico">Mormon colonies in Mexico</a>; events during the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> forced his family to flee back to the United States when he was a child. The family lived in several states and ended up in <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a>, where they struggled during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. Romney worked in a number of jobs, served as a <a href="Mormon%20missionary">Mormon missionary</a> in the United Kingdom, and attended several colleges in the U.S. but did not graduate from any of them. In 1939 he moved to <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and joined the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Automobile%20Manufacturers">American Automobile Manufacturers Association</a>, where he served as the chief spokesman for the automobile industry during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> and headed a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share production improvements. He joined <a href="Nash-Kelvinator%20Corporation">Nash-Kelvinator</a> in 1948, and became the chief executive of its successor, <a href="American%20Motors%20Corporation">American Motors Corporation</a>, in 1954. There he turned around the struggling firm by focusing all efforts on the compact <a href="Rambler%20%28automobile%29%231958-1969">Rambler</a> car. Romney mocked the products of the "<a href="Big%20Three%20%28automobile%20manufacturers%29%23United%20States%20and%20Canada">Big Three</a>" automakers as "gas-guzzling dinosaurs" and became one of the first high-profile, media-savvy business executives. Devoutly religious, he presided over the Detroit <a href="Stake%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Stake</a> of <a href="The%20Church%20of%20Jesus%20Christ%20of%20Latter-day%20Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>.

Having entered politics by participating in a state <a href="Constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">constitutional convention</a> to rewrite the <a href="Michigan%20Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a> during 1961–1962, Romney was elected Governor of Michigan in 1962. Re-elected by increasingly large margins in 1964 and 1966, he worked to overhaul the state's financial and revenue structure, greatly expanding the size of state government and introducing Michigan's first <a href="state%20income%20tax">state income tax</a>. Romney was a strong supporter of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement">American Civil Rights Movement</a>. He briefly represented moderate Republicans against conservative Republican <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a> during the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201964">1964 U.S. presidential election</a>. He requested the intervention of federal troops during the <a href="1967%20Detroit%20riot">1967 Detroit riot</a>.

Initially a front runner for the Republican nomination for President of the United States <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201968">in the 1968 election</a>, he proved <a href="George%20Romney%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201968">an ineffective campaigner</a> and fell behind <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> in polls. After a mid-1967 remark that his earlier support for the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a> had been due to a "brainwashing" by U.S. military and diplomatic officials in Vietnam, his campaign faltered even more and he withdrew from the contest in early 1968. After Nixon's election as president, he appointed Romney as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Romney's ambitious plans for housing production increases for the poor, and for open housing to desegregate suburbs, were modestly successful but often thwarted by Nixon. Romney left the administration at the start of Nixon's second term in 1973. Returning to private life, he advocated volunteerism and public service, and headed the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Voluntary%20Action">National Center for Voluntary Action</a> and its successor organizations from 1973 through 1991. He also served as a <a href="regional%20representative%20of%20the%20Twelve">regional representative of the Twelve</a> within his church.

Romney's grandparents were <a href="Mormonism%20and%20polygamy">polygamous</a> Mormons who fled the United States with their children owing to the federal government's prosecution of polygamy. His maternal grandfather was <a href="Helaman%20Pratt">Helaman Pratt</a> (1846–1909), who presided over the Mormon mission in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a> before moving to the Mexican state of <a href="Chihuahua%20%28state%29">Chihuahua</a> and who was the son of original Mormon apostle <a href="Parley%20P.%20Pratt">Parley P. Pratt</a> (1807–1857). In the 1920s, Romney's uncle <a href="Rey%20L.%20Pratt">Rey L. Pratt</a> (1878–1931) played a major role in the preservation and expansion of the Mormon presence in Mexico and in its introduction to South America. A more distant kinsman was <a href="George%20Romney%20%28painter%29">George Romney</a> (1734–1802), a noted portrait painter in Britain during the last quarter of the 18th century.

Romney's parents, <a href="Gaskell%20Romney">Gaskell Romney</a> (1871–1955) and Anna Amelia Pratt (1876–1926), were United States citizens and natives of the <a href="Territory%20of%20Utah">Territory of Utah</a>. They married in 1895 in Mexico and lived in <a href="Colonia%20Dubl%C3%A1n">Colonia Dublán</a> in <a href="Galeana%2C%20Chihuahua">Galeana</a> in the state of Chihuahua (one of the <a href="Mormon%20colonies%20in%20Mexico">Mormon colonies in Mexico</a>), where George was born on July 8, 1907. They practiced monogamy (polygamy having been abolished by the <a href="1890%20Manifesto">1890 Manifesto</a>, although it persisted in places, especially Mexico). George had three older brothers, two younger brothers, and a younger sister. Gaskell Romney was a successful carpenter, house builder, and farmer who headed the most prosperous family in the colony, which was situated in an agricultural valley below the <a href="Sierra%20Madre%20Occidental">Sierra Madre Occidental</a>. The family chose U.S. citizenship for their children, including George.

The <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> broke out in 1910 and the Mormon colonies were endangered in 1911–1912 by raids from marauders, including "Red Flaggers" <a href="Pascual%20Orozco">Pascual Orozco</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20In%C3%A9s%20Salazar">José Inés Salazar</a>. Young George heard the sound of distant gunfire and saw rebels walking through the village streets. The Romney family fled and returned to the United States in July 1912, leaving their home and almost all of their property behind. Romney later said, "We were the first displaced persons of the 20th century."

In the United States, Romney grew up in humble circumstances. The family subsisted with other Mormon refugees on government relief in <a href="El%20Paso%2C%20Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>, benefiting from a $100,000 fund for refugees that the <a href="U.S.%20Congress">U.S. Congress</a> had set up. After a few months they moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles, California</a>, where <a href="Gaskell%20Romney">Gaskell Romney</a> worked as a carpenter. In kindergarten, other children mocked Romney's national origin by calling him "Mex".
In 1913, the family moved to <a href="Oakley%2C%20Idaho">Oakley, Idaho</a>, and bought a farm, where they grew and subsisted largely on <a href="Idaho%20potato">Idaho potato</a>es. The farm was not on good land and failed when potato prices fell. The family moved to <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%2C%20Utah">Salt Lake City, Utah</a>, in 1916, where <a href="Gaskell%20Romney">Gaskell Romney</a> resumed construction work, but the family remained generally poor. In 1917, they moved to <a href="Rexburg%2C%20Idaho">Rexburg, Idaho</a>, where <a href="Gaskell%20Romney">Gaskell</a> became a successful home and commercial builder in a growing area due to high <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> commodities prices.

George started working in wheat and sugar beet fields at the age of eleven and was the valedictorian at his grammar school graduation in 1921 (by the sixth grade he had attended six different schools). The <a href="Depression%20of%201920%E2%80%9321">Depression of 1920–21</a> brought a collapse in prices, and local building was abandoned. His family returned to Salt Lake City in 1921, and while his father resumed construction work, George became skilled at <a href="lath-and-plaster">lath-and-plaster</a> work. The family was again prospering when the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> hit in 1929 and ruined them. George watched his parents fail financially in Idaho and Utah and having to take a dozen years to pay off their debts. Seeing their struggles influenced his life and business career.

In Salt Lake City, Romney worked while attending Roosevelt Junior High School and, beginning in 1922, <a href="Latter-day%20Saints%20High%20School">Latter-day Saints High School</a>. There he played <a href="Halfback%20%28American%20football%29">halfback</a> on the football team, <a href="Guard%20%28basketball%29">guard</a> on the basketball team, and <a href="right%20field">right field</a> on the baseball team, all with more persistence than talent, but in an effort to uphold the family tradition of athleticism, he earned <a href="varsity%20letter">varsity letter</a>s in all three sports. In his senior year, he and junior <a href="Lenore%20Romney">Lenore LaFount</a> became high school sweethearts; she was from a more well-assimilated Mormon family. Academically, Romney was steady but undistinguished. He graduated from high school in 1925; his yearbook picture caption was "Serious, high minded, of noble nature – a real fellow."

Partly to stay near Lenore, Romney spent the next year as a junior college student at the co-located <a href="Latter-day%20Saints%20University">Latter-day Saints University</a>, where he was elected <a href="student%20body%20president">student body president</a>. He was also president of the <a href="booster%20club">booster club</a> and played on the basketball team that won the Utah–Idaho Junior College Tournament.

After becoming an <a href="Elder%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">elder</a>, Romney earned enough money working to fund himself as a <a href="Missionary%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Mormon missionary</a>. In October 1926, he sailed to Great Britain and was first assigned to preach in a slum in <a href="Glasgow">Glasgow</a>, Scotland. The abject poverty and hopelessness he saw there affected him greatly, but he was ineffective in gaining converts and temporarily suffered a crisis of faith.

In February 1927, he was shifted to <a href="Edinburgh">Edinburgh</a> and in February 1928 to London, where he kept track of mission finances. He worked under renowned <a href="Quorum%20of%20the%20Twelve%20Apostles%20%28LDS%20Church%29">Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</a> intellectuals <a href="James%20E.%20Talmage">James E. Talmage</a> and <a href="John%20A.%20Widtsoe">John A. Widtsoe</a>; the latter's admonitions to "Live mightily today, the greatest day of all time is today" made a lasting impression on him. Romney experienced British sights and culture and was introduced to members of the <a href="peerage">peerage</a> and the <a href="Oxford%20Group">Oxford Group</a>.

In August 1928, Romney became president of the Scottish missionary district. Operating in a <a href="whisky">whisky</a>-centric region was difficult, and he developed a new "task force" approach of sending more missionaries to a single location at a time; this successfully drew local press attention and several hundred new recruits. Romney's frequent public proselytizing – from <a href="The%20Mound">Edinburgh's Mound</a> and in London from soap boxes at <a href="Speakers%27%20Corner">Speakers' Corner</a> in <a href="Hyde%20Park%2C%20London">Hyde Park</a> and from a platform at <a href="Trafalgar%20Square">Trafalgar Square</a> – developed his gifts for debate and sales, which he would use the rest of his career. Three decades later, Romney said that his missionary time had meant more to him in developing his career than any other experience.

Romney returned to the U.S. in late 1928 and studied briefly at the <a href="University%20of%20Utah">University of Utah</a> and <a href="LDS%20Business%20College">LDS Business College</a>. He followed LaFount to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, in fall 1929, after her father, <a href="Harold%20A.%20Lafount">Harold A. Lafount</a>, had accepted an appointment by President <a href="Calvin%20Coolidge">Calvin Coolidge</a> to serve on the <a href="Federal%20Radio%20Commission">Federal Radio Commission</a>. He worked for <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a> Democratic <a href="U.S.%20Senator">U.S. Senator</a> <a href="David%20I.%20Walsh">David I. Walsh</a> during 1929 and 1930, first as a stenographer using <a href="speedwriting">speedwriting</a>, then, when his abilities at that proved limited, as a staff aide working on tariffs and other legislative matters. Romney researched aspects of the proposed <a href="Smoot%E2%80%93Hawley%20Tariff%20Act">Smoot-Hawley tariff legislation</a> and sat in on committee meetings; the job was a turning point in his career and gave him lifelong confidence in dealing with Congress.

With one of his brothers, Romney opened a <a href="Milk%20bar%23Similar%20establishments">dairy bar</a> in nearby <a href="Rosslyn%2C%20Virginia">Rosslyn, Virginia</a>, during this time. The business soon failed, in the midst of the Great Depression. He also attended <a href="George%20Washington%20University">George Washington University</a> at night. Based upon a connection he made working for Walsh, Romney was hired as an apprentice for <a href="Alcoa">Alcoa</a> in <a href="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> in June 1930.

When LaFount, an aspiring actress, began earning bit roles in Hollywood movies, Romney arranged to be transferred to Alcoa's Los Angeles office for training as a salesman. There he took night classes at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>. (Romney did not attend for long, or graduate from, any of the colleges in which he was enrolled, accumulating only 2½ years of credits; instead he has been described as an <a href="autodidact">autodidact</a>.) LaFount had the opportunity to sign a $50,000, three-year contract with <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a> studios, but Romney convinced her to return to Washington with him as he was assigned a position there with Alcoa as a <a href="lobbyist">lobbyist</a>. She later said she had never had a choice of both marriage and an acting career, because the latter would have upstaged him, but expressed no regrets about having chosen the former. Romney would later consider wooing her his greatest sales achievement.

The couple married on July 2, 1931, at <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%20Temple">Salt Lake City Temple</a>. They would have four children: Margo Lynn (born 1935), Jane LaFount (born 1938), <a href="G.%20Scott%20Romney">George Scott</a> (born 1941), and <a href="Mitt%20Romney">Willard Mitt</a> (born 1947). The couple's marriage reflected aspects of their personalities and courtship. George was devoted to Lenore, and tried to bring her a flower every day, often a single rose with a love note. George was also a strong, blunt personality used to winning arguments by force of will, but the more self-controlled Lenore was unintimidated and willing to push back against him. The couple quarreled so much as a result that their grandchildren would later nickname them "the Bickersons", but in the end, their closeness would allow them to settle arguments amicably.

As a lobbyist, Romney frequently competed on behalf of the aluminum industry against the copper industry, and defended Alcoa against charges of being a monopoly. He also represented the Aluminum Wares Association. In the early 1930s, he helped get aluminum windows installed in the <a href="Herbert%20C.%20Hoover%20Building">U.S. Department of Commerce Building</a>, at the time the largest office building in the world.

Romney joined the <a href="National%20Press%20Club%20%28USA%29">National Press Club</a> and the <a href="Burning%20Tree%20Club">Burning Tree</a> and <a href="Congressional%20Country%20Club">Congressional Country Club</a>s; one reporter watching Romney hurriedly play golf at the last said, "There is a young man who knows where he is going." Lenore's cultural refinement and hosting skills, along with her father's social and political connections, helped George in business, and the couple met the Hoovers, the Roosevelts, and other prominent Washington figures. He was chosen by Pyke Johnson, a Denver newspaperman and automotive industry trade representative he met at the Press Club, to join the newly formed Trade Association Advisory Committee to the <a href="National%20Recovery%20Administration">National Recovery Administration</a>. The committee's work continued even after the agency was declared unconstitutional in 1935. During 1937 and 1938, Romney was also president of the Washington Trade Association Executives.

After nine years with Alcoa, Romney's career had stagnated; there were many layers of executives to climb through and a key promotion he had wanted was given to someone with more seniority. Pyke Johnson was vice president of the <a href="Automobile%20Manufacturers%20Association">Automobile Manufacturers Association</a>, which needed a manager for its new <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> office. Romney got the job and moved there with his wife and two daughters in 1939. An association study found Americans using their cars more for short trips and convinced Romney that the trend was towards more functional, basic transportation. In 1942, he was promoted to general manager of the association, a position he held until 1948. Romney also served as president of the Detroit Trade Association in 1941.

In 1940, as <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> raged overseas, Romney helped start the Automotive Committee for Air Defense, which coordinated planning between the automobile and aircraft industries. Immediately following the December 1941 <a href="attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">attack on Pearl Harbor</a> that drew the U.S. into the war, Romney helped turn that committee into, and became managing director of, the <a href="Automotive%20Council%20for%20War%20Production">Automotive Council for War Production</a>. This organization established a cooperative arrangement in which companies could share machine tools and production improvements, thus maximizing the industry's contribution to the war production effort. It embodied Romney's notion of "competitive cooperative capitalism".

With labor leader <a href="Victor%20Reuther">Victor Reuther</a>, Romney led the Detroit Victory Council, which sought to improve conditions for Detroit workers under wartime stress and deal with the causes of the <a href="Detroit%20race%20riot%20of%201943">Detroit race riot of 1943</a>. Romney successfully appealed to the <a href="Federal%20Housing%20Administration">Federal Housing Administration</a> to make housing available to black workers near the <a href="Willow%20Run">Ford Willow Run</a> plant. He also served on the labor-management committee of the Detroit section of the <a href="War%20Manpower%20Commission">War Manpower Commission</a>.

Romney became the chief spokesman of the automobile industry, often testifying before Congressional hearings about production, labor, and management issues; he was mentioned or quoted in over 80 stories in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" during this time. By war's end, 654 manufacturing companies had joined the Automotive Council for War Production, and produced nearly $29 billion in output for the Allied military forces. This included over 3 million motorized vehicles, 80 percent of all tanks and tank parts, 75 percent of all aircraft engines, half of all diesel engines, and a third of all machine guns. Between a fifth and a quarter of all U.S. wartime production was accounted for by the automotive industry.

As peacetime production began, Romney persuaded government officials to forgo complex contract-termination procedures, thus freeing auto plants to quickly produce cars for domestic consumption and avoid large layoffs. Romney was director of the American Trade Association Executives in 1944 and 1947, and managing director of the National Automobile Golden Jubilee Committee in 1946. From 1946 to 1949, he represented U.S. employers as a delegate to the Metal Trades Industry conference of the <a href="International%20Labor%20Office">International Labor Office</a>. By 1950, Romney was a member of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council, and criticized <a href="Racial%20segregation%20in%20the%20United%20States">racial segregation</a> in Detroit's housing program when speaking before the <a href="Detroit%20City%20Council">Detroit City Council</a>. Romney's personality was blunt and intense, giving the impression of a "man in a hurry", and he was considered a rising star in the industry.

As managing director of the Automobile Manufacturers Association, Romney became good friends with then-president <a href="George%20W.%20Mason">George W. Mason</a>. When Mason became chairman of the manufacturing firm <a href="Nash-Kelvinator%20Corporation">Nash-Kelvinator</a> in 1948, he invited Romney along "to learn the business from the ground up" as his roving assistant, and the new executive spent a year working in different parts of the company. At an inefficient Detroit refrigerator plant of the Kelvinator appliance division, Romney battled the <a href="Mechanics%20Educational%20Society%20of%20America">Mechanics Educational Society of America</a> union to institute a new industrial–labor relations program that forestalled the whole facility being shut down. He appealed to the workers by saying, "I am no college man. I've laid floors, I've done lathing. I've thinned beets and shocked wheat." As Mason's protégé, Romney assumed executive assignment for the development of the <a href="Rambler%20%28car%29">Rambler</a>.

Mason had long sought a merger of Nash-Kelvinator with one or more other companies, and on May 1, 1954, it merged with <a href="Hudson%20Motor%20Car">Hudson Motor Car</a> to become the <a href="American%20Motors%20Corporation">American Motors Corporation</a> (AMC). It was the largest merger in the history of the industry, and Romney became an executive vice president of the new firm. In October 1954, Mason suddenly died of acute <a href="pancreatitis">pancreatitis</a> and <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Romney was named AMC's president and chairman of the board the same month.

When Romney took over, he reorganized upper management, brought in younger executives, and pruned and rebuilt AMC's <a href="Car%20dealership">dealer network</a>. Romney believed that the only way to compete with the "<a href="Big%20Three%20%28automobile%20manufacturers%29%23United%20States%20and%20Canada">Big Three</a>" (<a href="General%20Motors%20Corporation">General Motors</a>, <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford</a>, and <a href="Chrysler%20Corporation">Chrysler</a>) was to stake the future of AMC on a new smaller-sized car line. Together with chief engineer Meade Moore, by the end of 1957 Romney had completely phased out the <a href="Nash%20Motors">Nash</a> and <a href="Hudson%20Motor%20Car%20Company">Hudson</a> brands, whose sales had been lagging. The <a href="Rambler%20%28automobile%29%231958-1969">Rambler brand</a> was selected for development and promotion, as AMC pursued an innovative strategy: manufacturing only <a href="compact%20car">compact car</a>s. The company struggled badly at first, losing money in 1956, more in 1957, and experiencing defections from its dealer network. Romney instituted company-wide savings and efficiency measures, and he and other executives reduced their salaries by up to 35 percent.

Though AMC was on the verge of being taken over by corporate raider <a href="Louis%20Wolfson">Louis Wolfson</a> in 1957, Romney was able to fend him off. Then sales of the Rambler finally took off, leading to unexpected financial success for AMC. It posted its first quarterly profit in three years in 1958, was the only car company to show increased sales during the <a href="recession%20of%201958">recession of 1958</a>, and moved from thirteenth to seventh place among worldwide auto manufacturers.
In contrast with the Hudson's <a href="NASCAR">NASCAR</a> racing success in the early 1950s, the Ramblers were frequent winners in the coast-to-coast <a href="Mobil%20Economy%20Run">Mobil Economy Run</a>, an annual event on U.S. highways. Sales remained strong during 1960 and 1961; the Rambler was America's third most popular car both years.

A believer in "competitive cooperative consumerism", Romney was effective in his frequent appearances before Congress. He discussed what he saw as the twin evils of "big labor" and "big business", and called on Congress to break up the Big Three. As the Big Three automakers introduced ever-larger models, AMC undertook a "gas-guzzling dinosaur fighter" strategy, and Romney became the company spokesperson in print advertisements, public appearances, and commercials on the "<a href="Walt%20Disney%20anthology%20television%20series">Disneyland</a>" television program. Known for his fast-paced, shirt-sleeved management style that ignored organization charts and levels of responsibility, he often wrote the ad copy himself.

Romney became what automotive writer Joe Sherman termed "a folk hero of the American auto industry" and one of the first high-profile media-savvy business executives. His focus on small cars as a challenge to AMC's domestic competitors, as well as the foreign-car invasion, was documented in the April 6, 1959, cover story of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine, which concluded that "Romney has brought off singlehanded one of the most remarkable selling jobs in U.S. industry." A full biography of him was published in 1960; the company's resurgence made Romney a household name. The <a href="Associated%20Press">Associated Press</a> named Romney its Man of the Year in Industry for four consecutive years, 1958 through 1961.

The company's stock rose from $7 per share to $90 per share, making Romney a millionaire from <a href="stock%20options">stock options</a>. However, whenever he felt his salary and bonus was excessively high for a year, he gave the excess back to the company. After initial wariness, he developed a good relationship with <a href="United%20Automobile%20Workers">United Automobile Workers</a> leader <a href="Walter%20Reuther">Walter Reuther</a>, and AMC workers also benefited from a then-novel <a href="Profit-sharing%20agreement%20%28USA%29">profit-sharing plan</a>. Romney was one of only a few Michigan corporate chiefs to support passage and implementation of the state Fair Employment Practices Act.

Religion was a paramount force in Romney's life. In a 1959 essay for the "<a href="Detroit%20Free%20Press">Detroit Free Press</a>" he said, "My religion is my most precious possession. ... Except for my religion, I easily could have become excessively occupied with industry, social and recreational activities. Sharing personal responsibility for church work with my fellow members has been a vital counterbalance in my life." Following <a href="LDS%20Church">LDS Church</a> practices, he did not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages, smoke, or swear. Romney and his wife <a href="tithe">tithe</a>d, and from 1955 to 1965, gave 19 percent of their income to the church and another 4 percent to charity.

Romney was a high priest in the <a href="Melchizedek%20priesthood%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Melchizedek priesthood of the LDS</a>, and beginning in 1944 he headed the Detroit <a href="Branch%20%28Mormonism%29">church branch</a> (which initially was small enough to meet in a member's house). By the time he was AMC chief, he presided over the <a href="Stake%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Detroit Stake</a>, which included not only all of Metro Detroit, Ann Arbor, and the Toledo area of Ohio but also the western edge of Ontario along the Michigan border. In this role, Romney oversaw the religious work of some 2,700 church members, occasionally preached sermons, and supervised the construction of the first stake tabernacle east of the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> in 100 years. Because the stake covered part of Canada, he often interacted with Canadian Mission President <a href="Thomas%20S.%20Monson">Thomas S. Monson</a>. Romney's rise to a leadership role in the church reflected the church's journey from a fringe pioneer religion to one that was closely associated with mainstream American business and values. Due in part to his prominence, the larger Romney family tree would become viewed as "LDS royalty".

Romney and his family lived in affluent <a href="Bloomfield%20Hills%2C%20Michigan">Bloomfield Hills</a>, having moved there from Detroit around 1953. He became deeply active in Michigan civic affairs. He was on the board of directors of the <a href="Children%27s%20Hospital%20of%20Michigan">Children's Hospital of Michigan</a> and the United Foundation of Detroit, and was chairman of the executive committee of the Detroit Round Table of Catholics, Jews, and Protestants. In 1959, he received the <a href="Anti-Defamation%20League">Anti-Defamation League of B'nai</a>'s Americanism award.

Starting in 1956, Romney headed a citizen-based committee for improved educational programs in Detroit's public schools. The 1958 final report of the Citizens Advisory Committee on School Needs was largely Romney's work and received considerable public attention; it made nearly 200 recommendations for economy and efficiency, better teacher pay, and new infrastructure funding. Romney helped a $90-million education-related bond issue and tax increase win an upset victory in an April 1959 statewide referendum. He organized Citizens for Michigan in 1959, a nonpartisan group that sought to study Detroit's problems and build an informed electorate. Citizens for Michigan built on Romney's belief that assorted interest groups held too much influence in government, and that only the cooperation of informed citizens acting for the benefit of all could counter them.

Based on his fame and accomplishments in a state where automobile making was a central topic of conversation, Romney was seen as a natural to enter politics. He first became directly involved in politics in 1959, when he was a key force in the petition drive calling for a constitutional convention to rewrite the <a href="Michigan%20Constitution">Michigan Constitution</a>. Romney's sales skills made Citizens for Michigan one of the most effective organizations among those calling for the convention. Previously unaffiliated politically, Romney declared himself a member of the <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> and gained election to the convention. By early 1960, many in Michigan's somewhat moribund Republican Party were touting Romney as a possible candidate for governor, U.S. senator, or even U.S. vice president.

Also in early 1960, Romney served on the <a href="Fair%20Campaign%20Practices%20Committee">Fair Campaign Practices Committee</a>, a group also having Jewish, Catholic, mainline and evangelical Protestant, and Orthodox Christian members. It issued a report whose guiding principles were that no candidate for elected office should be supported or opposed due to their religion and that no campaign for office should be seen as an opportunity to vote for one religion against another. This statement helped pave the way for <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>'s famous speech on religion and public office later that year. Romney briefly considered a run in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20elections%2C%201960">1960 Senate election</a>, but instead became a vice president of the constitutional convention that revised the Michigan constitution during 1961 and 1962.

After a period of pained indecision and a 24-hour prayer fast, Romney stepped down from AMC in February 1962 to enter electoral politics (given an indefinite leave of absence, he was succeeded as president of AMC by <a href="Roy%20Abernethy">Roy Abernethy</a>).
Romney's position as the leader of the moderate Republicans at the constitutional convention helped gain him the Republican nomination for <a href="Governor%20of%20Michigan">Governor of Michigan</a>.
He ran against incumbent Democratic Governor <a href="John%20B.%20Swainson">John B. Swainson</a> in the general election. Romney campaigned on revising the state's tax structure, increasing its appeal to businesses and the general public, and getting it "rolling again". Romney decried both the large influence of labor unions within the Democratic Party and the similarly large influence of big business within the Republican Party. His campaign was among the first to exploit the capabilities of <a href="electronic%20data%20processing">electronic data processing</a>.

Romney won by some 80,000 votes and ended a fourteen-year stretch of Democratic rule in the state executive spot. His win was attributed to his appeal to independent voters and to those from the increasingly influential suburbs of Detroit, who by 1962 were more likely to vote Republican than the heavily Democratic residents of the city itself. Additionally, Romney had appeal to labor union members that was unusual for a Republican. Democrats won all the other statewide executive offices in the election, including Democratic incumbent <a href="T.%20John%20Lesinski">T. John Lesinski</a> in the separate election for <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Michigan">Lieutenant Governor of Michigan</a>. Romney's success caused immediate mention of him as a presidential possibility for 1964, and President John F. Kennedy said privately in 1963 that, "The one fellow I don't want to run against is Romney."

Romney was sworn in as governor on January 1, 1963. His initial concern was the implementation of the overhaul of the state's financial and revenue structure that had been authorized by the constitutional convention. In 1963, he proposed a comprehensive tax revision package that included a flat-rate <a href="state%20income%20tax">state income tax</a>, but general economic prosperity alleviated pressure on the state budget and the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> rejected the measure. Romney's early difficulties with the legislature helped undermine an attempted push that year of Romney as a national political figure by former <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> associates. One Michigan Democrat said of Romney, "He has not yet learned that things in government are not necessarily done the moment the man at the top gives an order. He is eager and sometimes impatient." But over his first two years in office, Romney was able to work with Democrats – who often had at least partial control of the legislature – and an informal bipartisan coalition formed which allowed Romney to accomplish many of his goals and initiatives.

Romney held a series of Governor's Conferences, which sought to find new ideas from public services professionals and community activists who attended. He opened his office in the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Capitol">Michigan State Capitol</a> to visitors, spending five minutes with every citizen who wanted to speak with him on Thursday mornings, and was always sure to shake the hands of schoolchildren visiting the capitol. He almost always eschewed political activities on Sunday, the Mormon Sabbath. His blunt and unequivocal manner sometimes caused friction, and family members and associates used the idiom "bull in a china shop" to describe him. He took a theatrical approach to governance, staging sudden appearances in settings where he might be politically unwelcome. One former aide later said that "willful" was too weak a word to describe him, and chose "messianic" instead. Romney saw a moral dimension in every issue and his political views were held with as much fervor as religious ones; writer <a href="Theodore%20H.%20White">Theodore H. White</a> said "the first quality that surfaced, as one met and talked with George Romney over a number of years, was a sincerity so profound that, in conversation, one was almost embarrassed."

Romney supported the <a href="American%20Civil%20Rights%20Movement">American Civil Rights Movement</a> while governor. Although he belonged to a church that <a href="Black%20people%20and%20Mormonism">did not allow black people in its lay clergy</a>, Romney's hardscrabble background and subsequent life experiences led him to support the movement. He reflected, "It was only after I got to Detroit that I got to know Negroes and began to be able to evaluate them and I began to recognize that some Negroes are better and more capable than lots of whites." During his first <a href="State%20of%20the%20State%20address">State of the State address</a> in January 1963, Romney declared that "Michigan's most urgent human rights problem is racial discrimination—in housing, public accommodations, education, administration of justice, and employment." Romney helped create the state's first civil rights commission.
When <a href="Martin%20Luther%20King%20Jr.">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> came to Detroit in June 1963 and led the 120,000-strong <a href="Great%20March%20on%20Detroit">Great March on Detroit</a>, Romney designated the occasion Freedom March Day in Michigan, and sent state senator Stanley Thayer to march with King as his emissary, but did not attend himself because it was on Sunday. Romney did participate in a much smaller march protesting housing discrimination the following Saturday in <a href="Grosse%20Pointe%2C%20Michigan">Grosse Pointe</a>, after King had left. Romney's advocacy of civil rights brought him criticism from some in his own church; in January 1964, Quorum of the Twelve Apostles member <a href="Delbert%20L.%20Stapley">Delbert L. Stapley</a> wrote him that a proposed civil rights bill was "vicious legislation" and telling him that "the Lord had placed the curse upon the Negro" and men should not seek its removal. Romney refused to change his position and increased his efforts towards civil rights. Regarding the church policy itself, Romney was among those liberal Mormons who hoped the church leadership would revise the theological interpretation that underlay it, but Romney did not believe in publicly criticizing the church, subsequently saying that fellow Mormon <a href="Stewart%20Udall">Stewart Udall</a>'s 1967 published denunciation of the policy "cannot serve any useful religious purpose".
In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201964">1964 U.S. presidential election</a>, Senator <a href="Barry%20Goldwater">Barry Goldwater</a> quickly became the likely Republican Party nominee. Goldwater represented a new wave of <a href="American%20conservatism">American conservatism</a>, of which the moderate Romney was not a part. Romney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in all the other races that year, including Romney's own (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor). Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater's views on civil rights; he would later say, "Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, have "got" to learn to know each other. Barry Goldwater didn't have any background to understand this, to fathom them, and I couldn't get through to him."

During the June 1964 <a href="National%20Governors%27%20Conference">National Governors' Conference</a>, 13 of 16 Republican governors present were opposed to Goldwater; their leaders were <a href="Jim%20Rhodes">Jim Rhodes</a> of Ohio, <a href="Nelson%20Rockefeller">Nelson Rockefeller</a> of New York (whose own campaign had just stalled out with a loss to Goldwater in the California primary), <a href="William%20Scranton">William Scranton</a> of Pennsylvania, and Romney. In an unusual Sunday press conference, Romney declared, "If [Goldwater's] views deviate as indicated from the heritage of our party, I will do everything within my power to keep him from becoming the party's presidential nominee." Romney had, however, previously vowed to Michigan voters that he would not run for president in 1964. Detroit newspapers indicated they would not support him in any such bid, and Romney quickly decided to honor his pledge to stay out of the contest. Scranton entered instead, but Goldwater prevailed decisively at the <a href="1964%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1964 Republican National Convention</a>. Romney's name was entered into nomination as a <a href="favorite%20son">favorite son</a> by U.S. Representative <a href="Gerald%20Ford">Gerald Ford</a> of Michigan (who had not wanted to choose between candidates during the primary campaign) and he received the votes of 41 delegates in the roll call (40 of Michigan's 48 and one from Kansas).
At the convention, Romney fought for a strengthened civil rights plank in the party platform that would pledge action to eliminate discrimination at the state, local, and private levels, but it was defeated on a voice vote. He also failed to win support for a statement that condemned both left- and right-wing extremism without naming any organizations, which lost a standing vote by a two-to-one margin. Both of Romney's positions were endorsed by former President <a href="Dwight%20Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, who had an approach to civic responsibilities similar to Romney's. As the convention concluded, Romney neither endorsed nor repudiated Goldwater and vice presidential nominee <a href="William%20E.%20Miller">William E. Miller</a>, saying he had reservations about Goldwater's lack of support for civil rights and the political extremism that Goldwater embodied.

For the fall 1964 elections, Romney cut himself off from the national ticket, refusing to even appear on the same stage with them and continuing to feud with Goldwater privately. He campaigned for governor in mostly Democratic areas, and when pressed at campaign appearances about whether he supported Goldwater, he replied, "You know darn well I'm not!" Romney was re-elected in 1964 by a margin of over 380,000 votes over Democratic Congressman <a href="Neil%20Staebler">Neil Staebler</a>, despite Goldwater's landslide defeat to President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> that swept away many other Republican candidates. Romney won 15 percent of Michigan's black vote, compared to Goldwater's two percent.

In 1965, Romney visited <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a> for 31 days and said that he was continuing his strong support for U.S. military involvement there.
During 1966, while son Mitt was away in France on missionary work, George Romney guided Mitt's fiancée <a href="Ann%20Romney">Ann Davies</a> in her conversion to Mormonism. Governor Romney continued his support of civil rights; after violence broke out during the <a href="Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches">Selma to Montgomery marches</a> in 1965, he marched at the front of a Detroit parade in solidarity with the marchers. In 1966, Romney had his biggest electoral success, winning re-election again by some 527,000 votes over Democratic lawyer <a href="Zolton%20Ferency">Zolton Ferency</a> (this time to a four-year term, after a change in Michigan law). His share of the black vote rose to over 30 percent, a virtually unprecedented accomplishment for a Republican.

By 1967, a looming deficit prompted the legislature to overhaul Michigan's tax structure. Personal and corporate state income taxes were created while business receipts and corporation franchise taxes were eliminated. Passage of an income levy had eluded past Michigan governors, no matter which party controlled of the legislature. Romney's success convincing Democratic and Republican factions to compromise on the details of the measure was considered a key test of his political ability.

The massive <a href="12th%20Street%20riot">12th Street riot</a> in Detroit began during the predawn hours of July 23, 1967, precipitated by a police raid of a <a href="blind%20pig">speakeasy</a> in a predominantly black neighborhood. As the day wore on and looting and fires got worse, Romney called in the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Police">Michigan State Police</a> and the <a href="Michigan%20National%20Guard">Michigan National Guard</a>. At 3 a.m. on July 24, Romney and Detroit Mayor <a href="Jerome%20Cavanagh">Jerome Cavanagh</a> called <a href="U.S.%20Attorney%20General">U.S. Attorney General</a> <a href="Ramsey%20Clark">Ramsey Clark</a> and requested that federal troops be sent. Clark indicated that to do so, Romney would have to declare a state of <a href="civil%20insurrection">civil insurrection</a>, which the governor was loath to do from fear that insurance companies would seize upon it as a reason to not cover losses owing to the riot. Elements of the <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">82nd</a> and <a href="101st%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">101st U.S. Army Airborne Divisions</a> were mobilized outside of the city.
As the situation in Detroit worsened, Romney told <a href="United%20States%20Deputy%20Secretary%20of%20Defense">Deputy Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Cyrus%20Vance">Cyrus Vance</a>, "We gotta move, man, we gotta move." Near midnight on July 24, President Johnson authorized thousands of paratroopers to enter Detroit. Johnson went on national television to announce his actions and made seven references to Romney's inability to control the riot using state and local forces. Thousands of arrests took place and the rioting continued until July 27. The final toll was the largest of any American civil disturbance in fifty years: 43 dead, over a thousand injured, 2,500 stores looted, hundreds of homes burned, and some $50 million overall in property damage.

There were strong political implications in the handling of the riot, as Romney was seen as a leading Republican contender to challenge Johnson's presidential re-election the following year; Romney believed the White House had intentionally slowed its response and he charged Johnson with having "played politics" in his actions. The riot notwithstanding, by the end of Romney's governorship the state had made strong gains in civil rights related to public employment, government contracting, and access to public accommodations. Lesser improvements were made in combating discrimination in private employment, housing, education, and law enforcement. Considerable state and federal efforts were made during this time to improve the lot of Michigan's <a href="Migrant%20worker">migrant farm workers</a> and <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">Native Americans</a>, without much progress for either.

Romney greatly expanded the size of state government while governor. His first state budget, for fiscal year 1963, was $550 million, a $20 million increase over that of his predecessor Swainson. Romney had also inherited an $85 million budget deficit, but left office with a surplus. In the following fiscal years, the state budget increased to $684 million for 1964, $820 million for 1965, $1 billion for 1966, $1.1 billion for 1967, and was proposed as $1.3 billion for 1968. Romney led the way for a large increase in state spending on education, and Michigan began to develop one of the nation's most comprehensive systems of higher education. There was a significant increase in funding support for local governments and there were generous benefits for the poor and unemployed. Romney's spending was enabled by the that generated continued government surpluses and by a consensus of both parties in Michigan to maintain extensive state bureaucracies and expand public sector services.

The bipartisan coalitions that Romney worked with in the state legislature enabled him to reach most of his legislative goals. His record as governor continued his reputation for having, as writer <a href="Theodore%20H.%20White">Theodore H. White</a> said, "a knack for getting things done." Noted <a href="University%20of%20Michigan">University of Michigan</a> historian <a href="Sidney%20Fine%20%28historian%29">Sidney Fine</a> assessed him as "a highly successful governor".

Romney's wide margin of re-election as governor in November 1966 thrust him to the forefront of national Republicans. In addition to his political record, the tall, square-jawed, handsome, graying Romney matched what the public thought a president should look like. Republican governors were determined not to let a Goldwater-sized loss recur, and neither Rockefeller nor Scranton wanted to run again; the governors quickly settled on Romney as their favorite for the <a href="Republican%20Party%20presidential%20primaries%2C%201968">Republican presidential nomination in the 1968 U.S. presidential election</a>.
Former Congressman and <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> chair <a href="Leonard%20W.%20Hall">Leonard W. Hall</a> became Romney's informal campaign manager. A <a href="Gallup%20Poll">Gallup Poll</a> after the November elections showed Romney as favored among Republicans over former Vice President Richard Nixon for the Republican nomination, 39 percent to 31 percent; a <a href="Harris%20Poll">Harris Poll</a> showed Romney besting President Johnson among all voters by 54 percent to 46 percent. Nixon considered Romney his chief opponent. Romney announced an exploratory phase for a possible campaign in February 1967, beginning with a visit to Alaska and the Rocky Mountain states.

Romney's greatest weakness was a lack of foreign policy expertise and a need for a clear position on the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. The press coverage of the trip focused on Vietnam and reporters were frustrated by Romney's initial reluctance to speak about it. The qualities that helped Romney as an industry executive worked against him as a presidential candidate; he had difficulty being articulate, often speaking at length and too forthrightly on a topic and then later correcting himself while maintaining he was not. Reporter <a href="Jack%20Germond">Jack Germond</a> joked that he was going to add a single key on his typewriter that would print, "Romney later explained ..." "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" magazine wrote that Romney "manages to turn self-expression into a positive ordeal" and that he was no different in private: "nobody can sound more like the public George Romney than the real George Romney let loose to ramble, inevitably away from the point and toward some distant moral precept."

The perception grew that Romney was gaffe-prone. The campaign, beset by internal rivalries, soon went through the first of several reorganizations. By then, Nixon had already overtaken Romney in Gallup's Republican preference poll, a lead he would hold throughout the rest of the campaign. The techniques that had brought Romney victories in Michigan, such as operating outside established partisan formulas and keeping a distance from Republican Party organizational elements, proved ineffective in a party nominating contest.
Romney's national poll ratings continued to erode, and by May he had lost his edge over Johnson. The Detroit riots of July 1967 did not change his standing among Republicans, but did give him a bounce in national polls against the increasingly unpopular president.

Questions were occasionally asked about Romney's eligibility to run for <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> owing to his birth in Mexico, given the ambiguity in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> over the phrase "<a href="natural-born%20citizen">natural-born citizen</a>". Romney would depart the race before the matter could be more definitively resolved, although the preponderance of opinion then and since has been that he was eligible.

Romney was also the first Mormon to stage a credible run for the presidency. By this time, he was well known as a Mormon and perhaps the most nationally visible one since <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a>. But his membership in the LDS Church was scarcely mentioned at all during the campaign. What indirect discussion there was helped bring to national attention the church's policy regarding blacks, but the contrast of Romney's pro-civil rights stance deflected any criticism of him and indirectly benefited the image of the church. Some historians and Mormons suspected then and later that had Romney's campaign lasted longer and been more successful, his religion might have become a more prominent issue. Romney's campaign did often focus on his core beliefs; a Romney billboard in New Hampshire read "The Way To Stop Crime Is To Stop Moral Decay". <a href="Dartmouth%20College">Dartmouth College</a> students gave a bemused reaction to his morals message, displaying signs such as "God Is Alive and Thinks He's George Romney". A spate of books were published about Romney, more than for any other candidate, and included a friendly campaign biography, an attack from a former staffer, and a collection of Romney's speeches.

On August 31, 1967, in a taped interview with locally influential (and nationally syndicated) talk show host <a href="Lou%20Gordon%20%28journalist%29">Lou Gordon</a> of <a href="WKBD-TV">WKBD-TV</a> in Detroit, Romney stated: "When I came back from Viet Nam [in November 1965], I'd just had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get." He then shifted to opposing the war: "I no longer believe that it was necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia." Decrying the "tragic" conflict, he urged "a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time." Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was "morally right and necessary".

The "brainwashing" reference had been an offhand, unplanned remark that came at the end of a long, behind-schedule day of campaigning. By September 7, it found its way into prominence at "The New York Times". Eight other governors who had been on the same 1965 trip as Romney said no such activity had taken place, and one of them, <a href="Philip%20H.%20Hoff">Philip H. Hoff</a> of Vermont, said Romney's remarks were "outrageous, kind of stinking ... Either he's a most naïve man or he lacks judgment." The connotations of <a href="brainwashing">brainwashing</a>, following the experiences of American prisoners of war (highlighted by the 1962 film "<a href="The%20Manchurian%20Candidate%20%281962%20film%29">The Manchurian Candidate</a>"), made Romney's comment devastating, especially as it reinforced the negative image of Romney's abilities that had already developed. The topic of brainwashing quickly became newspaper editorial and television talk show fodder, and Romney bore the brunt of the topical humor. Senator <a href="Eugene%20McCarthy">Eugene McCarthy</a>, running against Johnson for the Democratic nomination, said that in Romney's case, "a light rinse would have been sufficient." Republican Congressman <a href="Robert%20T.%20Stafford">Robert T. Stafford</a> of Vermont sounded a common concern: "If you're running for the presidency, you are supposed to have too much on the ball to be brainwashed." After the remark was aired, Romney's poll ratings nosedived, going from 11 percent behind Nixon to 26 percent behind.

He nonetheless persevered, staging a three-week, 17-city tour of the nation's ghettos and disadvantaged areas that none of his advisors thought politically worthwhile. He sought to engage militants in dialogue, found himself exposed to the harsh realities and language of ghetto areas, and had an unusual encounter with <a href="hippies">hippies</a> and <a href="Diggers%20%28theater%29">The Diggers</a> in San Francisco's <a href="Haight-Ashbury">Haight-Ashbury</a>.

Romney formally announced on November 18, 1967, at Detroit's <a href="UAW-Ford%20National%20Programs%20Center">Veterans Memorial Building</a>, that he had "decided to fight for and win the Republican nomination and election to the Presidency of the United States." His subsequent release of his federal tax returns – twelve years' worth going back to his time as AMC head – was groundbreaking and established a precedent that many future presidential candidates would have to contend with. He spent the following months campaigning tirelessly, focusing on the <a href="New%20Hampshire%20primary">New Hampshire primary</a>, the first of the season, and doing all the on-the-ground activities known to that state: greeting workers at factory gates before dawn, having neighborhood meetings in private homes, and stopping at bowling alleys. He returned to Vietnam in December 1967 and made speeches and proposals on the subject, one of which presaged Nixon's eventual policy of <a href="Vietnamization">Vietnamization</a>. For a while, he got an improved response from voters.
Two weeks before the March 12 primary, an internal poll showed Romney losing to Nixon by a six-to-one margin in New Hampshire. Rockefeller, seeing the poll result as well, publicly maintained his support for Romney but said he would be available for a draft; the statement made national headlines and embittered Romney (who would later claim it was Rockefeller's entry, and not the "brainwashing" remark, that doomed him). Seeing his cause was hopeless, Romney announced his withdrawal as a presidential candidate on February 28, 1968. Romney wrote his son Mitt, still away on missionary work: "Your mother and I are not personally distressed. As a matter of fact, we are relieved. ... I aspired, and though I achieved not, I am satisfied."

Nixon went on to gain the nomination. At the <a href="1968%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1968 Republican National Convention</a> in Miami Beach, Romney refused to release his delegates to Nixon, something Nixon did not forget. Romney finished a weak fifth, with only 50 votes on the roll call (44 of Michigan's 48, plus six from Utah). When party liberals and moderates and others expressed dismay at Nixon's choice of <a href="Spiro%20Agnew">Spiro Agnew</a> as his running mate, Romney's name was placed into nomination for vice president by <a href="Mayor%20of%20New%20York">Mayor of New York</a> <a href="John%20Lindsay">John Lindsay</a> and pushed by several delegations. Romney said he did not initiate the move, but he made no effort to oppose it. Nixon saw the rebellion as a threat to his leadership and actively fought against it; Romney lost to Agnew 1,119–186. Romney, however, worked for Nixon's eventually successful campaign in the fall, which did earn him Nixon's gratitude.

Presidential historian Theodore H. White wrote that during his campaign Romney gave "the impression of an honest and decent man simply not cut out to be President of the United States." Governor <a href="Jim%20Rhodes">Jim Rhodes</a> of Ohio more memorably said, "Watching George Romney run for the presidency was like watching a duck try to make love to a football."

After the election, Nixon named Romney to be <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20Housing%20and%20Urban%20Development">Secretary of Housing and Urban Development</a> (HUD). The president-elect made the announcement as part of a nationally televised presentation of his new cabinet on December 11, 1968. Nixon praised Romney for his "missionary zeal" and said that he would also be tasked with mobilizing volunteer organizations to fight poverty and disease within the United States. In actuality, Nixon distrusted Romney politically, and appointed him to a liberally oriented, low-profile federal agency partly to appease Republican moderates and partly to reduce Romney's potential to challenge for the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201972">1972 Republican presidential nomination</a>.

Romney was confirmed by the Senate without opposition on January 20, 1969, the day of Nixon's inauguration, and was sworn into office on January 22, with Nixon at his side. Romney resigned as Governor of Michigan that same day, and was succeeded by Lieutenant Governor <a href="William%20G.%20Milliken">William G. Milliken</a>. Milliken continued Romney's model of downplaying party label and ideology, and Republicans held onto the governorship for three more terms until 1983, though Michigan was one of the nation's most blue-collar states.

As secretary, Romney conducted the first reorganization of the department since its 1966 creation. His November 1969 plan brought programs with similar functions together under unified, policy-based administration at the Washington level, and created two new assistant secretary positions. At the same time, he increased the number of regional and area offices and decentralized program operations and locality-based decisions to them.

The <a href="Fair%20Housing%20Act%20of%201968">Fair Housing Act of 1968</a> mandated a federal commitment towards housing desegregation, and required HUD to orient its programs in this direction. Romney, filled with moral passion, wanted to address the widening economic and geographic gulf between whites and blacks by moving blacks out of inner-city ghettos into suburbs. Romney proposed an <a href="open%20housing">open housing</a> scheme to facilitate desegregation, dubbed "Open Communities"; HUD planned it for many months without keeping Nixon informed.
When the open housing proposal became public, local reaction was often hostile. Such was the reaction of many residents in <a href="Warren%2C%20Michigan">Warren, Michigan</a>, a predominately white blue-collar suburb of Detroit. While it had no formal discriminatory laws, most blacks were excluded by zoning practices, refusals to sell to them, and intimidatory actions of white property owners, many of whom were ethnic Polish and Catholic and had moved to the suburb as part of <a href="white%20flight">white flight</a>. By this time, Detroit was 40–50 percent black. HUD made Warren a prime target for Open Communities enforcement and threatened to halt all federal assistance to the town unless it took a series of actions to end racial discrimination there; town officials said progress was being made and that their citizens resented forced integration. Romney rejected this response, partly because when he was governor, Warren residents had thrown rocks and garbage and yelled obscenities for days at a biracial couple who moved into town. Now the secretary said, "The youth of this nation, the minorities of this nation, the discriminated of this nation are not going to wait for 'nature to take its course.' What is really at issue here is responsibility – moral responsibility."

Romney visited Warren in July 1970, where he addressed leaders from it and around 40 nearby suburbs. He emphasized that the government was encouraging <a href="Affirmative%20action%20in%20the%20United%20States">affirmative action</a> rather than forced integration, but the local populace saw little difference and Romney was jeered as a police escort took him away from the meeting place. Nixon saw what happened in Warren and had no interest in the Open Communities policy in general, remarking to domestic adviser <a href="John%20Ehrlichman">John Ehrlichman</a> that, "This country is not ready at this time for either forcibly integrated housing or forcibly integrated education." The Open Communities policy conflicted with Nixon's use of the <a href="Southern%20strategy">Southern strategy</a> of gaining political support among traditionally white southern Democrats, and his own views on race. Romney was forced to back down on Warren and release federal monies to them unconditionally.

When <a href="Black%20Jack%2C%20Missouri">Black Jack, Missouri</a>, subsequently resisted a HUD-sponsored plan for desegregated lower- and middle-income housing, Romney appealed to U.S. Attorney General <a href="John%20N.%20Mitchell">John Mitchell</a> for <a href="U.S.%20Justice%20Department">Justice Department</a> intervention. In September 1970, Mitchell refused and Romney's plan collapsed. Under Romney, HUD did establish stricter affirmative racial guidelines in relation to new public housing projects, but overall administration implementation of the Fair Housing Act was lacking. Some of the responsibility lay with Romney's inattentiveness to gaining political backing for the policy, including the failure to rally natural allies such as the <a href="NAACP">NAACP</a>. <a href="Salisbury%20University">Salisbury University</a> historian Dean J. Kotlowski writes that, "No civil rights initiative developed on Nixon's watch was as sincerely devised or poorly executed as open communities."

Another of Romney's initiatives was "Operation Breakthrough," which was intended to increase the amount of housing available to the poor and which initially had Nixon's support. Based on his automotive industry experience, Romney thought that the cost of housing could be significantly reduced if in-factory <a href="modular%20building">modular construction</a> techniques were used. HUD officials believed that introduction of this technique could help bring about desegregation; Romney said, "We've got to put an end to the idea of moving to suburban areas and living only among people of the same economic and social class". This aspect of the program brought about strong opposition at the local suburban level and lost support in the White House as well. Over half of HUD's research funds during this time were spent on Operation Breakthrough, and it was modestly successful in its building goals. It did not revolutionize home construction, and was phased out once Romney left HUD. But it resulted indirectly in more modern and consistent <a href="building%20codes">building codes</a> and introduction of technological advances such as the <a href="smoke%20alarm">smoke alarm</a>.

In any case, using conventional construction methods, HUD set records for the amount of construction of assisted housing for low- and moderate-income families. Toward the end of his term, Romney oversaw demolition of the infamous <a href="Pruitt%E2%80%93Igoe">Pruitt–Igoe</a> housing project in <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a>, which had become crime-ridden, drug-infested, and largely vacant.
Romney was largely outside the president's inner circle and had minimal influence within the <a href="Nixon%20administration">Nixon administration</a>. His intense, sometimes bombastic style of making bold advances and awkward pullbacks lacked adequate guile to succeed in Washington. Desegregation efforts in employment and education had more success than in housing during the Nixon administration, but HUD's many missions and unwieldy structure, which sometimes worked at cross-purposes, made it institutionally vulnerable to political attack. Romney also failed to understand or circumvent Nixon's use of counsel Ehrlichman and <a href="White%20House%20Chief%20of%20Staff">White House Chief of Staff</a> <a href="H.%20R.%20Haldeman">H. R. Haldeman</a> as policy gatekeepers, resulting in "de facto" downgrading of the power of cabinet officers. Romney was used to being listened to and making his own decisions; he annoyed Nixon by casually interrupting him at meetings. At one point, Nixon told Haldeman, "Just keep [Romney] away from me." A statement by Romney that he would voluntarily reduce his salary to aid the federal budget was viewed by Nixon as an "ineffective grandstand play".

By early 1970, Nixon had decided he wanted Romney removed from his position. Nixon, who hated to fire people and was, as Ehrlichman later described, "notoriously inadept" at it, instead hatched a plot to get Romney to run in the 1970 U.S. Senate race in Michigan. Instead, Romney proposed that his wife Lenore run, and she received the backing of some state Republicans. There was also resistance to her candidacy and an initial suspicion that it was just a <a href="stalking%20horse">stalking horse</a> for keeping his options open. She barely survived a primary against a conservative opponent, then lost badly in the general election to incumbent Democrat <a href="Philip%20A.%20Hart">Philip A. Hart</a>. Romney blamed others for his wife having entered the race, when he had been the major force behind it.

In late 1970, after opposition to Open Communities reached a peak, Nixon again decided that Romney should go. Still reluctant to dismiss him, Nixon tried to get Romney to resign by forcing him to capitulate on a series of policy issues. Romney surprised both Nixon and Haldeman by agreeing to back off his positions, and Nixon kept him as HUD secretary. Nixon remarked privately afterwards, "[Romney] talks big but folds under pressure." Puzzled by Nixon's lack of apparent ideological consistency across different areas of the government, Romney told a friend, "I don't know what the president believes in. Maybe he doesn't believe in anything," an assessment shared by others both inside and outside the administration.

In spring 1972, the <a href="Federal%20Housing%20Administration">Federal Housing Administration</a> (FHA), an agency within HUD, was struck by scandal. Since passage of the <a href="Housing%20and%20Urban%20Development%20Act%20of%201968">Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968</a> and the creation of the <a href="Government%20National%20Mortgage%20Association">Government National Mortgage Association</a> (Ginnie Mae), it had been responsible for helping the poor buy homes in inner-city areas via government-backed mortgages. These were financed by <a href="Mortgage-backed%20security">mortgage-backed securities</a>, the first issues of which Romney had announced in 1970. A number of FHA employees, along with a number of real estate firms and lawyers, were indicted for a scheme in which the value of cheap inner city homes was inflated and they were sold to black buyers who could not really afford them, based on using those government-backed mortgages. The government was stuck for the bad loans when owners defaulted, as the properties were overvalued and could not be resold at the inflated prices. Romney conceded that HUD had been unprepared to deal with speculators and had not been alert to earlier signs of illegal activity at the FHA. The FHA scandal gave Nixon the ability to shut down HUD's remaining desegregation efforts with little political risk; by January 1973, all federal housing funds had been frozen.

In August 1972, Nixon announced Romney would inspect <a href="Hurricane%20Agnes">Hurricane Agnes</a> flood damage in <a href="Wilkes-Barre%2C%20Pennsylvania">Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania</a>, but neglected to tell Romney first. Much of the area lacked shelter six weeks after the storm, residents were angry, and Romney got into a three-way shouting match with Governor <a href="Milton%20J.%20Shapp">Milton J. Shapp</a> and a local citizens' representative. Romney denounced Shapp's proposal that the federal government pay off the mortgages of victims as "unrealistic and demagogic", and the representative angrily said to Romney, "You don't give a damn whether we live or die." The confrontation received wide media attention, damaging Romney's public reputation. Feeling very frustrated, Romney wanted to resign immediately, but Nixon, worried about the fallout to his 1972 re-election campaign, insisted that Romney stay on. Romney agreed, although he indicated to the press that he would leave eventually.

Romney finally turned in his resignation on November 9, 1972, following Nixon's re-election. His departure was announced on November 27, 1972, as part of the initial wave of departures from Nixon's first-term cabinet. Romney said he was unhappy with presidential candidates who declined to address "the real issues" facing the nation for fear they would lose votes, and said he would form a new national citizens' organization that would attempt to enlighten the public on the most vital topics. He added that he would stay on as secretary until his successor could be appointed and confirmed, and did stay until Nixon's second inauguration on January 20, 1973. Upon his departure, Romney said he looked forward "with great enthusiasm" to his return to private life.

"<a href="The%20Boston%20Globe">The Boston Globe</a>" later termed Romney's conflicts with Nixon a matter that "played out with Shakespearean drama". Despite all the setbacks and frustrations, <a href="University%20at%20Buffalo">University at Buffalo</a> political scientist Charles M. Lamb concluded that Romney pressed harder to achieve suburban integration than any prominent federal official in the ensuing 1970s through the 1990s. In 2008, <a href="Lehman%20College">Lehman College</a> sociology professor Christopher Bonastia assessed the Romney-era HUD as having come "surprisingly close to implementing unpopular antidiscrimination policies" but finally being unable to produce meaningful alterations in American residential segregation patterns, with no equivalent effort having happened since then or likely to in the foreseeable future.

Romney was known as an advocate of public service, and <a href="volunteerism">volunteerism</a> was a passion of his. He initiated several volunteer programs while Governor of Michigan, and at the beginning of the Nixon administration chaired the Cabinet Committee on Voluntary Action. Out of this the <a href="National%20Center%20for%20Voluntary%20Action">National Center for Voluntary Action</a> was created: an independent, private, non-profit organization intended to encourage volunteerism on the part of American citizens and organizations, to assist in program development for voluntary efforts, and to make voluntary action an important force in American society. Romney's long interest in volunteerism stemmed from the Mormon belief in the power of institutions to transform the individual, but also had a secular basis. At the National Center's first meeting on February 20, 1970, he said:

Americans have four basic ways of solving problems that are too big for individuals to handle by themselves. One is through the federal government. A second is through state governments and the local governments that the states create. The third is through the private sector – the economic sector that includes business, agriculture, and labor. The fourth method is the independent sector – the voluntary, cooperative action of free individuals and independent association. Voluntary action is the most powerful of these, because it is uniquely capable of stirring the people themselves and involving their enthusiastic energies, because it is their own – voluntary action is the people's action. ... As Woodrow Wilson said, "The most powerful force on earth is the spontaneous cooperation of a free people." Individualism makes cooperation worthwhile – but cooperation makes freedom possible.

In 1973, after he left the cabinet, Romney became chair and CEO of the National Center for Voluntary Action. In 1979, this organization merged with the Colorado-based <a href="National%20Information%20Center%20on%20Volunteerism">National Information Center on Volunteerism</a> and became known as ; Romney headed the new organization. The organization simplified its name to in 1984 and to the <a href="National%20Volunteer%20Center">National Volunteer Center</a> in 1990. Romney remained as chair of these organizations throughout this time.

Within the LDS Church, Romney remained active and prominent, serving as <a href="Patriarch%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">patriarch</a> of the Bloomfield Hills Stake and holding the office of <a href="regional%20representative%20of%20the%20Twelve">regional representative of the Twelve</a>, covering Michigan and northern Ohio. As part of a longtime habit of playing golf daily, he had long ago concocted a "compact 18" format in which he played three balls on each of six holes, or similar formulations depending upon the amount of daylight. During the early part of the <a href="Reagan%20administration">Reagan administration</a>, Romney served on the <a href="President%27s%20Task%20Force%20for%20Private%20Sector%20Initiatives">President's Task Force for Private Sector Initiatives</a> along with LDS leader Monson. In 1987, he held a four-generation extended family reunion in Washington, where he showed the places and recounted the events of his life which had occurred there. Looking back on his and some other failed presidential bids, he once concluded, "You can't be right too soon and win elections."

President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>'s <a href="Points%20of%20Light%20Foundation">Points of Light Foundation</a> was created in 1990, also to encourage volunteerism. Romney received the Points of Light Foundation's inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award from President Bush in April 1991. The Bush administration wanted to tap Romney to chair the new foundation, but he reportedly refused to head two organizations doing the same thing and suggested they merge. They did so in September 1991, and Romney became one of the founding directors of the <a href="Points%20of%20Light%20Foundation%20%26amp%3B%20Volunteer%20Center%20National%20Network">Points of Light Foundation & Volunteer Center National Network</a>.
In the early 1990s, Romney was also involved in helping to set up the <a href="Commission%20on%20National%20and%20Community%20Service">Commission on National and Community Service</a>, one of the predecessors to the later <a href="Corporation%20for%20National%20and%20Community%20Service">Corporation for National and Community Service</a>. He gave speeches emphasizing the vital role of people helping people, and in 1993 inspired the first national meeting of <a href="volunteer%20center">volunteer center</a>s.

For much of his final two decades, Romney had been out of the political eye, but he re-emerged to the general public when he campaigned for his son, Mitt Romney, during the younger Romney's bid to unseat Senator <a href="Edward%20M.%20Kennedy">Edward M. Kennedy</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20Massachusetts%2C%201994">1994 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts</a>. Romney had urged Mitt to enter the race and moved into his son's house for its duration, serving as an unofficial advisor. Romney was a vigorous surrogate for his son in public appearances and at fundraising events. When Kennedy's campaign sought to bring up the LDS Church's past policy on blacks, Romney interrupted Mitt's press conference and said loudly, "I think it is absolutely wrong to keep hammering on the religious issues. And what Ted is trying to do is bring it into the picture." The father counseled the son to be relaxed in appearance and to pay less attention to his political consultants and more to his own instincts, a change that the younger Romney made late in the ultimately unsuccessful campaign.

That same year, <a href="Ronna%20Romney">Ronna Romney</a>, Romney's ex-daughter-in-law (formerly married to G. Scott Romney), decided to seek the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate from Michigan. While Mitt and G. Scott endorsed Ronna Romney, George Romney had endorsed her opponent and the eventual winner, <a href="Spencer%20Abraham">Spencer Abraham</a>, during the previous year when Ronna was considering a run but had not yet announced. A family spokesperson said that George Romney had endorsed Abraham before knowing Ronna Romney would run and could not go back on his word, although he did refrain from personally campaigning on Abraham's behalf.

By January 1995, amid press criticism of the Points of Light Foundation engaging in ineffective, wasteful spending, Romney expressed concern that the organization had too high a budget. Active to the end, in July 1995, four days before his death, Romney proposed a presidential summit to encourage greater volunteerism and community service, and the night before his death he drove to a meeting of another volunteer organization.

On July 26, 1995, Romney died of a <a href="myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a> at the age of 88 while he was doing his morning exercising on a <a href="treadmill">treadmill</a> at his home in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan; he was discovered by his wife Lenore but it was too late to save him. He was buried at the Fairview Cemetery in <a href="Brighton%2C%20Michigan">Brighton, Michigan</a>. In addition to his wife and children, Romney was survived by 23 grandchildren and 33 great-grandchildren.

The <a href="Presidents%27%20Summit%20For%20America%27s%20Future">Presidents' Summit For America's Future</a> took place in Philadelphia in 1997, manifesting Romney's last volunteerism proposal, with the organization <a href="America%27s%20Promise">America's Promise</a> coming out of it.
For many years, the Points of Light Foundation (and its predecessor organization) has given out an annual Lenore and George W. Romney Citizen Volunteer Award (later retitled the George and Lenore Romney Citizen Volunteer Award); the inaugural such award in 1987 went to George Romney himself. The Points of Light Foundation and the <a href="Corporation%20for%20National%20and%20Community%20Service">Corporation for National and Community Service</a> also give out a George W. Romney Volunteer Center Excellence Award (later the George W. Romney Excellence Award) at the annual National Conference on Community Volunteering and National Service (later the National Conference on Volunteering and Service). The George W. Romney Volunteer Center itself is sponsored by the <a href="United%20Way%20of%20America">United Way for Southeastern Michigan</a>, and began during Romney's lifetime.

Founded in 1998 with a grant from <a href="Romney%20family">Romney's immediate family</a>, the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management in the <a href="Marriott%20School%20of%20Management">Marriott School of Management</a> at <a href="Brigham%20Young%20University">Brigham Young University</a> honors the legacy left by Romney. Its mission is to develop people of high character who are committed to service, management, and leadership in the public sector and in non-profit organizations throughout the world.

The building housing the main offices of the Governor of Michigan in <a href="Lansing%2C%20Michigan">Lansing</a> is known as the <a href="George%20W.%20Romney%20Building">George W. Romney Building</a> following a 1997 renaming. The Governor George Romney Lifetime Achievement Award is given annually by the State of Michigan, to recognize citizens who have demonstrated a commitment to community involvement and volunteer service throughout their lifetimes. In 2010, <a href="Adrian%20College">Adrian College</a> in Michigan announced the opening of its George Romney Institute for Law and Public Policy. Its purpose is to explore the interdisciplinary nature of law and public policy and encourage practitioners, academics, and students to work together on issues in this realm.
