Ghosts I–IV

Ghosts I–IV is the sixth studio album by American <a href="industrial%20rock">industrial rock</a> band <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails">Nine Inch Nails</a>, released on March 2, 2008 by <a href="The%20Null%20Corporation">The Null Corporation</a>. It was the band's first independent release, following their split from longtime label <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a> the prior year. The album's production team included Nine Inch Nails frontman <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a>, studio collaborators <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a> and <a href="Alan%20Moulder">Alan Moulder</a>, and instrumental contributions from <a href="Alessandro%20Cortini">Alessandro Cortini</a>, <a href="Adrian%20Belew">Adrian Belew</a>, and <a href="Brian%20Viglione">Brian Viglione</a>.

Reznor described the music of "Ghosts" as "a soundtrack for daydreams", a sentiment echoed by critics, who compared it to the work of <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> and <a href="Robert%20Fripp">Robert Fripp</a>. The tracks are unnamed, identified only by their track listing and group number, and is an almost entirely instrumental album. Although initially intended to be a five-track <a href="extended%20play">EP</a>, the final release consisted of four nine-track EPs, totaling 36 tracks. The album was released under a <a href="Creative%20Commons">Creative Commons</a> license (<a href="BY-NC-SA">BY-NC-SA</a>) and in a variety of differing packages and <a href="price%20point">price point</a>s, including a US$300 "Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition", without prior announcement. A user-generated "film festival" was also announced, inviting fans to visually interpret the music and post their submissions.

The album received a favorable reception from critics, who complimented its experimental nature and unorthodox release method, although some viewed the former as its weak point. The album reached number 14 in the US, and was nominated for two <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s (Best Rock Instrumental Performance and Best Box Set or Limited Edition Package) representing the first time music released under a Creative Commons license had been nominated for a Grammy Award.

Nine Inch Nails frontman <a href="Trent%20Reznor">Trent Reznor</a> announced in 2007 that the band had completed its contractual obligations to its record label, <a href="Interscope%20Records">Interscope Records</a>, and would no longer be working with the company. He also revealed that the band would likely distribute its next album independently, possibly in a fashion similar to <a href="Saul%20Williams">Saul Williams</a>' 2007 album "<a href="The%20Inevitable%20Rise%20and%20Liberation%20of%20NiggyTardust%21">The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</a>", which Reznor produced.

Following the <a href="Performance%202007%20Tour">Performance 2007 Tour</a> in support of the band's previous album "<a href="Year%20Zero%20%28album%29">Year Zero</a>" (2007), Reznor set out to make a record "with very little forethought". "Ghosts I–IV" originated from an experiment: "The rules were as follows: 10 weeks, no clear agenda, no overthinking, everything driven by impulse. Whatever happens during that time gets released as ... something." Reznor explained, "I've been considering and wanting to make this kind of record for years, but by its very nature it wouldn't have made sense until this point".

The core creative team behind the project was Reznor, <a href="Atticus%20Ross">Atticus Ross</a>, and <a href="Alan%20Moulder">Alan Moulder</a>. <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20live%20performances">Live-band</a> member <a href="Alessandro%20Cortini">Alessandro Cortini</a> and studio musicians <a href="Adrian%20Belew">Adrian Belew</a> and <a href="Brian%20Viglione">Brian Viglione</a> also contributed instrumental performances on select tracks. Reznor described the band's early intentions for the project as "an experiment", and explained the group's process: "When we started working with the music, we would generally start with a sort of visual reference that we had imagined: a place, or a setting, or a situation. And then attempt to describe that with sound and texture and melody. And treat it, in a sense, as if it were a soundtrack."

The musicians created the album tracks through improvisation and experimentation. As a result, the initial plan to release a single EP of the material expanded to include the increasing amount of material. Viglione contributed percussion to tracks 19 and 22. He stated that Reznor's instructions to him were to "build a drumkit. Piece together any stuff that you want to bang on; rent what you want to rent. Have fun and ... be creative—See where your mind and your ideas take you." Viglione's makeshift drum kit included a 50-gallon trash can, a pair of water cooler jugs, and a cookie tray with a chain across it. Alessandro Cortini is credited on a total of ten tracks from "Ghosts" for his contributions on <a href="guitar">guitar</a>, <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a>, <a href="Appalachian%20dulcimer">dulcimer</a>, and electronics. Cortini was brought onto the project two weeks into the process, and his involvement evolved from "first recording some extra parts to some tracks" and eventually into "a collaboration on [the] tracks noted in the booklet". Adrian Belew was also brought on for select instrumental contributions, but as the project evolved Reznor expanded Belew's involvement and shared writing credit with him on two tracks.

"Ghosts I–IV" is an almost entirely instrumental album, with only a few tracks containing sampled vocals. Reznor described the album's sound as "the result of working from a very visual perspective—dressing imagined locations and scenarios with sound and texture; a soundtrack for daydreams." <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>' review of the album compared its musical style to that of <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> and <a href="Robert%20Fripp">Robert Fripp</a>, ultimately categorizing it as "<a href="dark%20ambient">dark ambient</a>". The review went on to describe the music as "a tonal painting, a collection of moods and not all of these moods are good ones." <a href="NPR">NPR</a> compared the album to the music of <a href="Erik%20Satie">Erik Satie</a> and Brian Eno; "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"<nowiki>'s</nowiki> review to Brian Eno, specifically the album's sound to the instrumentals of "<a href="Another%20Green%20World">Another Green World</a>" (1975) and the rhythm collages of "<a href="My%20Life%20in%20the%20Bush%20of%20Ghosts%20%28album%29">My Life in the Bush of Ghosts</a>" (1981). <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> also compared the album to the work of Brian Eno, summarizing "Ghosts"<nowiki>'</nowiki> sound as "mental wallpaper".

"Ghosts I–IV" features a wide assortment of musical instruments, including <a href="piano">piano</a>, <a href="guitar">guitar</a>, <a href="bass%20guitar">bass</a>, <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>, <a href="marimba">marimba</a>, <a href="tambourine">tambourine</a>, <a href="banjo">banjo</a>, <a href="Appalachian%20dulcimer">dulcimer</a>, and <a href="xylophone">xylophone</a>, many of which were sampled and distorted electronically. <a href="Percussion%20instrument">Percussion instrument</a>s, contributed primarily by Brian Viglione, were constructed largely out of found objects and household items.
<a href="Rob%20Sheridan">Rob Sheridan</a> acted as the album's art director, in collaboration with Artist in Residence. Sheridan was also art director for the previous two Nine Inch Nails studio albums, "<a href="With%20Teeth">With Teeth</a>" (2005) and "<a href="Year%20Zero%20%28album%29">Year Zero</a>". Since "Ghosts" was released in a variety of versions, some of the versions feature somewhat differing (or additional) album art and related artwork. A 40-page <a href="Portable%20Document%20Format">PDF</a> comes with each version of the album and contains a photograph for each of the 36 tracks. These photographs are also embedded into the <a href="ID3">ID3</a> tags of every downloadable track.

"Ghosts I–IV" was released online on March 2, 2008, on the official Nine Inch Nails website in a number of different formats at various price points. The only prior advertisement or notice of the release was a post by Reznor two weeks prior on the site saying "2 weeks!" "Ghosts" was the first album released by Reznor's independent label <a href="The%20Null%20Corporation">The Null Corporation</a>. Retail copies of the album were distributed by <a href="RED%20Distribution">RED Distribution</a> on April 8 on CD and vinyl formats, and May 1 for the "Deluxe" and "Ultra-Deluxe" editions. The smallest "Ghosts" package contains the first nine tracks, available for free online from either the official Nine Inch Nails website or officially from various <a href="BitTorrent%20tracker">BitTorrent tracker</a>s, including <a href="The%20Pirate%20Bay">The Pirate Bay</a>. The entire album was also made available for download directly from the band for US$5. Physical copies of the album were available for pre-sale online, with immediate access to the digital version. A two-disc version includes two audio CDs and a 16-page booklet for $10. A "Deluxe Edition" is available for $75 and includes two audio CDs, a data-<a href="DVD">DVD</a> containing <a href="multitrack%20recording">multitrack</a> files of the album, a <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> with the album in high-definition stereo and accompanying slide show, and a 48-page hardcover book with photographs. A $300 "Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition" included everything in the "Deluxe" edition, as well as a 4-LP 180 gram <a href="Gramophone%20record">vinyl</a> set in a fabric slipcase, and two exclusive limited edition <a href="Gicl%C3%A9e">Giclée</a> prints, unique to each copy. These were limited to 2,500 pieces, each copy numbered and signed by Trent Reznor. Reznor described the limited edition release as "the most luxurious physical package we've ever created." Finally, the album was also released on 4-LP 130 gram vinyl, set in a double gate fold package, for $39.

The album is licensed under a <a href="Creative%20Commons">Creative Commons</a> <a href="Creative%20Commons%20licenses">Attribution Non-Commercial Share Alike</a> license, in effect allowing anyone to use or rework the material for any non-profit purpose, as long as credit is provided and the resulting work is released under a similar license. Reznor explained this move by saying "It's a stance we're taking that we feel is appropriate [...] with digital technology, and outdated copyright laws, and all the nonsense that's going on these days". Jim Guerinot, then manager of Nine Inch Nails, explained the unconventional release of the album as "[not] a reaction to what doesn’t exist today. [...] it’s more just like, 'Hey, in a vacuum I can do whatever I want to do.'" The digital-release of the album reportedly required an extensive overhaul of the Nine Inch Nails website in order for the site to cope with the influx of traffic, online-payments, and customer service needs of releasing the album. These upgrades cost Reznor approximately $20,000 to implement. Despite these measures, upon the release of "Ghosts" the site crashed, and additional <a href="server%20%28computing%29">servers</a> were necessary to handle the traffic.

Reznor wrote in 2008 that "more volumes of "Ghosts" are likely to appear in the future." In a 2009 interview with <a href="Trent%20Vanegas">Trent Vanegas</a>, he repeated his intention to make another "Ghosts" album in the near future. Portions of the album were used as the soundtrack to the 2014 documentary film "<a href="Citizenfour">Citizenfour</a>".

Nearly two weeks after the release of the album, Reznor organized and announced a user-created "<a href="film%20festival">film festival</a>" as an accompaniment to the album, hosted at the official Nine Inch Nails <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a> channel. It was revealed that the album was stripped of much artwork and song titles to provide a blank canvas for the project.
Reznor explained that the endeavor was not meant as a contest, but as "an experiment in collaboration and a chance for us to interact beyond the typical one-way artist-to-fan relationship." Over 2,000 video submissions were posted and over 13,000 members joined the festival group, which started in March 2008.

"Ghosts I–IV" material was implemented into <a href="Nine%20Inch%20Nails%20live%20performances">Nine Inch Nails live performances</a> typically as a distinct section of instrumental songs midway through the show. "Ghosts" material was performed in this manner primarily as part of the "<a href="The%20Slip%20%28album%29%23Lights%20in%20the%20Sky%20tour">Lights in the Sky</a>" tour in 2008, immediately after the album's release. During these segments the music was largely acoustic, as opposed to the electric instrumentation of other Nine Inch Nails live sets. The "Ghosts" segment included instrumentation from a <a href="marimba">marimba</a>, <a href="Pump%20organ">harmonium</a>, <a href="glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a>, <a href="double%20bass">double bass</a>, <a href="banjo">banjo</a> and various homemade percussion instruments. The "Ghosts" section was later scrapped for the "NINJA" and "Wave Goodbye" tours, as Reznor felt the instrumental songs did not fit with the set lists.

Critical response to "Ghosts I–IV" was generally favorable, with an average rating of 69/100 based on 12 reviews on <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>. Seth Colter Walls of "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>" described the album as "the kind of absorbing musical experience that the surviving ranks of know-it-all record-store clerks would be pushing on customers, if only they could offer it for sale." <a href="IGN">IGN</a> gave the album a rating of 8.7 out of 10 and wrote, "The music is so engrossing and encompassing that time ceases to be a factor—at least until the music finally stops." <a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a> gave the album an 8 out of 10 and described the album as "36 tracks, but no songs", and went on to call it "dark, brooding [...] haunting." <a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a> criticized the album by saying "nearly every one of the untitled instrumental sketches here feels emaciated and half-finished", and gave the work a 5.0 out of 10.0. "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" also criticized the album, summarizing the review by saying "Nine Inch Nails return with no label oversight, no boundaries and no tunes."
"<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>" stated, "There's too much here. Yet it's the most interesting NIN in years." The review went on to describe each track as "the sonic equivalent of a silver orb hovering in your living room [which then] explodes into a million shiny balls of mercury that splash to the floor before trickling, magnetically, back into a large round mass."

The album's unorthodox distribution methods also garnered the attention of various news agencies, such as "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>"'s Eliot Van Buskirk, who labeled "Ghosts" as "a remarkably extensive release". Ben Worthen of "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" hypothesized that "most business execs [...] could learn a lot from [Reznor's] experiments with online business models." Many news agencies compared the release to <a href="Radiohead">Radiohead</a>'s 2007 "<a href="pay%20what%20you%20want">pay what you want</a>" digital release of "<a href="In%20Rainbows">In Rainbows</a>", as well as the similar release of <a href="Saul%20Williams">Saul Williams</a>' album "<a href="The%20Inevitable%20Rise%20and%20Liberation%20of%20NiggyTardust%21">The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!</a>" the same year, which Reznor produced. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s review called the album a "a new-media showpiece", while <a href="Tiny%20Mix%20Tapes">Tiny Mix Tapes</a> said "the circumstances surrounding the release are so forward-thinking that they could be considered just as key to appreciating the album as the music itself." Financial website <a href="The%20Motley%20Fool">The Motley Fool</a> wrote an article on the album's release titled "Music Industry Gets Nailed Again", forecasting that "Innovators like Nine Inch Nails are paving the way for new media business models that may bypass the middleman while making sure artists "and" fans are happy." In its review of "The Slip", however, PopMatters described "Ghosts I–IV" in retrospect as an "aimless batch of ... instrumentals packaged in a brilliant marketing scheme" and said that it was "basically a CD release with a couple of mail-order special editions available for the 'true fans'."

"Ghosts" was nominated for two <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s, under the categories Best Rock Instrumental performance for the track "34 Ghosts IV", and Best Boxed Set or Limited Edition Package for the "Ultra-Deluxe" edition of the album. These nominations represented the first time music licensed under Creative Commons had been nominated for a Grammy Award. Following the release of "Ghosts" and the similar online release method of the band's follow-up, "The Slip", Reznor was awarded the Webby Artist of the Year Award at the annual <a href="Webby%20Awards">Webby Awards</a> in 2009. "Rolling Stone" magazine named Reznor number 46 in its "100 People Who Are Changing America" list, concluding that he has "been more creative than anyone in embracing the post-CD era".

The album's initial release on the official Nine Inch Nails website suffered problems as the website was inundated with traffic, and was not fully operational until extra servers were added to handle the influx of downloads. A week after the album's release, the official Nine Inch Nails site reported over 780,000 purchase and download transactions, amassing over $1.6 million in sales. Pre-orders of the $300 "Ultra-Deluxe Limited Edition" sold out in less than 30 hours of its release.

The physical release of the album debuted at number 14 on the US <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> with 26,000 copies sold in its first week. The album also topped "Billboard"s <a href="Dance/Electronic%20Albums">Dance/Electronic Albums</a> chart. It had sold 149,000 copies in the United States by May 2013. Internationally, "Ghosts" peaked at number three in Canada, number 15 in Australia, number 26 in New Zealand, number 58 in Austria, and number 60 in the United Kingdom.

Included with the "Deluxe" and "Ultra-Deluxe" releases were two additional bonus tracks, accessible only by reconstructing them from multi-track files provided on the DVD. The second bonus track features musical elements and a similar song structure to "Demon Seed", track 10 from what would be the next Nine Inch Nails release, "<a href="The%20Slip%20%28album%29">The Slip</a>".

The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.

The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H. is a 1981 <a href="literary%20fiction">literary</a> and <a href="Philosophical%20fiction">philosophical</a> novella by <a href="George%20Steiner">George Steiner</a>. The story is about Jewish <a href="Nazi%20hunter">Nazi hunter</a>s who find a fictional <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a> (A.H.) alive in the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon jungle</a> thirty years after the end of <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII">World War II</a>. The book was controversial, particularly among reviewers and Jewish scholars, because the author allows Hitler to defend himself when he is put on trial in the jungle by his captors. There Hitler maintains that <a href="Israel">Israel</a> owes its existence to the <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> and that he is the "benefactor of the Jews".

The novella was first published in the United Kingdom in May 1981 as a <a href="Paperback%23Paperback%20originals">paperback original</a> by <a href="Faber%20and%20Faber">Faber and Faber</a>, and in the United States in hardcover in April 1982 by <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a>. Adapted for the theatre by British playwright <a href="Christopher%20Hampton">Christopher Hampton</a>, it was staged in London in 1982 and in <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a> a year later. The productions generated further controversy, resulting in public pickets and condemnation being levelled against Steiner.

A central theme of "The Portage" is the nature of language, and revolves around Steiner's lifelong work on the subject and his fascination in the power and terror of human speech. Other themes include the philosophical and moral analysis of history, justice, guilt and revenge. Steiner makes no attempt to explain Hitler, but rather enters into a dialogue with him.

Reaction to the book was mixed: in a review in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine, <a href="Otto%20Friedrich">Otto Friedrich</a> described it as "a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity", whereas <a href="John%20Leonard%20%28critic%29">John Leonard</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" called Hitler's speech at the end of the book "obscene", and said Steiner's decision to leave it unchallenged "makes me sick to my stomach." Similarly, many readers and theatre-goers were disturbed by Steiner's fictional Hitler, and the author admitted that his character had got the better of him. Despite the controversy, "The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H." was a 1983 finalist in the <a href="PEN/Faulkner%20Award%20for%20Fiction">PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction</a>.

From his base in <a href="Tel%20Aviv">Tel Aviv</a>, <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivor Emmanuel Lieber directs a group of Jewish <a href="Nazi%20hunter">Nazi hunter</a>s in search of <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>. Lieber believes that the former <a href="F%C3%BChrer">Führer</a> is still alive, and following rumours and hearsay, he tracks Hitler's movements through South America. After months of wading through swamps in the <a href="Amazon%20rainforest">Amazon jungle</a>, the search party finds the 90-year-old alive in a clearing. Lieber flies to San Cristóbal where he awaits the group's return with their captive. But getting the old man out of the jungle alive is more difficult than getting in, and their progress is further hampered by heavy thunderstorms.

Meanwhile, broken and incoherent radio messages between Lieber and the search party are intercepted by intelligence agents tracking their progress, and rumours begin to spread across the world of Hitler's capture. Debates flare up over his impending trial, where it will be held and under whose <a href="jurisdiction">jurisdiction</a>. Orosso is identified as the nearest <a href="Aerodrome">airfield</a> to the last known location of the search party, and aircraft begin arriving at the hitherto unknown town. But when the search party loses radio contact with Lieber, they must make a decision to either wait out the storms and deliver their captive to Lieber later, or <a href="Trial">try</a> Hitler in the jungle. They choose the latter, given that they would likely lose control of the situation if they attempted to transport their prisoner. Against Lieber's advice ("You must not let him speak ... his tongue is like no other") they prepare for a trial with a judge, prosecution and defence attorneys selected from the members of the search party. Teku, a local <a href="Indigenous%20peoples%20in%20Brazil">Indian</a> tracker, is asked to observe the trial as an independent witness.

The attention Hitler receives renews his strength, and when the trial begins, he brushes aside his "defence attorney" and begins a long speech in four parts in his own defence:


At the end of his speech, Teku, who "had not understood the words, only their meaning", is the first to react and jumps up shouting "Proven". But he is drowned out by the appearance of a helicopter over the clearing.


George Steiner, academic, philosopher, writer and <a href="literary%20criticism">literary critic</a> for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>" and "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", had written about the <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a> in some of his previous books, including "Anno Domini" (1964), "Language and Silence" (1967) and "<a href="In%20Bluebeard%27s%20Castle">In Bluebeard's Castle</a>" (1971). Many of the ideas Steiner expresses in "The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H." were drawn from these earlier works. Steiner told "New York Times" editor <a href="D.%20J.%20R.%20Bruckner">D. J. R. Bruckner</a> that this book arose out of his lifelong work on language. "Central to everything I am and believe and have written is my astonishment ... that you can use human speech both to bless, to love, to build, to forgive and also to torture, to hate, to destroy and to annihilate."

Steiner wrote "The Portage" in 1975 and 1976 in <a href="Geneva">Geneva</a>, Switzerland, and the 120-page work originally appeared in the Spring 1979 issue of the US <a href="literary%20magazine">literary magazine</a>, "<a href="The%20Kenyon%20Review">The Kenyon Review</a>". An abridged version was published in the Spring 1980 issue of "<a href="Granta">Granta</a>", the British literary magazine. Its first publication in book form, with minor revisions by Steiner, was in May 1981 by <a href="Faber%20and%20Faber">Faber and Faber</a> in the UK and, as requested by Steiner, it was a <a href="Paperback%23Paperback%20originals">paperback original</a>. The first US edition was published in hardcover in April 1982 by <a href="Simon%20%26amp%3B%20Schuster">Simon & Schuster</a>. "The Portage" has been translated into several languages, including French, German, Hebrew, Italian and Swedish.

Commenting on the controversy the book generated, Steiner admitted to literary journalist and critic <a href="Ron%20Rosenbaum">Ron Rosenbaum</a> (author of "<a href="Explaining%20Hitler">Explaining Hitler</a>") that he too was disturbed by it, adding that his fictional Hitler had got the better of him, "golem- or Frankenstein-like". He said that it felt like the book "wrote me". Steiner also pointed out that the novella is not only about his thoughts on the Holocaust, but also about the horrific events that took place in countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, El Salvador and Burundi: "My feeling is that one has to grapple with the abyss if one can." In his 1997 memoir, "Errata: An Examined Life", Steiner remarked that had he known what the response to "The Portage" and its stage interpretation would be, he would have made the novella "my foremost business".

The only work of fiction by Steiner to have been adapted for the stage, "The Portage" was reworked in 1982 by British playwright <a href="Christopher%20Hampton">Christopher Hampton</a>. It was staged in April 1982 at London's <a href="Mermaid%20Theatre">Mermaid Theatre</a> under the direction of <a href="John%20Dexter">John Dexter</a> with <a href="Alec%20McCowen">Alec McCowen</a> playing the part of Adolf Hitler. McCowen won the 1982 <a href="Evening%20Standard%20Theatre%20Awards">Evening Standard Theatre Award</a> for best actor for this performance. The production generated "a storm of controversy". In "Stage Nazis: The Politics and Aesthetics of Memory", Robert Skloot described the play as "a rarely articulated fantasy about the causes of genocide" that "test[s] the limits of personal tolerance". He wrote that Steiner was "intentionally provocative" in choosing Hitler for the search party to pursue, and Hampton exploited this by giving the former Führer 25 minutes to present his case. Skloot added that while Hitler's speech is "a hodgepodge of misinformation, mendacity and slander", its delivery is captivating.

In 1983 the production moved to the US where it played at the Hartford Stage Company in <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>, directed by <a href="Mark%20Lamos">Mark Lamos</a> and starring <a href="John%20Cullum">John Cullum</a> as Hitler. At this premiere, Cullum's 25-minute speech at the end of the play was described by <a href="Mel%20Gussow">Mel Gussow</a> in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" as "a Wagnerian intensity without resorting to histrionics" that "almost succeeds in that most difficult of tasks—humanizing Hitler". In "<a href="World%20Literature%20Today">World Literature Today</a>", Bettina L. Knapp wrote that the play presented theatre-goers with the dilemma: what would you do with Hitler were he to surface today? Skloot noted that while the "facts" in Steiner's work are pure fiction, the play confronts the audience with an event that cannot be resolved with traditional "logic, facticity and morality". Responding to theatre critics who objected to Hitler having the last word, Steiner said he wanted the audience to refute the former dictator's claims themselves.

"The Portage" generated considerable controversy because of its apparent "admiration for Hitler". The controversy grew further when the stage adaptation of the book ("too faithful", according to Steiner) was performed in the UK and the US.

Hitler's speech at the end of the book disturbed many readers and critics. Steiner not only lets Hitler justify his past, he allows him the (almost) last word before the outside world invades. The fact that Steiner is Jewish made this speech in particular even more contentious. One critic, while acknowledging that Steiner always saw Hitler as "the incarnation of unprecedented and unparalleled evil", felt that there was no clear distinction in the book between Steiner's own views and those of his fictional Hitler, even going so far as to accuse Steiner, who rejects <a href="Jewish%20political%20movements">Jewish nationalism</a> and is a critic of <a href="Israel">Israel</a>'s treatment of the <a href="Palestinians">Palestinians</a>, of anti-Semitism.

In contrast, a "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine article felt that Steiner's intention for the Hitler speech was to use it to explore his belief "that Hitler wielded language as an almost supernatural force". Steiner articulated this in Lieber's warning in the book that "there shall come a man [who] ... will know the grammar of hell and ... will know the sounds of madness and loathing and make them seem music." <a href="Menachem%20Z.%20Rosensaft">Menachem Z. Rosensaft</a>, chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish Survivors, said that "Nothing in ["The Portage"] was a trivialization of the Holocaust or a whitewash".

Rosenbaum remarked that as Hitler's trial in the book ended, so Steiner's trial began, with "manifold and stinging" accusations levelled against him, "from the artistic to the personal". The dramatisation of the novel and the subsequent stage performances escalated the criticism, and led to public pickets. By letting Hitler's "long, insidious, subversive, and disturbing speech" go unchallenged, Steiner was accused of "playing with fire". One of Steiner's most prominent critics, British Jewish scholar <a href="Hyam%20Maccoby">Hyam Maccoby</a> said:

In a world historically receptive to any anti-Semitic argument, however crude, to put in Hitler's mouth a powerful rationale for blaming the Jews, however ironically, was feeding the same fires that sent Jews up the chimneys of the death camps.

One of the biggest criticisms Steiner received was that he himself believed what his fictive Hitler said about the Jews. It was also thought that at the end of the London theatre production, the audience were applauding Hitler and not the play.

Steiner responded to criticism that Hitler's speech in the book is unchallenged by saying that it had been done before: for example <a href="Satan">Satan</a>'s speech in <a href="John%20Milton">Milton</a>'s "<a href="Paradise%20Lost">Paradise Lost</a>" (1667), and <a href="The%20Grand%20Inquisitor">The Grand Inquisitor</a>'s speech in <a href="Fyodor%20Dostoyevsky">Dostoyevsky</a>'s "<a href="The%20Brothers%20Karamazov">The Brothers Karamazov</a>" (1880). He also reminded the reader that Hitler's speech is balanced out earlier in the book by Lieber's long monologue on the horrors of the Holocaust. Finally, Steiner said that his Hitler (A.H.) is "a fictive figure", and that it is not he who has the last word, but Teku, the Indian tracker, who shouts "Proven". <a href="Dominick%20LaCapra">Dominick LaCapra</a> said that Teku's declaration is ambiguous, meaning either Hitler has proved his innocence or his guilt. Steiner explained this ambiguity by adding that Teku is the <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a> word used to indicate that "there are issues here beyond our wisdom to answer or decide."

Reaction to "The Portage" was mixed. <a href="Anthony%20Burgess">Anthony Burgess</a> in "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" called it "astonishing", <a href="Christopher%20Booker">Christopher Booker</a> of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" described it as a "powerful piece", and English author <a href="A.%20S.%20Byatt">A. S. Byatt</a> said it was a "masterpiece". In "<a href="Explaining%20Hitler">Explaining Hitler</a>" (1998), Rosenbaum called "The Portage" "A Frankenstein story", referring to Steiner's fictive Hitler having taken on a life of its own. Writing in "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine, <a href="Otto%20Friedrich">Otto Friedrich</a> described the book as "a philosophic fantasy of remarkable intensity", adding that by not refuting Hitler's speech, Steiner deviates from the horrors of traditional Holocaust literature and ends the book "on a note of bleak ambiguity".

<a href="Morris%20Dickstein">Morris Dickstein</a> of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" was more critical of the book, calling it "a misconceived and badly executed novel, a sideshow distraction from the serious business of thinking through the unspeakable horrors of the Nazi era." He described it as "wearisome", and "suffocate[d]" by too much "fine writing" ("<a href="belles-lettres">belles-lettres</a>"). He also complained that the characters are lifeless, and while they each have detailed histories, they are only "verbal figments" that do not separate them from one another. Finally Dickstein noted that because almost all the points of Hitler's speech are drawn from some of Steiner's earlier works, he "unwittingly creates sympathy for Hitler by making him old and pathetic yet also lucid and brilliant—at once absurdly harmless and unconvincingly dangerous."

In another review in "The New York Times" <a href="John%20Leonard%20%28critic%29">John Leonard</a> wrote that while the book has its strong points, "some wit, a catholic disdain, multiplicity of character and a South American swamp-life that terrifies", its weaknesses are that "the characters are really ideas, ... the symbols clash and there are too many echoes of better books by <a href="Franz%20Kafka">Kafka</a> and <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Proust</a>". But Leonard's biggest criticism of the book was Hitler's speech, which he called "obscene", and Steiner's decision to end the book at that point, which Leonard said "not only denies the power of art to arrange and transcend, but ... makes me sick to my stomach."

Writing in the American literary magazine "<a href="Salmagundi%20%28magazine%29">Salmagundi</a>", Alvin H. Rosenfeld called "The Portage" a "breakthrough work" that "astonishes". He was struck by the book's interplay between the landscape of swamp and jungle, and the "landscape of speech"—the former being "brilliantly registered" with its "immense feeling of physicality", and the latter, "even more dramatic" in the way it exposes "the dark underside of words" and how its use and misuse reveals the true nature of a person. He was particularly impressed by the depiction of Nazi hunter Emmanuel Lieber and his role as representative of the Jewish consciousness. Rosenfeld noted that while Holocaust literature often either soars to "expostulation and apostrophe", or sinks to "a dwindling sob of elegiac lament", Steiner's Lieber "mediates between these two extremes, ... simultaneously records and mourns, coldly enumerates yet carries an immense affect". What concerned the reviewer was the way Steiner used ideas from his earlier works, that he had put them "virtually verbatim" into Hitler's mouth, creating the impression that "Steiner's understanding of Hitler were identical with the latter's self-understanding". Rosenfeld also questioned why the book had to end with Hitler's speech. He said that Steiner's fictive Hitler plays "the devil's game of language subversion", making "madness [sound] like music", something the real Hitler had perfected. By stopping at this point, Rosenfeld felt that Steiner "succumb[s], rhetorically, to the seductive eloquence of negation", which undermines his own "high standards of moral intelligence". But overall Rosenfeld said "The Portage" "must be counted among the most vigorous attempts to portray the presence and meaning of Hitler", forcing us to confront him "in a way hardly seen before in fiction".

"The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H." was a finalist in the 1983 <a href="PEN/Faulkner%20Award%20for%20Fiction">PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction</a>.

A central theme of "The Portage" is the nature of language. Rosenbaum says that Steiner's "fascination and ... distrust of speech, the love and hate for the power and terror of language, has been at the very heart of [his] remarkable career as literary prodigy and prodigal." Steiner told Rosenbaum that "in the German language, Hitler drew on a kind of rhetorical power which, in a way that is perhaps a little bit peculiar to German, allies highly abstract concepts with political, physical violence in a most unusual way". Hitler's genius lay "not so much in the written word, but the embodied voice", which Steiner described as "mesmeric". Rosenbaum notes that Steiner describes Hitler as "a kind of medium for the evil genius of the German language itself" and that his language is "like '<a href="antimatter">antimatter</a>' to ordinary language".

Margaret Burton sees the language in the book as polarised between "a venue for truth" and "a source of destruction", with Lieber representing the former, and Hitler the latter. Bryan Cheyette considers that Steiner is not contrasting Lieber and Hitler, but is "portraying them as part of the same dialect", and that they reflect a dichotomy in Steiner himself. Alexander M. Sidorkin argues that Steiner's approach to Hitler was not to attempt to explain him, but rather to "enter ... into a dialogue" with him, a "dialogue with evil". Sidorkin suggests that Steiner had to "explore his own inner Hitler", his suppressed prejudices, to bring Hitler's speech to life.

Other themes in "The Portage" include the philosophical and moral analysis of history, justice, guilt and revenge. Having captured one of the world's greatest enemies, his Jewish captors are forced to examine their feelings on the situation they find themselves in. Hitler's historical significance features prominently in the book, and the recurring questions surrounding the meaning of Hitler, which Steiner makes no attempt to answer, surface periodically. Norwegian literary scholar <a href="Jakob%20Lothe">Jakob Lothe</a> felt that Steiner's attempts to dramatise these complex issues fail because his fiction "is too poor" for it to be effective.

Lightning Bar

Lightning Bar (1951–1960) was an <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse">American Quarter Horse</a> who <a href="Horse%20racing">raced</a> and subsequently became a <a href="horse%20breeding">breeding</a> stallion. He was bred by his lifelong owner Art Pollard of <a href="Sonoita%2C%20Arizona">Sonoita, Arizona</a>, and was the offspring of <a href="Three%20Bars">Three Bars</a>, a <a href="Thoroughbred">Thoroughbred</a>, and Della P, a Quarter Horse mare from Louisiana, then noted for the breeding of sprint horses. Lightning Bar raced ten times, achieving four victories and four other top three finishes. His racing career was cut short by illness after only one year, following which he spent two years as a show horse. As a breeding stallion he sired seven crops, or years, of <a href="foal">foal</a>s, among whom <a href="Doc%20Bar">Doc Bar</a> was the best known. In 1960 Lightning Bar died of an intestinal infection at the age of nine. He was inducted into the <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association">American Quarter Horse Association</a>'s (AQHA) <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hall of Fame</a> in 2008.

<a href="Glossary%20of%20equestrian%20terms%23F">Foaled</a>, or born, in 1951, Lightning Bar was bred to be a race horse, but injuries and bouts of illnesses kept him from racing past the age of two. His breeder, Art Pollard, owned him for the horse's entire life. Lightning Bar was sired by Three Bars, a Thoroughbred <a href="stallion">stallion</a> later inducted into the AQHA Hall of Fame. His dam was Della P, a daughter of the Thoroughbred stallion Doc Horn. His <a href="Glossary%20of%20equestrian%20terms%23S">second dam</a>, or maternal grandmother, was a mare who was never given a name, sired by Old D. J. Art Pollard purchased Della P from "Dink" Parker for $1,750 (approximately $ as of 2019) in the late 1940s. Della P was bred in Louisiana, a leader in breeding short distance racehorses between 1900 and 1940, and was taken to Arizona by Parker.

When Lightning Bar was about five days old Pollard was afraid that he had leg problems and was <a href="Equine%20conformation%23Conformation%20of%20the%20front%20and%20hind%20legs">buck-kneed</a>, and considered putting the <a href="colt%20%28horse%29">colt</a> to sleep. He sought Parker's advice, and as Pollard later related the story, "Dink just looked at me and shook his head. 'Ain't you ever gonna learn nothing? That colt's just what you're looking for.' " When mature, the <a href="Sorrel%20%28horse%29">sorrel</a>-colored Lightning Bar stood tall and weighed about .

Lightning Bar started on the racetrack ten times, winning four races, coming in second three times, and third once. Among those finishes, he ran second and third in two <a href="stakes%20race">stakes race</a>s, a type of race for higher quality horses with a higher payout. His total earnings on the track were $1,491 (approximately $ as of 2019), and his highest <a href="speed%20index">speed index</a>, or comparative rating of his speed, was AAA, the highest achievable at the time. Lightning Bar raced for only one year, as he suffered from bouts of <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>, <a href="strangles">strangles</a>, and <a href="Lameness%20%28equine%29">leg injuries</a>. He equalled one track record for two-year-olds at the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20County%20Fair">Los Angeles County Fair</a> race meeting in <a href="Pomona%2C%20California">Pomona, California</a>, running in 17.2 seconds.

After his racing career Lightning Bar went on to become a <a href="Horse%20show">show horse</a>, earning 18 open <a href="halter%20%28horse%20show%29">halter</a> points with the AQHA, and an <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Horse%20shows%20and%20rodeos">AQHA Champion</a> award in 1955. He won one grand championship and one reserve championship in halter classes at recognized AQHA shows.

The first year Lightning Bar stood as a breeding stallion his <a href="stud%20fee">stud fee</a>, the amount charged to breed a mare to him, was $250 (approximately $ as of 2019) but only nine <a href="mare">mare</a>s were bred to him. The next year, he bred 11 mares, but in 1956, he bred 102 mares at $500 (approximately $ as of 2019) each. One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting one of his ranch hands take the horse to a local jackpot <a href="Team%20Roping">roping</a>. Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish grin on his face. I asked him how the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used. He replied, 'The stud.' "

Pollard said of Lightning Bar that "I always had to be careful about the kind of latch I used on a gate with that horse. He could figure them out faster than I could. He would open a gate, and go for a stroll." Lightning Bar sired 148 foals in his eight breeding seasons, and 118 of those foals went on to either race or show careers. Of his foals, 108 started races, and 77 won, earning a total of $476,949. The most successful of his foals, Lightning Belle, earned $60,134 (approximately $ as of 2019).

Five of Lightning Bar's foals earned AQHA Championships: Cactus Comet, Crash Bang, Lightning Rey, Pana Bar and Relampago Bar; Lightning Rey earned a Supreme Championship. In addition, Lightning Bar's offspring earned $1,163.32 in <a href="National%20Cutting%20Horse%20Association">National Cutting Horse Association</a> sanctioned <a href="Cutting%20%28sport%29">cattle cutting</a> competitions, and four earned a <a href="American%20Quarter%20Horse%20Association%23Horse%20shows%20and%20rodeos">Superior Halter Horse</a> title from the AQHA.

Lightning Bar died in June 1960 from <a href="colitis-X">colitis-X</a>, a disease of unknown origin that can kill rapidly and without warning. It infected many of Pollard's horses; of those affected only three survived. Heartbroken, Pollard sold his remaining stock and did not return to the Quarter Horse business for 15 years. He said later that "it was a nightmare when they were wiped out. Even now, we can still feel the sadness of losing those horses." Another time, Pollard remarked that "Someone once said that a man deserves one good woman and one good dog in his lifetime. To that quip I would add one good horse. I certainly had one in Lightning Bar."

Lightning Bar was inducted into the AQHA's American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame in 2008. His most famous son was <a href="Doc%20Bar">Doc Bar</a>, who was also inducted into the Hall of Fame. Lightning Bar's daughter Glamour Bars was the dam of <a href="Impressive%20%28horse%29">Impressive</a>, who became well known as one of the leading sires of halter horses. Two stakes races were run in Lightning Bar's memory, the first at <a href="Los%20Alamitos%20Race%20Course">Los Alamitos Race track</a> in California for one year in 1961. The second ran from 1962 to 1966 at <a href="Ruidoso%20Downs">Ruidoso Downs</a> in New Mexico.

Otto Julius Zobel

Otto Julius Zobel (October 20, 1887 – January 1970) was an electrical engineer who worked for the <a href="American%20Telephone%20%26amp%3B%20Telegraph">American Telephone & Telegraph Company (AT&T)</a> in the early part of the 20th century. Zobel's work on filter design was revolutionary and led, in conjunction with the work of <a href="John%20R.%20Carson">John R. Carson</a>, to significant commercial advances for AT&T in the field of <a href="frequency%20division%20multiplex">frequency division multiplex</a> (FDM) telephone transmissions.

Although much of Zobel's work has been superseded by more modern filter designs, it remains the basis of filter theory and his papers are still referenced today. Zobel invented the <a href="m-derived%20filter">m-derived filter</a>
and the <a href="Zobel%20network">constant-resistance filter</a>, which remains in use.

Zobel and Carson helped to establish the nature of noise in electric circuits, concluding that—contrary to mainstream belief—it is not even theoretically possible to filter out noise entirely and that noise will always be a limiting factor in what is possible to transmit. Thus, they anticipated the later work of <a href="Claude%20Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, who showed how the theoretical information rate of a channel is related to the noise of the channel.
Otto Julius Zobel was born on October 20, 1887 in <a href="Ripon%2C%20Wisconsin">Ripon, Wisconsin</a>. He first studied at <a href="Ripon%20College%20%28Wisconsin%29">Ripon College</a>, where he received his BA in 1909 with a thesis on "Theoretical and experimental treatment of electrical condensers". He later received a Distinguished Alumnus Award from Ripon. He then went to the University of Wisconsin and graduated with an MA in physics in 1910. Zobel stayed at the University of Wisconsin as a physics instructor from 1910 to 1915, and graduated with his PhD in 1914; his dissertation concerned "Thermal Conduction and Radiation". This followed his 1913 co-authoring of a book on the subject of <a href="Geophysics">geophysical</a> <a href="thermodynamics">thermodynamics</a>. From 1915 to 1916 he taught physics at the University of Minnesota. Having moved to <a href="Maplewood%2C%20New%20Jersey">Maplewood, New Jersey</a>, he joined AT&T in 1916, where he worked on transmission techniques. In 1926, still with the company, he moved to New York and in 1934, he transferred to Bell Telephone Laboratories (<a href="Bell%20Labs">Bell Labs</a>), the research organisation created jointly by AT&T and <a href="Western%20Electric">Western Electric</a> a few years earlier. He retired from Bell Telephone in 1952.

The last of his prolific list of patents occurred for Bell Labs in the 1950s, by which time he was residing in <a href="Morristown%2C%20New%20Jersey">Morristown, New Jersey</a>. He died there of a heart attack in January 1970.

Zobel's early work on heat conduction was not pursued in his later career. There are, however, some interesting connections. <a href="Lord%20Kelvin">Lord Kelvin</a> in his early work on the transmission line derived the properties of the electric line by analogy with heat conduction. This is based on <a href="Conduction%20%28heat%29%23Fourier%27s%20law">Fourier's law</a> and the <a href="Heat%20equation">Fourier conduction equation</a>. Ingersoll and Zobel describe the work of Kelvin and Fourier in their book and Kelvin's approach to the representation of <a href="propagation%20constant">transmission function</a>s would consequently have been very familiar to Zobel. It is therefore no surprise that in Zobel's paper on the electric wave filter a very similar representation is found for the transmission function of filters.

Solutions to the Fourier equation can be provided by <a href="Fourier%20series">Fourier series</a>. Ingersoll and Zobel state that in many cases the calculation involved makes the solution "well-nigh impossible" by analytical means. With modern technology such a calculation is trivially easy, but Ingersoll and Zobel recommend the use of harmonic analysers, which are the mechanical counterpart of today's <a href="spectrum%20analyser">spectrum analyser</a>s. These machines add together mechanical oscillations of various frequencies, phases and amplitudes by combining them through a set of pulleys or springs; one for each oscillator. The reverse process is also possible, driving the machine with the function and measuring the Fourier components as output.

After the work of <a href="John%20R.%20Carson">John R. Carson</a> in 1915 it became clear that <a href="multiplexed">multiplexed</a> telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of <a href="single%20sideband">single sideband</a> suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic <a href="amplitude%20modulation">amplitude modulation</a> (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the <a href="Bandwidth%20%28signal%20processing%29">bandwidth</a> and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the <a href="frequency%20domain">frequency domain</a> consists of a <a href="Carrier%20wave">carrier</a> and two <a href="sidebands">sidebands</a>. The <a href="carrier%20wave">carrier wave</a> in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information transmission point of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple <a href="tuned%20circuit">tuned circuit</a>s. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum <a href="Selectivity%20%28electronic%29">rejection</a> of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent <a href="crosstalk">crosstalk</a>. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.

<a href="George%20A.%20Campbell">George A. Campbell</a> and Zobel worked on this problem of extracting a single sideband from an amplitude-modulated composite wave for use in <a href="multiplexing">multiplexing</a> telephone channels and the related problem of extracting (de-multiplexing) the signal at the far end of the transmission.

Initially, the <a href="baseband">baseband</a> pass range used was 200 Hz to 2500 Hz but later the <a href="International%20Telecommunication%20Union">International Telecommunication Union</a> set a standard of 300 Hz to 3.4 kHz with 4 kHz spacing. Thus the filtering was required to go from fully pass to fully stop in the space of 900 Hz. This standard in telephony is still in use today and had remained widespread until it began to be supplanted by digital techniques from the 1980s onwards.

Campbell had previously utilised the <a href="Heaviside%20condition">condition</a> discovered in the work of <a href="Oliver%20Heaviside">Oliver Heaviside</a> for lossless transmission to improve the frequency response of transmission lines using <a href="lumped%20component">lumped component</a> inductors (<a href="loading%20coils">loading coils</a>). When Campbell started investigating electric wave filter design from 1910, this previous work naturally led him to filters using <a href="ladder%20network">ladder network</a> topology using capacitors and inductors. <a href="Low-pass%20filter">Low-pass</a>, <a href="high-pass">high-pass</a> and <a href="band-pass">band-pass</a> filters were designed. Sharper <a href="Cutoff%20frequency">cut-offs</a> and higher <a href="stop-band">stop-band</a> rejection to any arbitrary design specification could be achieved merely by increasing the length of the ladder. The filter designs used by Campbell were described by Zobel as <a href="constant%20k%20filters">constant k filters</a> although this was not a term used by Campbell himself.

After Zobel arrived at the Engineering Department of AT&T he used his mathematical skills to further improve the design of electric wave filters. Carson and Zobel developed the mathematical method of analyzing the behavior of filters now known as the <a href="Image%20impedance">image</a> method whereby the impedance and transmission parameters of each section are calculated as if it is part of an infinite chain of identical sections.

Zobel invented the <a href="M-derived%20filter">m-derived (or m-type) filter</a> section in 1920, the distinguishing feature of this design being a <a href="Pole%20%28complex%20analysis%29">pole</a> of attenuation close to the filter <a href="cut-off%20frequency">cut-off frequency</a>. The result of this design is a filter response which falls very rapidly past the cut-off frequency. To use a well known quaint engineer's expression it "goes off like the side of a house". A fast transition between <a href="pass-band">pass-band</a> and <a href="stop-band">stop-band</a> was one of the primary requirements for cramming as many telephone channels as possible into one cable.

One disadvantage of the m-type section was that at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response of the filter started to increase again, reaching a peak somewhere in the stop-band and then falling again. Zobel overcame this problem by designing hybrid filters using a mixture of constant k and m-type sections. This gave Zobel the advantages of both: the fast transition of the m-type and good stop-band rejection of the constant k.

By 1921 Zobel had further perfected his composite filter designs. He was now using, in addition, m-type half sections at the ends of his composite filters to improve the impedance matching of the filter to the source and the load, a technique in which he held a patent. The difficulty that he was trying to overcome was that the <a href="image%20impedance">image impedance</a> techniques being used to design filter sections only gave the mathematically predicted response if they were terminated in their respective image impedances. Technically, this was easy to do within the filter as it could always be arranged that adjacent filter sections had matching image impedances (one of the characteristics of m-type sections is that one side or the other of the m-type section will have an image impedance identical to the equivalent constant k section). However, the terminating impedances are a different story. These are normally required to be resistive but the image impedance will be complex. Even worse, it is not even mathematically possible to construct a filter image impedance out of discrete components. The result of impedance mismatch is reflections and a degraded filter performance. Zobel found that a value of m=0.6 for the end half sections, while not mathematically exact, gave a good match to resistive terminations in the pass-band.

Around 1923, Zobel's filter designs were reaching the peak of their complexity. He now had a filter section to which he had doubly applied the m-derivation process resulting in filter sections which he called the mm'-type. This had all the advantages of the previous m-type, but more so. An even faster transition into the stop-band and an even more constant characteristic impedance in the pass-band. At the same time one side would match into the old m-type, just as the m-type could match into the <a href="constant%20k%20filter">k-type</a>. Because there were now two arbitrary parameters (m and m') that the filter designer could adjust, much better end matching half-sections could be designed. A composite filter using these sections would have been the very best that could have been achieved at that time. However, the mm'-type sections never became as widespread and well known as the m-type sections, possibly because their greater complexity has deterred designers. They would have been inconvenient to implement with microwave technology and the increased count of components, especially wound components, made them more expensive to implement with <a href="Passivity%20%28engineering%29%23Passive%20filter">conventional LC technology</a>. Certainly, it is hard to find a textbook from any period which covers their design.

Zobel directed much of his effort in the 1920s to constructing networks which could simulate transmission lines. These networks were derived from filter sections, which themselves had been derived from transmission line theory and the filters were used on transmission line signals. In turn, these artificial lines were used to develop and test better filter sections.
Zobel used a design technique based on his theoretical discovery that the impedance looking into the end of a filter chain was practically the same (within the limits of component tolerances) as the theoretical impedance of an infinite chain after only a small number of sections had been added to the chain. These "image" impedances have a mathematical characterization impossible to construct simply out of discrete components, and can only ever be approximated. Zobel found that using these impedances constructed out of small filter chains as components in a greater network allowed him to build realistic line simulators. These were not in any sense intended as practical filters in the field, but rather the intention was to construct good controllable line simulators without having the inconvenience of miles of cable to contend with.

Zobel invented several filters whose defining characteristic was a <a href="constant-resistance%20network">constant resistance</a> as the input impedance. The resistance remained constant through the pass band and the stop band. With these designs Zobel had completely solved the impedance matching problem. The main application of these sections has been not so much for filtering out unwanted frequencies, the k-type and m-type filters remained best for this, but rather to equalize the response in the pass band to a flat response.

Perhaps one of Zobel's most fascinating inventions is the <a href="Lattice%20phase%20equaliser">lattice filter</a> section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, yet it is constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.

A common theme throughout Zobel's work is the issue of impedance matching. The obvious approach to filter design is to design directly for the attenuation characteristics desired. With modern computing power, a brute force approach is possible and easy, simply incrementally adjusting each component while recalculating in an iterative process until the desired response is achieved. However, Zobel developed a more indirect line of attack. He realized very early on that mismatched impedances inevitably meant reflections, and reflections meant a loss of signal. Improving the impedance match, conversely, would automatically improve a filter's pass-band response.

This impedance matching approach not only led to better filters but the techniques developed could be used to construct circuits whose sole purpose was to match together two disparate impedances. Zobel continued to invent impedance matching networks throughout his career. During <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> he moved on to <a href="waveguide%20filter">waveguide filter</a>s for use in the newly developed <a href="radar">radar</a> technology. Little was published during the war for obvious reasons but towards the end with Bell Labs in the 1950s, Zobel designs for sections to match physically different waveguide sizes appear. However, the circuit noted above which still bears Zobel's name today, the constant-resistance network, can be viewed as an impedance matching circuit and remains Zobel's finest achievement in this regard.

The name of Zobel is, perhaps, most well known with regard to impedance compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to this is where he speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the <a href="hybrid%20transformer">hybrid transformer</a> which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a <a href="phantom%20circuit">phantom circuit</a>.

While Carson led the way theoretically, Zobel was involved in the design of filters for the purpose of noise reduction on transmission systems.

At the beginning of the 1920s and through to the 1930s, the thinking on noise was dominated by the radio engineers' concern with external <a href="Static%20%28radio%29">static</a>. In modern terminology, this would include random (<a href="thermal%20noise">thermal</a> and <a href="shot%20noise">shot</a>) noise but those concepts were relatively unknown and little understood at the time despite an early paper by <a href="Walter%20H.%20Schottky">Schottky</a> in 1918 on shot noise. To the radio engineers of the time, static meant externally generated interference. The line of attack against noise from the radio engineers included developing <a href="directional%20antenna">directional antenna</a>e and moving to higher frequencies where the problem was known not to be so severe.

For telephone engineers, what was then called "fluctuating noise", and would now be described as random noise, i.e. shot and thermal noise, was much more noticeable than with early radio systems. Carson broadened the radio engineers' concept of signal-to-static ratio to a more general <a href="signal-to-noise%20ratio">signal-to-noise ratio</a> and introduced a figure of merit for noise.

The radio engineers' preoccupation with static and the techniques being used to reduce it led to the idea that noise could be totally eliminated by, in some way, compensating for it or canceling it out. The culmination of this viewpoint was expressed in a 1928 paper by <a href="Edwin%20Armstrong">Edwin Armstrong</a>. This led to a famous retort by Carson in a subsequent paper, "Noise, like the poor, will always be with us". Armstrong was technically in the wrong in this exchange, but in 1933, ironically and paradoxically, went on to invent wide-band <a href="FM%20broadcasting">FM</a> which enormously improved the noise performance of radio by "increasing" the bandwidth.

Carson and Zobel in 1923 had conclusively shown that filtering cannot remove noise to the same degree as, say, interference from another station could be removed. To do this they had analyzed random noise in the frequency domain and postulated that it contains all frequencies in its spectrum. This was the first use of <a href="Fourier%20analysis">Fourier analysis</a> to describe random noise and hence described it in terms of a spread of frequencies. Also first published in this paper was the concept of what we would now call <a href="White%20noise">band-limited white noise</a>. For Zobel this meant that characteristics of the receiving filter completely determine the figure of merit in the presence of white noise and that the filter design was key to achieving the optimum noise performance.

Although this work by Carson and Zobel was very early, it was not universally accepted that noise could be analyzed in the frequency domain in this way. For this reason, the aforementioned exchange between Carson and Armstrong was still possible years later. The precise mathematical relationship between noise power and bandwidth for random noise was finally determined by <a href="Harry%20Nyquist">Harry Nyquist</a> in 1928 thus giving a theoretical limit to what could be achieved by filtering.

This work on noise produced the concept, and led Zobel to pursue the design, of <a href="matched%20filter">matched filter</a>s. In this context matched means that the filter is chosen to match the signal's characteristics in order to admit all of the available signal without admitting any noise that could have been excluded. The underlying insight is that admitting as much signal as is available without admitting any noise that could be excluded will maximize the signal to noise ratio. When the signal to noise ratio is maximized, the noise performance of the equipment is optimal. This conclusion was the culmination of theoretical research into removing noise by the application of <a href="linear%20filters">linear filters</a>. This became important in the development of radar during the Second World War in which Zobel played a part.

Zobel's work has recently found an application in research into <a href="genetic%20programming">genetic programming</a>. The purpose of this research is to attempt to demonstrate that the results obtained from genetic programming are comparable to human achievements. Two of the measures that are used to determine whether a genetic programming result is human-competitive are:

One such problem set as a task for a genetic program was to design a <a href="Audio%20crossover">crossover filter</a> for <a href="woofer">woofer</a> and <a href="tweeter">tweeter</a> loudspeakers. The output design was identical in <a href="Electronic%20filter%20topology">topology</a> to a design found in a patent of Zobel's for a filter to separate multiplexed low and high frequencies on a transmission line. This was judged to be human-comparable, not only because of the patent, but also because the high-pass and low-pass sections were "<a href="Decomposition%20%28computer%20science%29">decomposed</a>" as in Zobel's design, but not specifically required to be so in the programs parameters. Whether or not Zobel's filter design would be good for a <a href="hi-fi">hi-fi</a> system is another question. The design does not actually cross over, but rather, there is a gap between the two pass-bands where the signal is not transmitted to either output. Essential for multiplexing, but not so desirable for sound reproduction.

A later genetic programming experiment produced a filter design which consisted of a chain of constant k sections terminated in an m-type half section. This was also determined to have been a design patented by Zobel.

2003 Insight Bowl

The 2003 Insight Bowl was a post-season American <a href="college%20football">college football</a> <a href="bowl%20game">bowl game</a> between the <a href="2003%20Virginia%20Tech%20Hokies%20football%20team">Virginia Tech Hokies</a> and the <a href="2003%20California%20Golden%20Bears%20football%20team">California Golden Bears</a> at <a href="Bank%20One%20Ballpark">Bank One Ballpark</a> in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>, on December 26, 2003. The game was the final contest of the <a href="2003%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2003 NCAA Division I-A football season</a> for both teams, and ended in a 52–49 victory for California. Cal and Virginia Tech combined for 101 points; only the <a href="2001%20GMAC%20Bowl">2001 GMAC Bowl</a> saw more points scored by two teams in a bowl game without <a href="Overtime%20%28sports%29%23American%20and%20Canadian%20football">overtime</a>.

During the <a href="2003%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2003 college football season</a>, Virginia Tech accumulated an 8–4 regular-season record that included four losses in the Hokies' final six regular-season games. As the third-place team in the <a href="Big%20East%20Conference%20%281979%E2%80%932013%29">Big East Conference</a>, Tech accepted a bid to the 2003 <a href="Insight%20Bowl">Insight Bowl</a>. Facing the Hokies were the <a href="California%20Golden%20Bears%20football">California Golden Bears</a>, who went 7–6 during the regular season, tying for third place in the <a href="Pacific-10%20Conference">Pacific-10</a> (Pac-10).

The 2003 Insight Bowl <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kicked off</a> at 8:30 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> on December 26, 2003. From the beginning of the game, it was a quick-paced, high-scoring contest. In the first quarter, Virginia Tech jumped out to a 21–7 lead courtesy of the Tech passing game, which was coordinated by quarterback <a href="Bryan%20Randall">Bryan Randall</a>, who threw four <a href="touchdown">touchdown</a>s during the game. In the second quarter, California recovered from its 14-point first-quarter deficit by scoring two touchdowns. Tech, meanwhile, scored another, and took a 28–21 lead into <a href="halftime">halftime</a>.

The offensive onslaught continued in the second half, though it was California who took the advantage at first. Bolstered by an improved defensive effort that held the Hokies scoreless throughout the third quarter, California and quarterback <a href="Aaron%20Rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a> scored 21 unanswered points to take a 42–28 lead into the fourth quarter. In that quarter, the Hokies clawed back into competition. Tech scored a touchdown to begin the quarter, but Cal answered with one of its own, making the score 49–35. The Hokies evened the score at 49–49 after an 80-yard touchdown drive that took less than two minutes and a <a href="punt%20return">punt return</a> by <a href="DeAngelo%20Hall">DeAngelo Hall</a> for a touchdown. The post-score Tech <a href="Kickoff%20%28American%20football%29">kickoff</a> went out of bounds, giving the Bears possession at their 35-yard line. With time running out, Cal began to drive for a game-winning score. Cal needed just seven plays to advance 47 yards and set up a <a href="Field%20goal%20%28American%20football%29">field goal</a> attempt. As time expired, kicker <a href="Tyler%20Fredrickson">Tyler Fredrickson</a> kicked a 35-yard field goal to give California the 52–49 win.

In 2003, the Insight Bowl contracted with the Big East conference and Pacific-10 conference to select teams for participation in its annual game. Big East champion <a href="Miami%20Hurricanes%20football">Miami</a> was awarded an automatic <a href="Bowl%20Championship%20Series">Bowl Championship Series</a> berth, and second-place <a href="Pittsburgh%20Panthers%20football">Pittsburgh</a> accepted a bid to the <a href="Continental%20Tire%20Bowl">Continental Tire Bowl</a> in <a href="Charlotte%2C%20North%20Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a>. Continental Tire Bowl officials considered inviting Virginia Tech to participate in the game, but were required to invite <a href="Virginia%20Cavaliers%20football">Virginia</a> due to the Continental Tire Bowl's contract with the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a>. Rather than selecting two teams that faced each other in the final game of the regular season, Continental Bowl officials chose another team. The other possibility for the Hokies was the <a href="Fight%20Hunger%20Bowl">San Francisco Bowl</a>, whose managers also held a contract with the Big East, but because Tech played in <a href="2002%20San%20Francisco%20Bowl">the previous year's San Francisco Bowl</a>, the bowl's organizing committee decided against a second invitation.

California's route to the Insight Bowl was less roundabout. In the Pac-10, first-place <a href="USC%20Trojans%20football">Southern California</a> was awarded the conference's Bowl Championship Series bid. Second-place <a href="Washington%20State%20Cougars%20football">Washington State</a> was selected by the <a href="Holiday%20Bowl">Holiday Bowl</a>, and <a href="Oregon%20Ducks%20football">Oregon</a>, tied for third place with California, received a bid to the <a href="Sun%20Bowl">Sun Bowl</a>. Oregon had a better overall record than California and also won the teams' head-to-head matchup.

Virginia Tech entered the <a href="2003%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2003 college football season</a> having gone 10–4 the previous season, including a season-ending victory over <a href="Air%20Force%20Falcons%20football">Air Force</a> in the <a href="2002%20San%20Francisco%20Bowl">inaugural San Francisco Bowl</a>. During the offseason, the Hokies were extended an invitation to join the <a href="Atlantic%20Coast%20Conference">Atlantic Coast Conference</a> and accepted, making the 2003 season their final year in the Big East. In the annual preseason poll of reporters covering Big East football, Virginia Tech was picked to finish third in the conference, behind the previous year's champion, Miami, and Pittsburgh.

Virginia Tech's first game of the season was at home against <a href="UCF%20Knights%20football">Central Florida</a> on August 31. In a game that saw the debut of quarterback <a href="Marcus%20Vick">Marcus Vick</a>, brother of former star Hokie <a href="Michael%20Vick">Michael Vick</a>, 10th-ranked Virginia Tech pulled out to an early lead before Central Florida fought back in the second half. Tech recovered, however, and won the game, 48–29. Virginia Tech followed the victory with five others. On October 11, a fourth-ranked Hokie squad easily won against <a href="Syracuse%20Orange%20football">Syracuse University</a>, 51–7, giving Virginia Tech a 6–0 record.

In its seventh game, Tech suffered its first loss. Traveling to <a href="Morgantown%2C%20West%20Virginia">Morgantown, West Virginia</a>, home of <a href="West%20Virginia%20Mountaineers%20football">West Virginia University</a>, the third-ranked Hokies lost 28–7 to the No. 23 Mountaineers. The loss was Tech's worst since November 2001, and knocked the previously undefeated Hokies out of contention for the national championship. The Hokies returned home to face another high-ranking opponent, No. 2 Miami. Recovering from the loss against West Virginia, the Hokies delivered one of the highest-profile wins in school history, defeating the second-ranked Hurricanes 31–7. The game ended a 39-game regular-season winning streak by Miami and was Tech's first victory over a top-eight team in 34 games.

Tech's fortunes declined dramatically following the victory over Miami. The week after that win, Tech lost 31–28 to Pittsburgh, then escaped with a one-point win in overtime against <a href="Temple%20Owls%20football">Temple University</a>, which had just one win that season. Tech's win against Temple was its last in the regular season. The Hokies lost their final two regular-season games, dropping their overall record to 8–4. To some Virginia Tech fans, the Insight Bowl invitation accepted on December 1 was a disappointment after a season that began with hopes of participation in the national championship game.

The California Golden Bears earned a 7–5 record in 2002, a year that culminated with a 30–7 victory over traditional rival <a href="Stanford%20Cardinal%20football">Stanford</a> in the <a href="Big%20Game%20%28football%29">Big Game</a>. It was California's first winning season since <a href="1993%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">1993</a>, and came on the heels of a 1–10 season in <a href="2001%20NCAA%20Division%20I-A%20football%20season">2001</a>. New head coach <a href="Jeff%20Tedford">Jeff Tedford</a> was praised for turning the program around so quickly, and expectations were high heading into the 2003 season. Tedford was awarded a new five-year contract in the offseason, and in the annual preseason poll of media covering the Pac-10 conference, Cal was picked to finish eighth in the 10-team organization.

In the Bears' first game of the season, California traveled to <a href="Arrowhead%20Stadium">Arrowhead Stadium</a> in <a href="Kansas%20City%2C%20Missouri">Kansas City, Missouri</a>, to face No. 10 <a href="2003%20Kansas%20State%20Wildcats%20football%20team">Kansas State</a> for the 2003 <a href="BCA%20Classic">BCA Classic</a>. There, California lost 42–28 in the season opener for both teams. California recovered from the loss in its next game, outscoring the visiting Southern Miss Golden Eagles 34–2. Despite the Bears' success against Southern Miss, they struggled in their next two games, losing to both Colorado State and Utah. Traveling to the Midwest to face Big 10 opponent Illinois, California debuted a new quarterback: <a href="Aaron%20Rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a>. Rodgers had success late in California's game against Utah, but did not earn the win. Against Illinois, however, he orchestrated a California offense that emerged victorious, 31–24.

The week after the Illinois game, California faced its toughest opponent of the season: third-ranked Southern California. The USC Trojans were undefeated heading into their game against the Bears and on an 11-game winning streak, but California maintained a lead throughout the game. During the fourth quarter, however, USC rallied to tie California and force overtime, then second and third overtimes when the score remained tied. At the end of the third overtime, California kicker Tyler Fredrickson's 38-yard field goal kick was successful, and the Bears earned a 34–31 victory. It was California's first home victory over a top five team since 1975, and turned out to be USC's only loss of the season. California lost its next two games, but then won four of its final five, completing the regular season with a record of 7–6 and earning a spot in the Insight Bowl.

California head coach Jeff Tedford said, "Playing in a bowl game was one of our primary goals this year, so today's announcement represents a milestone for this team and the Cal football program." The Insight Bowl would be California's first bowl game appearance since 1996.

In the weeks leading up to the game, media coverage focused on Virginia Tech's lack of motivation heading into the game. The Hokies were ranked among the top five teams in the country earlier in the season, and had higher expectations than the Insight Bowl, a factor some commentators speculated could cause a distraction. The game was Virginia Tech's first in the state of Arizona, and its first against a Pac-10 team. California played in the <a href="1990%20Copper%20Bowl">1990 Copper Bowl</a>, the name of the Insight Bowl before a name change in the mid-1990s.

Virginia Tech running back Kevin Jones drew media attention one day after Virginia Tech's selection for the Insight Bowl by announcing that he would be foregoing his final year of school in favor of entering the <a href="NFL%20Draft">NFL Draft</a>. Jones was an <a href="All-America">All-America</a> selection and broke a Virginia Tech single-season record by rushing for 1,494 yards during the regular season. Speculation immediately turned to the fact that Jones could be the top running back taken in that year's draft.

Assisting Jones' success was a strong offensive line, led by Associated Press first-team All-America <a href="Center%20%28American%20football%29">center</a> <a href="Jake%20Grove">Jake Grove</a>. Grove was the only first-team All-America player for the Hokies that season and earned the <a href="Dave%20Rimington%20Trophy">Dave Rimington Trophy</a>, given annually to the best college <a href="Center%20%28American%20football%29">center</a> in the United States. As with Jones, Grove announced his intention to enter the NFL Draft following the Insight Bowl.

Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall also benefited from the Hokies' strong offensive line. Randall finished the regular season having passed for 1,598 yards and 11 touchdowns. He also rushed for 412 yards on the ground, and was the Hokies' second-leading rusher. Wide receiver <a href="Ernest%20Wilford">Ernest Wilford</a> was the Hokies' leading receiver, finishing the regular season with 776 receiving yards and three touchdowns.

Running back Adimchinobe Echemandu was named California's regular-season <a href="most%20valuable%20player">most valuable player</a> by ESPN.com writer Ted Miller, who pointed to Echemandu's 1,161 yards and 12 touchdowns on the ground despite missing one game and most of another due to injury. He was picked ahead of Bears quarterback <a href="Aaron%20Rodgers">Aaron Rodgers</a>, who finished the season with 2,509 passing yards and 17 touchdowns despite starting the season as the team's backup player in that position. He outplayed original starting quarterback Reggie Robertson and replaced him during most of the second half of the season.
Rodgers' favorite passing target was wide receiver Geoff McArthur, who was the Bears' leading receiver during the regular season, catching 85 passes for a school-record 1,504 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns. In one of the Bears' final practices before the Insight Bowl, however, McArthur fractured his right forearm and was unable to play. McArthur recorded the third-highest receiving total for a Pac-10 player and had the second-highest average receiving yards per game in the country during the regular season. He set California single-game records for receiving yards and receptions. Junior receiver Chase Lyman was picked to start the Insight Bowl in McArthur's place. Lyman caught just seven passes for 107 yards during the season.

During practice before the game, California kicker Tyler Fredrickson practiced kicking the ball high to avoid what was expected to be a difficult Virginia Tech kick-blocking attack. During the regular season, Fredrickson had five kicks blocked and successfully converted just 14 of 29 field goal attempts. Virginia Tech, meanwhile, blocked 102 kicks in the 200 games previous to the Insight Bowl.

Virginia Tech's defense, which performed well in the beginning of the season and against No. 3 Miami, faltered in the final games of the regular season, allowing 123 points and over 1,800 yards to opponents' offenses. Despite a poor performance when compared with previous seasons' accomplishments, Virginia Tech still ranked second in the Big East conference in total defense, scoring defense, and quarterback sacks.

Leading that defense was <a href="cornerback">cornerback</a> <a href="DeAngelo%20Hall">DeAngelo Hall</a>, a second-team All-America selection and first-team All-Big East selection who was also a semifinalist for the <a href="Jim%20Thorpe%20Award">Jim Thorpe Award</a>, given annually to the best <a href="defensive%20back">defensive back</a> in college football. Hall finished the regular season with 54 tackles and 1 interception. Hall was also a threat returning kicks. During the regular season, he returned 30 punts for 434 yards and 2 touchdowns.

The California defense was led by defensive back Donnie McCleskey, an All-Pac-10 selection who accumulated 99 tackles—the most on the team—and 2 interceptions during the regular season. The 99 tackles were enough to tie him for 14th place on California's all-time single-season tackle leaders list.

Lineman Ryan Riddle drew attention by accumulating 5.5 sacks and 6.5 tackles for loss despite playing only three games for the Bears. Riddle had not played football for two years while he focused on academics. He eventually signed up with a junior college team, then transferred to California when the Bears expressed interest in having him play on their team.

Linebacker Brendan Tremblay, who finished the season with 31 tackles, was scheduled to miss the game due to a knee injury that required surgery.

The 2003 Insight Bowl kicked off at 8:30 p.m. <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">EST</a> on December 26, 2003 at <a href="Bank%20One%20Ballpark">Bank One Ballpark</a> in <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. Though normally a baseball stadium, Bank One Ballpark hosted the Insight Bowl from 2000 to 2005 with seating reconfigured from the standard used during baseball games. 42,364 people attended the game, which was just 511 short of a sellout and was the largest crowd to attend an Insight Bowl game since the game moved to Bank One Ballpark in 2000. In exchange for participating in the game, each team received $750,000. On December 24, two days before the game, <a href="spread%20betting">spread bettors</a> favored Virginia Tech to win by three points.

An estimated 2.7 million people watched the game on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a>'s television broadcast, which was commentated by <a href="Mark%20Malone">Mark Malone</a>, <a href="Mike%20Golic">Mike Golic</a> and <a href="Rob%20Stone%20%28sportscaster%29">Rob Stone</a>. The audience was large enough to earn the game a <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">Nielsen rating</a> of 3.08, making it the 13th most-viewed bowl game that season and the fourth-highest <a href="Nielsen%20ratings">television rating</a> of the 20 bowl games broadcast on ESPN that season. At kickoff, the weather was clear with an air temperature of . Owing to the cool temperatures, the roof of Bank One Ballpark (which is retractable) was closed after <a href="fireworks">fireworks</a> were shot off during the opening ceremony.

After the ceremonial pre-game <a href="Coin%20flipping">coin toss</a>, California chose to receive the ball to begin the game. James Bethea returned the opening kickoff to the California 21-yard line. On the game's first play from scrimmage, California quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Burl Toler, presaging the game's offensive nature. Rodgers completed another pass, and the Bears were aided by a penalty against Virginia Tech. Running back Adimchinobe Echemandu ran the ball twice for short gains each time, and Rodgers continued to make long passes for first downs to keep the Golden Bears' offensive drive going. Deep inside Virginia Tech territory, Rodgers ran the ball twice, picking up short gains and the game's first touchdown. The extra point kick by kicker Tyler Fredrickson was good, and with 9:43 remaining in the quarter, California took a 7–0 lead.

Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the post-touchdown kickoff, returning it 52 yards and setting up the Virginia Tech offense inside California territory to begin Tech's first offensive possession of the game. Although Tech quarterback Bryan Randall was sacked for a loss of nine yards on his first play, he recovered to complete all four passes he attempted during the Tech drive, and after pushing the Hokies deep into California territory, scoring on a two-yard touchdown run. The drive took just two and a half minutes off the clock, and the touchdown and subsequent extra point evened the score at 7–7 with 7:13 remaining in the quarter.

After receiving Virginia Tech's kickoff, the California offense returned to the field. The Bears were unable to repeat the success of their first drive and went <a href="three%20and%20out">three and out</a>, punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies recovered the ball at their 43-yard line and moved quickly. Bryan Randall completed a 53-yard pass to receiver Chris Shreve. Two plays later, Randall completed a three-yard touchdown pass that gave the Hokies a 14–7 lead with 2:40 remaining in the quarter. California received the ball after the touchdown, but again went three and out. As before, the Hokies struck quickly. After starting from the California 49-yard line, it took one play for Virginia Tech to score. Randall completed a long pass to quarterback Marcus Vick, who came into the game as a wide receiver. The score and extra point made the game 21–7 with 50 seconds left in the quarter. California received the kickoff and ran three quick plays before the end of the quarter. As time expired, California faced a fourth down and nine yards from their 36-yard line and was preparing to punt. With one quarter elapsed, Virginia Tech led, 21–7.

The second quarter began with a California punt. Virginia Tech recovered at its 15-yard line and began the first offensive series of the second quarter. On the first full play of the quarter, Virginia Tech running back Kevin Jones broke free of the California defense for a 42-yard gain. On the next play, Bryan Randall completed an 11-yard pass to receiver Ernest Wilford. Jones returned to action with a nine-yard run, driving the Hokies to the California 22-yard line, but there the Hokie offense stalled. Tech faced a second down and needed just two yards for a first down, but could not gain the required yardage in two attempts. Tech kicker Carter Warley was sent in to attempt a 40-yard field goal, but his kick missed and California took over on offense at its 23-yard line.

In their first drive of the second quarter, the Golden Bears found success that was missing since their first drive of the game. Quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed a short pass, then <a href="Quarterback%20scramble">scrambled</a> for 24 yards and a first down. California ran the ball three times for another first down, then Rodgers connected with Chase Lyman on a 33-yard touchdown toss. The score was California's first since the opening drive of the game and cut Virginia Tech's lead to 21–14 with 9:10 remaining before halftime. The Hokies recovered the post-touchdown kickoff at their 20-yard line and began a scoring drive of their own. At first, the Hokies moved slowly, spending six plays to move just 14 yards, gaining a first down in the process. Then, facing a third down and seven, Randall completed a 25-yard pass to Richard Johnson. This was followed by another long pass—this one a 31-yarder—to Marcus Vick. On the play immediately following, Kevin Jones ran for seven yards and a Virginia Tech touchdown. The Tech score made the game 28–14 with 5:09 remaining in the quarter.

California began its next drive at its 29-yard line after a short kickoff return. At first, the Bears struggled to move the ball, but were helped by a 15-yard personal foul penalty against Virginia Tech. This advanced the ball near midfield and gave California a first down. Aaron Rodgers then completed a series of passes to drive California into the Virginia Tech side of the field and into the end zone. On a 13-yard pass to <a href="J.%20J.%20Arrington">J. J. Arrington</a>, Rodgers cut Virginia Tech's lead to 28–21 with 30 seconds remaining. Virginia Tech took over after the kickoff at its 31-yard line. Kevin Jones ran for 15 yards and Bryan Randall completed a 30-yard pass to drive Tech into California territory. Tech was unable to advance the ball further, but kicker Carter Warley was sent in to attempt a 45-yard field goal. As time expired in the first half, Warley's kick missed, denying the Hokies a chance to extend their lead. At the end of the first half, Virginia Tech still held a 28–21 lead.

Because California received the ball to begin the game, Virginia Tech received the ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the <a href="Goal%20line%20%28American%20football%29">goal line</a> and returned it 40 yards. Bryan Randall got off to a good start, completing two passes for 26 yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16 yards. After pushing inside the California <a href="Red%20zone%20%28football%29">red zone</a>, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.

After the missed kick, California took over at its 12-yard line. Aaron Rodgers completed three passes for 58 yards and Arrington added 15 yards on an <a href="end-around">end-around</a> run. It took California 2:44 in game time to advance 88 yards for a touchdown. The score tied the game at 28–28 with 10:12 to go in the quarter. Tech received the post-touchdown kickoff and gained two quick first downs, but after advancing the ball beyond its own 40-yard line, was forced to punt it back to California.

With the momentum shifting in the Golden Bears' favor and a chance to take the lead, it took California three plays to earn a touchdown from its 34-yard line. Rodgers completed a 42-yard pass, then a 14-yard pass, and Adimchinobe Echemandu ran the ball in to the end zone from the Virginia Tech 10-yard line. The score gave California its first lead since the first drive of the game, and with 5:52 remaining in the quarter, the scoreboard read 35–28, California. Following the touchdown, Virginia Tech received the ball and had its first three and out of the game. Tech was forced to punt after running three plays for four yards.

California received the ball at its 41-yard line and used the good field position to its advantage. After two short-gain plays, Rodgers completed a 16-yard pass and a 24-yard toss to drive the Bears inside the Virginia Tech 20-yard line. Echemandu rushed the ball twice for seven total yards, then Rodgers ran it himself the remaining nine yards for another California touchdown. The touchdown and extra point gave California a 42–28 lead, its largest in the game. Virginia Tech received the ball with 41 seconds remaining in the quarter, and ran four quick plays. After Bryan Randall threw two incompletions, he connected with Ernest Wilford on a long 23-yard pass, and Kevin Jones rushed up the middle of the field for another 12 yards. As time expired in the quarter, Tech was inside California territory for the first time since the beginning of the quarter and had a first down. At the end of the third quarter, California held a 42–28 lead.

Virginia Tech opened the fourth quarter in possession of the ball, facing a first down at the California 45-yard line. Two short plays resulted in seven yards, then Kevin Jones rushed for a 15-yard gain. On the next play, Bryan Randall completed a 22-yard toss to receiver Keith Willis for a touchdown. The score and extra point cut California's lead to 42–35, and there were 13 minutes and 35 seconds remaining in the game.

California received the ball at its 35-yard line following the post-touchdown kickoff and a short return. The Bears began to run out the clock, rushing the ball more than passing it, as had been the trend throughout the game. Though Aaron Rodgers completed four passes during the drive for 38 yards, J. J. Arrington and Vincent Strang rushed the ball a total of eight times during the possession. California ran 7:09 off the clock before Vincent Strang broke free for a 13-yard rush that resulted in a touchdown. The score restored California's 14-point lead, making the game 49–35 with 6:26 remaining.

Needing to score quickly, Virginia Tech's subsequent drive consisted primarily of pass plays. Marcus Vick quarterbacked the first play of the drive, but his pass fell incomplete and he was replaced by Bryan Randall on subsequent plays. Randall completed his first three passes of the drive for 46 yards, pushing the Hokies into California territory. Kevin Jones picked up another first down on two rushes, then Randall completed a 28-yard pass to Chris Shreve for a touchdown that cut California's lead to 49–42. The drive took just two minutes off the clock, leaving 4:26 remaining in the game. California received the post-touchdown kickoff and went three and out, leaving plenty of time for a potential game-tying Virginia Tech drive.

This turned out to be unnecessary, however, as Tyler Fredrickson's punt was returned 52 yards by Virginia Tech's DeAngelo Hall for a touchdown. Hall's return tied the game at 49–49, and with 3:11 remaining in the game, California took over on offense. On his first play after receiving Virginia Tech's post-touchdown kickoff, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense and fumbled the ball. The Bears' Chris Murphy jumped on the ball, preventing what otherwise might have been a game-losing turnover. Rodgers recovered from the fumble by completing three straight passes: first to J. J. Arrington for 11 yards, then to Brandon Hall for 18 yards and a first down, then to Burl Toler for 22 yards and another first down. The last play took California deep into Virginia Tech territory. At the Tech 20-yard line, Rodgers rushed for a five-yard gain, then prepared the offense for a potential game-winning field goal kick. With two seconds remaining on the clock, California called timeout and sent in kicker Tyler Fredrickson. Despite an attempt by Virginia Tech to <a href="Icing%20the%20kicker">ice the kicker</a> by calling its final timeout, Fredrickson was undeterred by the pressure and his 35-yard field goal sailed through the goalposts as time expired. The kick gave California three points and the 52–49 victory.

For his performance in the 2003 Insight Bowl, California quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the offensive player of the game. Rodgers completed 27 of his 35 passes for 394 yards and two touchdowns in the winning effort. Rodgers' performance tied Cal's bowl records for most completions, most touchdowns, and most rushing touchdowns, and was the third-highest offensive output by a single player in California history. The victory was California's first bowl win since a victory over Iowa in the <a href="1993%20Alamo%20Bowl">1993 Alamo Bowl</a>. California kicker Tyler Fredrickson's game-winning score was his only field goal kick during the game, but he also had seven extra-point kicks for seven points. In addition, he served as California's punter, kicking the ball 4 times for 159 total punting yards. He set school records for most extra points in a season and most extra points attempted. Virginia Tech kicker Carter Warley missed three field goals: a 40-yarder, 45-yarder, and a 28-yarder. He successfully kicked four extra points for four points. Virginia Tech quarterback Bryan Randall finished the game having completed 24 of his 34 pass attempts for 398 yards and four touchdowns.

On the ground, Virginia Tech running back Kevin Jones led all rushers with 16 carries for 153 yards and a touchdown. He finished the game having set school records for most rushing yards in a season, most 100-yard rushing games in a season, and most yards averaged per carry in a career. Leading the Golden Bears on the ground was J. J. Arrington, who finished the game with 11 carries for 34 yards. Two other California players—Adimchinobe Echemandu and quarterback Aaron Rodgers—also had more than 30 yards rushing. Echemandu had one rushing touchdown, and Rodgers earned two.

Virginia Tech receiver Ernest Wilford caught 8 passes for 110 yards, setting school records for career pass receptions with 126, most receptions in a bowl game, and most receptions in a season (56). Tech's Marcus Vick, normally a quarterback, was put into the game several times as a wide receiver. He caught four passes for 82 yards and a touchdown. California wide receiver Chase Lyman led all receivers statistically, finishing with five receptions for 149 yards and a touchdown. Burl Toler had the most California receptions, catching six passes for 84 yards. Lyman's total was a career-high for him and a California bowl game record.

Virginia Tech's offense broke or tied 14 school bowl records, either individually or as a team. In addition to the ones already noted, the Hokies' 18 first downs by passing, 398 yards passing, 551 yards of total offense, 24 passes completed, 49 points scored and four passing touchdowns were also new school bowl records. Tech's 26 rushing plays were the fewest in a Virginia Tech bowl game. California's offense set school bowl records for most points (52), total yards (530), passing yards (394), completion percentage (77.1%, 27-of-35), touchdowns (seven), and rushing touchdowns (five).

On defense, California's Ryan Gutierrez was named the defensive player of the game. He led all defensive players with 12 tackles in the game.

California's win raised it to a final record of 8–6, while Virginia Tech's loss dropped it to a final record of 8–5. The Hokies' five losses represented their worst season since 1997, when they went 7–5. Virginia Tech and California's combined score—101 points—represented the second-highest scoring bowl game without an overtime period in NCAA history, behind only the <a href="2001%20GMAC%20Bowl">2001 GMAC Bowl</a>.

Several players from each team were selected in the <a href="2004%20NFL%20Draft">2004 NFL Draft</a>. California's Mark Wilson and Adimchinobe Echemandu were selected in the fifth and seventh rounds, respectively. Virginia Tech had five players selected: DeAngelo Hall and Kevin Jones were both taken in the first round, Jake Grove was selected in the second, Ernest Wilford in the fourth, and Nathaniel Adibi in the fifth.

One day before the Insight Bowl, Virginia Tech was selected as a participant in the 2004 <a href="Black%20Coaches%20%26amp%3B%20Administrators">Black Coaches Association</a> Classic, which traditionally was the first college football game of the season. Virginia Tech's opponent in that game was Southern California, whom the Hokies' Insight Bowl opponents, California, defeated during the 2003 regular season.

Louis Lambert (novel)

Louis Lambert is an 1832 novel by <a href="French%20people">French</a> novelist and playwright <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> (1799–1850), included in the "Études philosophiques" section of his <a href="novel%20sequence">novel sequence</a> "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>". Set mostly in a school at <a href="Vend%C3%B4me">Vendôme</a>, it examines the life and theories of a boy genius fascinated by the Swedish philosopher <a href="Emanuel%20Swedenborg">Emanuel Swedenborg</a> (1688–1772).

Balzac wrote "Louis Lambert" during the summer of 1832 while he was staying with friends at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Sach%C3%A9">Château de Saché</a>, and published three editions with three different titles. The novel contains a minimal plot, focusing mostly on the metaphysical ideas of its boy-genius <a href="protagonist">protagonist</a> and his only friend (eventually revealed to be Balzac himself). Although it is not a significant example of the <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realist</a> style for which Balzac became famous, the novel provides insight into the author's own childhood. Specific details and events from the author's life – including punishment from teachers and social <a href="ostracism">ostracism</a> – suggest a fictionalized <a href="autobiography">autobiography</a>.

While he was a student at Vendôme, Balzac wrote an essay called "Traité de la Volonté" ("Treatise on the Will"); it is described in the novel as being written by Louis Lambert. The essay discusses the philosophy of Swedenborg and others, although Balzac did not explore many of the metaphysical concepts until much later in his life. Ideas analyzed in the essay and elsewhere in the novel include the split between inward and outward existence; the presence of <a href="angels">angels</a> and spiritual enlightenment; and the interplay between genius and madness.

Although critics panned the novel, Balzac remained steadfast in his belief that it provided an important look at <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, especially <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>. As he developed the scheme for "La Comédie humaine", he placed "Louis Lambert" in the "Études philosophiques" section, and later returned to the same themes in his novel "<a href="S%C3%A9raph%C3%AEta">Séraphîta</a>", about an <a href="androgynous">androgynous</a> angelic creature.

By 1832, <a href="Honor%C3%A9%20de%20Balzac">Honoré de Balzac</a> had begun to make a name for himself as a writer. The second of five children, Balzac was sent to the <a href="Oratory%20of%20Saint%20Philip%20Neri">Oratorian</a> College de <a href="Vend%C3%B4me">Vendôme</a> at the age of eight. He returned from the school six years later, sickly and weak. He was taught by tutors and private schools for two and a half years, then attended the <a href="Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a> in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. After training as a <a href="law%20clerk">law clerk</a> for three years, he moved into a tiny <a href="Attic">garret</a> in 1819 and began writing.

His first efforts, published under a variety of pseudonyms, were cheaply printed <a href="potboiler">potboiler</a> novels. In 1829 he finally released a novel under his own name, titled "<a href="Les%20Chouans">Les Chouans</a>"; it was a minor success, though it did not earn the author enough money to relieve his considerable debt. He found fame soon afterwards with a series of novels including "La Physiologie du mariage" (1829), "<a href="Sarrasine">Sarrasine</a>" (1830), and "<a href="La%20Peau%20de%20chagrin">La Peau de chagrin</a>" (1831).

In 1831 Balzac published a short story called "<a href="Les%20Proscrits">Les Proscrits</a>" ("The Exiles"), about two poets named Dante and Godefroid de Gand who attend the <a href="Sorbonne">Sorbonne</a> at the start of the fourteenth century. It explores questions of <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a> and <a href="mysticism">mysticism</a>, particularly the spiritual quest for <a href="illuminism">illuminism</a> and enlightenment. Balzac had been influenced greatly as a young man by the Swedish philosopher <a href="Emanuel%20Swedenborg">Emanuel Swedenborg</a>, whose theories permeate "Les Proscrits". The story was published – alongside "La Peau de chagrin", which also delves into metaphysics – as part of an 1831 collection entitled "Romans et contes philosophiques" ("Philosophical novels and stories").

In May 1832, Balzac suffered a head injury when his <a href="Tilbury%20%28carriage%29">tilbury</a> carriage crashed in a Parisian street. Although he was not hurt badly, he wrote to a friend about his worry that "some of the cogs in the mechanism of my brain may have got out of adjustment". His doctor ordered him to rest and refrain from writing and other mental activity. When he had recuperated, he spent the summer at the <a href="Ch%C3%A2teau%20de%20Sach%C3%A9">Château de Saché</a>, just outside the city of <a href="Tours">Tours</a>, with a family friend, Jean de Margonne.

While in Saché, he wrote a short novel called "Notice biographique sur Louis Lambert" about a misfit boy genius interested in <a href="metaphysics">metaphysics</a>. Like "Les Proscrits", "Louis Lambert" was a vehicle for Balzac to explore the ideas that had fascinated him, particularly those of Swedenborg and <a href="Louis%20Claude%20de%20Saint-Martin">Louis Claude de Saint-Martin</a>. He hoped the work would "produce an effect of incontestable superiority". and provide "a glorious rebuttal" to critics who ridiculed his interest in metaphysics.

The novel was first published as part of the "Nouveaux contes philosophiques" in late 1832, but by the start of the following year he declared it to be "a wretched miscarriage" and began rewriting it. During the process, Balzac was aided by a grammarian working as a proofreader, who found "a thousand errors" in the text. Once he had returned home, the author "cried with despair and with that rage that takes hold of you when you recognize your faults after working so hard".

A vastly expanded and revised novel, "Histoire intellectuelle de L.L.", was published as a single volume in 1833. Balzac, still unsatisfied, continued reworking the text – as he often did between editions – and included a series of letters written by the boy genius, as well as a detailed description of his metaphysical theories. This final edition was released as "Louis Lambert", included with "Les Proscrits" and a later work, "Séraphîta", in a volume entitled "Le Livre mystique" ("The Mystical Book").

The novel begins with an overview of the main character's background. Louis Lambert, the only child of a <a href="Tanning%20%28leather%29">tanner</a> and his wife, is born in 1797 and begins reading at an early age. In 1811 he meets the real-life Swiss author <a href="Anne%20Louise%20Germaine%20de%20Sta%C3%ABl">Madame de Staël</a> (1766–1817), who – struck by his intellect – pays for him to enroll in the Collège de Vendôme. There he meets the narrator, a classmate named "the Poet" who later identifies himself in the text as Balzac; they quickly become friends. Shunned by the other students and berated by teachers for not paying attention, the boys bond through discussions of philosophy and mysticism.

After completing an essay entitled "Traité de la Volonté" ("Treatise on the Will"), Lambert is horrified when a teacher confiscates it, calls it "rubbish", and – the narrator speculates – sells it to a local grocer. Soon afterwards, a serious illness forces the narrator to leave the school. In 1815, Lambert graduates at the age of eighteen and lives for three years in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>. After returning to his uncle's home in <a href="Blois">Blois</a>, he meets a woman named Pauline de Villenoix and falls passionately in love with her. On the day before their wedding, however, he suffers a mental breakdown and attempts to <a href="castration">castrate</a> himself.

Declared "incurable" by doctors, Lambert is ordered into solitude and rest. Pauline takes him to her family's château, where he lives in a near <a href="coma">coma</a>. The narrator, ignorant of these events, meets Lambert's uncle by chance, and is given a series of letters. Written by Lambert while in Paris and Blois, they continue his philosophical musings and describe his love for Pauline. The narrator visits his old friend at the Villenoix château, where the decrepit Lambert says only: "The angels are white." Pauline shares a series of statements her lover had dictated, and Lambert dies on 25 September 1824 at the age of twenty-eight.

The actual events of "Louis Lambert" are secondary to extended discussions of philosophy (especially metaphysics) and human emotion. Because the novel does not employ the same sort of <a href="realism%20%28arts%29">realism</a> for which Balzac became famous, it has been called one of "the most diffuse and least valuable of his works". Whereas many Balzac stories focus on the external world, "Louis Lambert" examines many aspects of the thought process and the life of the mind. Many critics, however, condemn the author's disorganized style and his placement of his own mature philosophies into the mind of a teenage boy.

Still, shades of Balzac's realism are found in the book, particularly in the first-hand descriptions of the Collège de Vendôme. The first part of the novel is replete with details about the school, describing how quarters were inspected and the complex social rules for exchanging dishes at dinnertime. Punishments are also described at length, including the assignment of tedious writing tasks and the painful application of the <a href="Strap%23Disciplinary%20strapping">strap</a>: Of all the physical torments to which we were exposed, certainly the most acute was that inflicted by this leathern instrument, about two fingers wide, applied to our poor little hands with all the strength and all the fury of the administrator. To endure this classical form of correction, the victim knelt in the middle of the room. He had to leave his form and go to kneel down near the master's desk under the curious and generally merciless eyes of his fellows... Some boys cried out and shed bitter tears before or after the application of the strap; others accepted the infliction with stoic calm ... but few could control an expression of anguish in anticipation. Further signs of Balzac's realism appear when Lambert describes his ability to vicariously experience events through thought alone. In one extended passage, he describes reading about the <a href="Battle%20of%20Austerlitz">Battle of Austerlitz</a> and seeing "every incident". In another he imagines the physical pain of a knife cutting his skin. As Balzac's biographer André Maurois notes, these reflections provide insight into the author's perspective toward the world and its written representations.

Biographers and critics agree that Louis Lambert is a thinly veiled version of the author, evidenced by numerous similarities between them. As a student at the Collège de Vendôme, Balzac was friends with a boy named Louis-Lambert Tinant. Like the title character, Balzac's faith was shaken at the time of his first <a href="Eucharist">communion</a>. Balzac read voraciously while in school, and – like Lambert – was often punished for misbehaving in class. The precise details of the school also reflect Balzac's time there: as described in the novel, students were allowed to keep <a href="pigeons">pigeons</a> and tend gardens, and holidays were spent in the <a href="dormitories">dormitories</a>.

Lambert's essay about metaphysics, "Traité de la Volonté" ("Treatise on the Will"), is another autobiographical reference. Balzac wrote the essay himself as a boy, and – as in the novel – it was confiscated by an angry teacher. Lambert's genius and philosophical erudition are reflections of Balzac's self-conception. Similarly, some critics and biographers have suggested that Lambert's madness reflects (consciously or not) Balzac's own unsteady mental state. His plans to run for parliament and other non-literary ambitions led observers at the time to suspect his sanity.

The many letters in the novel written by Lambert are also based on Balzac's life. After finishing the first version of the book, Balzac tried to win the heart of the Marquise de Castries by sending her a fragmented love letter from the book. Lambert's letters to his uncle about life in Paris from 1817 to 1820, meanwhile, mirror Balzac's own sentiments while attending the Sorbonne at the same time.

The ideas of <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> philosopher <a href="Emanuel%20Swedenborg">Emanuel Swedenborg</a> (and his disciple <a href="Louis%20Claude%20de%20Saint-Martin">Louis Claude de Saint-Martin</a>) are central to "Louis Lambert". Madame de Staël is impressed by Lambert when she finds him in a park reading Swedenborg's metaphysical treatise "<a href="Heaven%20and%20Hell%20%28Swedenborg%29">Heaven and Hell</a>" (1758); the Swedish writer's ideas are later reproduced in Lambert's own comments about mind, soul, and will. Primary among these is the division of the human into an "inward" and "outward" being. The outward being, subject to the forces of nature and studied by science, manifests itself in Lambert as the frail, frequently sick boy. The inward being, meanwhile, contains what Lambert calls "the material substance of thought", and serves as the true life into which he gradually moves throughout the novel.

Swedenborg's concepts are explored with relation to language, pain, memory, and dreams. When the students take a trip to the nearby Château de <a href="Jean-Baptiste%20Donatien%20de%20Vimeur%2C%20comte%20de%20Rochambeau">Rochambeau</a>, for example, Lambert, who has never visited the château, nevertheless recalls vivid memories of the place from a dream. Believing his spirit visited the place while his body slept, he ascribes the experience to "a complete severance of my body and my inner being" and "some inscrutable locomotive faculty in the spirit with effects resembling those of locomotion in the body".

Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac attempts in "Louis Lambert" to construct a viable theory to unify spirit and matter. Young Lambert attempts this goal in his "Traité de la Volonté", which – having been confiscated by a teacher – is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to connote ... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he thought, was the Idea evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in <a href="Franz%20Mesmer">Franz Mesmer</a>, who postulated the theory of <a href="animal%20magnetism">animal magnetism</a>, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes a section of the "Traité de la Volonté" which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.

Balzac's spiritual crisis at the time of his first communion led him to explore the first Christian thinkers and the <a href="Problem%20of%20evil">question of evil</a>. As the French critic Philippe Bertault points out, much of the mysticism in "Louis Lambert" is related to that of early <a href="Christianity">Christianity</a>. In his letters, Lambert describes exploring the philosophies of Christianity, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, and <a href="Confucianism">Confucianism</a>, among others. Tracing the similarities among these traditions, he declares that Swedenborg "undoubtedly epitomizes all of the religions—or rather the one religion—of humanity". The same theory informs Balzac's efforts, in "Louis Lambert" and elsewhere, to complement his Christian beliefs with occult mysticism and secular realism.

The church itself is a subject of Lambert's meditations, particularly with regard to the early <a href="Christian%20martyrs">Christian martyrs</a>. The split between inward and outward realities, he suggests, serves to explain the ability of those being tortured and maimed to escape physical suffering through the will of the spirit. As Lambert says: "Do not the phenomena observed in almost every instance of the torments so heroically endured by the early Christians for the establishment of the faith, amply prove that Material force will never prevail against the force of Ideas or the Will of man?" This inward–outward split also serves to explain the <a href="Miracles%20attributed%20to%20Jesus">Miracles attributed to Jesus</a>, whom Lambert considers a "perfect" representation of unity between the two beings.

The religious theme later appears in passages relating to <a href="angel">angel</a>s. Discussing the contents of Swedenborg's "Heaven and Hell", Lambert tries to convince the narrator of the existence of angels, described as "an individual in whom the inner being conquers the outer being". The boy genius himself is seen as an example of this process: his physical body withers and sickens, while his spiritual enlightenment expands, reaching its apex with his comment to the narrator: "The angels are white." Pauline, meanwhile, is described as "the angel" and "Angel-woman". Their parallel angelic states merge into what critic Charles Affron calls "a kind of perfect marriage, a spiritual bond that traverses this world and the next". Balzac later returned to the question of angels in other works of the "Études philosophiques", particularly "Séraphîta".

Convinced that he was himself a <a href="genius">genius</a>, Balzac used "Louis Lambert" to explore the difficulty of geniuses in society, as well as their frequent progression into <a href="insanity">madness</a>. He had been troubled greatly when, at Vendôme, he watched a schoolmate's mental condition deteriorate severely. Lambert's madness is represented most vividly in his attempt at self-<a href="castration">castration</a>, followed by years spent in a <a href="catatonic">catatonic</a> state. This transformation is in many ways a byproduct of his genius; because his brilliance is condemned by teachers and incompatible with the society of the other children, Lambert finds himself rejected by the world. He finds no more success in Paris, where he is led to "eat my heart out in misery". He becomes a vegetable, removed from the physical world entirely.

As a reflection of Balzac himself, Lambert also embodies the author's self-image as a brilliant writer, but one who acknowledges suspicions about his mental health. Some of his stories and public statements – as well as his fall prior to writing the novel – had led some observers to question Balzac's sanity. The protagonist's madness in "Louis Lambert" only added weight to these claims. As biographer Graham Robb writes: "It was typical of Balzac to douse a fire with petrol."

Balzac was fiercely proud of "Louis Lambert" and believed that it elegantly represented his diverse interests in philosophy, mysticism, religion, and occultism. When he sent an early draft to his lover at the time, however, she predicted the negative reception it would receive. "Let the whole world see you for themselves, my dearest," she wrote, "but do not cry out to them to admire you, because then the most powerful magnifying glasses will be directed at you, and what becomes of the most exquisite object when it is put under a microscope?" Critical reaction was overwhelmingly negative, due mostly to the book's lack of sustaining narrative. Conservative commentator Eugène Poitou, on the other hand, accused Balzac of lacking true faith and portraying the French family as a vile institution.

Balzac was undeterred by the negative reactions; referring to "Louis Lambert" and the other works in "Le Livre mystique", he wrote: "Those are books that I create for myself and for a few others." Although he was often critical of Balzac's work, French author <a href="Gustave%20Flaubert">Gustave Flaubert</a> was influenced – perhaps unconsciously – by the book. His own story "La Spirale", written in the 1850s, bears a strong plot resemblance to Balzac's 1832 novel.

While the three editions of "Louis Lambert" were being revised and published, Balzac was developing a scheme to organize all of his novels – written and unwritten. He called the scheme "<a href="La%20Com%C3%A9die%20humaine">La Comédie humaine</a>" ("The Human Comedy"), and envisioned it as a panoramic look at every part of French life at the time. He placed "Louis Lambert" in the section named "Études philosophiques" ("Philosophical Studies"), where it remained throughout his fifteen-year refinement of the project. He returned to the themes of the novel in his later work "Séraphîta", which follows the travails of an <a href="androgynous">androgynous</a> angelic creature. Balzac also inserted Lambert and his lover Pauline into later works – as he often did with characters from earlier novels – most notably in the story "<a href="Un%20drame%20au%20bord%20de%20la%20mer">Un drame au bord de la mer</a>" ("A Drama at the Sea's Edge").

Montreal Laboratory

The Montreal Laboratory in <a href="Montreal">Montreal, Quebec</a>, Canada, was established by the <a href="National%20Research%20Council%20%28Canada%29">National Research Council</a> of Canada during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> to undertake <a href="nuclear%20technology">nuclear research</a> in collaboration with the <a href="Nuclear%20weapons%20and%20the%20United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>, and to absorb some of the scientists and work of the <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> nuclear project in Britain. It became part of the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>, and designed and built some of the world's first <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>s.

After the <a href="Fall%20of%20France">Fall of France</a>, some French scientists escaped to Britain with their stock of <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a>. They were temporarily installed in the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a>, where they worked on reactor design. The <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a> was uncertain whether this was relevant to the main task of Tube Alloys, that of building an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>, although there remained a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>, which might be used in one. It therefore recommended that they be relocated to the United States, and co-located with the Manhattan Project's reactor effort. Due to American concerns about security (many of the scientists were foreign nationals) and patent claims by the French scientists and <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI), it was decided to relocate them to Canada instead.

The Canadian government agreed to the proposal, and the Montreal Laboratory was established in a house belonging to <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a>; it moved to permanent accommodation at the <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al">Université de Montréal</a> in March 1943. The first eight laboratory staff arrived in Montreal at the end of 1942. These were <a href="Bertrand%20Goldschmidt">Bertrand Goldschmidt</a> and <a href="Pierre%20Auger">Pierre Auger</a> from France, <a href="George%20Placzek">George Placzek</a> from <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, S. G. Bauer from Switzerland, <a href="Friedrich%20Paneth">Friedrich Paneth</a> and <a href="Hans%20von%20Halban">Hans von Halban</a> from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The Canadian contingent included <a href="George%20Volkoff">George Volkoff</a>, <a href="Bernice%20Weldon%20Sargent">Bernice Weldon Sargent</a> and <a href="George%20Laurence">George Laurence</a>, and promising young Canadian scientists such as <a href="J.%20Carson%20Mark">J. Carson Mark</a>, <a href="P.%20R.%20Wallace">Phil Wallace</a> and <a href="Leo%20Yaffe">Leo Yaffe</a>.

Although Canada was a major source of <a href="uranium%20ore">uranium ore</a> and heavy water, these were controlled by the Americans. Anglo-American cooperation broke down, denying the Montreal Laboratory scientists access to the materials they needed to build a reactor. In 1943, the <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a> merged Tube Alloys with the American Manhattan Project. The Americans agreed to help build the reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects left, and <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a> became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. The <a href="Chalk%20River%20Laboratories">Chalk River Laboratories</a> opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946. Two reactors were built at Chalk River. The small <a href="ZEEP">ZEEP</a> went critical on 5 September 1945, and the larger <a href="NRX">NRX</a> on 21 July 1947. NRX was for a time the most powerful <a href="research%20reactor">research reactor</a> in the world.

Canada has a long history of involvement with nuclear research, dating back to the pioneering work of <a href="Ernest%20Rutherford">Ernest Rutherford</a> at <a href="McGill%20University">McGill University</a> in 1899. In 1940, <a href="George%20Laurence">George Laurence</a> of the <a href="National%20Research%20Council%20%28Canada%29">National Research Council</a> (NRC) began experiments in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> to measure <a href="neutron%20capture">neutron capture</a> and <a href="nuclear%20fission">nuclear fission</a> in <a href="uranium">uranium</a> to demonstrate the feasibility of a <a href="nuclear%20reactor">nuclear reactor</a>. For that purpose, he obtained of <a href="uranium%20dioxide">uranium dioxide</a> in paper bags from the <a href="Eldorado%20Mine%20%28Northwest%20Territories%29">Eldorado Mine</a> at <a href="Port%20Radium">Port Radium</a> in the <a href="Northwest%20Territories">Northwest Territories</a>. For a <a href="neutron%20moderator">neutron moderator</a>, he used <a href="carbon">carbon</a> in the form of <a href="petroleum%20coke">petroleum coke</a>. This was placed with the bags of uranium oxide in a large wooden bin lined with <a href="paraffin%20wax">paraffin wax</a>, another neutron moderator. A neutron source was added, and a <a href="Geiger%20counter">Geiger counter</a> used to measure <a href="radioactivity">radioactivity</a>.

The experiments continued in 1942, but were ultimately unsuccessful; the problems posed by impurities in the coke and uranium oxide had not been fully appreciated, and as a result too many neutrons were captured. But Laurence's efforts attracted some attention, and in the summer of 1940 he was visited by <a href="Ralph%20H.%20Fowler">R. H. Fowler</a>, the British scientific liaison officer in Canada. This was followed by a visit from <a href="John%20Cockcroft">John Cockcroft</a> of the British <a href="Tizard%20Mission">Tizard Mission</a> to the United States in the autumn. They brought news of the similar research being carried out under the supervision of the <a href="MAUD%20Committee">MAUD Committee</a> in Britain and the <a href="National%20Defense%20Research%20Committee">National Defense Research Committee</a> (NDRC) in the United States.

Fowler became the channel of communication between the NDRC and its counterparts in Britain and Canada. Through him, Laurence obtained an introduction to <a href="Lyman%20J.%20Briggs">Lyman J. Briggs</a>, the chairman of the NDRC's <a href="S-1%20Uranium%20Committee">S-1 Uranium Committee</a>, who supplied copies of American studies. On returning to England, Cockcroft arranged through <a href="Henry%20Mond%2C%202nd%20Baron%20Melchett">Lord Melchett</a> for Laurence to receive a $5,000 grant to continue his research. This payment was made by <a href="Imperial%20Chemical%20Industries">Imperial Chemical Industries</a> (ICI) through a Canadian subsidiary. It had the desired side effect of impressing the Canadian authorities with the importance of Laurence's work.

Laurence had chosen to use carbon instead of <a href="heavy%20water">heavy water</a> because it was cheaper and more readily available. A team of scientists in France that included <a href="Hans%20von%20Halban">Hans von Halban</a>, <a href="Lew%20Kowarski">Lew Kowarski</a>, and <a href="Francis%20Perrin">Francis Perrin</a> had been conducting similar experiments since 1939. By 1940, they had decided to use heavy water as a moderator, and through the French <a href="Minister%20of%20Armaments%20%28France%29">Minister of Armaments</a> obtained about from the <a href="Norsk%20Hydro">Norsk Hydro</a> hydroelectric station at <a href="Vemork">Vemork</a> in Norway. After the <a href="Fall%20of%20France">Fall of France</a>, they had escaped to Britain with their stock of heavy water. They were temporarily installed in the <a href="Cavendish%20Laboratory">Cavendish Laboratory</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> but, believing that Britain would soon fall as well, were eager to relocate to the United States or Canada.

Canada was an alternative source of heavy water. <a href="Cominco">Cominco</a> had been involved in heavy water research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in <a href="Trail%2C%20British%20Columbia">Trail, British Columbia</a>. On 26 February 1941, the NRC inquired about its ability to produce heavy water. This was followed on 23 July by a letter from <a href="Hugh%20Stott%20Taylor">Hugh Taylor</a>, a British-born scientist working at <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>, on behalf of the <a href="Office%20of%20Scientific%20Research%20and%20Development">Office of Scientific Research and Development</a> (OSRD). Taylor offered a NDRC contract to produce , for which the NDRC was prepared to pay $5 per pound for low-grade and $10 for high-grade heavy water. At the time it was selling for up to $1,130 per pound.

Cominco's president, <a href="Selwyn%20G.%20Blaylock">Selwyn G. Blaylock</a>, was cautious. There might be no post-war demand for heavy water, and the <a href="patent">patent</a> on the process was held by Albert Edgar Knowles, so a profit-sharing agreement would be required. In response, Taylor offered $20,000 for plant modifications. There the matter rested until 6 December, when Blaylock had a meeting with the British physicist G. I. Higson, who informed him that Taylor had become discouraged with Cominco, and had decided to find another source of heavy water. Blaylock invited Taylor to visit Trail, which he did from 5 to 8 January 1942. The two soon found common ground. Blaylock agreed to produce heavy water at Trail, and quickly secured approval from the Chairman of the Board, Sir <a href="Edward%20Wentworth%20Beatty">Edward Beatty</a>. A contract was signed on 1 August 1942. The heavy water project became known as the <a href="P-9%20Project">P-9 Project</a> in October 1942.

The French scientists made good progress on the design of an <a href="aqueous%20homogeneous%20reactor">aqueous homogeneous reactor</a>, but there were doubts that their work was relevant to the main task of the British <a href="Tube%20Alloys">Tube Alloys</a> project, that of building an <a href="atomic%20bomb">atomic bomb</a>, and resources were tightly controlled in wartime Britain. There was a possibility that a reactor could be used to breed <a href="plutonium">plutonium</a>, but its use in a bomb seemed a remote possibility. The MAUD Committee therefore felt that they should relocate to America. It made sense to pool resources, and America had advantages, notably access to materials such as heavy water. American scientists such as <a href="Henry%20D.%20Smyth">Henry D. Smyth</a>, Harold Urey and Hugh Taylor urged that the Cambridge team be sent to America. On the other hand, American officials had concerns about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the Cambridge group was British, and about French patent claims. These included patents on controlling nuclear chain reactions, enriching uranium, and using <a href="deuterium">deuterium</a> as a neutron moderator. There were also two patent applications in conjunction with <a href="Egon%20Bretscher">Egon Bretscher</a> and <a href="Norman%20Feather">Norman Feather</a> on the production and use of plutonium. <a href="George%20Paget%20Thomson">George Thomson</a>, the chairman of the MAUD Committee, suggested a compromise: relocating the team to Canada.

The next step was to broach the matter with the Canadians. The <a href="Lord%20President%20of%20the%20Council">Lord President</a>, Sir <a href="John%20Anderson%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Waverley">John Anderson</a>, as the <a href="Minister%20%28government%29">minister</a> responsible for Tube Alloys, wrote to the British <a href="High%20Commissioner%20%28Commonwealth%29">High Commissioner</a> to Canada, <a href="Malcolm%20MacDonald">Malcolm MacDonald</a>, who had been involved in Tube Alloys negotiations with Canada regarding <a href="Eldorado%20Mining%20and%20Refining">Eldorado</a>'s uranium mine at Port Radium and its refinery in <a href="Port%20Hope%2C%20Ontario">Port Hope, Ontario</a>. On 19 February 1942, MacDonald, Thomson and Wallace Akers, the director of Tube Alloys, met with <a href="Jack%20Mackenzie">C. J. Mackenzie</a>, the president of the NRC, who enthusiastically supported the proposal. The following day he took them to see <a href="C.%20D.%20Howe">C. D. Howe</a>, the <a href="Minister%20of%20Munitions%20and%20Supply">Minister of Munitions and Supply</a>.
Howe cabled Anderson expressing the Canadian government's agreement in principle, but requesting a more detailed appraisal of the cost of the proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and funded through the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.

The Canadians decided that the new laboratory should be located in Montreal, where housing accommodation was easier to find than in wartime Ottawa. They hoped to have everything ready by 1 January 1943, but negotiations for laboratory space fell through. A search then commenced for an alternative location. <a href="Bertrand%20Goldschmidt">Bertrand Goldschmidt</a>, a French scientist who was already in Canada, ran into <a href="Henri%20Laugier">Henri Laugier</a>, a French biologist who had been president of the "<a href="Centre%20national%20de%20la%20recherche%20scientifique">Centre national de la recherche scientifique</a>" before the Fall of France, when he had escaped to Canada. Laugier suggested that they acquire some unused wings of a new building at the <a href="Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Montr%C3%A9al">Université de Montréal</a>, where he was now teaching. These had been earmarked for a medical school, but had never been equipped due to a lack of funds. The space was acquired, but considerable work was required to convert it into a laboratory, and it could not be made ready before mid-February 1943. <a href="Ernest%20Cormier">Ernest Cormier</a>, the university architect, drew up the plans.

The first eight staff arrived in Montreal at the end of 1942. These were Goldschmidt and <a href="Pierre%20Auger">Pierre Auger</a> from France, <a href="George%20Placzek">George Placzek</a> from <a href="Czechoslovakia">Czechoslovakia</a>, S. G. Bauer from Switzerland, <a href="Friedrich%20Paneth">Friedrich Paneth</a> and Halban from Austria, and R. E. Newell and F. R. Jackson from Britain. The <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Atlantic">Battle of the Atlantic</a> was still raging, and men and equipment, which travelled separately, were at risk from German <a href="U-boat">U-boat</a>s. The scientists occupied a house at 3470 Simpson Street in downtown Montreal that belonged to McGill University. This soon became so crowded that bathrooms were used for offices, with the bath tubs used to store papers and books. They were relieved to move to the more spacious accommodation at the Université de Montréal in March. The laboratory grew to over 300 staff, about half of whom were Canadians recruited by Laurence.

Placzek became head of the theoretical physics division. Kowarski was designated to be the head of the experimental physics division, but there was a personality clash with Halban, and Kowarski did not wish to accept what he saw as a subordinate position under Halban. At this point, many other scientists said that they would not go without Kowarski, but Sir <a href="Edward%20Victor%20Appleton">Edward Appleton</a>, the <a href="permanent%20secretary">permanent secretary</a> of the British <a href="Department%20of%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Scientific and Industrial Research</a>, of which the Tube Alloys was a part, managed to persuade them to go. Kowarski remained at Cambridge, where he worked for <a href="James%20Chadwick">James Chadwick</a>. Auger became head of the experimental physics division instead. Paneth became head of the chemistry division. Two other scientists that had escaped from France joined the laboratory: the French chemist <a href="Jules%20Gu%C3%A9ron">Jules Guéron</a>, who had been working for <a href="Free%20France">Free France</a> at Cambridge, and <a href="Bruno%20Pontecorvo">Bruno Pontecorvo</a>, an Italian scientist who had worked with <a href="Enrico%20Fermi">Enrico Fermi</a> in Italy before the war.

For the Canadian contingent, Laurence and Mackenzie set out to recruit some top nuclear physicists, of whom there were few in Canada. The first was <a href="George%20Volkoff">George Volkoff</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20British%20Columbia">University of British Columbia</a>, who had worked with <a href="Robert%20Oppenheimer">Robert Oppenheimer</a> on the physics of <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>s. They also tried to recruit <a href="Harry%20Thode">Harry Thode</a> from <a href="McMaster%20University">McMaster University</a>, but found that Harold Urey from the <a href="Manhattan%20Project">Manhattan Project</a>'s <a href="SAM%20Laboratories">SAM Laboratories</a> was also interested in Thode's expertise in testing heavy water with <a href="mass%20spectrography">mass spectrography</a>, and had made a more attractive offer. A compromise was reached whereby Thode did work for the Montreal Laboratory, but remained at McMaster University. Promising young Canadian scientists were also recruited, including <a href="J.%20Carson%20Mark">J. Carson Mark</a>, <a href="P.%20R.%20Wallace">Phil Wallace</a> and <a href="Leo%20Yaffe">Leo Yaffe</a>.

The Montreal Laboratory investigated multiple avenues of reactor development. One was a homogeneous reactor, in which a uranium compound was dissolved in heavy water to form a <a href="slurry">slurry</a>, or a "mayonnaise" as the Montreal team called it. This offered various advantages for cooling, control and the ability to draw off plutonium that was produced. Paneth, Goldschmidt and others experimented with methods of preparing such a uranium compound, but none could be found with the required density. They considered using <a href="enriched%20uranium">enriched uranium</a>, but it was unavailable. Attention then turned to a heterogeneous reactor, in which a lattice of uranium metal rods were immersed in heavy water. While much less heavy water would be required, there was a danger that the water would decompose into deuterium and oxygen—a potentially explosive combination. There was great interest in <a href="breeder%20reactor">breeder reactor</a>s, which could breed plutonium from uranium or <a href="uranium-233">uranium-233</a> from <a href="thorium">thorium</a>, as it was believed that uranium was scarce. A process was devised for separating the uranium from thorium.

To build a working nuclear reactor, the Montreal Laboratory depended on the Americans for heavy water from Trail, which was under American contract, but this was not forthcoming. An American request for Halban to come to New York to discuss heavy water with Fermi and Urey was turned down by the British, and the Americans brought cooperation to a standstill. By June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a halt. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. The British government seriously considered going it alone on developing nuclear weapons, despite the cost and the expected length of the project. In August 1943, Canadian Prime Minister <a href="Mackenzie%20King">Mackenzie King</a> hosted the <a href="Quebec%20Conference%2C%201943">Quebec Conference</a>, at which <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a> and <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> came together, and agreed to resume cooperation. The <a href="Quebec%20Agreement">Quebec Agreement</a> subsumed Tube Alloys into the Manhattan Project, and established the <a href="Combined%20Policy%20Committee">Combined Policy Committee</a>, on which Canada was represented by Howe, to control the Manhattan Project.

While some aspects of cooperation resumed quickly, it took longer to finalize the details with respect to the Montreal Laboratory. <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Leslie%20Groves">Leslie Groves</a> (the director of the Manhattan Project), Chadwick (now the head of the <a href="British%20contribution%20to%20the%20Manhattan%20Project">British Mission to the Manhattan Project</a>), and Mackenzie negotiated recommendations, which were approved by the Combined Policy Committee on 13 April 1944. A final agreement was spelt out on 20 May. Under it, the Americans would assist with the construction of a heavy water reactor in Canada, and would provide technical assistance with matters such as corrosion and the effects of radiation on materials. They would not provide details about plutonium or plutonium chemistry, although irradiated uranium slugs would be made available for the British to work it out for themselves. The Americans had already built their own heavy water reactor, <a href="Chicago%20Pile-3">Chicago Pile-3</a>, which went critical in May 1944. The September 1944 <a href="Quebec%20Agreement%23Background%20and%20negotiations">Hyde Park Agreement</a> extended both commercial and military cooperation into the post-war period.

Hans von Halban had proved to be an unfortunate choice as he was a poor administrator, and did not work well with Mackenzie or the NRC. The Americans saw him as a security risk, and objected to the French atomic patents claimed by the Paris Group (in association with ICI). In April 1944 a Combined Policy Committee meeting at Washington agreed that Canada would build a heavy water reactor. Scientists who were not British subjects would leave, and Cockcroft became the new director of the Montreal Laboratory in May 1944. <a href="Edgar%20William%20Richard%20Steacie">E. W. R. Steacie</a> became assistant director and head of the Chemistry division when Paneth left. Volkoff eventually succeeded Placzek as head of the Theoretical Physics division. Halban remained as head of the nuclear physics division.
After the <a href="Liberation%20of%20Paris">Liberation of Paris</a> in August 1944, the French scientists wanted to go home. Auger had already returned to London to join the French Scientific Mission in April 1944. Halban returned on a visit to London and Paris in November 1944, where he saw <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Joliot-Curie">Frédéric Joliot-Curie</a> for the first time since leaving France. While he maintained that he did not divulge any nuclear secrets to his previous boss (although he had discussed patent rights), Halban was not allowed to work or to leave North America for a year, although he left the Montreal Laboratory in April 1945. In 1946 he settled in England. <a href="Bernice%20Weldon%20Sargent">B. W. Sargent</a> then became Head of the nuclear physics division. Cockcroft arranged for Goldschmidt, Guéron and Kowarski to remain until June 1945, later extended until the end of 1945. Goldschmidt was willing to stay longer, and Cockcroft wanted to keep him, but Groves insisted that he should go, and, in the interest of Allied harmony, he did. All the French scientists had left by January 1946.

On 24 August 1944, the decision was taken to build a small reactor to test the group's calculations relating to such matters as lattice dimensions, sheathing materials, and <a href="control%20rod">control rod</a>s, before proceeding with the full-scale <a href="NRX">NRX</a> reactor. With Halban gone, Kowarski joined the Laboratory, and was given responsibility for the small reactor, which he named <a href="ZEEP">ZEEP</a>, for Zero Energy Experimental Pile. He was assisted in the design by Charles Watson-Munro from New Zealand, and <a href="George%20Klein%20%28inventor%29">George Klein</a> and Don Nazzer from Canada. Building reactors in downtown Montreal was out of the question; the Canadians selected, and Groves approved, a site at <a href="Chalk%20River">Chalk River</a>, Ontario, on the south bank of the <a href="Ottawa%20River">Ottawa River</a> some northwest of Ottawa.

The Americans fully supported the reactor project with information and visits. Groves loaned the Montreal Laboratory of heavy water and of pure uranium metal for the reactor, and samples of pure and irradiated uranium and thorium to develop the extraction process. The irradiated materials came from the Manhattan Project's <a href="X-10%20Graphite%20Reactor">X-10 Graphite Reactor</a> at the <a href="Clinton%20Engineer%20Works">Clinton Engineer Works</a> at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. Some of machined pure uranium rods was sold outright to Canada. He also supplied instruments, drawings and technical information, provided expertise from American scientists, and opened a liaison office in Montreal headed by Major H. S. Benbow. The American physicist <a href="William%20Weldon%20Watson">William Weldon Watson</a> from the <a href="Metallurgical%20Laboratory">Metallurgical Laboratory</a> and chemist John R. Huffman from the SAM Laboratories were assigned to it. They were succeeded by <a href="George%20Weil">George Weil</a> in November 1945. Benbow was succeeded by Major P. Firmin in December 1945, who in turn was replaced by Colonel A. W. Nielson in February 1946.

The <a href="Chalk%20River%20Laboratories">Chalk River Laboratories</a> opened in 1944, and the Montreal Laboratory was closed in July 1946. ZEEP went critical on 5 September 1945, becoming the first operating nuclear reactor outside the United States. Using of heavy water and of uranium metal, it could operate continuously at 3.5 W, or for brief periods at 30 to 50 W. The larger NRX followed on 21 July 1947. With five times the <a href="neutron%20flux">neutron flux</a> of any other reactor, it was the most powerful <a href="research%20reactor">research reactor</a> in the world. Originally designed in July 1944 with an output of 8 MW, the power was raised to 10 MW through design changes such as replacing uranium rods clad in stainless steel and cooled by heavy water with aluminium-clad rods cooled by light water.

By the end of 1946, the Montreal Laboratory was estimated to have cost US$22,232,000, excluding the cost of the heavy water. The NRX reactor provided Britain, the United States and Canada with a source of fissile plutonium and uranium-233. It also provided a means of efficiently producing medical isotopes like <a href="phosphorus-32">phosphorus-32</a>, research facilities that for a time were superior to those in the United States, and a wealth of technical information related to reactor design and operation. With the passage of the Canadian Atomic Energy Act of 1946, the responsibility for the Chalk River Laboratories passed to the <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Control%20Board">Atomic Energy Control Board</a>.

On 5 September 1945, <a href="Igor%20Gouzenko">Igor Gouzenko</a>, a <a href="cipher">cypher</a> clerk at the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>'s embassy in Ottawa, and his family <a href="defection">defected</a> to Canada. He brought with him copies of cables detailing <a href="GRU">Soviet intelligence</a> (GRU) espionage activities in Canada. Agents included Alan Nunn May, who secretly supplied tiny samples of uranium-233 and <a href="uranium-235">uranium-235</a> to GRU agent Pavel Angelov in July 1945; <a href="Fred%20Rose%20%28politician%29">Fred Rose</a>, a <a href="Parliament%20of%20Canada">member of parliament</a>; and NRC scientists <a href="Israel%20Halperin">Israel Halperin</a>, Edward Mazerall and Durnford Smith. Pontecorvo, who defected to the Soviet Union in 1950, has long been suspected of having been involved in espionage. No evidence that he was a Soviet agent has ever been established, but the GRU obtained samples of uranium and blueprints of the NRX, for which Nunn May could not have been the source, and Pontecorvo remains the prime suspect. When the spy ring became public knowledge in February 1946, the Americans became more cautious about sharing information with Britain and Canada.

The Montreal Laboratory had been a fruitful and successful international venture, although the Canadians had on occasion been resentful of British actions that were perceived as high-handed and insensitive. One such action came in November 1945 when the British government suddenly announced that Cockcroft had been appointed the head of the new <a href="Atomic%20Energy%20Research%20Establishment">Atomic Energy Research Establishment</a> in Britain without any prior consultation and at a time when the NRX reactor was still under construction. Cockcroft did not depart Canada until September 1946, but it was a sure sign of waning British interest in collaboration with Canada. The British suggested he be replaced by the British physicist <a href="Bennett%20Lewis">Bennett Lewis</a>, who was eventually appointed, but only after the Canadian-born <a href="Walter%20Zinn">Walter Zinn</a> turned the job down.

Anglo-American cooperation did not long survive the war. Roosevelt died on 12 April 1945, and the Hyde Park Agreement was not binding on subsequent administrations. The <a href="Special%20Relationship">Special Relationship</a> between Britain and the United States "became very much less special". The British government had trusted that America would share nuclear technology, which the British considered a joint discovery. On 9 November 1945, Mackenzie King and British Prime Minister <a href="Clement%20Attlee">Clement Attlee</a> went to Washington, D.C. to confer with President <a href="Harry%20Truman">Harry Truman</a> about future cooperation in nuclear weapons and nuclear power. A Memorandum of Intention that replaced the Quebec Agreement made Canada a full partner. The three leaders agreed that there would be full and effective cooperation, but British hopes for a resumption of cooperation on nuclear weapons were in vain. The Americans soon made it clear that cooperation was restricted to basic scientific research.

At the Combined Policy Committee meeting in February 1946, without prior consultation with Canada, the British announced their intention to build a <a href="GLEEP">graphite-moderated nuclear reactor</a> in the United Kingdom. An outraged Howe told Canadian ambassador <a href="Lester%20B.%20Pearson">Lester B. Pearson</a> to inform the Committee that nuclear cooperation between Britain and Canada was at an end. The Canadians had been given what they deemed assurances that the Chalk River Laboratories would be a joint enterprise, and regarded the British decision as a breach of faith. Anglo-American cooperation largely ended in April 1946 when Truman declared that the United States would not assist Britain in the design, construction or operation of a plutonium production reactor. The Americans had agreed that such a facility could be built in Canada, but the British were not willing to be dependent on Canada for the supply of <a href="fissile">fissile</a> material.

The story is about <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a>, a <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n warrior tricked into killing his wife and daughter by his former master, the Greek God of War <a href="Ares">Ares</a>. Kratos seeks to rid himself of the nightmares by serving the other <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian gods</a>, but soon finds himself in confrontation with them due to their machinations.

Santa Monica has developed all main entries, while <a href="Ready%20at%20Dawn">Ready at Dawn</a> and <a href="Javaground">Javaground</a>/<a href="Sony%20Online%20Entertainment">Sony Online Entertainment-Los Angeles</a> (SOE-LA) developed the three side games. <a href="Sony%20Interactive%20Entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> (SIE; formerly Sony Computer Entertainment) has published all games except the mobile phone installment; it was published by <a href="Sony%20Pictures%20Digital">Sony Pictures Digital</a>. There are two eras in the series. The first era are the first seven games, which are based on <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a> with vengeance as a central motif.

The fourth main installment, "" (2013), was also released for the PS3 and serves as a prequel to all other games. The three side games include "" (2008) and "" (2010) for the <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a> (PSP), and "" (2007) for mobile phones that supported the <a href="Java%20Platform%2C%20Micro%20Edition">Java Platform, Micro Edition</a> (Java ME).

Games in the series have been praised as some of the best action games of all time. Some of them have also been remastered for newer PlayStation platforms. The franchise has sold over 27 million units worldwide with the release of 2018's installment. Strong sales and support of the series led to the franchise's expansion into other media, such as three comic book series and three novels. A film adaptation of the original installment has been in development since 2005. Merchandise includes artwork, clothing, toys, and <a href="prop%20replica">prop replica</a>s, as well as the games' soundtracks, including a <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> album, "" (2010), featuring original music by various bands who were inspired by the series.

<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29">God of War</a> was first released in North America on March 22, 2005, for the <a href="PlayStation%202">PlayStation 2</a>. After ten years in the service of the <a href="Twelve%20Olympians">Olympian gods</a>, <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n soldier <a href="Kratos%20%28God%20of%20War%29">Kratos</a> is tasked by <a href="Athena">Athena</a> to find <a href="Pandora%27s%20Box">Pandora's Box</a>; the key to defeating <a href="Ares">Ares</a>, the God of War, who is running amok through <a href="Athens">Athens</a>. A series of flashbacks reveals that Kratos was once the servant of Ares, who saved the Spartan and his army from annihilation in battle, but tricked him into killing his family which forced his metamorphosis into the "Ghost of Sparta". Kratos eventually finds Pandora's Box, and after finally killing Ares, he ascends to <a href="Mount%20Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> to become the new God of War.

<a href="God%20of%20War%20II">God of War II</a> was first released in North America on March 13, 2007, for the PlayStation 2. Angered at his fellow gods, Kratos runs amok across the city of <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>. <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> intervenes and betrays Kratos, who is saved by the <a href="Titan%20%28mythology%29">Titan</a> <a href="Gaia%20%28mythology%29">Gaia</a>. She tells him he must now find the <a href="Moirai">Sisters of Fate</a>, who can change his fate and prevent his death at the hands of Zeus. Kratos is ultimately successful and as he is about to kill the god, Athena sacrifices herself to save Zeus and preserve Olympus, and tells Kratos that he is the son of Zeus. Kratos then joins forces with Gaia and the Titans to attack Olympus.

<a href="God%20of%20War%20III">God of War III</a> was first released in North America on March 16, 2010, for the <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a>. Reigniting the <a href="Titanomachy">Great War</a>, Kratos is soon abandoned by the Titans, who were only using him to exact their own revenge. Helped by the spirit of Athena who was elevated to a new level of understanding, she instructs him to seek the Flame of Olympus in order to defeat Zeus. Kratos engages the gods and the Titans in an epic series of battles across the <a href="Underworld">Underworld</a> and Olympus and learns that Pandora's Box is within the Flame. He discovers that <a href="Pandora">Pandora</a> herself is the key to pacifying the Flame and allowing him to open the Box. After finally killing Zeus, he refuses to help Athena assume the role of new patron of mankind and disappears.

 is a short <a href="text-based%20game">text-based game</a>, released through <a href="Facebook%20Messenger">Facebook Messenger</a> on February 1, 2018. The game serves as a prequel story to 2018's "God of War", and follows Atreus on his first adventure in the Norse wilds.

<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282018%20video%20game%29">God of War</a> was released worldwide on April 20, 2018, for the <a href="PlayStation%204">PlayStation 4</a> console. Many years after the events of "God of War III", Kratos has ended up in the world of <a href="Norse%20mythology">Norse mythology</a> in ancient <a href="Norway">Norway</a> in the realm of <a href="Midgard">Midgard</a>, and he now has a son named Atreus. After his second wife and Atreus' mother, <a href="Laufey">Faye</a>, passes away from an unknown cause, the two set out on a journey to fulfill her final wish, which was to have her ashes spread at the highest peak of the <a href="Norse%20cosmology">nine realms</a>, eventually revealed to be in <a href="Jotunheim">Jotunheim</a>. Along their journey, they are attacked by <a href="Baldr">Baldur</a>, who was sent by <a href="Odin">Odin</a> to get to Faye in order to prevent <a href="Ragnar%C3%B6k">Ragnarök</a>, unaware she was already dead. Following the death of Baldur, however, the three-year long <a href="Fimbulwinter">Fimbulwinter</a> begins, which means Ragnarök is soon to follow, which was not supposed to occur for another hundred years. Baldur's mother <a href="Freyja">Freya</a> swears revenge on Kratos, while he and Atreus complete their journey, where they learn that Faye knew of everything and had wanted to name Atreus as <a href="Loki">Loki</a>. The game is a new direction for the series, not only by its new mythological setting, but also by its gameplay. Kratos now prominently uses a magical battle axe called the Leviathan Axe.

Although further games have not been officially announced, <a href="Cory%20Barlog">Cory Barlog</a> confirmed that this new installment would not be Kratos' last game. It was also revealed that following games would continue to be set in the Norse environment, and include Atreus.

<a href="God%20of%20War%20Collection">God of War Collection</a> was first released in North America on November 17, 2009, for the PlayStation 3—the franchise's first appearance on the platform. It is a <a href="Classics%20HD">remastered port</a> of the original "God of War " and "God of War II". The games were <a href="ported">ported</a> by <a href="Bluepoint%20Games">Bluepoint Games</a> and feature high-definition <a href="1080p">1080p</a> <a href="Multisample%20anti-aliasing">anti-aliased</a> graphics at 60 frames per second and <a href="PlayStation%20Network%23Trophies">trophies</a>. <a href="Sanzaru%20Games">Sanzaru Games</a> later ported the collection to the <a href="PlayStation%20Vita">PlayStation Vita</a> and it was released in May 2014—the franchise's only appearance on this platform.

<a href="God%20of%20War%20Saga">God of War Saga</a> was released in North America on August 28, 2012. It is a collection of five of the "God of War" games for the PlayStation 3, released as part of Sony's <a href="PlayStation%20Collections">PlayStation Collections</a> line. The collection includes the original "God of War", "God of War II", "God of War III", "Chains of Olympus", and "Ghost of Sparta". It features two Blu-ray Discs—"God of War I" and "II" on the first and "III" on the second—and a voucher to download "Chains of Olympus" and "Ghost of Sparta". The games retain the same features as their first PS3 releases.

<a href="God%20of%20War%20III%20Remastered">God of War III Remastered</a> was first released in North America on July 14, 2015, for the PlayStation 4—the franchise's first appearance on the platform. It is a remastered version of "God of War III", and it features full 1080p support targeted at 60 frames per second and a photo mode. The game's announcement and release was in celebration of the franchise's tenth anniversary. It was ported by Wholesale Algorithms.

The series consists of seven <a href="Single-player%20video%20game">single-player-only games</a>, and one that includes <a href="Multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a>. Throughout the first era, the games featured a <a href="Third-person%20%28video%20games%29">third-person</a>, <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Fixed">fixed</a> cinematic camera with the exception of "Betrayal", which is the only installment to feature a 2D side-scrolling view. In 2018's "God of War", the camera was switched from being fixed and became an <a href="Virtual%20camera%20system%23Interactive">over-the-shoulder free camera</a>. A <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> camera is featured in "God of War III" and "Ascension". Throughout the series, the player controls the character Kratos in a combination of <a href="hack%20and%20slash">hack and slash</a> combat, <a href="Platform%20game">platforming</a>, and <a href="Puzzle%20video%20game">puzzle game</a> elements to achieve goals and complete the story (platforming elements were removed from 2018's "God of War" due to the camera change). 2018's "God of War" adds Kratos' son Atreus, and although the game is played entirely as Kratos, there are times when the player may choose to passively control Atreus (a button is dedicated to Atreus, and he will fire an arrow from his bow depending on where the camera is pointed).

Throughout the Greek era, Kratos' main weapon is a pair of <a href="dual%20wield">double-chained blades</a> that appear in three iterations: the Blades of Chaos, the Blades of Athena (or Athena's Blades), and the Blades of Exile. They each perform similarly, but differ in the types of <a href="Combo%20%28video%20gaming%29">combo</a>s and amount of damage each yields, as well as cosmetic differences. Other weapons are also obtained during the games and vary in gameplay. <a href="Magic%20%28gaming%29">Magic</a> is also used, and four abilities are typically acquired. "God of War III" differs in that instead of separate abilities, there are four primary weapons that possess their own respective magic offensive. The game also features "Items"—additional secondary weapons with limited usage, such as the Bow of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>. With each new game, most weapons and magic are lost via a plot device, and a new arsenal of weapons and abilities are acquired during gameplay. "Ascension" differs from the previous games in that instead of acquiring new weapons that are kept throughout the entire game, the player collects up to five World Weapons (such as a sword or a javelin) that have limited usage. When there is not a World Weapon equipped, the player can punch or kick foes as part of a new mechanic added to the game. In 2018's "God of War", Kratos' primary weapon is a magical battle axe called the Leviathan Axe. It can be thrown and summoned back to his hand, similar to <a href="Thor">Thor</a>'s hammer <a href="Mj%C3%B6lnir">Mjölnir</a>. Later on in the game, he recovers the Blades of Chaos, which perform similarly as they did during the Greek games, but with different abilities. Both the Leviathan Axe and Blades of Chaos can be upgraded to use special magical attacks called runic attacks. Each weapon has a light and heavy runic attack, and the player can choose which runic attacks to equip on the weapons.

The series offers combo-based combat, and includes a <a href="quick%20time%20event">quick time event</a> (QTE) feature, also called context sensitive attacks, which is initiated when the player has weakened a foe or to perform a defensive maneuver. It allows limited control of Kratos during the QTE cinematic sequence; success ends the battle, while failure usually results in damage to the player. As well as the QTE system, "Ascension" features a prompt-less free-form system, allowing players the choice of when to attack or dodge based on the enemy's actions. A grab maneuver can be used on minor foes. 2018's "God of War" changed this up; after an enemy has been weakened enough, a prompt will appear above its head, and depending on the enemy, Kratos may rip it in half or grab them and throw them into other enemies, among other possible outcomes. He will also jump on top of and ride large enemies, such as ogres, causing them to attack other enemies, similar to the cyclopes in the Greek games.

Relics, which the player can use in successive games (such as Poseidon's Trident obtained in the original "God of War" allowing Kratos to swim underwater for extended periods) are also found and necessary for game progression. Kratos often has a special ability, which provides temporary invulnerability and increased attack damage. This ability has become an ongoing feature of gameplay throughout the series—Rage of the Gods in the original "God of War" and "Ascension", Rage of the Titans in "God of War II", Rage of Sparta in "God of War III", and Thera's Bane in "Ghost of Sparta". This ability can be recharged by building hits on foes in combat, and gaining game-specific orbs. Thera's Bane, however, is recharged automatically. While Kratos does not retain any relics from the Greek era in 2018's "God of War", he does have a rage ability, called Spartan Rage, and with this ability, Kratos uses powerful bare-handed attacks, as opposed to weapons, to greatly damage enemies.

<a href="Gorgon">Gorgon</a> Eyes and <a href="Phoenix%20%28mythology%29">Phoenix</a> Feathers, found throughout the Greek games in unmarked <a href="Treasure%20chest%20%28video%20games%29">chests</a> (white chests in "Ascension"), increase the maximum amount of <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health</a> and <a href="Magic%20point">magic</a>, respectively. <a href="Minotaur">Minotaur</a> Horns, which increase the Items and Fire meter's maximum length, are available in "God of War III" and "Ghost of Sparta", respectively. The Items meter allows the use of secondary weapons, called Items, and the Fire meter allows the use of Thera's Bane. The meters are increased in increments and reach their maximum once a certain number of Eyes, Feathers, and Horns are found. Other chests contain green, blue, or red <a href="Power-up%23Token%20abilities">orbs</a>. Green orbs replenish the player's health, blue orbs replenish magic allowing further usage, and red orbs provide <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s (XP) for upgrading weapons and magic for new, more powerful attacks, and replenish the Rage meter in the original "God of War". Gold orbs found in "God of War II" and "Ascension", and white orbs in "God of War III", replenish the Rage meter instead of red orbs; the Rage meter in "Ascension" is also refilled by landing attacks on foes. Chests with changing colors, which allow players to choose which meter to replenish, have also been available. Red orbs can also be collected by killing foes and destroying certain inanimate objects. Bosses and more powerful opponents release a combination of colored orbs when killed via the quick-time feature. For 2018's "God of War", <a href="I%C3%B0unn">Iðunn</a>'s <a href="Golden%20apple">Apples</a> replaced the Gorgon Eyes to increase the maximum length of the health meter, while <a href="Drinking%20horn">Horns of Blood Mead</a> increase the maximum length of the rage meter. While the game retains green health orbs to replenish the health meter, magic is done differently. Instead of blue orbs, there is a cool down time on magical runic attacks. Once that cool down time is up, the magical runic attack can be used again. Furthermore, players accumulate a currency called Hacksilver, which is a key component in crafting and purchasing new <a href="Item%20%28gaming%29">items</a>, such as new armor or upgrading existing armor, and XP is used for learning new combat skills. Chests in this game provide a variety of different items.

With the exception of "Ascension", each installment offers a challenge mode, which yields extra red orbs (or XP), secret costumes, and behind-the-scenes videos. <a href="Unlockable%20%28gaming%29">Bonus content</a> can also be unlocked by defeating the game's difficulty levels. 2018's "God of War" also includes a challenge mode, which ends with an optional fight with a <a href="Valkyrie">Valkyrie</a>, who provides various items upon defeat. Battle arenas, which allow players to set difficulty levels and choose their own opponents, are included in "God of War II", "God of War III", and "Ghost of Sparta". A quick-time sex <a href="minigame">mini-game</a> is also included in each installment except "Betrayal", "Ascension", and the 2018 game.

"Ascension" is the only installment in the series to feature multiplayer, which is <a href="Online%20game">online-only</a> for both competitive and cooperative play. Up to eight players on two teams of two to four players (or a four to eight player <a href="deathmatch">deathmatch</a>) battle for control of a map in order to earn rewards from the gods. Players can also fight each other in one-on-one matches. Players must sell their champion's soul to either Zeus, Hades, Ares, or Poseidon, which allows players to try different weapons, armor sets, and powers inspired by the god of their choice, and extras can be unlocked.
After the success of their first game "<a href="Kinetica">Kinetica</a>" (2001), <a href="SIE%20Santa%20Monica%20Studio">Santa Monica Studio</a> began development of the original "God of War" in 2002, and unveiled it two years later at <a href="Sony%20Computer%20Entertainment%20America">SCEA</a> Santa Monica Gamers' Day 2004. Game director and creator <a href="David%20Jaffe">David Jaffe</a> said that although the idea for "God of War" was his own, the concept owed a debt to <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a> because he had played "<a href="Onimusha">Onimusha</a>" and said "let's do that with <a href="Greek%20Mythology">Greek Mythology</a>". He was inspired in part by the 1981 <a href="feature%20film">feature film</a>, "<a href="Clash%20of%20the%20Titans%20%281981%20film%29">Clash of the Titans</a>", saying, "the real high concept for me was ... merging it with "<a href="Heavy%20Metal%20%28magazine%29">Heavy Metal</a>" magazine". He said he liked both "the kids stuff ... with Greek Mythology" and the idea of adding more adult themes such as sex and violence. He was also inspired by the 1981 film "<a href="Raiders%20of%20the%20Lost%20Ark">Raiders of the Lost Ark</a>". Although the game is based on Greek mythology, the development team gave themselves "lots of freedom" to modify the myths, and Jaffe said they took the "coolest aspects of the subject" and created art and story using those elements. Director of visual development and lead concept artist, Charlie Wen, drew inspiration from these films as well as more contemporary films such as "<a href="Gladiator%20%282000%20film%29">Gladiator</a>" (2000) for tonal inspiration to lead the visual design of Kratos, other characters, and the world of "God of War".<ref name="IGN6/10/04"></ref>
<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> said the developers described the gameplay "as merging the action of "<a href="Devil%20May%20Cry">Devil May Cry</a>" with the puzzle-solving of "<a href="Ico">Ico</a>"" and noted that players would be able to "sunder enemies with a single move, such as by ripping them in half". The game uses Santa Monica's <a href="Kinetica%20%28game%20engine%29">Kinetica</a> <a href="Game%20engine">engine</a>, which they developed for "Kinetica".

A sequel to "God of War" was first teased at the end of its credits, which stated, "Kratos Will Return". "God of War II" was officially announced at the 2006 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a> (GDC). David Jaffe stepped down and became the creative director of its sequel and "God of War"s lead animator Cory Barlog assumed the role of game director. Barlog said that in the game, players would see "a larger view of Kratos' role within the mythological world." Like "God of War", the game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine. Magic attacks became an integral part of the combat system and it was more refined. New creatures and heroes from the mythology, and more boss battles were added. Both Jaffe and Barlog said that they did not view "God of War II" as a sequel, but rather a continuation of the previous game. Jaffe said that they did not want to include the <a href="Roman%20numeral">Roman numeral</a> number two (II) in the title for this reason, but they did not want the title to convey the impression it was an <a href="expansion%20pack">expansion pack</a>. Both Jaffe and Barlog said that the reason "God of War II" appeared on the PlayStation 2 instead of the PlayStation 3—which was released four months prior to "God of War II"—was because "there's a 100 million people out there that will be able to play "God of War II" as soon as it launches." Barlog assured that the game would be playable on the newer platform, which originally had PlayStation 2 <a href="Backward%20compatibility">backwards compatibility</a>.<ref name="PALGN7/26/06"></ref><ref name="Spike5/5/06"></ref>

"God of War III" was first mentioned by Cory Barlog at a "God of War II" launch event, and it was officially announced at the 2008 <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3). After the first eight months of development, Barlog left Santa Monica for other opportunities and <a href="Stig%20Asmussen">Stig Asmussen</a> (lead environment artist and art director on "God of War" and "God of War II", respectively) became director. Asmussen said that one of the greatest challenges in developing "God of War III" for the PlayStation 3 was the "complexity of everything"; individual tasks, such as designing Helios' decapitation, could take a year because the "level of detail [that was] expected [was] so high and intricate, it [crossed] multiple departments." He said that the PlayStation 3's hardware capabilities allowed more flexibility in character creation and interaction with the environment.<ref name="IGN12/8/09"></ref><ref name="GamePro11/4/09"></ref> The engine for "God of War III" was ported from the first two installments to the PlayStation 3. As the game was being developed, the code department swapped out PlayStation 2 components with PlayStation 3 components. They replaced the renderer, the particle system, and the collision system. Although they were re-using the engine from "God of War II", the core engine for "God of War III" was brand new. Between <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202009">E3 2009</a> and the time the game shipped, <a href="Spatial%20anti-aliasing">morphological anti-aliasing</a> (MLAA) was added, which graphics engineer Ben Diamand said "improved edges dramatically and saved substantial amounts of frame-rate." Diamand also said that "depth-of-field, motion blur, crepuscular 'god' rays and refraction were either added or improved in quality and speed" during that same time period.<ref name="Euro5/4/13"></ref>

On April 12, 2012, Sony released a teaser image for "Ascension" on its official PlayStation <a href="Facebook">Facebook</a> page, which was followed by the game's announcement on April 19 on <a href="PlayStation.Blog">PlayStation.Blog</a>. Todd Papy, who had previously worked as a designer on "God of War" and "God of War II" and as design director on "God of War III", assumed the role of game director; "God of War III" director Stig Asmussen was busy with another project at Santa Monica and did not work on "Ascension". The announcement officially confirmed the game's title and Papy said it was not titled "God of War IV" to avoid confusion because it is a prequel, rather than a sequel, to the trilogy.<ref name="4/30"></ref> The game features a retooled "God of War III" engine, enabling online multiplayer battles for up to eight players. The decision to add multiplayer came about from curiosity, according to lead combat designer Jason McDonald. The multiplayer was first tested using Kratos, and McDonald said the testers had "a lot of fun". Seeing their reaction made the team feel that the multiplayer had value and they then began to put the ""God of War" spin on it".<ref name="PSBlog3/8/13"></ref> In the developmental transition from "God of War III" to "Ascension", one of the graphics engineers, Cedric Perthuis, noted that the limits of the "God of War III" engine restricted artist creativity, so they "tried to remove or push those limits as far as possible without losing any performance." "Ascension" did not have a graphical leap over its predecessor like "God of War III" did. <a href="Dynamic%20lighting">Dynamic lighting</a> was added, which allowed for development of the Life Cycle gameplay mechanic. Particle effects were also greatly improved upon from "God of War III".

Santa Monica began work on the fifth main installment in 2014, which was confirmed by the returning Cory Barlog at the first annual <a href="PlayStation%20Experience">PlayStation Experience</a> on December 6 that year. The official announcement came at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo%202016">2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) with a gameplay demo. This also confirmed that Barlog had returned to the series as game director. The game was deliberately titled "God of War" with no numeral or subtitle because although it is a continuation of the series, "we are reimagining everything." Other mythologies were also considered for the new setting, but Norse was picked to keep the focus on Kratos; there was also consideration to use a different protagonist, but it was decided to keep Kratos as he "is intrinsically tied" to the series. Most of the development team that worked on the original "God of War" worked on the new installment. They claimed that they matched the new gameplay with the same level of accessibility as the previous installments. Some gameplay characteristics found in the previous installments were cut, such as jumping, swimming, and instant-death <a href="platform%20game">platforming challenges</a>; these were cut due to the camera being closer to Kratos. Although "Ascension" had introduced multiplayer to the series, the team dropped the mode to focus on the single-player experience. The Leviathan Axe was chosen as Kratos' new main weapon because the developers wanted a more grounded direction for the game. The enemy count was increased to up to 100 enemies on-screen; "God of War III" and "Ascension" could do up to 50. Although the game was built for the standard PlayStation 4, Barlog confirmed that it would "benefit from the power" of the <a href="PlayStation%204%20Pro">PlayStation 4 Pro</a>; an updated version of the PlayStation 4 that can render games in <a href="4K%20resolution">4K</a> and was released a few months after "God of War" was announced. The game's story was estimated to take 25–35 hours to complete, which is significantly more than the previous four main installments, which each took an average of 10 hours to complete.
Cory Barlog also confirmed that the 2018 game would not be Kratos' last. He said that future games could see the series tackling <a href="Egyptian%20mythology">Egyptian</a> or <a href="Maya%20mythology">Mayan mythology</a>, and that although the 2018 game focuses on Norse mythology, it alludes to the fact that there are other mythologies co-existing in the world. Barlog also said that he liked the idea of having different directors for each game, seen throughout the first seven games, and although he may not direct another "God of War", he would still be at Santa Monica to work on future games.

Game developer <a href="Ready%20at%20Dawn">Ready at Dawn</a> pitched the idea of a "God of War" game for the PlayStation Portable to Santa Monica Studio soon after the original "God of War" launched. Cory Barlog officially confirmed the development of "Chains of Olympus" at a "God of War II" launch event, stating "It is its own story that connects to the overall story." "Chains of Olympus" uses a proprietary, in-house engine referred to as the Ready at Dawn engine, which expanded on the engine created for their previous game, "<a href="Daxter%20%28video%20game%29">Daxter</a>" (2006). Originally designed for the PlayStation Portable's restricted 222 <a href="megahertz">megahertz</a> (MHz) processor, Ready at Dawn convinced Sony to increase the <a href="clock%20speed">clock speed</a> of the PSP to 333 MHz, which they did in <a href="PlayStation%20Portable%20system%20software%23Version%203">a firmware upgrade</a>. The faster processor allowed for more realistic blood effects, lighting effects, and shadows as well as improved enemy intelligence, but noticeably decreased battery life. After the game's completion, game director Ru Weerasuriya stated multiplayer options and other puzzles, characters, and dialogue had to be removed due to time constraints.

"Ghost of Sparta" was announced on May 4, 2010, on PlayStation.Blog. According to Sony, Ready at Dawn utilized "state-of-the-art visual technologies" that allowed "higher quality environments and characters." "Ghost of Sparta" offers "over 25% more gameplay" than "Chains of Olympus", while adding more enemies on screen and more boss encounters. Development of "Ghost of Sparta" took 23 months to complete. Due to Weerasuriya's schedule at Ready at Dawn, he could not return to direct; Dana Jan, the lead level designer for "Chains of Olympus", became director for "Ghost of Sparta". At <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">Comic-Con 2010</a>, Jan noted that when development began in 2008, the goal was to make the game bigger than "Chains of Olympus", which had apparently pushed the PSP to its functional limits. Jan stated that "Ghost of Sparta" took the PSP to its "absolute capacity", with another feature being more on-screen foes. The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the <a href="PlayStation%20Network%23Trophies">platinum trophy</a> from "God of War III". The trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall.com, which became the official site for "Ghost of Sparta" on May 4. Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between "God of War" and "God of War II" was because "It seemed to make a lot of sense to fill in that void."

"Betrayal" was announced by <a href="Sony%20Online%20Entertainment">Sony Online Entertainment</a> at a press conference in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in May 2007. The game utilizes a total of 110 different animations and features a 2D rendition of the series' <a href="3D%20computer%20graphics">three-dimensional</a> (3D) graphics. Game director Phil Cohen said that although the game was enjoyable to develop, the greatest challenge was creating a single tileset and palette swapping scheme that was diverse enough to portray multiple environments with only several hundred <a href="kilobytes">kilobytes</a>, and that met Santa Monica Studio's high standards. Cohen wrote the initial design document between September and October 2005, and revisited it in August 2006, the month development started. The versions for high-end handsets were completed in April 2007, with final versions for low-end handsets completed by June 2007. The porting team adapted the game to over 200 handsets in a matter of weeks. Both David Jaffe and Cory Barlog ensured that the "Betrayal" development team captured the feel of the combat and visual style, and were "helpful with feedback and positive support".

A film adaptation of the first game was announced in 2005. Creator David Jaffe confirmed that a completed script had been written by <a href="David%20Self">David Self</a> and would be sent to an unspecified director. He said that <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> was behind the making of the "God of War" movie, but was unaware of its current status, and eventually said, "it's doubtful that the film will even be made". In September 2010, Jaffe said that the "script went out a year and a half ago to <a href="Daniel%20Craig">Daniel Craig</a> who plays [James] Bond, but he turned it down". He also said that another actor had since been cast as Kratos; he said, "this new person is pretty good, if that ends up true." In July 2012, "<a href="The%20Hollywood%20Reporter">The Hollywood Reporter</a>" said that writers <a href="Patrick%20Melton">Patrick Melton</a> and <a href="Marcus%20Dunstan">Marcus Dunstan</a> had been hired to adapt the "God of War" film. On August 30, 2012, the writers told IGN that they intend to "humanize" Kratos and explore his past. Melton said that they are emotionally invested and it could become a series of films, and that Ares "will become a more proactive villain". As of 25, 2019, the movie is without a director, no actors have been confirmed, and a release date has not been set, but the script has been "turned in". It has a budget of $150 million <a href="United%20States%20dollar">USD</a>.

"God of War: Unearthing the Legend" (75 minutes, 2010) is a documentary about the "God of War" franchise and is hosted by <a href="Peter%20Weller">Peter Weller</a>. The production discusses the relationship between the "God of War" games and Greek mythology, and features members of the "God of War III" development team and professional historians. It was included as part of the "God of War III Ultimate Edition" (North America) and "Ultimate Trilogy Edition" (Europe, Australia, and New Zealand) packages. On March 25, 2010, it was released on the PlayStation Store in North America to purchase.

"God of War – Game Directors Live" (80 minutes, 2010) is a documentary featuring five game directors of the "God of War" series: David Jaffe (original "God of War"), Cory Barlog (just "God of War II" at the time), Ru Weerasuriya ("Chains of Olympus"), Stig Asmussen ("God of War III"), and Dana Jan ("Ghost of Sparta"). The documentary takes the form of an interview panel hosted by <a href="G4%20%28U.S.%20TV%20channel%29">G4</a>'s <a href="Alison%20Haislip">Alison Haislip</a>, with the five game directors, 150 members of PlayStation.Blog, and members of "GodofWar.com" and "SpartansStandTall.com". It was filmed at the El Portal theater in Los Angeles on September 1, 2010, and was released as a pre-order bonus for "Ghost of Sparta" in North America on November 2, 2010, and was included with the "Origins Collection" and later released on the PlayStation Store.

Kratos also embarks upon a quest to destroy the same elixir to deny it to the worshippers of the slain god Ares, who wish to resurrect him.

In the lead up to "Ascension"s release, Santa Monica released a graphic novel titled "" on the "God of War" website that featured a <a href="Social%20network%20game">social experience</a> from October 2012 until March 2013. The graphic novel was a prequel story that tied into the single-player of "Ascension", and was the backstory of the player's multiplayer character.

A limited comic series from <a href="Dark%20Horse%20Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a>, also titled "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%28Dark%20Horse%20Comics%29">God of War</a>" and written by <a href="Chris%20Roberson%20%28author%29">Chris Roberson</a> with art by Tony Parker, was published from November 2018 to February 2019.

On March 1, 2005, "<a href="God%20of%20War%20%282005%20video%20game%29%23Soundtrack">God of War: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game</a>" was released on CD by SIE as an exclusive product for the <a href="Sony%20Connect">Sony Connect Music Store</a>. It has been praised for its well-developed orchestral themes, and the creative use of ancient and ethnic instrumentation. The composers were also praised for avoiding the production of never-ending action themes. "<a href="God%20of%20War%20II%20Soundtrack">God of War II: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game</a>" was released on CD by SIE on April 10, 2007. Praised as strong, the album features ominous orchestral pieces, and each composer's contributions are slightly more distinctive than the previous soundtrack. "<a href="God%20of%20War%20III%23Soundtrack">God of War III: Original Soundtrack from the Video Game</a>" was released on CD by SIE and <a href="Sumthing%20Else">Sumthing Else</a> on March 30, 2010. It was also included as downloadable content in the "God of War III Ultimate Edition" and "Ultimate Trilogy Edition" collections. The soundtrack was praised as an orchestral success and the best score in the series at that time.

The original scores for "God of War", "God of War II", and "God of War III" were nominated for Best Original Score at the 2005, 2007, and 2010 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, respectively. The "God of War Trilogy Soundtrack" was included with the "God of War III Ultimate Edition" and "Ultimate Trilogy Edition" collections as downloadable content.

On October 18, 2010, "" was released on the <a href="iTunes%20Store">iTunes Store</a> by SIE. It was also included as downloadable content as part of the "Ghost of Sparta" pre-order package and includes three bonus tracks from "Chains of Olympus". Several tracks were cited as being intended for purely contextual purposes, and the remaining tracks rated well in comparison to the soundtracks of the main installments in the series. "" differed from the previously released soundtracks as it was composed by Tyler Bates alone, and is the only "God of War" score that he has worked on. It was released on March 5, 2013, on iTunes by SIE and La-La Land Records. It was included as downloadable content in the "God of War: Ascension–Collector's Edition" and "Special Edition". Reviewers praised it for being powerful, rich, and pulsing, though felt it was repetitive at times. Bear McCreary is the most recent composer to work on the series as he composed the music for 2018's "God of War" on PlayStation 4.

"God of War: Blood & Metal" is a <a href="heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a> homage by various bands on the <a href="Roadrunner%20Records">Roadrunner Records</a> label, and features original music inspired by the "God of War" video game series.

Square Enix Music Online (8/10) stated the album is a "good selection of metal music" and listeners will be "surprised with the variety of music".

Track listing

With physical and digital copies combined, the "God of War" franchise has sold over 27 million games worldwide. "God of War" (2005), "God of War II", "Chains of Olympus", "God of War Collection", "God of War III", and "God of War" (2018) each received critical acclaim from several reviewers as compiled by <a href="review%20aggregator">review aggregator</a> <a href="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, with both the 2005 and 2018 titles being tied for the highest score in the franchise at 94/100. "Betrayal" and "Ghost of Sparta" only received generally favorable reception. "Ascension" also only had a generally favorable reception and, not including the PlayStation Vita port of "God of War Collection", it has the lowest score in the series from Metacritic (80/100).

At the time of its release, Raymond Padilla of <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> wrote that the original "God of War" was the "best action game ever to grace the PS2". Other critics similarly said that it was one of the best action games of all time; it received over a dozen "Game of the Year" awards. In 2009, it was named the "seventh best" PlayStation 2 game of all time on <a href="IGN">IGN</a>'s "Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time" list. "God of War II" was also on IGN's list, and was named the "second best" PlayStation 2 game of all time. "God of War II" was similarly called one of the best action games of all time and is considered the <a href="swan%20song">swan song</a> of the PlayStation 2 era. In November 2012, <a href="Complex.com">Complex.com</a> named "God of War II" the best PlayStation 2 game of all time—where "God of War" was named the 11th best—and consider it better than its successor, "God of War III". "Betrayal" was acclaimed for its fidelity to the series in terms of gameplay, art style, and graphics.

"Chains of Olympus" was praised for "fantastic" graphics and "tight and responsive" controls for the PSP at the time. In 2008, IGN awarded "Chains of Olympus" the "Best PSP Action Game", and in September 2010, it was listed as the best PSP game by "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>". "God of War III" received praise for its graphics, in particular of Kratos; at the time, IGN stated that Kratos was "perhaps the single most impressive-looking character ever in videogames." IGN also said that, at the time, "God of War III" "redefines what the word 'scale' means with regards to videogames, as it throws you into scenes with Titans that are larger than entire levels in some other games." "God of War III" received awards for "Most Anticipated Game of 2010" and "Best PS3 Game" at the 2009 and 2010 Spike Video Game Awards, respectively. The game also won the "Artistic Achievement" award at the 2011 <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> awards. "Ghost of Sparta" was praised for its graphics and story, with Chris Pereira of 1UP saying that it was "a more personal story than the [previous] "GOW" games." It received several awards at E3 2010, including "Best Handheld Game", "Best PSP Game", and "PSP Game of Show", and won "Best Handheld Game" at the 2010 Spike Video Game Awards. 2018's "God of War" received particular praise for its art direction, graphics, combat system, music, story, use of Norse mythology, characters, and cinematic feeling. Many also felt that it had successfully revitalized the series without losing the core identity of its predecessors. It won several awards, among which were "Game of the Year" and "Best Game Direction" at <a href="The%20Game%20Awards%202018">The Game Awards 2018</a> and "Best Storytelling" and "PlayStation Game of the Year" at the 2018 <a href="Golden%20Joystick%20Awards">Golden Joystick Awards</a>.

The series has also received criticism because of problems with puzzles, weapons, and technical issues. "Chains of Olympus" was criticized by G4, who stated that the game "occasionally suffers from screen tearing and framerate drops", and that some of the puzzles "are so maddeningly difficult to solve". The game was also criticized for its lack of variety in enemies, its continued use of puzzles that require players to move boxes, and its relatively short story. "God of War III" also received some criticism. <a href="GameFront">GameFront</a>'s Phil Hornshaw said it had an overly cruel protagonist, and the game assumed that the players reveled in the misery and violence as much as Kratos did. IGN complained about the game's weapons, and said "that two of the three additional weapons that you'll earn are extremely similar to your blades. They have unique powers and slightly different moves, but by and large, they're more of the same." "Ghost of Sparta" received criticism from "<a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a>", which said that the "game's primary problem ... is in its in-built focus" and that "there is a sense that "Ghost of Sparta" is a step back for the series if you've played ["God of War III"]." Some reviewers stated that "Ascension"s story was not as compelling as previous installments, with IGN stating that in comparison to Zeus and Ares, "the Furies don’t quite cut it". The multiplayer received a mixed response. Although reviewers claimed gameplay translated well into the multiplayer, they were critical of the balance and depth of combat. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" magazine approved of the multiplayer, stating it is an "evolutionary step" with "some fine ideas ... that will form part of this genre's future template." 2018's "God of War" received some criticism, for example, a couple of reviewers disliked that the <a href="fast%20travel">fast travel</a> option unlocked very late into the game.

The collections have also received praise. IGN (9.4/10) awarded "God of War Collection" (PS3) the "Editor's Choice" Award and praised the enhanced resolutions, lower price point and smoother frame rates, and stated it was the "definitive way to play the game[s]". Due to the success of "God of War Collection", Sony announced that further titles would receive similar treatment for release under its new "Classics HD" brand. The "Origins Collection" was similarly well received. IGN (9/10) stated "Sony succeeded at making good games better", although "GamePro" criticized it for its lack of new bonus content. "God of War Saga" also received praise. Ryan Fleming of <a href="Digital%20Trends">Digital Trends</a> wrote that the collection "is perhaps the best value buy for any console available," although the collection is not likely for fans of the series, but rather inexperienced players or newcomers. "God of War III Remastered" was met with generally favorable reception. Praise was given to the smoother textures and improved frame rate, though because the original already had remarkable graphics, the changes were not major, and reviewers said these changes were not a strong enough argument to rebuy the game for $40 USD.

A section of the highway originally served as part of Military Road, a connection between <a href="Fort%20Wilkins">Fort Wilkins</a> and <a href="Fort%20Howard%20%28Wisconsin%29">Fort Howard</a> during the Civil War. US 41 replaced the original <a href="M-15%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-15</a> designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Michigan state trunkline highway system. M-15 ran from Menominee through <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> to <a href="Houghton%2C%20Michigan">Houghton</a> and ended in Copper Harbor. Realignments and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes in <a href="Delta%20County%2C%20Michigan">Delta</a> and <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> counties and have created three <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>s off the main highway.

US 41 is a major highway for Michigan traffic in the Upper Peninsula. The highway comprises mostly two lanes; it is <a href="divided%20highway">undivided</a> except for the sections that are <a href="Concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> with <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a> near <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a> and <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a> near <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a>. US 41/M-28 is a four-lane <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a> along the "Marquette Bypass", and segments of the highway in <a href="Delta%20County%2C%20Michigan">Delta</a> and <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a> counties have four lanes. The route from the southern terminus to downtown <a href="Houghton%2C%20Michigan">Houghton</a> is part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways considered important to the nation's economy, defense and mobility. Sections of the trunkline are on the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Superior</a> and <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan</a> circle tours.

US 41 enters Michigan on the <a href="Interstate%20Bridge%20%28Marinette%2C%20Wisconsin%20%E2%80%93%20Menominee%2C%20Michigan%29">Interstate Bridge</a> connecting <a href="Marinette%2C%20Wisconsin">Marinette, Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="Menominee%2C%20Michigan">Menominee, Michigan</a>. In the city of Menominee, US 41 follows 10th Avenue and 10th Street just west of downtown. The highway meets the southern terminus of <a href="M-35%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-35</a>, with the <a href="Menominee-Marinette%20Twin%20County%20Airport">Menominee-Marinette Airport</a> to its west, and the waters of the <a href="Green%20Bay%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">Green Bay</a> less than to the east, following 10th Street out of town. The trunkline runs north through rolling farmland in the central <a href="Menominee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Menominee County</a> communities of <a href="Wallace%2C%20Menominee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wallace</a>, <a href="Stephenson%2C%20Michigan">Stephenson</a>, and the twin communities of <a href="Carney%2C%20Michigan">Carney</a> and <a href="Nadeau%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Nadeau</a>. At <a href="Powers%2C%20Michigan">Powers</a>, US 41 joins with US 2; the two highways run concurrently and turn east toward <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a>. US 2/US 41 crosses into the <a href="Hannahville%20Indian%20Community">Hannahville Indian Community</a> at the communities of <a href="Harris%2C%20Michigan">Harris</a> in Menominee County and <a href="Bark%20River%2C%20Michigan">Bark River</a> in <a href="Delta%20County%2C%20Michigan">Delta County</a>. The county line between the two communities marks the boundary between the <a href="Central%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Eastern</a> time zones.

Just west of downtown Escanaba, US 2/US 41 joins M-35 at the intersection of Ludington Street and Lincoln Road, the center of the Escanaba street grid. The trunkline enters Escanaba from the west on Ludington Street, turns north on Lincoln Road, and joins M-35. The combined highway then runs north adjacent to <a href="Little%20Bay%20de%20Noc">Little Bay de Noc</a> using a four-lane divided highway to the city of <a href="Gladstone%2C%20Michigan">Gladstone</a>, where M-35 turns west along 4th Avenue North. US 2/US 41 continues on a four-lane expressway north to <a href="Rapid%20River%2C%20Michigan">Rapid River</a> at the end of Little Bay de Noc. There, US 2 turns east, and US 41 turns north and inland to cross the Upper Peninsula.

The section of US 41 between Menominee and Escanaba illustrates an anomaly in the highway routing: between these two cities M-35 is the shortest state trunkline highway. Under <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20and%20Transportation%20Officials">American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials</a> guidelines, <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">US Highways</a> are to follow the most direct path between two locations, but US 41 runs inland and M-35 goes more directly up the Lake Michigan shoreline. According to the 2007 MDOT state highway map, the US 41 routing runs for versus for M-35. The original map for the US Highway System shows US 41 continuing north from <a href="Powers%2C%20Michigan">Powers</a> on a direct line to <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a>. This routing would be more direct than the current US 41 routing via Escanaba and Rapid River, but has not been built.

This stretch of US 41 runs north through the western edge of the <a href="Hiawatha%20National%20Forest">Hiawatha National Forest</a>. At <a href="Trenary%2C%20Michigan">Trenary</a>, US 41 turns northwest through the southwest corner of <a href="Alger%20County%2C%20Michigan">Alger County</a>, crossing into <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a> north of <a href="Kiva%2C%20Michigan">Kiva</a>. M-94 follows US 41 for approximately near <a href="Skandia%2C%20Michigan">Skandia</a>, before it turns westward to provide access to <a href="K.%20I.%20Sawyer%20Air%20Force%20Base">K. I. Saywer</a>, a former air force base. US 41 continues northerly into the <a href="Chocolay%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Chocolay Township</a> community of <a href="Harvey%2C%20Michigan">Harvey</a>. It meets the eastern junction with <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a> in Harvey, and the two highways run concurrent for nearly , during which they follow the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Superior Circle Tour</a>.
US 41/M-28 runs north along the <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a> shoreline, passing the <a href="Marquette%20Branch%20Prison">Marquette Branch Prison</a> and crossing the Carp River before cresting Shiras Hill on the way into the city of <a href="Marquette%2C%20Michigan">Marquette</a>, entering town on Front Street. South of downtown, the highway turns west on the Marquette Bypass, a four-lane expressway complete with two overpasses. The bypass moves traffic around the former routing of US 41/M-28 along Front and Washington streets, a routing that was used for <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20Business%20%28Marquette%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 41</a> (Bus. US 41) until 2005. West of Washington Street, US 41/M-28 follows a heavily trafficked business corridor. The 2006 <a href="average%20annual%20daily%20traffic">average annual daily traffic</a> (AADT, the yearly traffic count divided by 365) along this corridor ranged from 31,700 to 34,700 vehicles. US 41/M-28 climbs hilly terrain into the cities of <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a> and <a href="Ishpeming%2C%20Michigan">Ishpeming</a>, running west and slightly south. The two cities host <a href="M-28%20Business%20%28Ishpeming%E2%80%93Negaunee%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. M-28</a>, which was once designated as ALT US 41 as well. Between the twin cities, US 41/M-28 skirts the shores of <a href="Teal%20Lake%20%28Michigan%29">Teal Lake</a> in Negaunee and then narrows to two lanes west of Ishpeming.

US 41/M-28 continues west through rural Marquette County and passes along the north shore of <a href="Lake%20Michigamme">Lake Michigamme</a> between <a href="Champion%2C%20Michigan">Champion</a> and <a href="Michigamme%2C%20Michigan">Michigamme</a>, crossing the Peshekee River. In eastern <a href="Baraga%20County%2C%20Michigan">Baraga County</a>, the highway runs along an isthmus between Lake George and Lake Ruth in the community of <a href="Three%20Lakes%2C%20Michigan">Three Lakes</a>. Further west, US 41 meets the northern terminus of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20141">US 141</a>, which marks the western junction with M-28 near <a href="Covington%2C%20Michigan">Covington</a>, and the end of the M-28 concurrency.

US 41 turns north solo from Covington, crossing the Sturgeon River, on the way to the historic sawmill town of <a href="Alberta%2C%20Michigan">Alberta</a>. <a href="Henry%20Ford">Henry Ford</a> built the village to serve the sawmill in 1935. The Alberta mill supplied wood for <a href="Ford%20Motors">Ford Motors</a> until it was closed by <a href="Henry%20Ford%20II">Henry Ford II</a>; the property was donated to <a href="Michigan%20Technological%20University">Michigan Technological University</a> (MTU) in 1954.
Continuing north from Alberta, US 41 enters the town of <a href="L%27Anse%2C%20Michigan">L'Anse</a> on the east side of <a href="Keweenaw%20Bay">Keweenaw Bay</a>, rounding the bay to the town of <a href="Baraga%2C%20Michigan">Baraga</a>. Both towns are a part of the <a href="Keweenaw%20Bay%20Indian%20Community">Keweenaw Bay Indian Community</a>. US 41 continues along the shores of the bay north into <a href="Houghton%20County%2C%20Michigan">Houghton County</a>, turning along <a href="Portage%20Lake%20%28Keweenaw%29">Portage Lake</a> near <a href="Chassell%2C%20Michigan">Chassell</a>.

US 41 enters <a href="Houghton%2C%20Michigan">Houghton</a> along Townsend Drive on the campus of MTU. After crossing the campus, it uses College Avenue into downtown. There, US 41 is split along the <a href="one-way%20pair">one-way pair</a>ing of Sheldon Avenue for northbound and Montezuma Avenue for southbound traffic. The two streets merge west of downtown at the southern end of the <a href="Portage%20Lake%20Lift%20Bridge">Portage Lake Lift Bridge</a>. Downtown Houghton marks the start of the Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway.
North of the lift bridge, US 41 turns west through the downtown of <a href="Hancock%2C%20Michigan">Hancock</a> using the one-way pairing of Quincy Street northbound and Hancock Street southbound. The trunkline then follows Lincoln Drive after merging the two directions west of downtown. The highway continues up Quincy Hill and out of town, passing the <a href="Quincy%20Mine">Quincy Mine</a> at the top of the hill. North of Hancock, US 41 passes the <a href="Houghton%20County%20Memorial%20Airport">Houghton County Memorial Airport</a> before reaching the towns of <a href="Calumet%2C%20Michigan">Calumet</a> and <a href="Laurium%2C%20Michigan">Laurium</a>. US 41 merges with <a href="M-26%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-26</a> in Calumet, and they follow the center of the Keweenaw Peninsula to the community of <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Michigan">Phoenix</a>. M-26 turns northwesterly in Phoenix to loop through <a href="Eagle%20River%2C%20Michigan">Eagle River</a> and <a href="Eagle%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Eagle Harbor</a>, while US 41 turns easterly through the rural communities of <a href="Central%20Mine%20Historic%20District">Central</a> and <a href="Delaware%2C%20Michigan">Delaware</a>. The two highways meet one last time in <a href="Copper%20Harbor%2C%20Michigan">Copper Harbor</a> where M-26 ends. US 41 turns east on Gratiot Street to pass through town towards <a href="Fort%20Wilkins%20State%20Park">Fort Wilkins State Park</a>. A mileage sign in Copper Harbor gives the distance down US 41 to <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami, Florida</a>, as . The roadway continues east, crossing Fanny Hooe Creek near the state park. Past the park entrance, US 41 ends at a cul-de-sac, marked by a large wooden sign.

There are two major eras of the history of US 41. The first dates back to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and a wagon road built by the federal government. The Military Road was built to connect the <a href="Copper%20Country">Copper Country</a> with <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. After the establishment of the <a href="Michigan%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway system</a>, a segment of the Military Road was used for <a href="M-15%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-15</a>, the predecessor of US 41.

The northernmost section of the modern US 41 between Houghton and Copper Harbor originated in the 19th century as the Military Road. The road was one of 13 roads built between 1817 and 1864 by the federal government. Construction of the road was proposed as early as two years after the US acquired the last tracts of land in the Upper Peninsula. <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> asked Secretary of War <a href="William%20Wilkins%20%28U.S.%20politician%29">William Wilkins</a> for funding to build such a road in 1844, since the area depended on a land connection to <a href="Green%20Bay%2C%20Wisconsin">Green Bay, Wisconsin</a>, for up to six months a year for supplies and mail. The estimate for a , crude road was $37,400 (equivalent to $ in ). The matter died until 1848 when the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> petitioned Congress for an appropriation to build to connect <a href="Green%20Bay%20%28Lake%20Michigan%29">Green Bay</a> to the <a href="Keweenaw%20Bay">Keweenaw Bay</a>. The appeal went unfulfilled by the government, but private groups stepped in. Mail service was available overland once a month during the winter from Green Bay. In 1857, the Legislature enacted a law to provide a road from Eagle Harbor south to <a href="Ontonagon%2C%20Michigan">Ontonagon</a>. This road was extended south to the state line pursuant to two laws in 1859.
The Civil War refocused discussions about the road. There were fears that Great Britain would enter on the side of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederacy</a> during the early days of the war. British troops were as close to Michigan as <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>, and more than half of the copper used in the US came from mines along the proposed roadway. Control of the area could have been established by seizing the <a href="Soo%20Locks">Soo Locks</a> at <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>, severing communication lines through the <a href="Great%20Lakes">Great Lakes</a>. If the locks fell to an enemy force, no troops or supplies could be moved to the <a href="Copper%20Country">Copper Country</a> except by land. The road was also needed during the five or six months of the year that transportation on the Great Lakes was barred by ice or stormy weather.

Congress passed a law to build a military wagon road on March 3, 1863 from Fort Wilkins to Houghton and then south to the state line. The road was laid out in 1864 following what is today <a href="M-26%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-26</a> between Copper Harbor and Phoenix, US 41 south to Houghton, M-26 south to <a href="Winona%2C%20Michigan">Winona</a> and <a href="Forest%20Highway%2016">Federal Forest Highway 16</a> (FFH-16) to the state line. Wisconsin authorities ran the road along what is now <a href="Highway%2029%20%28Wisconsin%29">Highway 29</a> between Green Bay and <a href="Shawano%2C%20Wisconsin">Shawano</a> and <a href="Highway%2055%20%28Wisconsin%29">Highway 55</a> north to the state line. Military Road would connect Fort Wilkins with <a href="Fort%20Howard%20%28Wisconsin%29">Fort Howard</a> near Green Bay.

The laws setting up the construction of the Military Road established a five-year deadline for construction. The war removed laborers in mining, lumbering and shipping as well as soldiers from the available workforce, and Congress extended the deadline an additional 21 months in June 1868. A second extension was granted in May 1870. The Wisconsin section of the highway was completed on June 20, 1870. The Houghton County segment was finished in January 1871. The Keweenaw County section was completed by August 1871. A third and final extension on the deadline was needed in April 1872, and the roadway was completed south to the state line in September 1873, shifting the southern segment in the Upper Peninsula west to the modern <a href="U.S.%20Route%2045%20in%20Michigan">US 45</a> corridor in place of the FFH-16 alignment.

In payment for the completion of the road, close to were awarded by the federal government to the corporation, including some to Dr James Ayer of <a href="Lowell%2C%20Massachusetts">Lowell, Massachusetts</a>, for his investments in the company. Most of the remaining land grants went to the company behind the Portage Lake Canal near Houghton and Hancock. Ayer's holdings were controlled by the trustees of his estate after his death in July 1878. A few thousand acres were sold over time, and the trustees benefitted from the sale of timber and the mineral rights. The profits had been exhausted by 1921, and the remaining tracts were sold to a lumberman from <a href="Grand%20Rapids%2C%20Michigan">Grand Rapids</a> for $2.3 million (equivalent to $ in ).

Railroads built near the Military Road attracted more traffic than the road. The road was not well built; except in the winter when the weather froze the ground or covered it in snow, the road was barely passable. Most of the highway was converted into a state trunkline between 1913 and 1920, mostly as M-15 or M-26. Remnants of the original Military Road can be found as backwoods trails labeled "Old Military Road" on maps, or as a street in <a href="Ripley%2C%20Michigan">Ripley</a> near Hancock called "Military Road".

The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 41 was M-15, in use as far back as 1919. The 1925 draft plan for the establishment of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highways">US Highway System</a> would have replaced parts of M-15 with three different US Highways. Between Menominee and Powers, M-15 was to become US 41. East of Powers to Rapid River, the trunkline would have been US 2. The next segment between Rapid River and <a href="Humboldt%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Humboldt</a> was planned as <a href="U.S.%20Route%20102">US 102</a> while the remainder north to Copper Harbor was not initially planned as a part of the new highway system. When the system was created on November 11, 1926, US 41 was the only US Highway routed along the alignment of M-15, and US 41 extended north to Copper Harbor. The original map showed US 41 following an unbuilt alignment between Powers and Marquette. The new US 41 designation was instead routed to follow the former M-15.
The 1927 edition of the official Michigan highway service map was the first to show <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a> extended along US 41 into <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a> and east over the former <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a> through <a href="Munising%2C%20Michigan">Munising</a> and <a href="Newberry%2C%20Michigan">Newberry</a>, before ending in downtown <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>. At <a href="Negaunee%2C%20Michigan">Negaunee</a>, M-28 was shown along the previous routing of M-15 between Negaunee and Marquette for , while US 41 ran along a portion of <a href="M-35%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-35</a>. This southern loop routing of M-28 lasted until approximately 1936, when M-28 was displayed as concurrent with US 41. The former route is now Marquette County Road 492 (CR 492). Around 1930, the northern terminus of US 41 was extended east from Copper Harbor to Fort Wilkins State Park. Another realignment shown in 1937 marked the transfer of US 41/M-28 out of downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee. This former routing later became <a href="M-28%20Business%20%28Ishpeming%E2%80%93Negaunee%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. M-28</a>. The highway was realigned due north between Rapid River and Trenary according to the 1938 service map. US 41 was completely paved in 1951. The final two sections to be paved were in <a href="Baraga%20County%2C%20Michigan">Baraga County</a> and <a href="Keweenaw%20County%2C%20Michigan">Keweenaw County</a>.
M-35 was routed concurrently with US 41 between Negaunee and Baraga by 1953. This extra concurrency connected the two previously disconnected segments of M-35. The Portage Lake Bridge opened in 1959 at a cost of $13 million (equivalent to $ in ).

The Marquette Bypass was opened in November 1963 as a four-lane expressway south of downtown Marquette at a cost of $1.7 million (equivalent to $ in ). Washington and Front streets in Marquette were redesignated as <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20Business%20%28Marquette%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 41</a> at this time. While the expressway was being built, a large vein of <a href="jasper">jasper</a> exposed, and gifts fashioned from the mineral were presented to local and state politicians. A set of cufflinks to be given to President <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> was never presented because he <a href="Assassination%20of%20John%20F.%20Kennedy">was killed in Dallas</a> just hours after the Marquette Bypass opened to traffic.

The concurrency with M-35 through Marquette and Baraga counties was removed in January 1969. M-35 west of Baraga was designated as a new <a href="M-38%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-38</a> and M-35 was shortened to its current northern terminus. Another expressway section of US 41 was denoted along US 2/US 41 between Gladstone and Rapid River in 1972. A Bus. M-28 designation was added to Bus. US 41 on the MDOT map in 1975, making it similar to the former Bus. US 41/Bus. M-28 designation along <a href="M-28%20Business%20%28Ishpeming-Negaunee%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. M-28</a> in Ishpeming and Negaunee. This second designation was removed by 1982.

US 41 in the Copper Country was recognized on September 26, 1995, as the state's first scenic heritage route (now a <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a>). The first section given the designation ran from <a href="Central%2C%20Michigan">Central</a> to Copper Harbor. The designation was extended south to Mohawk in 2002 and Houghton in 2004. On September 22, 2005, US 41 north of Houghton was designated the Copper Country Trail of the <a href="National%20Scenic%20Byways">National Scenic Byways</a> program. This section of the highway was named one of "Country" magazine's 10 "Best Scenic Roads in America" in November 2014.

Construction started on November 1, 2004, to replace the Interstate Bridge carrying US 41 between Marinette, Wisconsin, and Menominee. The project wrapped up on November 22, 2005, when the new bridge opened to traffic. A ribbon-cutting ceremony was held on December 3, 2005, to celebrate the replacement of the 1929 structure. In 2011, MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County to , although truck traffic remained set at until 2017.

MDOT unveiled plans on March 31, 2009, to rebuild the intersection between Front Street and the eastern end of the Marquette Bypass during 2010 as a <a href="roundabout">roundabout</a>, replacing several intersecting roadways that connect the north and south sections of Front Street with US 41/M-28 through the existing intersection. The previous intersection configuration dated back to November 1963. It had been labeled as "dangerous and [causing] significant traffic delays" by the designers of the replacement. A traffic study concluded in 2007 that the intersection would need either the roundabout or a traffic signal with several turning lanes to accommodate the traffic needs in the area. MDOT decided in favor of a two-lane, roundabout retaining the right-turn lanes from the previous intersection layout. These lanes will be used by right-turning traffic to bypass the circle at the center of the intersection.

MDOT engineers touted the constant-flowing nature of the design as a benefit to the new intersection, and city planners promoted the enhanced safety aspects of the project. Both parties stated the planned intersection was less expensive than a conventional stop light. Residents have expressed concerns about snow plowing and truck traffic in the intersection. The designers consulted officials of <a href="Avon%2C%20Colorado">Avon, Colorado</a>, where several roundabouts are situated in a location that averages over of annual snowfall. Designers planned the size of the new intersection to accommodate truck traffic. MDOT has stated that many of the concerns expressed are due to misconceptions and unfounded assumptions about the design. The department held an informational meeting with the residents on April 15, 2010 before construction began. Topics ranged from emergency vehicles, plowing, trucks, accidents and detour plans.

Construction started on the project in May. One lane of traffic in each direction was maintained for US 41/M-28. Motorists seeking access to downtown were detoured via Grove Street or Lakeshore Boulevard. The Downtown Development Authority had plans to purchase billboards helping to direct customers to the downtown shopping district. A section of the intersection was opened in July to traffic from the south that turns west. The lanes northbound into downtown were opened in the beginning of August, and the city held a ribbon cutting ceremony on August 19, 2010. The remaining lanes were opened the next day. To address residents' concerns about truck traffic through the intersection, the mayor noted that a large lumber truck successfully navigated the roundabout after the ribbon was cut. "It just cruised right around and through. All of these people who are wondering is it big enough, can you get a firetruck on it? Yes, you can," stated Mayor John Kivela.

In 2010, officials from MDOT announced a $2.3 million project to move a section of US 41 about inland along a set of cliffs north of Baraga. The sandstone cliffs were eroding next to Keweenaw Bay, and a 2007 study from <a href="Michigan%20Technological%20University">MTU</a> said that action at that time would be needed within a decade. The department had funding available in 2010 and decided to take on the project at the time. Local homes were not affected by the project, although the state had to purchase property to accommodate the shift. A parallel rail line was removed in the project. Rail service from Baraga to Chassell has been suspended for several years, and the <a href="Right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> had been overgrown with brush; the rails will be replaced if needed in the future. The project was completed in October 2010.

Seven bridges along the US 41 corridor have been recognized for their historic character by various organizations. Six of the seven are listed on MDOT's Historic Bridge Inventory; the seventh not listed by MDOT is on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP) and Michigan's State Register of Historic Sites (SRHS) along with four of the others.

The Portage Lake Lift Bridge connects the cities of Hancock and Houghton by crossing over the Portage Waterway, an arm of <a href="Portage%20Lake%20%28Keweenaw%29">Portage Lake</a> that cuts across the <a href="Keweenaw%20Peninsula">Keweenaw Peninsula</a>. A canal links the final several miles of the lake arm to Lake Superior to the northwest.
This <a href="lift%20bridge">lift bridge</a> features a middle section capable of being raised from a low point of of clearance over the water to a clearance of to allow boats to pass underneath. The Portage Lake Lift Bridge is the widest and heaviest double-decked vertical lift bridge in the world. The lower deck of the span was originally open to rail traffic when it was built in 1959, but this level is now closed to trains and is used in the winter for snowmobile traffic.

The lift bridge is the last of several previous crossings over the waterway. A wooden <a href="swing%20bridge">swing bridge</a> was built in 1875. A newer, iron swing bridge was built in 1897; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it was struck by a ship. This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until the lift bridge was opened in December 1959. The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982, after the <a href="Soo%20Line%20Railroad">Soo Line</a> rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976. The middle section is left in an intermediate position for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the lower deck of the lift span and pleasure craft can pass under the bridge. In the winter, the lift span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the lower deck while cars and trucks use the upper deck.

The Interstate Bridge was built in 1929 for $700,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to carry US 41 over the <a href="Menominee%20River">Menominee River</a> at the state line. This span replaced a series of bridges built to connect Marinette, Wisconsin, and Menominee, Michigan, across the river. The first bridge was built in 1865 with a second built in 1872 that was replaced in 1929 with the third bridge. This third crossing was in length, consisting of eleven spans. The bridge was rehabilitated in 1970 in a project that included widening the deck and replacing the guard rails. Another construction project in 1999 repaired the Michigan side and the slough bridge portion of the Wisconsin side of the structure; the project closed the bridge for six months.
The Interstate Bridge was completely replaced starting on November 1, 2004, in a joint project between the MDOT and the <a href="Wisconsin%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Wisconsin Department of Transportation</a>. The 13-month project was budgeted to cost $6.45 million (equivalent to $ in ). Demolition started in the center of the crossing, sawing the deck into pieces for disposal. This reconstruction was completed ahead of schedule, and the span reopened on November 22, 2005. The project completely replaced the bridge above the water line with wider traffic lanes, a new bicycle lane and wider sidewalks. Images of wild rice were sculpted into the concrete because "Menominee" in the local <a href="Menominee%20language">Menominee language</a> means "wild rice". These sculptures were added to the other decorative elements placed on the new bridge including the railings and light poles. The new Interstate Bridge was dedicated on December 3, 2005, in a ribbon-cutting ceremony that replicated the 1930 ceremony on the previous crossing.

Five other bridges are listed on the NRHP and the Michigan SRHS as well as on the MDOT Historic Bridge Inventory. The first is in <a href="Limestone%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Limestone Township</a> in Alger County. Designated <a href="King%20Road%E2%80%93Whitefish%20River%20Bridge">Trunk Line Bridge No. 264</a>, it carries King Road across the Whitefish River along a former alignment of US 41 built in 1919. Constructed of two through girders, the span continues to carry traffic although it is no longer on a state trunkline highway.
Drivers cannot use the <a href="Trunk%20Line%20Bridge%20No.%201">Peshekee River Bridge</a> south of US 41/M-28 in western <a href="Marquette%20County%2C%20Michigan">Marquette County</a>'s <a href="Michigamme%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Michigamme Township</a>. The structure was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999 for its engineering and architectural significance. MDOT has listed it on their Historic Bridge Inventory as "one of Michigan's most important vehicular bridges". It was the first bridge designed by the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD), the forerunner to MDOT, in 1914. As the first crossing, it was designated "Trunk Line Bridge No. 1" and served as the prototype for hundreds of similar concrete through-girder bridges built in the state before the design fell out of favor in 1930. It was bypassed by a new structure built over the Peshekee River for US 41/M-28 and subsequently abandoned as a roadway, deteriorating in a county park.

Another abandoned bridge is now privately owned and in use at the mouth of the <a href="Old%20US%2041%E2%80%93Backwater%20Creek%20Bridge">Backwater Creek</a> on the <a href="Keweenaw%20Bay">Keweenaw Bay</a> near L'Anse. The span was constructed in 1918 for $4,536 (equivalent to $ in ). It is an <a href="truss%20bridge">Warren truss</a> design now situated on private property. This abandoned bridge was listed on the National Register in 1999.

One bridge still in use crosses the Sturgeon River in Baraga County, known locally as the <a href="Canyon%20Falls%20Bridge">Canyon Falls Bridge</a>. The structure was completed in 1948 as a <a href="steel%20arch%20bridge">steel arch bridge</a> to span the river near the falls as part of a reconstruction project of US 41 between Ishpeming and L'Anse. The crossing has a main span of flanked by two approach spans.

The last historic bridge on US 41 is located near the northern terminus east of Copper Harbor. The <a href="US%2041%E2%80%93Fanny%20Hooe%20Creek%20Bridge">Fanny Hooe Creek crossing</a> was listed on the NRHP in 1999, but , MDOT has not included the structure on its inventory of historic bridges online. The creek crossing is just west of the Fort Wilkins State Park entrance. MSHD and the Keweenaw County Road Commission designed and built the span in 1927–28 for $8,132 (equivalent to $ in ). The bridge is unique for its stonework decoration on the span over the creek. This stonework includes fieldstones not usually associated with Michigan highway bridges. The crossing has remained in service since construction without alteration.

Seven memorial designations have been applied to sections of US 41. Some of these designations follow other highways that run concurrently with US 41. Most of the designations are no longer in use, but the Jacobetti and Veterans memorial highways still have signage posted on the side of the road.

The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau. A predecessor of the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tour">Great Lakes Circle Tour</a>s years later, the route followed "... a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ..." This route followed the modern US 41 from the M-28 junction in Harvey to Copper Harbor. A branch of the route followed US 2/US 41 between Powers and Rapid River. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan; the side trips to Lake Superior distracted from this mission.

Sheridan Road was created in the early 20th century connecting <a href="Chicago%2C%20Illinois">Chicago</a> with <a href="Fort%20Sheridan">Fort Sheridan</a> north of the city. Both the road and the fort were named in honor of <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, Union general during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>. Sheridan, who served as colonel of the 2nd Michigan Cavalry in 1862, was later promoted to the rank of major general during the war. The Greater Sheridan Road Association started to promote an extension of the road south to <a href="St.%20Louis%2C%20Missouri">St. Louis</a> and north through Wisconsin and Michigan to end at Fort Wilkins in Copper Harbor by 1922. The roadway followed US 41's predecessor, M-15, and included numerous road signs bearing Sheridan's silhouette mounted on his horse Rienzi. Towns along the way were encouraged to rename city streets as Sheridan Road on <a href="Labor%20Day">Labor Day</a> 1923. The road was promoted until the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> in the 1930s. All that remains are signs in Menominee noting that First Street was once Sheridan Road.

The Townsend National Highway was named for <a href="Charles%20E.%20Townsend">Charles E. Townsend</a>, a former congressman and senator from Michigan. As a senator, he introduced the federal highway aid bill in 1919. The Michigan Good Roads Association promoted a highway in his name between <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, and Michigan. The Michigan segment followed a number of highways through the two peninsulas, including the modern US 41 between Harvey and Calumet. Only Townsend Drive in Houghton retains the name in part.

Memory Lane was created in 1947 along US 41 in Baraga. The local <a href="Lions%20Club">Lions Club</a> planted over 100 <a href="Acer%20rubrum">red maple</a> trees at the recommendation of a state highway department forester to honor the veterans of World War I and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

The Amvets Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2/US 41/M-35 between the northern Escanaba city limits and CR 426 in Delta County. The <a href="AMVETS">American Veterans</a> (AMVETS) organization in Michigan petitioned the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> to grant this designation which was granted under Public Act 144 in 1959.

The <a href="Dominic%20Jacobetti">D. J. Jacobetti</a> Memorial Highway follows the segment of US 41 concurrent with M-28 between Harvey and the Ishpeming–Negaunee city limits in Marquette County. The designation was created in 1986 and continues east along M-28 to honor the longest serving member of the Michigan Legislature, elected to a record 21 terms before his death in 1994.

A section of US 41 is one of six unrelated Veterans Memorial Highway designations in Michigan. The Upper Peninsula designation follows the western end of M-28, including the section of US 41 between Ishpeming and Covington. This memorial was created in Public Act 10 of 2003 and dedicated on <a href="Memorial%20Day">Memorial Day</a> in 2004.

There have been three <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>s for US 41: Ishpeming–Negaunee, Marquette and Baraga. Only the business loop serving Ishpeming and Negaunee is still a state-maintained trunkline, but it is no longer designated Bus. US 41. US 41/M-28 was relocated to bypass the two cities' downtowns in 1937. The highway through downtown Ishpeming and Negaunee later carried the ALT US 41/ALT M-28 designation before being designated Bus. M-28 in 1958. The western end of the business loop was transferred to local government control when Bus. M-28 was moved along Lakeshore Drive in 1999.
Bus. US 41 in Marquette was first shown on a map in 1964 after the construction of the Marquette Bypass. It was later designated Bus. US 41/Bus. M-28 on a map in 1975; this second designation was removed from maps by 1982. The entire business loop was turned back to local control in a "route swap" between the City of Marquette and MDOT announced in early 2005. The proposal transferred jurisdiction on the unsigned <a href="M-554%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-554</a> and the business route from the state to the city. The state would take jurisdiction over a segment of McClellan Avenue to be used to extend <a href="M-553%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-553</a> to US 41/M-28. In addition, MDOT would pay $2.5 million (equivalent to $ in ) for reconstruction work planned for 2007. The transfer would increase Marquette's operational and maintenance liability expenses by $26,000 (equivalent to $ in ) and place the financial burden of the future replacement of a stop light on the city. On October 10, 2005, MDOT and Marquette transferred jurisdiction over the three roadways. As a result, Bus. US 41 was decommissioned when the local government took control over Washington and Front streets. As a result of the decommissioning, the 2006 maps did not show the former business loop.

The third business loop was in Baraga in the early 1940s. As shown on the maps of the time, US 41 was relocated in Baraga between the publication of the December 1, 1939, and the April 15, 1940, MSHD maps. A business loop followed the old routing through downtown. The last map that shows the loop was published on July 1, 1941. Bus. US 41 is shown under local control on the June 15, 1942, map.

U.S. Route 2 in Michigan

US Highway 2 (US 2) is a component of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> that connects <a href="Everett%2C%20Washington">Everett, Washington</a>, to the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a> (UP) of the US state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, with a separate segment that runs from <a href="Rouses%20Point%2C%20New%20York">Rouses Point, New York</a>, to <a href="Houlton%2C%20Maine">Houlton, Maine</a>. In Michigan, the highway runs through the UP in two segments as a part of the <a href="Michigan%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway system</a>, entering the state at <a href="Ironwood%2C%20Michigan">Ironwood</a> and ending at <a href="St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a>; in between, US 2 briefly traverses the state of <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. As one of the major transportation arteries in the UP, US 2 is a major conduit for traffic through the state and neighboring northern <a href="Midwest">Midwest</a> states. Two sections of the roadway are included as part of the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tours">Great Lakes Circle Tours</a>, and other segments are listed as state-designated <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a>s. There are several memorial highway designations and historic bridges along US 2 that date to the 1910s and 1920s. The highway runs through rural sections of the UP, passing through two national and two state forests in the process.

The route of what became US 2 was used as part of two Indian trails before European settlers came to the UP, and as part of the Michigan segments of the <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20International%20Highway">Theodore Roosevelt International Highway</a> and the King's International Highway <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a>s in the early 20th century. The state later included these trails as part of <a href="M-12%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑12</a> when the first state highway trunklines were designated in 1919. Most of M‑12 was redesignated as part of US 2 when the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926. Since the 1930s, several changes have reshaped the highway's routing through the UP. One such alteration eventually created a <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a> that connected across the state line with <a href="Hurley%2C%20Wisconsin">Hurley, Wisconsin</a>, and others pushed an originally inland routing of US 2 closer to the <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> shoreline. With the creation of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>, part of US 2 was rerouted to coincide with the new <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">Interstate 75</a> (I‑75), though in the 1980s, the U.S. Highway was truncated and removed from the I‑75 freeway, resulting in today's basic form.

According to a 2006 regional planning committee report, US 2 is a key highway for Michigan, providing its main western gateway. The roadway plays "an important role in the transportation of goods across the northern tier of states in the Midwest", and is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a> (NHS) for its entire length. The NHS is a network of roadways important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. Together with <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑28</a>, US 2 is part of a pair of primary trunklines that bridge the eastern and western sides of the UP. The of roadway in Michigan is divided into a western segment and a eastern segment, interrupted by a section that runs for in the state of Wisconsin.

US 2 enters Michigan from Wisconsin for the first time north of downtown <a href="Hurley%2C%20Wisconsin">Hurley, Wisconsin</a>, and <a href="Ironwood%2C%20Michigan">Ironwood, Michigan</a>, over the state line that runs along the <a href="Montreal%20River%20%28Wisconsin%E2%80%93Michigan%29">Montreal River</a>. The highway crosses the river into <a href="Gogebic%20County%2C%20Michigan">Gogebic County</a> and passes a <a href="welcome%20center">welcome center</a> on the way into a commercial district north of downtown. Running along Cloverland Drive, US 2 meets its only <a href="%23Business%20route">business route</a> in Michigan at Douglas Boulevard. The business route was previously a full loop that ran west through downtown Ironwood and crossed the border into Hurley and back to the main highway. The <a href="Wisconsin%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Wisconsin Department of Transportation</a> has removed the signage on their side of the border, which reduced the loop to a business spur that ends at the state line. US 2 continues eastward through UP woodlands to the city of <a href="Bessemer%2C%20Michigan">Bessemer</a>. While bypassing the community of <a href="Ramsay%2C%20Michigan">Ramsay</a>, the highway crosses a branch of the <a href="Black%20River%20%28Gogebic%20County%29">Black River</a>. The roadway enters <a href="Wakefield%2C%20Michigan">Wakefield</a> on the south side of Sunday Lake, meeting M‑28 at a stoplight in town. As the US Highway leaves Wakefield, it turns southeasterly through the <a href="Ottawa%20National%20Forest">Ottawa National Forest</a>, crossing Jackson Creek and two branches of the <a href="Presque%20Isle%20River">Presque Isle River</a>. US 2 and <a href="M-64%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑64</a> merge and <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">run concurrently</a> over the second branch of the Presque Isle in the community of <a href="Marenisco%2C%20Michigan">Marenisco</a>. This concurrency has the lowest traffic volume along the entire length of the highway within the state; in 2010 the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT) recorded a daily average usage along the stretch of 770 vehicles, compared to the overall average of 5,188 vehicles for the highway. At the end of the concurrency, M‑64 turns northerly to run along <a href="Lake%20Gogebic">Lake Gogebic</a>.

The highway continues parallel to the state line from the Marensico area through the national forest toward <a href="Watersmeet%2C%20Michigan">Watersmeet</a>. That <a href="unincorporated%20community">unincorporated community</a> is the home of the Watersmeet High School Nimrods, the basketball team featured on a series of <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> commercials and a documentary series on the <a href="Sundance%20Channel%20%28United%20States%29">Sundance Channel</a>. The area is also <a href="drainage%20basin">where the waters meet</a>; the rolling hills drain to <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a> via the <a href="Ontonagon%20River">Ontonagon River</a>, to <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> via the <a href="Brule%20River">Brule</a> and <a href="Menominee%20River">Menominee</a> rivers, or to the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> via the <a href="Wisconsin%20River">Wisconsin</a> and <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi</a> rivers. Also located in the area are the <a href="Sylvania%20Wilderness">Sylvania Wilderness</a>, and the <a href="Lac%20Vieux%20Desert%20Indian%20Reservation">Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation</a>, which includes the Lac Vieux Desert Casino and Resort. The highway travels southeasterly from Watersmeet around the many lakes and streams in the area and crosses into rural <a href="Iron%20County%2C%20Michigan">Iron County</a>. US 2 intersects <a href="Forest%20Highway%2016">Federal Forest Highway 16</a> (FFH 16) near Golden Lake in <a href="Stambaugh%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Stambaugh Township</a> in the middle of the national forest. The trunkline then runs along the <a href="Iron%20River%20%28Iron%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">Iron River</a> as it approaches <a href="Iron%20River%2C%20Michigan">the city of the same name</a> and meets <a href="M-73%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑73</a>. In town, US 2 intersects <a href="M-189%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑189</a> before crossing the river and turning northeast out of the city.
US 2 leaves the Ottawa National Forest at Iron River, and the highway continues eastward through forest lands near several small lakes to <a href="Crystal%20Falls%2C%20Michigan">Crystal Falls</a>, the <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of Iron County. On the west side of town, US 2 meets <a href="U.S.%20Route%20141">US 141</a>; the two highways run concurrently along Crystal Avenue. The combined highway turns south onto 5th Street and meets <a href="M-69%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑69</a>'s eastern terminus at the intersection between 5th Street and Superior Avenue next to the <a href="Iron%20County%20Courthouse%20%28Crystal%20Falls%2C%20Michigan%29">county courthouse</a> at the top of the hill. US 2/US 141 runs south out of Crystal Falls to the west of, and parallel to, the Paint River. The roadway passes Railroad, Kennedy and Stager lakes and leaves the state of Michigan at the Brule River, crossing into <a href="Florence%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Florence County, Wisconsin</a> for about .

US 2/US 141 re-enters Michigan where it crosses the Menominee River and subsequently meets <a href="M-95%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑95</a> in <a href="Breitung%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Breitung Township</a> north of <a href="Iron%20Mountain%2C%20Michigan">Iron Mountain</a> and <a href="Kingsford%2C%20Michigan">Kingsford</a>. The highways merge in a triple concurrency and run south on Stephenson Avenue into Iron Mountain along the west side of Lake Antoine, parallel to a branch line of the <a href="Escanaba%20and%20Lake%20Superior%20Railroad">Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad</a> (ELS Railroad). The road crosses through a retail corridor and over a flooded pit of the Chapin Mine. In downtown Iron Mountain at Ludington Street, M‑95 turns west off Stephenson Avenue to run across town to Kingsford. US 2/US 141 exits downtown and turns east along a second retail corridor near the Midtown Mall. The highway re-enters Breitung Township where US 141 separates to the south to re-enter Wisconsin. US 2 continues eastward parallel to a branch of the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> (CN Railway). Both road and rail travel through the community of <a href="Quinnesec%2C%20Michigan">Quinnesec</a>, where they pass near the largest paper mill in the UP. The trunkline runs along the main street of <a href="Norway%2C%20Michigan">Norway</a>, where the highway meets the eastern terminus of <a href="U.S.%20Route%208">US 8</a>. Then US 2 continues east through rural <a href="Dickinson%20County%2C%20Michigan">Dickinson County</a> to <a href="Vulcan%2C%20Michigan">Vulcan</a>, passing north of Hanbury Lake through the <a href="Copper%20Country%20State%20Forest">Copper Country State Forest</a>, before crossing the <a href="Sturgeon%20River%20%28Dickinson%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">Sturgeon River</a> in <a href="Loretto%2C%20Michigan">Loretto</a> and passing into <a href="Menominee%20County%2C%20Michigan">Menominee County</a>.
In Menominee County, the environment takes on a more agricultural character along US 2. The highway passes through the edge of the community of <a href="Hermansville%2C%20Michigan">Hermansville</a> before entering <a href="Powers%2C%20Michigan">Powers</a>. US 2 comes to a three-way intersection and turns northeast merging onto <a href="U.S.%20Route%2041%20in%20Michigan">US 41</a>. The concurrent highway runs from Powers through the communities of <a href="Wilson%2C%20Michigan">Wilson</a> and <a href="Spaulding%2C%20Michigan">Spaulding</a> on the south side of the CN Railway. At <a href="Harris%2C%20Michigan">Harris</a>, the trunkline enters the <a href="Hannahville%20Indian%20Community">Hannahville Indian Community</a>. Harris is on the Menominee County side of the reservation, but as the highway continues east, it crosses over to <a href="Bark%20River%2C%20Michigan">Bark River</a> on the <a href="Delta%20County%2C%20Michigan">Delta County</a> side. The county line in between not only separates the two communities, but also serves as the boundary between the <a href="Central%20Time%20Zone%20%28North%20America%29">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern</a> time zones. East of Bark River, the highway crosses <a href="Bark%20River%20%28Michigan%29">the community's namesake waterway</a> before intersecting the eastern terminus of M‑69. The roadway crosses the <a href="Ford%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Ford River</a> prior to turning due east into the outskirts of <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a>.

US 2/US 41 widens to four lanes along Ludington Street, which forms the east–west axis of the Escanaba street grid. Near downtown, the highway meets <a href="M-35%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑35</a>, which runs along the city's north–south axis, Lincoln Road. The trunklines merge and run north, bypassing the traditional central business district for a different business corridor. Lincoln Road runs north carrying four lanes of traffic past the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20State%20Fair">Upper Peninsula State Fair</a>grounds, site of one of the two <a href="state%20fair">state fair</a>s for the state of Michigan, the only state to have twin fairs. US 2/US 41/M‑35 continues north on Lincoln Road past the campus of <a href="Bay%20de%20Noc%20Community%20College">Bay de Noc Community College</a>. The four-lane highway crosses the <a href="Escanaba%20River">Escanaba River</a> just upstream from its mouth near the large Mead Paper Mill and shifts to run immediately next to <a href="Little%20Bay%20de%20Noc">Little Bay de Noc</a>. The section here carried the highest traffic counts along all of US 2 in the state: an average of 23,977 vehicles used this segment of roadway daily in 2011.
The road turns inland again, and US 2/US 41/M‑35 passes to the west of downtown <a href="Gladstone%2C%20Michigan">Gladstone</a>. The highway through here is an <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a>, four lanes divided by a central median and no driveway access. Unlike a <a href="freeway">freeway</a>, the expressway has standard <a href="intersection%20%28road%29">intersections</a> and not <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchanges</a>. The highway intersects the eastern terminus of County Road 426 (CR 426) and crosses the ELS Railroad south of the stoplight for 4th Avenue North, where M‑35 separates from the US Highways and turns to the northwest. The expressway continues north parallel to the CN Railway, crossing the <a href="Days%20River">Days River</a>. From Gladstone to <a href="Saint%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a>, US 2 carries a speed limit of for all traffic. This was, before 2017, the only road in the UP with a speed limit higher than besides <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a>, which has a speed limit of . The expressway segment runs around the upper end of Little Bay de Noc before ending at <a href="Rapid%20River%2C%20Michigan">Rapid River</a>. In this location, US 41 separates to the north, and US 2 returns to an easterly track as a two-lane road, crossing the <a href="Rapid%20River%20%28Delta%20County%2C%20Michigan%29">Rapid</a> and <a href="Whitefish%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Whitefish</a> rivers and turning southeast around the head of the bay. As US 2 crosses southern Delta County, it passes through the western unit of the <a href="Hiawatha%20National%20Forest">Hiawatha National Forest</a>. Near <a href="Garden%20Corners%2C%20Michigan">Garden Corners</a>, the highway runs along the shore of <a href="Big%20Bay%20de%20Noc">Big Bay de Noc</a>. After the intersection with the northern terminus of <a href="M-183%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑183</a>, US 2 turns inland cutting across the base of the <a href="Garden%20Peninsula">Garden Peninsula</a> and enters <a href="Schoolcraft%20County%2C%20Michigan">Schoolcraft County</a>.

As the highway approaches <a href="Thompson%2C%20Michigan">Thompson</a>, US 2 leaves the western unit of the Hiawatha National Forest and enters the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20State%20Forest">Lake Superior State Forest</a>. The roadway runs along <a href="Lake%20Michigan">Lake Michigan</a> to <a href="Manistique%2C%20Michigan">Manistique</a>, crossing the <a href="Manistique%20River">Manistique River</a>. The trunkline turns inland approaching <a href="Gulliver%2C%20Michigan">Gulliver</a> and then turns north-northeast to <a href="Blaney%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Blaney Park</a>. The community there is a former logging town-turned-resort at the southern terminus of <a href="M-77%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑77</a>; the resort was active from the late 1920s but declined by the 1980s. From Blaney Park, US 2 turns due east and crosses into <a href="Mackinac%20County%2C%20Michigan">Mackinac County</a> west of <a href="Gould%20City%2C%20Michigan">Gould City</a>. Where it intersects a former routing, the main highway crosses the CN Railway one last time and runs to the south of <a href="Engadine%2C%20Michigan">Engadine</a> to follow the Lake Michigan shoreline through <a href="Naubinway%2C%20Michigan">Naubinway</a>. After passing the community of <a href="Epoufette%2C%20Michigan">Epoufette</a>, US 2 crosses the <a href="Cut%20River%20Bridge">Cut River Bridge</a>, over the <a href="Cut%20River">Cut River</a>. The highway crosses into the eastern unit of the Hiawatha National Forest near <a href="Brevort%2C%20Michigan">Brevort</a>, running between Lake Michigan and <a href="Brevort%20Lake">Brevort Lake</a> in the process. The road continues along the Lake Michigan shoreline, passing Mystery Spot near <a href="Gros%20Cap%2C%20Michigan">Gros Cap</a> and turning inland immediately west of St. Ignace. The US 2 designation ends at the highway's <a href="partial%20cloverleaf%20interchange">partial cloverleaf interchange</a> with I‑75. The roadway continues easterly into downtown St. Ignace as <a href="Interstate%2075%20Business%20%28St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I‑75</a> (BL I‑75).

In 1701, the first transportation routes through what became the state of Michigan were the lakes, rivers and Indian trails. Two of these trails followed parts of the future US 2. The Sault–Green Bay Trail roughly followed the Lake Michigan shoreline routing of US 2 between <a href="Escanaba%2C%20Michigan">Escanaba</a> and <a href="St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a>. The <a href="Mackinac%20Trail">Mackinac Trail</a> connected St. Ignace with Sault Ste. Marie.

In the age of the <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a>, the roads that later formed US 2 through the UP were given a few different highway names. When the original roadways between Ironwood and Iron River were completed in late 1915, the Upper Peninsula Development Bureau (UPDB) named the area Cloverland and the highway the <a href="Cloverland%20Trail">Cloverland Trail</a>. Later the name was extended over the highway to Escanaba, and to all highways in the area in the early 1920s; the name was phased out by the UPDB completely in 1927. The roadways were also used for the <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt%20International%20Highway">Theodore Roosevelt International Highway</a>, named for former US president <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> after his death in 1919. Overall, this highway ran from <a href="Portland%2C%20Oregon">Portland, Oregon</a>, to <a href="Portland%2C%20Maine">Portland, Maine</a>, by way of Michigan and the Canadian province of <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>. Through the UP, the southern branch followed the immediate predecessors to US 2, including the section through Florence County, Wisconsin.

The Great Lakes Automobile Route was established in 1917 by the UPDB. A predecessor of the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tour">Great Lakes Circle Tour</a>s by seventy years, the route followed "a circular journey along the banks of lakes Michigan and Superior and Green Bay ..." This route followed the modern US 2 from Ironwood to the M‑94 junction in Manistique, using the modern M‑69 and M‑95 to stay in Michigan. Branches of the route followed US 41 and M‑35 between Powers and Escanaba. The route was originally intended to entice motorists to drive around Lake Michigan. The name fell out of use before its first anniversary because of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>.

One Canadian auto trail was routed through the UP as well. In 1920, the King's International Highway linked <a href="Vancouver%2C%20British%20Columbia">Vancouver, British Columbia</a>, to <a href="Halifax%20Regional%20Municipality">Halifax, Nova Scotia</a>, but there was no highway to carry it around the north side of Lake Superior. Motorists had to ship their cars by boat between <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Ontario">Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario</a>, and <a href="Thunder%20Bay%2C%20Ontario">Thunder Bay</a> or enter the United States to continue along the auto trail. The routings varied on the maps of the time, but its basic route used US 2 through the UP from Ironwood to Sault Ste. Marie until a highway north of Lake Superior was opened in 1960; by that time, the auto trail had taken on the <a href="Trans-Canada%20Highway">Trans-Canada Highway</a> name.

The first state trunkline highway designated along the path of the modern US 2 was <a href="M-12%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑12</a>, a designation that was in use by July 1, 1919, between Ironwood and <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan">Sault Ste. Marie</a>. The first roadside park in the country was created by Herbert Larson near what is now US 2 near <a href="Iron%20River%2C%20Michigan">Iron River</a> in 1919–20. When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US 2 partially replaced M-12. Between Crystal Falls and Iron Mountain, US 2 was routed through <a href="Florence%20%28CDP%29%2C%20Wisconsin">Florence, Wisconsin</a>. The former routing of M‑12 from Crystal Falls to Sagola became a new <a href="M-69%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑69</a> when the former M‑69 became US 102 (now US 141). M‑12 from Sagola south to Iron Mountain was made a part of an extended <a href="M-45%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑45</a>, which is now <a href="M-95%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑95</a>. By the next year, <a href="M-48%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑48</a> was added along US 2 from <a href="Rexton%2C%20Michigan">Rexton</a> to <a href="Garnet%2C%20Michigan">Garnet</a> as part of a larger extension.

The first changes to the routing of US 2 itself were made in 1930 with a bypass of downtown Escanaba. A larger rerouting was completed in 1933 between <a href="Rogers%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Rogers Park</a> and Sault Ste. Marie. The new routing followed Mackinac Trail instead of turning east to <a href="Cedarville%2C%20Michigan">Cedarville</a> and north to Sault Ste. Marie; the former routing was given the <a href="M-121%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑121</a> designation. Another realignment in the Iron Mountain area shifted US 2/US 141 to a new bridge over the <a href="Menominee%20River">Menominee River</a> between 1932 and 1934. Downtown Ironwood was bypassed in 1934, and the former route was initially designated <a href="M-54%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑54</a>.
The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) changed the routings and designations of the highways around <a href="Cooks%2C%20Michigan">Cooks</a>, <a href="Thompson%2C%20Michigan">Thompson</a> and <a href="Manistique%2C%20Michigan">Manistique</a> in the mid-1930s. The agency rerouted US 2 between Cooks and <a href="M-149%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑149</a> in Thompson, turning the old road back to county control. The section between M‑149 and <a href="M-125%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑125</a> was redesignated as an extension of M‑149 to Thompson, and M‑125 was replaced by a further extension of M‑149. The last change was to route US 2 along its current alignment in the area, completing the changes on August 2, 1936.

The MSHD started construction in 1936 on a new road that rerouted US 2 into St. Ignace for the first time. Between <a href="Brevort%2C%20Michigan">Brevort</a> and <a href="Moran%2C%20Michigan">Moran</a>, US 2 previously followed Worth Road inland to the Tahquamenon Trail to meet the northern extension of <a href="U.S.%20Route%2031%20in%20Michigan">US 31</a> into the Upper Peninsula. The new routing took US 2 along the lakeshore into St. Ignace. US 31 was truncated to the state ferry docks in <a href="Mackinaw%20City%2C%20Michigan">Mackinaw City</a> and US 2 was routed through St. Ignace along the former US 31 to Rogers Park; the connection in St. Ignace to the state ferry docks became <a href="M-122%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑122</a>. Further changes in the early 1940s straightened the roadway out near Watersmeet and Crystal Falls.

Additional realignments were completed by the MSHD to move US 2 to its modern lakeshore routing between <a href="Gould%20City%2C%20Michigan">Gould City</a> and <a href="Epoufette%2C%20Michigan">Epoufette</a> in 1941. The new highway traveled due east from Gould City to <a href="Naubinway%2C%20Michigan">Naubinway</a> and then along the lake to Epoufette. The former route through Engadine was turned back to local control as far east as <a href="Garnet%2C%20Michigan">Garnet</a>. From there east, it was numbered just <a href="M-48%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑48</a>, removing US 2 from a concurrency. Another former section into Epoufette was added to extend <a href="M-117%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑117</a>. The new highway was detoured around the <a href="Cut%20River%20Bridge">Cut River Bridge</a> until it was completed in 1946 after construction delays over steel shortages during <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

The western end of US 2 took on two changes in the 1940s. <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑28</a> was extended along US 2 to the state line at Ironwood from its western terminus at Wakefield. A similar extension was made from M‑28's eastern terminus to Sault Ste. Marie in 1948. The M‑54 designation was renumbered as <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20Business%20%28Ironwood%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 2</a> by 1945. The eastern M‑28 extension was reversed in 1950, and the western extension to the state line was shifted to a new location by 1952.

With the coming of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> in Michigan, the MSHD planned to convert the eastern section of US 2 to a freeway between St. Ignace and Sault St. Marie. In planning maps from 1947, this highway corridor was included in the system that later became the Interstates. It was also included in the "General Location of National System of Interstate Highways Including All Additional Routes at Urban Areas Designated in September 1955", or "Yellow Book" after the cover color, that was released in 1955 as the federal government readied plans for the freeway system. The proposed number in 1958 was <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">Interstate 75</a> (I‑75).

The first section of freeway was built in late 1957 or early 1958 between <a href="Evergreen%20Shores%2C%20Michigan">Evergreen Shores</a> and <a href="M-123%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑123</a> north of St. Ignace. The <a href="Mackinac%20Bridge">Mackinac Bridge</a> was opened to traffic on November 1, 1957; a new section of freeway and an <a href="interchange%20%28road%29">interchange</a> connected US 2 to the bridge. In 1961, another new freeway segment closed the gap between the Mackinac Bridge and Evergreen Shores sections. At the time, the I‑75 designation supplanted <a href="U.S.%20Route%2027%20in%20Michigan">US 27</a> on the bridge, and US 2 was shifted to follow I‑75 along the freeways in the St. Ignace area. The former routing of US 2 in downtown St. Ignace was redesignated <a href="Interstate%2075%20Business%20%28St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan%29">BL I‑75</a>. More sections of freeway were opened in 1962 immediately to the south of the newly constructed <a href="Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%20International%20Bridge">International Bridge</a> in Sault Ste. Marie as well as between <a href="Dafter%2C%20Michigan">Dafter</a> and <a href="Kinross%2C%20Michigan">Kinross</a>. The last two sections opened in 1963 connected the northern end of the freeway at M‑123 to Kinross, and the section between Dafter and Sault Ste. Marie. At this time, all of US 2's former routing became a <a href="H-63%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">county road known as Mackinac Trail (H-63)</a>.

The <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20State%20Highways">Department of State Highways</a> expanded US 2/US 41 into an expressway between <a href="Gladstone%2C%20Michigan">Gladstone</a> and <a href="Rapid%20River%2C%20Michigan">Rapid River</a> in 1971. The state built a new bridge over the <a href="Manistique%20River">Manistique River</a> in 1983, bypassing downtown. MDOT disposed of the former routing of US 2 into downtown in two ways. The western half was initially an unnumbered state highway until it was later transferred to local control. An extension of <a href="M-94%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M‑94</a> replaced the remainder, including the Siphon Bridge, through downtown. In that same year, the department truncated US 2 to end in St. Ignace by removing it from the I‑75 freeway. The last changes were made to US 2's routing through Iron River in 1998, bypassing the bridge that formerly carried the highway over the river in town. In 2011, MDOT raised the speed limit along the expressway section in Delta County from , although the speed limit for trucks remained until 2017. That year the highway's speed limits were raised to between Wakefield and Iron River as well as between Rapid River and St. Ignace.

On July 1, 1924, the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Administrative%20Board">State Administrative Board</a> named M‑12, the predecessor to US 2 in Michigan, the Bohn Highway to honor <a href="Frank%20P.%20Bohn">Frank P. Bohn</a>, a prominent local citizen who later served in <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> from 1927 to 1933. In 1929, the residents of Escanaba created a memorial to the veterans of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> called Memory Lane. The project consisted of <a href="elm">elm</a> and <a href="maple">maple</a> trees planted along US 2/US 41 west of town. The <a href="American%20Legion">American Legion</a> sold the trees to local businesses and individuals who could honor specific soldiers. Later in 1949, the Bessemer Women's Club created a tribute in the form of a permanent living memorial to the area veterans. Also called Memory Lane, the group planted 140 elms and 1,840 evergreens, trees and shrubs as a landscaped parkway along of US 2 east of Bessemer.

Most of US 2, along with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2023%20in%20Michigan">US 23</a> in the <a href="Lower%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Lower Peninsula</a>, was designated the United Spanish War Veterans Memorial Highway in 1949. To connect the gap in the routing where US 2 cuts through Wisconsin, M‑95 and M‑69 were used in place of US 2 between Iron Mountain and Crystal Falls. Signs marking the highway were not erected until 1968 when Governor <a href="George%20W.%20Romney">George W. Romney</a> had them installed.

The Amvets Memorial Drive designation was created for the section of US 2/US 41/M‑35 between the northern Escanaba city limits and County Road 426 (CR 426) in Delta County. The <a href="AMVETS">American Veterans</a> (AMVETS) organization in Michigan petitioned the <a href="Michigan%20Legislature">Michigan Legislature</a> to grant this designation, which was assigned under Public Act 144 in 1959.
Two sections of US 2 are part of the overall <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Circle%20Tour">Great Lakes Circle Tour</a> (GLCT): the segment from the Wisconsin state line near Ironwood to the M‑28 junction in Wakefield is part of the <a href="Lake%20Superior%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Superior Circle Tour</a> (LSCT), and the segment from the southern M‑35 junction in Escanaba to the eastern terminus in St. Ignace is part of the <a href="Lake%20Michigan%20Circle%20Tour">Lake Michigan Circle Tour</a> (LMCT). These two tours were created in May 1986 through a joint effort between MDOT and its counterparts in Wisconsin, <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a> and Ontario. The section of US 2 between Iron River and Crystal Falls has been named the Iron County Heritage Trail. This <a href="Pure%20Michigan%20Byway">Pure Michigan Byway</a> was designated to honor the "rich history of two industries that built a state and nation: mining and logging." On August 26, 2007, MDOT announced that the section of US 2 that runs concurrently with M‑35 in Delta County was being included in the <a href="UP%20Hidden%20Coast%20Recreational%20Heritage%20Trail">UP Hidden Coast Recreational Heritage Trail</a>. The segment between <a href="Thompson%2C%20Michigan">Thompson</a> and <a href="St.%20Ignace%2C%20Michigan">St. Ignace</a> along the northern shore of Lake Michigan was designated the Top of the Lake Scenic Byway in the Pure Michigan Byways program on October 9, 2017.

There are six bridges along current or former sections of US 2 that MDOT has added to its listing of Michigan's Historic Bridges; <a href="List%20of%20bridges%20on%20the%20National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places%20in%20Michigan">two of these</a> are also listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> (NRHP). A third bridge added to the NRHP in late 2012 has not been added to MDOT's listing however. The first of these historic bridges is the <a href="US%202%E2%80%93Iron%20River%20Bridge">crossing of the Iron River</a>, which has since been bypassed by a new bridge. The original structure, dating to 1918, is a <a href="spandrel%20arch">spandrel arch</a> span that was built by the MSHD as Trunk Line Bridge No. 191. The structure was listed on the NRHP on December 9, 1999, for its architectural and engineering significance.

In December 2012, the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> approved the listing of the <a href="Upper%20Twin%20Falls%20Bridge">Upper Twin Falls Bridge</a> that crosses the Menominee River northwest of Iron Mountain. The structure is a single-span, pin-connected, <a href="Camelback%20truss">camelback</a>, <a href="through-truss">through-truss</a> bridge, and it is the only known example of its type in Michigan. It was built between 1909 and 1910 because the Twin Falls Power Dam would flood an existing river crossing. The span cost $5,106 (equivalent to $ in ), paid equally by <a href="Dickinson%20County%2C%20Michigan">Dickinson</a> and <a href="Florence%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Florence</a> counties. Until the 1930s, the Upper Twin Falls Bridge carried US 2 across the Menominee River. In 1934, a new bridge was built about a mile downstream, and the highway was rerouted over the new span. The bridge closed to automobile traffic in September 1971, and the nomination process for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places began in 2012.

In 2003, MDOT replaced the Sturgeon River Bridge in <a href="Waucedah%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Waucedah Township</a>, Dickinson County. , even though the old bridge was demolished and replaced, MDOT retained it on their historic bridge list. It was built in 1929.

Before 1983, US 2 used a different routing through Manistique and crossed the Manistique River on what is nicknamed the "Siphon Bridge". Built as a part of a raceway flume on the river, the water level is actually higher than the road surface. This produces a <a href="siphon">siphon</a> effect, giving the bridge its nickname. The Manistique Pulp and Paper Company was organized in 1916 and needed a dam on the Manistique River to supply their mill. This dam would require a large section of the city to be flooded, and shallow river banks meant difficulties in any bridge construction. Instead of expensive dikes, a concrete tank was built lengthwise in the river bed; the sides of this tank provided man-made banks higher than the natural banks. The Michigan <a href="Works%20Progress%20Administration">Works Progress Administration</a> described the bridge as having "concrete bulkheads, formed by the side spans of the bridge, [that] allow the mill to maintain the water level several feet above the roadbed." The Manistique Tourism Council stated: "At one time, the bridge itself was partially supported by the water that was atmospherically forced under it," and that the bridge has been featured in "<a href="Ripley%27s%20Believe%20It%20or%20Not%21">Ripley's Believe It or Not!</a>". The eight-span structure is long.
The <a href="Cut%20River%20Bridge">Cut River Bridge</a> carries US 2 across the <a href="Cut%20River">Cut River</a> in <a href="Hendricks%20Township%2C%20Michigan">Hendricks Township</a>, Mackinac County. This structure was built during World War II but completion was delayed due to war-induced steel shortages. The span uses of structural steel to bridge the over the river and its gorge at a height of above the river. The Cut River Bridge is one of only two <a href="Cantilever%20bridge">cantilevered deck truss bridges</a> in the state. On either side of the bridge, there are picnic areas and trails down to the river.

Listed on the NRHP on December 17, 1999, the <a href="Mackinac%20Trail%E2%80%93Carp%20River%20Bridge">Mackinac Trail–Carp River Bridge</a> carries <a href="H-63%20%28Michigan%20county%20highway%29">H-63</a>, the modern successor to US 2, over the <a href="Carp%20River%20%28Mackinac%20County%29">Carp River</a> north of St. Ignace. The bridge is another spandrel arch structure in length and built in 1920. Increasing traffic along Mackinac Trail prompted the MSHD to "widen its deck by five feet [1.5 m] and install new guardrails in the 1929–1930 biennium" along with the addition of decorative retaining walls.

The last of the historic bridges along a former segment of US 2 is the structure carrying Ashmun Street (<a href="Interstate%2075%20Business%20%28Sault%20Ste.%20Marie%2C%20Michigan%29">BS I‑75</a>) over the Power Canal in Sault Ste. Marie. Built in 1934, it is one of only three steel arch bridges in the state. The and structure is described by MDOT as "massive" with an "innovative" construction method: the previous structure was used as a <a href="falsework">falsework</a> for the current bridge before removal.

MDOT has erected milemarkers along the two Michigan segments of the highway that use the total mileage starting at the state line in Ironwood; the signs on the eastern segment reflect the mileage in <a href="Florence%20County%2C%20Wisconsin">Florence County, Wisconsin</a>.

Business U.S. Highway 2 (Bus. US 2) is a <a href="business%20route">business route</a> that runs from the Wisconsin state line at the <a href="Montreal%20River%20%28Wisconsin-Michigan%29">Montreal River</a>. The route extends through downtown Ironwood on Silver and Aurora streets before turning northward along Suffolk Street. Bus. US 2 stays on Suffolk Street for a short while until it turns onto Frederick Street. On Frederick Street, Bus. US 2 bears north through a residential area along Douglas Street. The eastern terminus of the route is at its junction with US 2 at the corner of Cloverland Drive and Douglas Street north of downtown.

The business route was created in August 1942 when former M‑54 in Ironwood was renumbered as a business loop of US 2.

U.S. Route 45 in Michigan

US Highway 45 (US 45) is a part of the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> that runs from <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>, to the <a href="Upper%20Peninsula%20of%20Michigan">Upper Peninsula</a> (UP) of the state of <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>. The highway forms a part of the <a href="Michigan%20State%20Trunkline%20Highway%20System">state trunkline highway system</a> that is maintained by the <a href="Michigan%20Department%20of%20Transportation">Michigan Department of Transportation</a> (MDOT). It enters the state from <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a> south of <a href="Watersmeet%2C%20Michigan">Watersmeet</a>, ending at an intersection with Ontonagon Street in <a href="Ontonagon%2C%20Michigan">Ontonagon</a>. In between, the roadway crosses the UP running for approximately through the <a href="Ottawa%20National%20Forest">Ottawa National Forest</a> and parallel to the <a href="Ontonagon%20River">Ontonagon River</a>.

The highway dates back to the 1930s in Michigan. At the time it was extended into the state, it replaced sections of <a href="M-26%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-26</a> and <a href="M-35%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-35</a>. An segment was significantly reconstructed in the late 1950s, and an alignment change in the 1970s moved the routing of US 45 near <a href="Rockland%2C%20Michigan">Rockland</a> before it was reversed soon afterwards. A segment of roadway that formerly carried US 45 is the site of the <a href="Paulding%20Light">Paulding Light</a>, a local phenomenon whose origins were scientifically described in 2010.

US 45 crosses from Wisconsin to Michigan near <a href="Land%20O%27%20Lakes%2C%20Wisconsin">Land O' Lakes, Wisconsin</a>, east of the <a href="Sylvania%20Wilderness">Sylvania Wilderness</a> area of the <a href="Ottawa%20National%20Forest">Ottawa National Forest</a>. The highway angles northeast from the state line before curving around to the north toward Watersmeet, where it intersects <a href="U.S.%20Route%202%20in%20Michigan">US 2</a>. Watersmeet is home to the northern section of the <a href="Lac%20Vieux%20Desert%20Indian%20Reservation">Lac Vieux Desert Indian Reservation</a>. Continuing north across the <a href="Gogebic%20County%2C%20Michigan">Gogebic</a>–<a href="Ontonagon%20County%2C%20Michigan">Ontonagon</a> county line, US 45 crosses the boundary between the <a href="Central%20Time%20Zone%20%28Americas%29">Central</a> and <a href="Eastern%20Time%20Zone">Eastern</a> time zones.

In southern Ontonagon County, the highway runs west of the <a href="Bond%20Falls">Bond Falls</a> Flowage near <a href="Paulding%2C%20Michigan">Paulding</a>. North of here, the trunkline enters <a href="Bruce%20Crossing%2C%20Michigan">Bruce Crossing</a> and intersects <a href="M-28%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-28</a>. After leaving town, US 45 runs northward parallel to the Middle Branch of the <a href="Ontonagon%20River">Ontonagon River</a>, and the highway crosses the river near a roadside park south of <a href="Rockland%2C%20Michigan">Rockland</a>. East of Rockland, US 45 meets the southern terminus of <a href="M-26%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-26</a>; after the intersection, US 45 turns northwesterly and runs parallel to the Ontonagon River and a snowmobile trail (a former branch of the <a href="Escanaba%20and%20Lake%20Superior%20Railroad">Escanaba and Lake Superior Railroad</a>).
US 45 enters the south side of <a href="Ontonagon%2C%20Michigan">Ontonagon</a> on Rockland Road near the Holy Family Cemetery. The roadway turns due north, still running parallel to the course of the river. South of downtown, the highway crosses an intersection that serves as the joint termini of <a href="M-38%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-38</a> and <a href="M-64%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-64</a>. M-64 crosses the river from the west on a bridge built in 2006 and ends at the intersection. M-38 comes into town from the east and also ends at the same intersection. US 45 continues north on Rockland Road and turns northwest on River Street along the eastern river bank through downtown. The northern terminus of US 45 is at Ontonagon Street, about from <a href="Lake%20Superior">Lake Superior</a>.

US 45 debuted in Michigan by 1935 on maps of the time. The highway previously terminated in <a href="Des%20Plaines%2C%20Illinois">Des Plaines, Illinois</a>, until it was extended northward to Michigan. US 45 replaced <a href="M-26%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-26</a> between the state line north toward Rockland, as well as <a href="M-35%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-35</a> between Rockland and Ontonagon. The <a href="Michigan%20State%20Highway%20Department">Michigan State Highway Department</a> (MSHD) rebuilt an section of the highway in the Military Hills area of eastern Ontonagon County starting in 1957. As part of the project, tons of waste copper rock were hauled into the area to provide a base for the reconstructed roadway, which was previously quite steep through the hills and muddy during rains. The project included a new bridge over the Ontonagon River that opened in late 1959. Along with this bridge, the last of US 45 in the country were paved, connecting the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> and Lake Superior with a hard-surfaced road.
A rerouting in late 1971 moved the US 45 designation along M-26 between Rockland and <a href="Greenland%2C%20Michigan">Greenland</a>. From Greenland, US 45 followed Ontonagon–Greenland Road to Ontonagon. In late 1973, MDOT reversed the rerouting—US 45 was restored to its previous routing on Rockland Road between Rockland and Ontonagon and M-26 was re-extended south from Greenland to Rockland; M-38 was extended west along Ontonagon–Greenland Road.

In 2010, students from <a href="Michigan%20Technological%20University">Michigan Technological University</a> solved the mystery of the <a href="Paulding%20Light">Paulding Light</a>, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US 45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad brakeman. Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 19th century. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US 45 in the Paulding area.

Robert Sterling Yard

Robert Sterling Yard (February 1, 1861 – May 17, 1945) was an American writer, journalist, and <a href="wilderness">wilderness</a> activist. Born in <a href="Haverstraw%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Haverstraw, New York</a>, Yard graduated from <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> and spent the first twenty years of his career in the editing and publishing business. In 1915, he was recruited by his friend <a href="Stephen%20Mather">Stephen Mather</a> to help publicize the need for an independent national park agency. Their numerous publications were part of a movement that resulted in legislative support for a <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> (NPS) in 1916. Yard served as head of the National Parks Educational Committee for several years after its conception, but tension within the NPS led him to concentrate on non-government initiatives. He became executive secretary of the <a href="National%20Parks%20Conservation%20Association">National Parks Association</a> in 1919.

Yard worked to promote the national parks as well as educate Americans about their use. Creating high standards based on aesthetic ideals for park selection, he also opposed commercialism and industrialization of what he called "America's masterpieces". These standards subsequently caused discord with his peers. After helping to establish a relationship between the NPA and the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a>, Yard later became involved in the protection of wilderness areas. In 1935, he became one of the eight founding members of <a href="The%20Wilderness%20Society%20%28United%20States%29">The Wilderness Society</a> and acted as its first president from 1937 until his death eight years later. Yard is now considered an important figure in the modern wilderness movement.

Robert Sterling Yard was born in 1861 in <a href="Haverstraw%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">Haverstraw, New York</a> to Robert Boyd and Sarah (Purdue) Yard. After attending the Freehold Institute in New Jersey, he graduated from <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a> in 1883. Known throughout his life as "Bob", he became a prominent member of Princeton's Alumni Association, and founded the <a href="Montclair%2C%20New%20Jersey">Montclair</a> Princeton Alumni Association. In 1895, he married Mary Belle Moffat; they had one daughter, Margaret.

During the 1880s and 1890s, Yard worked as a journalist for the "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Sun">New York Sun</a>" and the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>". He served in the publishing business from 1900 to 1915, variously as editor-in-chief of "<a href="The%20Century%20Magazine">The Century Magazine</a>" and Sunday editor of the "New York Herald". After serving as editor of <a href="Charles%20Scribner%27s%20Sons">Charles Scribner's Sons</a>' the "Book Buyer", Yard helped launch the publishing firm of Moffat, Yard and Company. He served as vice president and editor-in-chief of the firm.

In 1915, Yard was invited to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> by his friend <a href="Stephen%20Mather">Stephen Mather</a>, who had started working on national parks as assistant to the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Interior">Secretary of Interior</a>. Yard and Mather had met while working for the "New York Sun" and became friends; Yard was the best man at Mather's wedding in 1893.

Mather, who wanted someone to help publicize the need for an independent agency to oversee the national parks movement, personally paid Yard's salary from his independent income. The United States had authorized 14 parks and 22 monuments over the previous forty years (1872–1915), but there was no single agency to provide unified management of the resources. In addition, some resources were managed by political appointees without professional qualifications. Together Mather and Yard ran a national parks publicity campaign for the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20the%20Interior">Department of the Interior</a>, writing numerous articles that praised the scenic qualities of the parks and their possibilities for educational, inspirational and recreational benefits. The unprecedented press coverage persuaded influential Americans about the importance of national parks, and encouraged <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> to create an independent parks agency.

Although Yard was not an outdoorsman like most advocates of a national park service, he felt a connection to the cause, and eventually became personally invested in its success. At the National Park Conference in March 1915, he stated, "I, the treader of dusty city streets, boldly claim common kinship with you of the plains, the mountains, and the glaciers." He gathered data regarding popular American tourist destinations, such as Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, and Canada, together with reasons why people visited certain areas; he also collected photographs and compiled lists of those who might enlist in the conservation cause. One of his most recognized and passionate articles of the time, entitled "Making a Business of Scenery", appeared in "The Nation's Business" in June 1916:

Yard's most successful publicity initiative during this time was the "National Parks Portfolio" (1916), a collection of nine pamphlets that—through photographs interspersed with text lauding the scenic grandeur of the nation's major parks—connected the parks with a sense of national identity to make visitation an imperative of American citizenship. Yard and Mather distributed this publication to a carefully selected list of prominent Americans, including every member of Congress. That same year, Yard wrote and published "Glimpses of Our National Parks", which was followed in 1917 by a similar volume titled "The Top of the Continent". The latter volume, which was subtitled "A Cheerful Journey through Our National Parks" and geared toward a younger audience, became a bestseller.

Yard and Mather's publicity and lobbying resulted in the creation of the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>; on August 25, 1916, President <a href="Woodrow%20Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a> signed a bill establishing the agency "to conserve the scenery and the natural and historic objects and wild life therein, and to provide for the enjoyment of the same in such manner and by such means as will leave them unimpaired for the enjoyment of future generations." Mather served as its first director beginning in 1917, and while he appointed <a href="Horace%20M.%20Albright">Horace Albright</a> as assistant director, he put Yard in charge of the National Parks Educational Committee. Consisting only of Yard and a secretary, this division of the NPS produced informative publicity in order to draw visitors to parks and develop programs to enhance the educational value of their experience.

In January 1917, Mather suffered a <a href="mental%20breakdown">mental breakdown</a> and had to take an extended leave. Yard believed he would be appointed interim director at the NPS. Disagreements within the organization, however, kept him from the position. Yard, who has been described as "intense, urbane and opinionated", was disappointed when the position was given to Albright, who was then only 27 years old. After more than a year of working in the Educational Division, Yard began to look outside the NPS for support.

Yard believed that while the National Park Service was effective as a government agency, it was not capable of promoting the wishes of the common American. He wrote in June 1918 that the national park movement must "be cultivated only by an organization of the people outside the government, and unhampered by politics and routine". On May 29, 1919, the <a href="National%20Parks%20Conservation%20Association">National Parks Association</a> (NPA) was officially created to fill this role. Yard, who became a pivotal figure in the new society, was elected its executive secretary. His duties as the only full-time employee of the NPA were practically the same as they had been with the NPS—to promote the national parks and to educate Americans about their use. In its early years, the NPA was Yard's livelihood and passion: he recruited the key founding members, raised money and wrote various press releases. Yard also served as editor of the NPA's "National Parks Bulletin" from 1919 to 1936. In the first issue, Yard outlined the organization's objectives in order to craft a broad educational program: not only would they attract students, artists and writers to the parks, but a "complete and rational system" would be created and adhered to by Congress and the Park Service.

Yard believed that eligible national parks had to be scenically stunning. He noted in his 1919 volume "The Book of the National Parks" that the major characteristic of almost all national parks was that their scenery had been forged by geological or biological processes. He wrote, "[W]e shall not really enjoy our possession of the grandest scenery in the world until we realize that scenery is the written page of the History of Creation, and until we learn to read that page." Yard's standards also insisted upon "complete conservation", meaning avoidance of commercialism and industrialization. Often referring to parks as "American masterpieces", he sought to protect them from economic activities such as timber cutting and mineral extracting. In such, Yard often advocated the preservation of "<a href="wilderness">wilderness</a>" conditions in America's national parks.

In 1920, Congress passed the <a href="Federal%20Power%20Act">Water Power Act</a>, which granted licenses to develop <a href="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric</a> projects on federal lands, including national parks. Yard and the NPA joined again with Mather and the National Park Service to oppose the intrusion on Park Service control. In 1921, Congress passed the Jones-Esch Bill, amending the Water Power Act to exclude existing national parks from hydroelectric development.

Despite agreeing on most issues regarding the protection of national parks, friction between the NPA and NPS was seemingly unavoidable. Mather and Yard disagreed on many issues; whereas Mather was not interested in the protection of wildlife and accepted the Biological Survey's efforts to exterminate predators within parks, Yard criticized the program as early as 1924. Yard was also highly critical of Mather's administration of the parks. Mather advocated plush accommodations, city comforts and various entertainments to encourage park visitation. These plans clashed with Yard's ideals, and he considered such urbanization of the nation's parks misguided. While visiting <a href="Yosemite%20National%20Park">Yosemite National Park</a> in 1926, he stated that the valley was "lost" after he found crowds, automobiles, jazz music and a bear show.

In 1924, the <a href="United%20States%20Forest%20Service">United States Forest Service</a> started a program to set aside "primitive areas" in the national forests to protect wilderness while opening it to use. Yard, who preferred to give the land that did not meet his standards to the Forest Service rather than the NPS, began to work closely with the USFS. Beginning in 1925, he served as secretary of the Joint Committee on the Recreational Survey of Federal Lands, a position he held until 1930. Composed of members of both the NPA and the USFS, the committee sought a separate national recreation policy that would distinguish between recreational and preservation areas. The NPA and Yard were both criticized by activists who feared that the association would be eclipsed by the Forest Service's own program goals. Yard at times felt isolated and under-appreciated by his peers. He wrote in 1926, "I wonder whether I'm justified in forcing this work upon people who seem to care so little about it."

By the late 1920s, Yard had come to believe preservation of wilderness was a solution to more commercially motivated park making. He continued to clash with others regarding legislation on park proposals. These included the <a href="Shenandoah%20National%20Park">Shenandoah National Park</a> in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, which Yard thought was too recreational and not of the caliber of a national park. He hesitated at the nomination of the <a href="Everglades%20National%20Park">Everglades National Park</a> in <a href="Florida">Florida</a>. When the Tropic Everglades National Park Association was founded in 1928 to promote the idea of a national park in south Florida, Yard was initially skeptical that it was necessary. Although he recognized the need for preservation, he did not accept proposals for a national park unless the area met his high scenic standards. He slowly warmed to the Everglades idea, and in 1931 supported the proposal under conditions that the area remain pristine, with limited tourist development. The Everglades National Park was authorized by Congress in 1934.

Yard's preservationist goals exceeded those of the Park Service in the 1930s. Drifting away from the national parks lobby, he pushed to preserve what he called "primitive" land; he and <a href="John%20C.%20Merriam">John C. Merriam</a> had discussed forming a group called "Save the Primitive League". Although that group was not formed, Yard was soon invited to become a founding member of <a href="The%20Wilderness%20Society%20%28United%20States%29">The Wilderness Society</a>. Seventy-four-years old at the time, he was known for his tireless work ethic and youthfulness; for decades he had jokingly insisted to colleagues that he was a mere 47.

The society was officially formed in January 1935 to lead wilderness preservation in the United States. Additional founding members included notable conservationists <a href="Bob%20Marshall%20%28wilderness%20activist%29">Bob Marshall</a>, <a href="Benton%20MacKaye">Benton MacKaye</a>, <a href="Bernard%20Frank%20%28wilderness%20activist%29">Bernard Frank</a>, <a href="Aldo%20Leopold">Aldo Leopold</a>, and <a href="Harvey%20Broome">Harvey Broome</a>. In September, Yard published the first issue of the society's magazine, "The Living Wilderness". He wrote of the society's genesis, "The Wilderness Society is born of an emergency in conservation which admits of no delay. The craze is to build all the highways possible everywhere while billions may yet be borrowed from the unlucky future. The fashion is to barber and manicure wild America as smartly as the modern girl. Our mission is clear."

Although Marshall proposed that Leopold act as the society's first president, in 1937 Yard accepted the role, as well as that of permanent secretary. He ran the society from his home in Washington, D.C. and single-handedly produced "The Living Wilderness" during its early years, with one issue annually until 1945. Yard did the greater share of work during the Society's early years; he solicited membership, corresponded with other conservation groups, and kept track of congressional activities related to wilderness areas. Although much older than some of his colleagues, Yard was described as a cautious and non-confrontational leader.

While ill from pneumonia at the end of his life, he ran the society's affairs from his bed. He died on May 17, 1945, at the age of 84.

The National Park Service and what is now called the National Parks Conservation Association remain successful organizations. The National Park System of the United States protects more than 400 sites covering an area exceeding in all 50 states, Washington, D.C., <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="Saipan">Saipan</a>, and the <a href="Virgin%20Islands">Virgin Islands</a>. His work to preserve wilderness in the United States has also endured. After his death, three members of The Wilderness Society took on his various duties; <a href="Benton%20MacKaye">Benton MacKaye</a> officially replaced him as president, but executive secretary <a href="Howard%20Zahniser">Howard Zahniser</a> and director <a href="Olaus%20Murie">Olaus Murie</a> ran the society for the next two decades. Zahniser also took over the society's magazine, making "The Living Wilderness" into a successful quarterly publication.

The December 1945 issue of "The Living Wilderness" was dedicated to Yard's life and work; in one article, fellow co-founder <a href="Ernest%20Oberholtzer">Ernest Oberholtzer</a> wrote that "the form he [Yard] gave The Wilderness Society was the crowning of a lifelong vision. He undertook it with a freshness that belied his years and revealed, as nothing else could, the vitality of his inspiration. Few men in America have ever had such understanding of the spiritual quality of the American scene, and fewer still the voice to go with it."

Yard's effect on the Wilderness Society proved long-lasting; he was responsible for initiating cooperation with other major preservationist groups, including the National Park Association. He also established a durable alliance with the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>, founded in 1892 by noted preservationist <a href="John%20Muir">John Muir</a>. This alliance proved crucial during the proposal and eventual passage of the <a href="Wilderness%20Act">Wilderness Act</a>. The act, which was signed into law by President <a href="Lyndon%20B.%20Johnson">Lyndon B. Johnson</a> on September 3, 1964, was the first major victory for The Wilderness Society. Written by Zahniser, it enabled Congress to set aside selected areas in the national forests, national parks, national wildlife refuges and other federal lands, as units to be kept permanently unchanged by humans. Since its conception, The Wilderness Society has contributed a total of 104 million acres (421,000 km²) to the <a href="National%20Wilderness%20Preservation%20System">National Wilderness Preservation System</a>.

Most quests consist of combat missions, but some involve the player interacting with <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s during visits to settlements. As the player progresses throughout the game, different locations and new squad members become available. <a href="Experience%20point">Experience point</a>s are gained by completing quests. Each time a sufficient amount of experience is obtained, the player "levels up" and is awarded Squad Points that can be used to develop powers for both Shepard and the members of the squad. Powers provide enhanced combat capabilities, with each power having four ranks that can be unlocked. Each rank costs the same number of Squad Points as its rank. For example, unlocking the first rank of a power requires one point, but unlocking all four ranks of a single power requires a total of ten points. Upon raising a power to its fourth rank, the player must evolve the power into one of two given forms.

The player's primary mode of transportation is a starship which serves as Shepard's base of operations. Aboard the ship, the player can interact with the squad members, customize the player's armor, travel to numerous <a href="planetary%20systems">planetary systems</a>, and scan planets for mineral resources. These resources allow the player to research numerous in-game upgrades that are found in the missions, providing benefits such as increasing weapon damage, fortifying the player's health, or extending the ship's fuel capacity, among others. Scanning requires the player to move a <a href="reticle">reticle</a> over a planet and launch a <a href="Space%20probe">probe</a> when an <a href="oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> warns of near resources. Additional upgrades, equipment, and non-essential items such as magazines and decorations for the ship can be purchased from merchants in settlements.

Combat in "Mass Effect 2" is squad-based and a maximum of two squad members may accompany the player on the battlefield. The player has direct control of Shepard while the squad members are controlled by the game's <a href="Artificial%20intelligence%20%28video%20games%29">artificial intelligence</a>. Battles take place in <a href="Time-keeping%20systems%20in%20games">real-time</a>, but the player can pause the action at any time to calmly target enemies and select different powers for the squad members to use. The game uses an <a href="Over%20the%20shoulder%20shot">over the shoulder perspective</a> akin to a <a href="third-person%20shooter">third-person shooter</a>, and places a strong emphasis on using <a href="Cover%20system">cover</a> to avoid taking damage while fighting enemy forces. The player may also issue commands to the squad members, such as sending them to take cover behind a manually picked object or focus their fire on a designated target.

Unlike the original "Mass Effect", where weapons overheat if fired continuously for prolonged periods, the weapons of "Mass Effect 2" have a finite <a href="Magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazine</a> and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots. Shepard and the squad members are protected by a damage-absorbing shield. When the shield is fully depleted, further damage reduces the <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">hit points</a> of a secondary health meter. Both the shield bar and health meter automatically regenerate when not taking fire for a brief period. The player can revive fallen squad members with the use of the Unity power. However, if Shepard dies, the player must start the game again from the last saved point.

All enemies are protected by health, shields, armor, barriers, or a combination thereof. Each type of protection has its own vulnerabilities. For example, armor is usually vulnerable to powers such as Incinerate, which burns enemies over time, and to weapons with a low <a href="rate%20of%20fire">rate of fire</a> such as sniper rifles and heavy pistols. In contrast, shields are vulnerable to powers such as Overload and to rapid-firing weapons like <a href="submachine%20gun">submachine gun</a>s and <a href="assault%20rifle">assault rifle</a>s. Barriers are typically used by <a href="Boss%20%28video%20gaming%29">boss</a>-type enemies and are vulnerable to certain weapons and powers. When the shields, armor, or barriers of an enemy have all been depleted, the player can use status-effect powers such as Pull, which temporarily levitates targets into the air, incapacitating them. Other powers may temporarily benefit the player; for instance, Adrenaline Rush puts the player in <a href="bullet%20time">bullet time</a>. Powers do not require any sort of <a href="Magic%20point">expendable resource</a>; they only have a global <a href="Cooldown">refresh time period</a>.

During conversations with characters, "Mass Effect 2" employs a <a href="Pie%20menu">radial command menu</a>, called Dialogue Wheel, where the player's <a href="Interactive%20storytelling">dialogue options</a> depend on wheel direction. The left side of the wheel is normally reserved for options that will continue the conversation in depth, while options on the right side tend to move the conversation towards completion. Responses at the top are generally more polite and selfless, while those at the bottom are more aggressive and hostile. The game also introduces a <a href="Context-sensitive%20user%20interface">context-sensitive</a> interrupt system, allowing players to interrupt the conversation with direct actions at certain times. Dialogue choices impact how others react to Shepard, the rewards for completing missions, possible discounts from merchants, romances and, most importantly, the Commander's morality.

Morality is measured by Paragon (charm) and Renegade (intimidate) points. These points affect the availability of new special Paragon and Renegade dialogue options with significant impact in the game. For example, the game features some missions to gain the loyalty of the squad. What the player does during one of these missions will determine whether they gain the loyalty of a squad member, which in turn will unlock a special power and also help in the final battle. Endings range from the entire team surviving to the entire team being killed, Shepard included, and everything in between. Upon completing the game, a <a href="New%20Game%20Plus">New Game Plus</a> option is unlocked, allowing players to replay the game using the same character with which they finished it.

"Mass Effect 2" is set within the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a> galaxy during the 22nd century where <a href="interstellar%20travel">interstellar travel</a> is possible through the use of mass transit devices called Mass Relays, a technology believed to have been built by an extinct alien race known as the Protheans. A conglomerate body of governments known as the Citadel Council controls a large percentage of the galaxy and is responsible for maintaining law and order among races of the galactic community. Races that belong to the Citadel Council include humans, asari, salarians and turians. Other alien races seen in the game include the reptilian krogan and drell, the environmental suited quarians, and a hostile race of networked <a href="artificial%20intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>s called geth. During the events of the original "<a href="Mass%20Effect%20%28video%20game%29">Mass Effect</a>", a geth army attempted to open a portal for the Reapers, a highly advanced machine race of synthetic-organic starships that are believed to eradicate all organic civilization every 50,000 years. The galactic community has since lived in fear of another possible invasion. Meanwhile, a human supremacist organization called Cerberus believes that humans deserve a greater role in the galactic community and supports the principle that any methods of advancing humanity's ascension are entirely justified, including illegal experimentation and <a href="Terrorism">terrorist</a> activities.

The protagonist of the game is Commander Shepard (voiced by <a href="Mark%20Meer">Mark Meer</a> or <a href="Jennifer%20Hale">Jennifer Hale</a>), an elite human soldier who is the Commanding Officer of the "SSV Normandy" and "Normandy SR-2" starships. Shepard's squad members include human Cerberus operative <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Jacob%20Taylor">Jacob Taylor</a> (Adam Lazarre-White), human Cerberus officer <a href="Miranda%20Lawson">Miranda Lawson</a> (<a href="Yvonne%20Strahovski">Yvonne Strahovski</a>), salarian scientist <a href="Mordin%20Solus">Mordin Solus</a> (Michael Beattie), turian vigilante <a href="Garrus%20Vakarian">Garrus Vakarian</a> (<a href="Brandon%20Keener">Brandon Keener</a>), human criminal <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Jack">Jack</a> (<a href="Courtenay%20Taylor">Courtenay Taylor</a>), genetically engineered krogan super soldier <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Grunt">Grunt</a> (<a href="Steve%20Blum">Steve Blum</a>), quarian engineer <a href="Tali%27Zorah">Tali'Zorah</a> (Liz Sroka), drell assassin <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Thane%20Krios">Thane Krios</a> (<a href="Keythe%20Farley">Keythe Farley</a>), asari Justicar <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Samara">Samara</a> (Maggie Baird) or Samara's serial killer daughter <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Morinth">Morinth</a> (<a href="Natalia%20Cigliuti">Natalia Cigliuti</a>), and geth mobile platform <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Legion">Legion</a> (<a href="D.%20C.%20Douglas">D. C. Douglas</a>). Other characters include the "Normandy"s pilot <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Jeff%20%26quot%3BJoker%26quot%3B%20Moreau">Jeff "Joker" Moreau</a> (<a href="Seth%20Green">Seth Green</a>), Cerberus leader the <a href="Illusive%20Man">Illusive Man</a> (<a href="Martin%20Sheen">Martin Sheen</a>), and the "Normandy SR-2"s enhanced defense intelligence, also known as <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23EDI">EDI</a> (<a href="Tricia%20Helfer">Tricia Helfer</a>).

In 2183, shortly after the events of the first game, the "SSV Normandy", while patrolling for geth resistance, is attacked by an unknown vessel, forcing the crew to abandon ship. Shepard pushes Joker into the final <a href="escape%20pod">escape pod</a> before being blasted into space. After a suit breach, Shepard dies via <a href="asphyxia">asphyxia</a>tion as his/her body is pulled into the orbit of a nearby planet. The body is recovered by Cerberus, who begins the "Lazarus Project" with the sole purpose of bringing Shepard back to life. Two years later, Shepard is revived on an operating table and escapes a research station under attack by its own security <a href="mecha">mechs</a> alongside Jacob Taylor and Miranda Lawson. Shepard is brought to meet the Illusive Man, who reveals that entire populations of human colonies have been disappearing all over the galaxy. Now working for Cerberus, Shepard is sent to investigate a recently attacked colony, where he/she finds clues suggesting that the Reapers are working by proxy through an <a href="insectoid">insectoid</a> species called the Collectors.

The Illusive Man explains that the Collectors reside beyond the Omega-4 Relay, a place from which no ship has ever returned, and tasks Shepard with assembling a team to stop them. Shepard is also given command of a new starship, the "Normandy SR-2", piloted once again by Joker and equipped with an onboard AI named EDI. Shepard recruits Mordin Solus, former squad member Garrus Vakarian, Jack, and (optionally) Grunt, before the Illusive Man informs him/her that another human colony is under attack. With the help of Mordin's studies on Collector biology, Shepard defends the colony, but is unable to stop a large portion of the population from being captured. Shepard can then recruit former squad member Tali'Zorah, Thane Krios, and Samara (later optionally replaced by Morinth), before being sent to explore a supposedly disabled Collector ship. There, Shepard learns that the Collectors were originally Protheans that were turned into slaves of the Reapers. With EDI's help, Shepard also finds out how to bypass the Omega-4 Relay before being ambushed by the Collectors. Although Shepard's squad escapes, his/her relationship with the Illusive Man is strained due to his prior knowledge of the trap.

Shepard visits a derelict Reaper and acquires an <a href="Identification%20friend%20or%20foe">IFF</a> necessary to safely travel through the Omega-4 Relay. Shepard also acquires a disabled geth that, if activated, joins the squad as Legion. While Shepard and the squad leave in a shuttle, the "Normandy SR-2" integrates the IFF into her systems. During their absence, the Collectors board the "Normandy SR-2". Only Joker avoids capture and, with EDI's help, is able to extract the "Normandy SR-2" to safety. When Shepard's squad returns, the team uses the Omega-4 Relay to reach the Collector base, located in the <a href="Galactic%20Center">Galactic Center</a>. The team rescues any surviving crew members and fights their way to the central chamber. Squad members will either survive or perish depending on the upgrades made to the "Normandy SR-2", their loyalty to Shepard, and the tasks they are assigned in battle.

In the central chamber, Shepard discovers that the Collectors have been constructing a new Human-Reaper made from the genetic material of the abducted colonists. Shepard destroys the machine powering it and prepares to destroy the Collector base. However, the Illusive Man proposes <a href="Sterilization%20%28microbiology%29">sterilizing</a> the base instead with a timed <a href="radiation">radiation</a> pulse so that it can be used against the Reapers. After deciding the fate of the base, Shepard destroys the awakened Human-Reaper and escapes with the surviving squad members. If no squad members survive, Shepard fails to escape and dies. Back on the "Normandy SR-2", after speaking with the Illusive Man one last time, Shepard meets the survivors in the cargo bay. There, Joker gives him/her schematics of a Reaper. The final scene shows the Reapers awakening in <a href="Intergalactic%20space">dark space</a> and descending upon the galaxy.

"Mass Effect 2" was developed by <a href="BioWare">BioWare</a> and directed by <a href="Casey%20Hudson">Casey Hudson</a>, who previously led the production of the first "Mass Effect" game. Before actual production began, BioWare created a list of goals to work towards based on feedback from fans, reviewers, and internal people. The company's main goal was to "create an experience that was less about being a game and more about being an experience." In contrast to the exclusive focus on the main story of the original "Mass Effect", Hudson explained that BioWare was interested in a plot where optional stories had as much intensity as the main story and decided that the idea of recruiting people and making them loyal to the player so that they could survive a suicide mission allowed to explore these possibilities. He noted, "the funny thing is that people will say 'other than gathering your crew and building your team and getting ready for this mission, there's not much story there.' But that is the story."

During the first stages of development, the designers' priority was purely on streamlining and polishing the <a href="Shooter%20game">shooting</a> aspects; <a href="Role-playing%20video%20game">RPG</a> elements were not added until this process was complete. According to lead designer Christina Norman, "we wanted more satisfying combat and a big part of that is making weapons more accurate and powerful at level one—basically saying 'let's take the RPG out of the shooter.'" Since BioWare had no experience with shooter games, the team spent roughly three months tuning how combat would work using the original "Mass Effect" as a basis. The camera was improved to offer a more precise aiming that included body-specific targeting like headshots. Norman explained that they wanted the weapons to have their own identity, noting that the final build of the game has 19 weapons with 108 tuning variables. The inclusion of limited ammunition was initially not part of the game design and was simply implemented for some early playtesting. However, the developers ultimately felt it improved the tension and pacing of combat.

Real-time gameplay with an emphasis on weapons and cover was a preference because the team felt that the constant pausing to select powers interrupts the intensity of the combat. As a result, more options to assign different abilities to the <a href="user%20interface">user interface</a> for use in real-time were added. Developers also decided to introduce regenerating health because it prevented players from playing erratically and relying on health kits. Norman remarked that it was important not to oversimplify the RPG elements but to still make them easier to use. She explained that the original "Mass Effect" offered "too many choices that weren't particularly representative of how they would impact the game. In "Mass Effect 2", the leveling options were pared down and made more descriptive." For the character classes, the developers wanted to create very different play styles, "even if it meant cutting some of the possible choices." The powers were balanced with a unified refresh time period since the earlier system, where powers could be used sequentially, was considered "ridiculous and endgame easy."

Keeping track of the enemies' strengths and weaknesses was made more consistent with different types of health bars so that players did not have to estimate what types of challenges they were facing when fighting new enemies. The game's <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">HUD</a> was revised eight times during development. As the inventory management of the original "Mass Effect" received criticism, designing a new inventory system for "Mass Effect 2" was one of the main concerns during development. Ideally, the inventory needed to be able to handle a large number of characters with simplicity. Norman spent time examining various inventory systems from other RPG games, but none could be applied to support the game's large number of characters. Ultimately, the team opted to replace it with a set of different systems that provide the same functionality without any sort of management. This concept allowed a character to use a weapon without taking it away from someone else.

The planetary exploration of the original "Mass Effect" was completely revamped. Instead of having large barren landscapes, the designers opted to build distinct and interesting places. The goal was to encourage players to keep exploring the galaxy by changing their expectations about what they could find. Originally, developers experimented with the idea of having a vehicle that could be used to navigate the planetary terrain in a more flexible way than in the original title. However, the vehicle was ultimately removed from the final build of the game. The context-sensitive interrupt system, which was originally meant to be a feature in the original "Mass Effect", was introduced in "Mass Effect 2" to help blend the dialogue better with the rest of the action. The pacing of the story was also improved because developers wanted to get players into the action faster.

Since the "<a href="Mass%20Effect">Mass Effect</a>" series was envisioned as a trilogy from its inception, work on "Mass Effect 2" started shortly before the original "Mass Effect" was released. The game was initially developed exclusively for the <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and <a href="Xbox%20360">Xbox 360</a> platforms with the same level of dedication. As a result, each version of the game features different user interfaces and controls. Like its predecessor, "Mass Effect 2" was built using <a href="Epic%20Games">Epic Games</a>' <a href="Unreal%20Engine%203">Unreal Engine 3</a> in conjunction with a <a href="Software%20framework">framework</a> that BioWare specifically developed for the "Mass Effect" games. As most of these "Mass Effect" technologies were already developed in the first game, the development team focused on adding a lot of new content and perfecting new features rather than creating them from scratch. Technical improvements included better <a href="memory%20management">memory management</a>, greater textures, a higher <a href="frame%20rate">frame rate</a>, and better <a href="lighting">lighting</a> scenarios. According to Hudson, "I actually can't think of an aspect of the game that we haven't overhauled and made 100% better."

"Mass Effect 2" contains voices from 90 <a href="voice%20actors">voice actors</a> who play 546 characters and speak over 25,000 lines of dialogue. Voice recording for the game took twice as long as the original "Mass Effect". The Unreal Engine 3's Matinee tool, which allows developers to animate characters during cinematics, was integrated into BioWare's own technology for digital acting and conversation. As Hudson explained, "Our writers write into a dialogue editor and that becomes fused with the way that you end up seeing many different pieces of Matinee play out in combination when you have a conversation with characters." Another Unreal Engine 3 technology, Kismet, was used for scripting how levels or enemies would respond to a certain action. As the game's programmers were already familiar with the Unreal Engine 3 after using it on the first "Mass Effect" game, they did not feel the need to constantly communicate with Epic Games for support.

Although "Mass Effect 2" was primarily developed at BioWare's <a href="Edmonton">Edmonton</a> studio, a new team of 30 people was set to work at <a href="EA%20Montreal">EA Montreal</a> in March 2009 to supplement the teams already working on the game. The new team was composed of a number of people who worked on the original game, but the majority was new hires. Overall, "Mass Effect 2" was developed over the course of roughly two years and more than 150 people worked on the game. Hudson mentioned two significant challenges that interfered with the development: the <a href="2008%E2%80%932012%20global%20recession">2008–2012 global recession</a> limited the game's budget, and the team had to get through it without impacting their ambitious goals. Additionally, due to the <a href="2009%20flu%20pandemic">2009 flu pandemic</a>, a significant part of the team was ill during the last months of development, resulting in a loss of a man-year of time. Despite these factors, Hudson described the development of "Mass Effect 2" as successful "on time, on budget, and exceeding quality goals."

Initially, BioWare denied that a <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> version was in the works. Despite this, it was reported that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of <a href="Computer%20program">code</a> referencing the PlayStation 3. BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is <a href="cross-platform">cross-platform</a>, which is the reason why it includes PlayStation 3 code. Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of "Mass Effect 2" was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses a modified version of the Unreal Engine 3 called "Mass Effect 3" engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming "<a href="Mass%20Effect%203">Mass Effect 3</a>". In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the <a href="PlayStation%203%20controller">PlayStation 3 controller</a>. An option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.

The music of "Mass Effect 2" was primarily composed by <a href="Jack%20Wall%20%28composer%29">Jack Wall</a>. His previous work with BioWare was as the main composer for "<a href="Jade%20Empire">Jade Empire</a>" and the original "Mass Effect". The score also features some pieces by Sam Hulick, David Kates, and Jimmy Hinson (better known as <a href="Big%20Giant%20Circles">Big Giant Circles</a>), with additional editing and in-game implementation by Brian DiDomenico. Unlike with the original "Mass Effect", the composers aimed for a darker and more mature sound to match the mood of the game. The music incorporates both <a href="orchestra">orchestra</a>l and classic <a href="Science%20fiction">sci-fi</a> arrangements which were inspired by the soundtrack of the 1982 film "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>" and music by German <a href="Electronic%20music">electronic</a> group <a href="Tangerine%20Dream">Tangerine Dream</a>. The <a href="harmonic">harmonic</a> structure of <a href="Wendy%20Carlos">Wendy Carlos</a>'s "<a href="Tron">Tron</a>" soundtrack also represented significant influences. To complement each character, the composers gave them their own theme song to convey their personalities and backgrounds. According to Kates, "it was one of our mandates to create a dynamic score that expressed a wide range of emotions."

Overall, around 180 minutes of music were composed for "Mass Effect 2", which totalled more than 700 assets. The song "Callista" by video game music composer <a href="Saki%20Kaskas">Saki Kaskas</a>, who wrote the music for five "<a href="Need%20for%20Speed">Need for Speed</a>" games, was used as the game's Afterlife Club theme. Music from the game has been released in several albums. BioWare released the main <a href="soundtrack%20album">soundtrack album</a>, "Mass Effect 2: Original Videogame Score", on January 19, 2010. The soundtrack spans two discs and 27 tracks, covering a duration of 1:55:43. "Mass Effect 2"s score was nominated for Best Original Music at the 2011 <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> Awards, and Best Soundtrack Album at the 9th Annual Game Audio Network Guild Awards. In 2012, "Legacy", an album composed mostly of tracks written for "Mass Effect 2" but not used in the game was released by Big Giant Circles.

"Mass Effect 2" was formally unveiled at the <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a> on March 17, 2009, accompanied by a teaser <a href="Trailer%20%28promotion%29">trailer</a> which declared Shepard to be "killed in action". The announcement confirmed that the game would be released for both Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. In June 2009, the game was presented at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a>, where it was confirmed that Shepard would be alive and playable in "Mass Effect 2", but the character could die at the end of the game. If the game was pre-ordered at certain retailers, players could receive new in-game armors and weapons. Players could also redeem codes on specially marked <a href="Dr%20Pepper">Dr Pepper</a> products for one of three pieces of headgear, and on registered copies of "" for a new armor. In the months leading up to the game's release, BioWare released a final cinematic trailer and launched six class trailers narrated by Norman.

"Mass Effect 2" was initially released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 on January 26, 2010, in North America and January 29, 2010, in Europe. Alongside the standard edition, a digital deluxe edition and a <a href="collector%27s%20edition">collector's edition</a> were made available for purchase. The collector's edition featured a different packaging, an artbook, bonus in-game content, a behind-the-scenes DVD, and one issue from the "" comic series. Electronic Arts sold-in more than two million copies of the game to worldwide retailers in its first week of release. Although "Mass Effect 2" was released at the end of the month, it became the second best-selling game of January 2010 with 572,100 units sold, behind <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a>'s "<a href="New%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%20Wii">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a>".

At <a href="Gamescom">Gamescom</a> 2010, BioWare announced that a <a href="PlayStation%203">PlayStation 3</a> version of the game was in development. Microsoft responded to the announcement that, despite losing the game's exclusivity, the Xbox 360 was still the most appropriate console to play the game due to the game's compatibility with the original "Mass Effect", which was only available on the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 systems at the time. The PlayStation 3 version was released on January 18, 2011, in North America and January 21, 2011, in Europe. The <a href="PlayStation%20Network">PlayStation Network</a> version accounted for more than 10% of the game's overall sales on PlayStation 3. As of April 2011, it was reported that both the original "Mass Effect" and "Mass Effect 2" combined have sold more than seven million units worldwide. In 2012, a compilation featuring the three main games of the series, titled "<a href="Mass%20Effect%20Trilogy">Mass Effect Trilogy</a>", was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. In 2016, "Mass Effect 2" was added to the <a href="List%20of%20Xbox%20360%20games%20compatible%20with%20Xbox%20One">list of backward compatible Xbox 360 games</a> on <a href="Xbox%20One">Xbox One</a>.

New purchases of the game are provided with a one-time use card granting access code that unlocks the game's <a href="Cerberus%20Network">Cerberus Network</a>, an online <a href="downloadable%20content">downloadable content</a> and news service that enables bonus content for the game. However, users who bought the game used would have to pay for the Cerberus Network separately if they wanted access to the new content. This policy allows publishers to combat the used-game market; companies like <a href="GameStop">GameStop</a> have allowed costumers to sell used games back to the retailer so that the company can resell them at a small discount to other customers, but the publisher does not make a profit. BioWare online development director Fernando Melo revealed that 11% of all "Mass Effect 2"s downloadable content revenue came from the Cerberus Network. The policy attracted criticism from some of the fan community, who have criticized downloadable content as being overpriced and an incentive for developers to leave items out of the initial release.

Shortly after the game's release, it was reported that the game's font-size had been formatted in such a way as to make in-game text difficult to read on <a href="standard%20definition%20television">standard definition television</a>s. Representatives from BioWare stated that the issue was a design choice instead of a <a href="Software%20bug">bug</a>. Mark Barlet, president of the website <a href="The%20AbleGamers%20Foundation">AbleGamers</a>, which advocates for making games more accessible to the disabled, observed that "It's not just the size of the text of "Mass Effect 2" that is the problem, it's the coloring of the text" that is the problem. After investigating the complaints further, BioWare released a statement acknowledging that "on some standard definition TVs the smallest text in "Mass Effect 2" can be difficult to read", and concluded that they were unable to resolve it through a title update. However, they stated that they would take it into consideration for future games.

Other issues with regards to <a href="Crash%20%28computing%29">crashes</a>, temporary <a href="Hang%20%28computing%29">freezes</a> and long load times were found on single core computers, but these were ultimately addressed in a <a href="Patch%20%28computing%29">patch</a>. A second patch, which reduced the amount of mining time required to acquire upgrades, fixed some saved game loading issues, and addressed other minor bugs, was also released. On PlayStation 3, a concerning number of players reported that their save files can become corrupted if the game crashes unexpectedly. After community chief Chris Priestly of BioWare asked affected players to provide details about the issue, BioWare released a PlayStation 3 patch designed to combat save bugs and crashes experienced.

"Mass Effect 2" supports additional in-game content in the form of downloadable content packs that were released from January 2010 to May 2011. The downloadable content ranges from single in-game character outfits to entirely new plot-related missions. Major packs include "" and "", which are vital to the series' plot. In "Lair of the Shadow Broker", Shepard helps former squad member <a href="Characters%20of%20the%20Mass%20Effect%20universe%23Liara%20T%27Soni">Liara T'Soni</a> to find an information dealer known as the Shadow Broker. In "Arrival", Shepard investigates evidence of a Reaper invasion, leading to events that bridge to "Mass Effect 3". Other plot-related downloadable content packs include the loyalty missions "Zaeed – The Price of Revenge" and "", and "", which adds five new missions to the game.

Unlike the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows versions of the game, the PlayStation 3 version includes the "Kasumi – Stolen Memory", "Overlord", and "Lair of the Shadow Broker" packs. Since the first "Mass Effect" game was originally not released on PlayStation 3, BioWare released "Genesis", a downloadable content pack which allows the player to impact the story of the game with several major plot decisions of the first game. These decisions are made through a digital interactive <a href="comic">comic</a> which appears at the beginning of the game. "Genesis" was eventually released on May 17, 2011, for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 users. The game's downloadable content was generally well received by critics and some packs were nominated for Best DLC (downloadable content) at the <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>.

Upon release, "Mass Effect 2" received universal critical acclaim from <a href="Video%20game%20journalism">video game publications</a>. Substantial praise was given to the game's diverse characters, <a href="interactive%20storytelling">interactive storytelling</a>, voice acting and art design. <a href="IGN">IGN</a> reviewer Erik Brudvig called "Mass Effect 2" a very personal game, with a lot of emotion involved. He praised the option of importing a character, stating that the overall experience changes as different saved games from the previous game are used. Tom Bramwell of <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> highlighted positively the weight of social interaction on the outcome of events and that players feel actual pressure for their decisions. Further praise was given to the game's characters. "<a href="Edge%20%28magazine%29">Edge</a>" credited them for their complex personalities and great <a href="characterization">characterization</a>, while <a href="Game%20Revolution">Game Revolution</a> pointed out that the loyalty missions "reach deep enough into their characters to make you empathize with all of them".

The game's visuals and atmosphere received similar praise. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> reviewer Kevin VanOrd remarked that "Mass Effect 2" is more detailed and darker than its predecessor. He wrote that "deep reds and glowing <a href="indigo">indigo</a>s saturate certain scenes, making them richer and more sinister; eerie fog limits your vision in one side mission, while rain pours down upon you in another. Subtle, moody lighting gives certain interactions great impact." Reviewer Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer credited the conversations and <a href="cutscene">cutscene</a>s for featuring better cinematography than the first game, stating that "it's hard to imagine them becoming much better in "Mass Effect 3"". Critics also gave high marks to the game's extensive <a href="Voice%20acting">cast of voices</a>, in particular Martin Sheen's performance of the Illusive Man, which was singled out for "steal[ing] the show". Andrew Reiner, writing for "<a href="Game%20Informer">Game Informer</a>", opined that the music "flows beautifully" in both the story and action sequences. The game's presentation and direction were considered "miles ahead of the competition".

Numerous publications declared the gameplay was an improvement over the original. John Davison of "<a href="GamePro">GamePro</a>" wrote "BioWare has done a spectacular job moving the role playing genre forward, and blending disparate gameplay styles into genuinely exciting sci-fi epic." VanOrd praised "Mass Effect 2" for possessing an identity, which was something that its predecessor lacked. He noted that the shooting is "more immediate and satisfying, which keeps the pace moving and intensifies the violence of each encounter". Similarly, <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a>s Gerald Villoria observed that, while the original "Mass Effect" "walked the line between RPG and shooter [...] "Mass Effect 2" has become a much more focused shooter experience". Jeremy Parish of <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> credited the combat for being more balanced, stating that the game encourages players to use different weapon classes and squad abilities when the situation requires it. Some publications, however, expressed concerns about the game's simplified RPG elements, calling it "stripped-down" and with a "dumbed-down feeling". The game's slow planet scanning was also criticized. Game Revolution felt it was a "chore, mandatory if you want upgrades and boring because there is no tension or challenge", but ultimately concluded that the game as a whole "does more than enough to live up to its predecessor".

Reception for the PlayStation 3 version was similar. Colin Moriarty of IGN described it as "the best, most complete version of the game available" due to the upgraded game engine and the extra downloadable content packs. In contrast, VanOrd criticized the inclusion of the character Kasumi Goto from the "Kasumi – Stolen Memory" pack, stating that "she never fits in with her more fully developed cohorts." He also remarked that the PlayStation 3 version suffers from technical issues such as frame rate inconsistencies, graphical glitches, and other minor bugs, which are mostly present in the downloadable content sections of the game. "Game Informer" reviewer Joe Juba reacted negatively to the lack of save importation from the original "Mass Effect", which was originally not released on PlayStation 3, and pointed out that the decisions made in the "Genesis" comic "have practically no context". Despite the criticism, he stated that the game itself is equally as good on PlayStation 3 as it is on Xbox 360.

"Mass Effect 2" collected numerous year-end awards. At the 14th Annual <a href="D.I.C.E.%20Summit">D.I.C.E. Awards</a>, "Mass Effect 2" won awards for Game of the Year, Role-Playing/Massively Multiplayer Game of the Year, and Outstanding Achievement in Story. At the 2010 <a href="Spike%20Video%20Game%20Awards">Spike Video Game Awards</a>, the game won for Best Xbox 360 Game and Best RPG; BioWare was also recognized for its work on the game and was awarded Studio of the Year. At the 2011 Canadian Videogame Awards, the game was awarded Game of the Year, Best Console Game, Best Game Design, and Best Writing. "Mass Effect 2" received several other notable awards, including Best Game at the 2011 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards, Best Writing at the 2011 <a href="Game%20Developers%20Choice%20Awards">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, and two <a href="Golden%20Joystick%20Awards">Golden Joystick Awards</a>: Best RPG of the Year and Ultimate Game of the Year.

"Mass Effect 2" continued to receive attention years after its release. "<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a>" editor Hollander Cooper explained that the game improved the technical issues of its predecessor significantly, while at the same time "expanding the already-impressive universe without sacrificing what made the series special." He went so far as to call the game "<a href="The%20Empire%20Strikes%20Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a>" of video games, stating that "few sequels have trumped the original as handily as "Mass Effect 2"." The game's focus on characters, along with their deeper stresses and internal conflicts, was highly praised. Rick Lane of Eurogamer described "Mass Effect 2" as a darker, warmer, and overall more human game than its predecessor, noting that it is the player's responsibility to make sure these characters are prepared for the final mission, otherwise they will die. He explained that "Mass Effect 2" is a long quest that "works towards an epic climax", and when it arrives there, "it doesn't disappoint."

"Mass Effect 2" has been cited as one of the <a href="List%20of%20video%20games%20considered%20the%20best">greatest video games of all time</a> by multiple publications, including "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" in 2014, IGN in 2015, "<a href="Polygon%20%28website%29">Polygon</a>" in 2017, and "Game Informer" in 2018. In 2011, the game was selected as one of 80 titles from the past 40 years to be placed in the Art of Video Games exhibit in the <a href="Smithsonian%20American%20Art%20Museum">Smithsonian American Art Museum</a>. According to the museum, the exhibit explored "the 40-year evolution of video games as an artistic medium, with a focus on striking visual effects and the creative use of new technologies."

A sequel to the game, entitled "Mass Effect 3", was released in 2012. The sequel begins on <a href="Earth">Earth</a> with Commander Shepard having been detained following the events in the "Arrival" downloadable content pack. The story of the game is influenced by decisions the player made in the original "Mass Effect" and "Mass Effect 2". However, if Shepard dies at the end of "Mass Effect 2", the character cannot be imported into "Mass Effect 3". BioWare stated that "Mass Effect 3" ends Shepard's story arc and that future games in the series would feature a different context. Unlike its predecessors, "Mass Effect 3" features a <a href="multiplayer%20video%20game">multiplayer</a> <a href="Cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative</a> mode in addition to the single-player campaign. Although the game received critical acclaim from video game publications, its ending was poorly received by fans, who felt that it did not meet expectations.

First-move advantage in chess

The first-move advantage in chess is the inherent advantage of the player (<a href="White%20and%20Black%20in%20chess">White</a>) who makes the first move in <a href="chess">chess</a>. Chess players and <a href="Chess%20theory">theorists</a> generally agree that White begins the game with some advantage. Since 1851, compiled <a href="statistics">statistics</a> support this view; White consistently slightly more often than <a href="White%20and%20Black%20in%20chess">Black</a>, usually scoring between 52 and 56 percent. White's is about the same for <a href="tournament">tournament</a> games between humans and games between <a href="computer">computer</a>s; however, White's advantage is less significant in <a href="Fast%20chess">blitz</a> games and games between novices.

Chess players and <a href="Chess%20theory">theoreticians</a> have long debated whether, given <a href="Solved%20game%23Perfect%20play">perfect play</a> by both sides, the game should end in a win for White or a <a href="draw%20%28chess%29">draw</a>. Since approximately 1889, when <a href="World%20Chess%20Championship">World Champion</a> <a href="Wilhelm%20Steinitz">Wilhelm Steinitz</a> addressed this issue, the consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. A few notable players have argued, however, that White's advantage may be sufficient to a win: <a href="Weaver%20Adams">Weaver Adams</a> and <a href="Vsevolod%20Rauzer">Vsevolod Rauzer</a> claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while <a href="Hans%20Berliner">Hans Berliner</a> argued that 1.d4 may win for White.

Some players, including world champions such as <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Ra%C3%BAl%20Capablanca">José Raúl Capablanca</a>, <a href="Emanuel%20Lasker">Emanuel Lasker</a>, and <a href="Bobby%20Fischer">Bobby Fischer</a>, have expressed fears of a "draw death" as chess becomes more deeply analyzed. To alleviate this danger, Capablanca and Fischer both proposed <a href="chess%20variant">chess variant</a>s to revitalize the game, while Lasker suggested changing how draws and <a href="stalemate">stalemate</a> are scored.

Since 1988, chess theorists have challenged previously well-established views about White's advantage. <a href="Grandmaster%20%28chess%29">Grandmaster</a> (GM) <a href="Andr%C3%A1s%20Adorj%C3%A1n">András Adorján</a> wrote a series of books on the theme that "Black is OK!", arguing that the general perception that White has an advantage is founded more in <a href="psychology">psychology</a> than reality. GM <a href="Mihai%20Suba">Mihai Suba</a> and others contend that sometimes White's disappears for no apparent reason as a game progresses. The prevalent style of play for Black today is to seek unbalanced, positions with active , rather than merely trying to .

Modern writers also argue that Black has certain countervailing advantages. The consensus that White should try to win can be a psychological burden for the white player, who sometimes loses by trying too hard to win. Some symmetrical openings (i.e. those where Black's moves copy White's) can lead to situations where moving first is a detriment, for either psychological or objective reasons.

Chess is not a <a href="solved%20game">solved game</a>, and it is considered unlikely that the game will be solved in the foreseeable future.

In 1946, W.F. Streeter examined the results of 5,598 games played in 45 international chess tournaments between 1851 and 1932. Streeter found that overall White scored 53.4% (W: 38.12; D: 30.56; L: 31.31). White scored 52.55% in 1851–1878 (W:45.52; D: 14.07; L: 40.41), 52.77% in 1881–1914 (W: 36.89; D: 31.76; L: 31.35), and 55.47% in 1919–1932 (W: 36.98; D: 36.98; L: 26.04). Streeter concluded, "It thus appears that it is becoming increasingly difficult to win with Black, but somewhat easier to draw."

Two decades later, statistician Arthur M. Stevens concluded in "The Blue Book of Charts to Winning Chess", based on a survey of 56,972 master games that he completed in 1967, that White scores 59.1%. However, Stevens assembled his games from those that had been published in chess magazines, rather than complete collections of all the games played in particular events.

More recent sources indicate that White scores approximately 54 to 56 percent. In 2005, GM <a href="Jonathan%20Rowson">Jonathan Rowson</a> wrote that "the conventional wisdom is that White begins the game with a small advantage and, holding all other factors constant, scores approximately 56% to Black's 44%". <a href="International%20Master">International Master</a> (IM) <a href="John%20L.%20Watson">John Watson</a> wrote in 1998 that White had scored 56% for most of the 20th century, but that this figure had recently slipped to 55%. The website <a href="Chessgames.com">Chessgames.com</a> holds regularly updated statistics on its games <a href="database">database</a>. As of January 12, 2015, White had won 37.50%, 34.90% were drawn, and Black had won 27.60% out of 739,769 games, resulting in a total White winning percentage of 54.95%.

"<a href="New%20In%20Chess">New In Chess</a>" observed in its 2000 Yearbook that of the 731,740 games in its database, White scored 54.8% overall; with the two most popular opening moves, White scored 54.1% in 349,855 games beginning 1.e4 (moving the king's pawn 2 spaces forwards), and 56.1% in 296,200 games beginning 1.d4 (moving the queen's pawn 2 spaces forwards). The main reason that 1.e4 was less effective than 1.d4 was the <a href="Sicilian%20Defence">Sicilian Defence</a> (1.e4 c5), which gave White only a 52.3% score in 145,996 games.

<a href="Statistician">Statistician</a> <a href="Jeff%20Sonas">Jeff Sonas</a>, in examining data from 266,000 games played between 1994 and 2001, concluded that White scored 54.1767% plus 0.001164 times White's <a href="Elo%20rating">Elo rating</a> advantage, treating White's rating advantage as +390 if it is better than +390, or −460 if it is worse than −460. He found that White's advantage is equivalent to 35 rating points, i.e. if White has a rating 35 points below Black's, each player will have an expected score of 50%. Sonas also found that White's advantage is smaller (53%) in <a href="fast%20chess">rapid</a> games than in games at a slower ("classical") <a href="time%20control">time control</a>. In the 462 games played at the 2009 <a href="World%20Blitz%20Chess%20Championship">World Blitz Chess Championship</a>, White scored only 52.16% (W38.96 D26.41 L34.63).

Other writers conclude that there is a <a href="positive%20correlation">positive correlation</a> between the players' ratings and White's score. According to GM <a href="Evgeny%20Sveshnikov">Evgeny Sveshnikov</a>, statistics show that White has no advantage over Black in games between beginners, but "if the players are stronger, White has the lead". An analysis of the results of games in <a href="ChessBase">ChessBase</a>'s Mega 2003 database between players with similar Elo ratings, commissioned by GM <a href="Andr%C3%A1s%20Adorj%C3%A1n">András Adorján</a>, showed that as the players' ratings went up, the percentage of draws increased, the proportion of decisive games that White won increased, and White's overall winning percentage increased. For example, taking the highest and lowest of Adorján's rating categories of 1669 games played by the highest-rated players (Elo ratings 2700 and above), White scored 55.7% overall (W26.5 D58.4 L15.2), whereas of 34,924 games played by the lowest-rated players (Elo ratings below 2100), White scored 53.1% overall (W37.0 D32.1 L30.8). Adorján also analyzed the results of games played at the very highest level: <a href="World%20Chess%20Championship">World Championship matches</a>. Of 755 games played in 34 matches between 1886 and 1990, White won 234 (31.0%), drew 397 (52.6%), and lost 124 (16.4%), for a total white winning percentage of 57.3%. In the last five matches in Adorjan's survey, all between <a href="Anatoly%20Karpov">Anatoly Karpov</a> and <a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, White won 31 (25.8%), drew 80 (66.7%), and lost 9 (7.5%), for a total white winning percentage of 59.2%.

<a href="Chess%20Engines%20Grand%20Tournament">Chess Engines Grand Tournament</a> (CEGT) tests computer <a href="chess%20engine">chess engine</a>s by playing them against each other, with time controls of 40 moves in 120 minutes per player (40/120), and also 40/20 and 40/4, and uses the results of those games to compile a rating list for each time control. At the slowest time control (40/120), White has scored 55.4% (W34.7 D41.3 L24.0) in games played among 38 of the strongest chess engines (as of May 27, 2009). At 40/20, White has scored 55.1% (W35.6 D39.1 L25.3) in games played among 1568 engines (as of April 22, 2018). At the fastest time control (40/4), White has scored 54.8% (W39.6 D30.5 L30.0), in games played among 128 programs (as of May 28, 2009).

In 2017 <a href="AlphaZero">AlphaZero</a>, playing 100 games against <a href="Stockfish%20%28chess%29">Stockfish</a>, won 25 and drew 25 as White, but won 3 and drew 47 as Black.

<a href="Joseph%20Bertin">Joseph Bertin</a> wrote in his 1735 textbook "The Noble Game of Chess", "He that plays first, is understood to have the <a href="Glossary%20of%20chess%23Attack">attack</a>." This is consistent with the traditional view that White, by virtue of the first move, begins with the and should try to extend it into the <a href="Chess%20middlegame">middlegame</a>, while Black should strive to neutralize White's initiative and attain . Because White begins with the initiative, a minor mistake by White generally leads only to loss of the initiative, while a similar mistake by Black may have more serious consequences. Thus, Sveshnikov wrote in 1994, "Black players cannot afford to make even the slightest mistake ... from a theoretical point of view, the tasks of White and Black in chess are different: White has to strive for a win, Black—for a draw!"

Chess theorists have long debated how enduring White's initiative is and whether, if both sides play perfectly, the game should end in a win for White or a draw. <a href="George%20Walker%20%28chess%20player%29">George Walker</a> wrote in 1846 that, "The first move is an advantage, ... but if properly answered, the first move is of little worth". Steinitz, the first World Champion, who is widely considered the father of modern chess, wrote in 1889, "It is now conceded by all experts that by proper play on both sides the legitimate issue of a game ought to be a draw." Lasker and Capablanca, the second and third World Champions, agreed. <a href="Reuben%20Fine">Reuben Fine</a>, one of the world's leading players from 1936 to 1951, wrote that White's opening advantage is too intangible to be sufficient for a win without an error by Black.

The view that a game of chess should end in a draw given best play prevails. Even if it cannot be proved, this assumption is considered "safe" by Rowson and "logical" by Adorján. Watson agrees that "the proper result of a perfectly played chess game ... is a draw. ... Of course, I can't prove this, but I doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree. ... I remember Kasparov, after a last-round draw, explaining to the waiting reporters: 'Well, chess is a draw. World Champion Bobby Fischer thought that "it's almost definite that the game is a draw theoretically". Similarly, British grandmaster <a href="Nigel%20Short">Nigel Short</a> wrote that "... with perfect play, God versus God ... chess is a draw".

Lasker and Capablanca both worried that chess would suffer a "draw death" as top-level players drew more and more of their games. More recently, Fischer agreed, saying that the game has become played out. All three advocated changing the <a href="rules%20of%20chess">rules of chess</a> to minimize the number of drawn games. Lasker suggested scoring less than half a point for a draw, and more than half a point for stalemating the opponent's <a href="king%20%28chess%29">king</a>. Capablanca in the 1920s proposed <a href="Capablanca%20Chess">Capablanca Chess</a>, a chess variant played on a larger board and with additional pieces. Fischer advocated <a href="Fischerandom%20Chess">Fischerandom Chess</a>, another chess variant, in which the initial position of the pieces is determined at random.

Today some of the opening variations have been analyzed so deeply that they are often used as . For example, at the highest levels, Black often uses the <a href="Ruy%20Lopez%23Marshall%20Attack">Marshall Attack</a> in the <a href="Ruy%20Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a>, a line where Black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances, to obtain an <a href="chess%20endgame">endgame</a> where Black is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play.
In 2007, GMs <a href="Kiril%20Georgiev">Kiril Georgiev</a> and <a href="Atanas%20Kolev">Atanas Kolev</a> asserted that much the same was true of the so-called <a href="Poisoned%20Pawn%20Variation">Poisoned Pawn Variation</a> of the <a href="Sicilian%20Defense%2C%20Najdorf%20Variation">Najdorf Sicilian</a>, which arises after 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Qb6 This has long been considered one of the sharpest and most problematic, or even foolhardy, opening lines. The game usually continues 8.Qd2 Qxb2 9.Rb1 Qa3. Georgiev and Kolev stated that 6.Bg5 is seldom seen at the highest level because the of this variation leads, with best play, to a draw by <a href="perpetual%20check">perpetual check</a>. They wrote that the following game "will probably remain the last word of theory":

<a href="Francisco%20Vallejo%20Pons">Francisco Vallejo Pons</a>–<a href="Garry%20Kasparov">Garry Kasparov</a>, Moscow 2004: 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 a6 6. Bg5 e6 7. f4 Qb6 8. Qd2 Qxb2 9. Rb1 Qa3 10. f5 Nc6 11. fxe6 fxe6 12. Nxc6 bxc6 13. e5 dxe5 14. Bxf6 gxf6 15. Ne4 Qxa2 16. Rd1 Be7 17. Be2 0-0 18. 0-0 Ra7 19. Rf3 Kh8 20. Rg3 Rd7 21. Qh6 Rf7 22. Qh5 Rxd1+ 23. Bxd1 Qa5 24. Kf1 Qd8 25. Qxf7 Qxd1+ 26. Kf2 Qxc2+ 27. Kf3 Qd1+ 28. Kf2 Qc2+ 29. Ke3 Bc5+ 30. Nxc5 Qxc5+ 31. Kd2 Qf2+ 32. Kc3 Qd4+ 33. Kc2 Qf2+ 34. Kc3 <a href="Draw%20%28chess%29">½–½</a> (After 34...Qd4+, White cannot escape the checks.)

However, Georgiev and Kolev's pessimistic assessment of 6.Bg5 has since been called into question, as White succeeded with 10.e5 (another critical line) in several later high-level games. GM <a href="Zaven%20Andriasyan">Zaven Andriasyan</a> wrote in 2013 that after 10.f5, "a forced draw results", but that after 10.e5, "we reach a very sharp position, with mutual chances."
Although it is very much a minority view, three prominent twentieth-century <a href="Chess%20master">master</a>s claimed that White's advantage should or may be decisive with best play. 

<a href="Weaver%20Adams">Weaver Adams</a>, then one of the leading American masters, was the best-known proponent of this view, which he introduced in his 1939 book "White to Play and Win", and <a href="Weaver%20Adams%23White%20to%20play%20and%20win%20theory">continued to expound</a> in later books and articles until shortly before his death in 1963. Adams opined that 1.e4 was White's strongest move, and that if both sides played the best moves thereafter, "White ought to win." Adams' claim was widely ridiculed, and he did not succeed in demonstrating the validity of his theory in tournament and match practice. The year after his book was published, at the finals of the 1940 <a href="U.S.%20Open%20Chess%20Championship">U.S. Open tournament</a>, he scored only one draw in his four games as White, but won all four of his games as Black. Adams also lost a match to IM <a href="Israel%20Albert%20Horowitz">I.A. Horowitz</a>, who took the black pieces in every game.

According to Sveshnikov, <a href="Vsevolod%20Rauzer">Vsevolod Rauzer</a>, a leading <a href="USSR">Soviet</a> player and theoretician during the 1930s, likewise "claimed in the [1930s]: '1.e4—and White wins!' and he managed to prove it quite often".

More recently, IM <a href="Hans%20Berliner">Hans Berliner</a>, a former World Champion of <a href="Correspondence%20Chess">Correspondence Chess</a>, claimed in his 1999 book "The System" that 1.d4 gives White a large, and possibly decisive, advantage. Berliner asserted that with best play White wins against the <a href="Gr%C3%BCnfeld%20Defense">Grünfeld Defense</a>, the <a href="Modern%20Benoni">Modern Benoni</a>, the <a href="Benko%20Gambit">Benko Gambit</a> and other (unnamed) "major defences", and achieves at least a large advantage in many lines of the <a href="Queen%27s%20Gambit%20Declined">Queen's Gambit Declined</a>. He allowed, however, that "It is possible that the rules of chess are such that only some number of plausible-appearing defences to 1.d4 can be refuted." Berliner wrote that Adams' "theories, though looked upon with scorn by most top chess players, made an immediate and lasting impression on me. Weaver W. Adams was the first person I met who actually had theories about how chess should be played."

Berliner's thesis, like Adams', has been sharply criticized.

As explained below, chess theorists in recent decades have continued to debate the size and nature of White's advantage, if any. Apart from Berliner, they have rejected the idea that White has a forced win from the opening position. Many also reject the traditional <a href="paradigm">paradigm</a> that Black's objective should be to neutralize White's initiative and obtain equality.

In 2004, GM <a href="Larry%20Kaufman">Larry Kaufman</a> expressed a more nuanced view than Adams and Berliner, arguing that the initiative stemming from the first move can always be transformed into some sort of enduring advantage, albeit not necessarily a decisive one. Kaufman writes, "I don't believe that White has a forced win in Chess. I do however believe that with either 1.e4 or 1.d4, White should be able to obtain some sort of advantage that persists into the <a href="Chess%20endgame">endgame</a>. If chess were scored like <a href="boxing">boxing</a>, with drawn games awarded by some point system to the player (if any) who came 'closer' to winning, then I believe White would indeed have a forced win in theory."

Starting in 1988, Adorján has argued in a series of books and magazine articles that "Black is OK!" Alone amongst modern writers, Adorján claims that White starts the game with essentially no advantage. He writes, "In my opinion, the only obvious advantage for White is that if he or she plays for a draw, and does so well, then Black can hardly avoid this without taking obvious risks." Adorján goes so far as to claim that, "The tale of White's advantage is a delusion, belief in it is based on <a href="Folie%20%C3%A0%20deux">mass psychosis</a>." Rowson writes that Adorján's "contention is one of the most important chess ideas of the last two decades ... because it has shaken our assumption that White begins the game with some advantage, and revealed its ideological nature". However, Rowson rejects Adorján's claim that White has essentially no advantage, reasoning that White is better' and 'Black is OK' need not be mutually exclusive claims".

In one of Adorján's books, GM <a href="Lajos%20Portisch">Lajos Portisch</a> opined that "at least two-thirds of all 'tested' openings give White an apparent advantage." According to Portisch, for Black, "The root of the problem is that very few people know which are the openings where Black is really OK. Those who find these lines have nothing to fear, as "Black is indeed OK", but only in those variations!" Rowson considers this an important point, noting that "1.d4 players struggle to get anywhere against main-line <a href="Slav%20Defense">Slavs</a> and 1.e4 players find the <a href="Sicilian%20Defence%2C%20Najdorf%20Variation">Najdorf</a> and particularly tough."

Modern writers often think of Black's role in more terms than merely trying to equalize. Rowson writes that "the idea of Black trying to 'equalize' is questionable. I think it has limited application to a few openings, rather than being an opening prescription for Black in general." Evans wrote that after one of his games against Fischer, "Fischer confided his 'secret' to me: unlike other masters, he sought to win with the Black pieces from the start. The revelation that Black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career, he said." Likewise, Watson surmised that Kasparov, when playing Black, bypasses the question of whether White has an opening advantage "by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board, and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible". Watson observes that "energetic opening play by Black may ... lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless. Sometimes we say 'dynamically balanced' instead of 'equal' to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage. This style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess, with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most visible practitioners."

Modern writers also question the idea that White has an enduring advantage. Suba, in his influential 1991 book "Dynamic Chess Strategy", rejects the notion that the initiative can always be transformed into an enduring advantage. He contends that sometimes the player with the initiative loses it with no logical explanation, and that, "Sometimes you must lose it, just like that. If you try to cling to it, by forcing the issue, your dynamic potential will become exhausted and you won't be able to face a vigorous <a href="glossary%20of%20chess%23Counterattack">counter-attack</a>." Rowson and Watson concur. Watson also observes, "Because of the presumption of White being better, the juncture of the game at which Black frees his game or neutralizes White's plans has often been automatically assumed to give him equality, even though in dynamic openings, the exhaustion of White's initiative very often means that Black has seized it with advantage."

Rowson argues that both White and Black have certain advantages:

According to Rowson, White's first advantage is that, "The advantage of the first move has some similarities with the <a href="serve%20%28tennis%29">serve</a> in <a href="tennis">tennis</a> in that White can score an '<a href="ace%20%28tennis%29">ace</a>' (for instance with a powerful ), he has more control over the pace and direction of the game, and he has a '<a href="Serve%20%28tennis%29%23First%20and%20second%20serves">second serve</a>' in that when things go wrong his position is not usually losing." Second, White begins the game with some initiative, although Rowson regards this as a psychological rather than a positional advantage, "and whether it leads to a positional advantage depends on the relative skill of the players." Third, some players are able to use the initiative to "play a kind of powerful '<a href="serve%20and%20volley">serve and volley</a>' chess in which Black is flattened with a mixture of deep and prowess." Fourth, "If White wants to draw, it is often not so easy for Black to prevent this. This advantage is particularly acute in cases where there is a possible <a href="threefold%20repetition">threefold repetition</a>, because White can begin the repetition without committing to a draw and Black has to decide whether to deviate before he knows whether White is bluffing."

Rowson cites as an example of the last phenomenon the well-regarded <a href="Ruy%20Lopez%23Zaitsev%20Variation">Zaitsev Variation</a> of the <a href="Ruy%20Lopez">Ruy Lopez</a>. After 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d6 9.h3 Bb7 10.d4 Re8 (initiating the Zaitsev Variation), White can repeat moves once with 11.Ng5 Rf8 12.Nf3. This puts Black in an awkward situation, since he must either (a) insist on the Zaitsev with 12...Re8, which allows White to choose whether to draw by threefold repetition with 13.Ng5 Rf8 14.Nf3, or play on with a different move, or (b) play a different (and possibly inferior) variation by playing something other than 12...Re8.

Rowson argues that Black also has several advantages. First, "White's alleged advantage is also a kind of obligation to play for a win, and Black can often use this to his advantage." Second, "White's 'extra move' can be a burden, and sometimes White finds himself in a mild form of "<a href="zugzwang">zugzwang</a>" ('Zugzwang Lite')." Third, although White begins the game with the initiative, if "Black retains a flexible position with good reactive possibilities, this initiative can be absorbed and often passes over to Black." Fourth, "The fact that White moves before Black often gives Black useful information". Suba likewise argues that White's advantage is actually less than a move, since White must tip his hand first, allowing Black to react to White's plans. Suba writes, "In terms of the mathematical <a href="game%20theory">games theory</a>, chess is a game of <a href="complete%20information">complete information</a>, and Black's information is always greater—by one move!"

Rowson also notes that Black's chances increase markedly by playing good openings, which tend to be those with flexibility and latent potential, "rather than those that give White fixed targets or that try to take the initiative prematurely." He also emphasizes that "White has 'the initiative', not 'the advantage'. Success with Black depends on seeing beyond the initiative and thinking of positions in terms of 'potential'." These ideas are exemplified by the <a href="Hedgehog%20%28chess%29">Hedgehog</a>, a dynamic modern system against the <a href="English%20Opening">English Opening</a> that can arise from various . A typical position arises after 1.c4 c5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.g3 b6 4.Bg2 Bb7 5.0-0 e6 6.Nc3 Be7 7.d4 cxd4 8.Qxd4 d6 9.e4 a6. White has a , while Black often maneuvers his pieces on the last two of the board, but White "has to keep a constant eye on the possible liberating pawn thrusts ...b5 and ...d5." Watson remarks, "Black's goal is to remain elastic and flexible, with many options for his pieces, whereas White can become paralyzed at some point by the need to protect against various dynamic ." He also observes that, "White tends to be as much tied up by Black's latent activity as Black himself is tied up by White's space advantage." Moreover, attempts by White to overrun Black's position often rebound disastrously. An example of this is the following grandmaster game:
<a href="Lev%20Polugaevsky">Lev Polugaevsky</a>–<a href="%C4%BDubom%C3%ADr%20Ft%C3%A1%C4%8Dnik">Ľubomír Ftáčnik</a>, <a href="Lucerne">Lucerne</a> <a href="Chess%20Olympiad">Olympiad</a> 1982: 1. Nf3 Nf6 2. c4 c5 3. Nc3 e6 4. g3 b6 5. Bg2 Bb7 6. 0-0 Be7 7. d4 cxd4 8. Qxd4 d6 9. Rd1 a6 10. b3 Nbd7 11. e4 Qb8 12. Bb2 0-0 Suba wrote of a similar Hedgehog position, "White's position looks ideal. That's the naked truth about it, but the 'ideal' has by definition one drawback—it cannot be improved." 13. Nd2 Rd8 14. a4 Qc7 15. Qe3 Rac8 16. Qe2 Ne5 17. h3 According to Ftáčnik, 17.f4 Neg4 18.Rf1 is better. h5 18. f4 Ng6 19. Nf3 Now Black breaks open the position in typical Hedgehog fashion. d5! 20. cxd5 Ftáčnik considers 20.e5 or 20.exd5 preferable. h4! 21. Nxh4 Nxh4 22. gxh4 Qxf4 23. dxe6 fxe6 24. e5? Ftáčnik recommends instead 24.Rxd8 Rxd8 25.Rd1. Bc5+ 25. Kh1 Nh5! 26. Qxh5 Qg3 27. Nd5 Other moves get <a href="checkmate">mated</a> immediately: 27.Bxb7 Qh3#; 27.Qe2 Qxh3#; 27.Qg4 Bxg2#. Rxd5 28. Rf1 Qxg2+! 29. Kxg2 Rd2+ White resigned. If 30.Kg3 (the only legal response to the <a href="double%20check">double check</a>), 30...Rg2+ 31.Kf4 Rf8+ forces mate.
An examination of reversed and symmetrical openings illustrates White's and Black's respective advantages:

In a "reversed opening", White plays an opening typically played by Black, but with colors reversed and thus an extra <a href="tempo%20%28chess%29">tempo</a>. Evans writes of such openings, "If a defense is considered good for Black, it must be even better for White with a move in hand." Former World Champion <a href="Mikhail%20Botvinnik">Mikhail Botvinnik</a> reportedly expressed the same view. Watson questions this idea, citing Suba's thesis that Black, by moving second, has more complete information than White. He writes, "everyone has such difficulties playing as White against a Sicilian Defence (1.e4 c5), but ... leading masters have no qualms about answering 1.c4 with 1...e5." To explain this <a href="paradox">paradox</a>, Watson discusses several different reversed Sicilian lines, showing how Black can exploit the disadvantages of various "extra" moves for White. He concludes, The point is, Black's set-up in the Sicilian is fine as a reactive system, but not worth much when trying to claim the initiative as White. This is true because Black is able to react to the specific plan White chooses; in Suba's terms, his information is indeed a move greater! Furthermore, he is able to take advantage of dead equal positions which White (hoping to retain the advantage of the first move) would normally avoid.
Watson also observes, "Similarly, the <a href="Dutch%20Defence">Dutch Defence</a> looks particularly sterile when White achieves the reversed positions a tempo up (it turns out that he has nothing useful to do!); and indeed, many standard Black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as White, tempo in hand." GM <a href="Alex%20Yermolinsky">Alex Yermolinsky</a> likewise notes that GM <a href="Vladimir%20Malaniuk">Vladimir Malaniuk</a>, a successful exponent of the <a href="Dutch%20Defense">Leningrad Dutch</a> (1.d4 f5 2.g3 g6) at the highest levels, "once made a deep impression on me by casually dismissing someone's suggestion that he should try 1.f4 as White. He smiled and said, 'That extra move's gonna hurt me.

Yermolinsky also agrees with <a href="Alexander%20Alekhine">Alekhine's</a> criticism of 1.g3 e5 2.Nf3, a reversed <a href="Alekhine%27s%20Defense">Alekhine's Defense</a>, in <a href="Richard%20R%C3%A9ti">Réti</a>–Alekhine, <a href="Baden-Baden">Baden-Baden</a> 1925, writing that Alekhine "understood the difference in opening philosophies for White and Black, and realized they just can't be the same! White is supposed to try for more than just obtaining a comfortable game in reversed colour opening set-ups, and, as the statistics show—surprisingly for a lot of people, but not for me—White doesn't even score as well as Black does in the same positions with his extra tempo and all." <a href="Howard%20Staunton">Howard Staunton</a>, generally considered to have been the strongest player in the world from 1843 to 1851, made a similar point over 160 years ago, writing that <a href="Owen%27s%20Defense">Owen's Defense</a> (1.e4 b6) is playable for Black, but that 1.b3 is inferior to "the more customary [first] moves, from its being essentially defensive". The current view is that Owen's Defense is slightly better for White, while 1.b3 is playable but less likely to yield an opening advantage than 1.e4 or 1.d4.

Watson concludes that 

Rowson writes that "in general one would assume that whatever advantage White has would be revealed most clearly in <a href="Symmetry">symmetrical</a> positions." Accordingly, Watson, Suba, Evans, and the eminent player and theorist <a href="Aron%20Nimzowitsch">Aron Nimzowitsch</a> (1886–1935) have all argued that it is in Black's interest to avoid symmetry. Nonetheless, even symmetrical opening lines sometimes illustrate the tenuous nature of White's advantage, in several respects.

It is often difficult for White to prove an advantage in symmetrical opening lines. As GM <a href="Bent%20Larsen">Bent Larsen</a> wrote, annotating a game that began 1.c4 c5 2.b3 b6, "In symmetrical openings, White has a theoretical advantage, but in many of them it is only theoretical." GM <a href="Andrew%20Soltis">Andrew Soltis</a> wrote in 2008 that he hates playing against the symmetrical <a href="Petroff%27s%20Defense">Petroff's Defense</a> (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6), and accordingly varies with 2.Nc3, the <a href="Vienna%20Game">Vienna Game</a>. However, there too he has been unable to find a way to an advantage after the symmetrical 2...Nc6 3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7, or after 3.Nf3 Nf6 ( to the <a href="Four%20Knights%20Game">Four Knights Game</a>) 4.Bb5 Bb4 5.0-0 0-0 6.d3 d6 7.Bg5 Bg4 8.Nd5 Nd4 9.Nxb4 Nxb5, or 7.Ne2 Ne7 8.c3 Ba5 9.Ng3 c6 10.Ba4 Ng6 11.d4 d5, when 12.exd5 e4 may even favor Black.

Moreover, symmetrical positions may be disadvantageous to White in that he has to commit himself first. Watson notes that it is even difficult for White to play noncommittally in a symmetrical position, since almost every move has certain drawbacks. Fischer once went so far as to claim that after 1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 g6 3.Bg2 Bg7 4.0-0 0-0 5.d3 d6 (Reinhard–Fischer, Western Open 1963), Believe it or not,' Black stands better! Now, whatever White does, Black will vary it and get an <a href="asymmetry">asymmetrical</a> position and have the superior position due to his better <a href="pawn%20structure">pawn structure</a>!" However, GM <a href="Paul%20Keres">Paul Keres</a> responded in <a href="CHESS%20magazine">"CHESS" magazine</a>, "We just don't believe it!" In symmetrical positions, as the <a href="Julian%20Hodgson">Hodgson</a>–<a href="Keith%20Arkell">Arkell</a> and <a href="Lajos%20Portisch">Portisch</a>–<a href="Mikhail%20Tal">Tal</a> games discussed below illustrate, Black can continue to imitate White as long as he finds it feasible and desirable to do so, and deviate when that ceases to be the case.

Further, a particular extra move is sometimes more of a liability than an asset. For example, Soltis notes that the position arising after 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.exd5 exd5 4.Nf3 Nf6 "is pretty equal". The same position, but with Black's knight moved to e4, arises in Petroff's Defense after 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 d6 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 d5. That position offers White better chances precisely because Black's extra move (...Ne4) allows the advanced knight to become a target for attack.

Finally, symmetrical positions may be difficult for the white player for psychological reasons. Watson writes that anyone who tries the Exchange French, "even if he thinks he is playing for a win, assume[s] a psychological burden. White has already ceded the advantage of the first move, and knows it, whereas Black is challenged to find ways to seize the initiative." Two famous examples of White losses in the Exchange French are <a href="Mikhail%20Gurevich%20%28chess%20player%29">M. Gurevich</a>–<a href="Nigel%20Short">Short</a> and Tatai–<a href="Viktor%20Korchnoi">Korchnoi</a>. In M. Gurevich–Short, a game between two of the world's leading players, White needed only a draw to qualify for the <a href="Candidates%20Matches">Candidates Matches</a>, while Black needed to win. Gurevich played passively and was outplayed by Short, who achieved the necessary win. In Tatai–Korchnoi, the Italian IM fell victim to Korchnoi's whirlwind , losing in just 14 moves.

Rowson gives the following example of Black outplaying White from the <a href="English%20Opening%23Common%20responses">Symmetrical Variation</a> of the <a href="English%20Opening">English Opening</a>. He remarks, "there is something compelling about Black's <a href="Chess%20strategy">strategy</a>. He seems to be saying: 'I will copy all your good moves, and as soon as you make a bad move, I won't copy you any more!
<a href="Julian%20Hodgson">Hodgson</a>–<a href="Keith%20Arkell">Arkell</a>, <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle</a> 2001: 1. c4 c5 2. g3 g6 3. Bg2 Bg7 4. Nc3 Nc6 5. a3 a6 6. Rb1 Rb8 7. b4 cxb4 8. axb4 b5 9. cxb5 axb5 (see diagram). Here Rowson remarks, "Both sides want to push their d-pawn and play Bf4/...Bf5, but White has to go first so Black gets to play ...d5 before White can play d4. This doesn't matter much, but it already points to the challenge that White faces here; his most natural continuations allow Black to play the moves he wants to. I would therefore say that White is in 'Zugzwang Lite' and that he remains in this state for several moves." 10. Nf3 d5 10...Nf6 11.0-0 0-0 12.d3 d6 13.Bd2 Bd7 would transpose to the Portisch–Tal game below. 11. d4 Nf6 12. Bf4 Rb6 13. 0-0 Bf5 14. Rb3 0-0 15. Ne5 Ne4 16. h3 h5 Finally breaking the symmetry. 17. Kh2 The position is still almost symmetrical, and White can find nothing useful to do with his extra move. Rowson whimsically suggests 17.h4!?, forcing Black to be the one to break the symmetry. 17... Re8! Rowson notes that this is a useful waiting move, covering e7, which needs protection in some lines, and possibly supporting an eventual ...e5 (see Black's twenty-second move). White cannot copy it, since after 18.Re1 Nxf2 Black would win a <a href="Pawn%20%28chess%29">pawn</a>. 18. Be3 Nxe5! 19. dxe5 Rc6! Rowson notes that with his more active pieces, "It looks like Black has some initiative." If now 20.Nxd5, Bxe5 "is at least equal for Black". 20. Nxb5 Bxe5! 20...Nxf2? 21.Qxd5! wins. 21. Nd4 Bxd4 22. Bxd4 e5 Rowson writes, "Now both sides have their trumps, but I think Black has some advantage, due to his extra central control, imposing <a href="knight%20%28chess%29">knight</a> and prospects for a ." 23. b5 Rc8 24. Bb2 d4 (diagram). Now White has a difficult game: Rowson analyzes 25.e3?! Nxg3 24.fxg3 Bc2 25.Qf3 Bxb3 26.exd4 Bc4!, winning; 25.g4 hxg4 26.hxg4 Nxf2! 27.Rxf2 Bc2, winning; 25.Qe1!? Rc2! with advantage; and 25.f4 (risky-looking, but perhaps best) Nc3! 26.Bxc3 dxc3 27.Qxd8 Rexd8, and Black is better. 25. b6? Overlooking Black's threat. 25... Nxf2! 26. Qe1 If 26.Rxf2, Bc2 <a href="Fork%20%28chess%29">forks</a> White's <a href="Queen%20%28chess%29">queen</a> and <a href="Rook%20%28chess%29">rook</a>. 26... Ne4 27. b7 Rb8 28. g4 hxg4 29. hxg4 Be6 30. Rb5 Nf6! 31. Rxf6 Qxf6 32. Qg3 Bc4 33. g5 Qh8+ 0–1
The opening of the following game between two world-class players, another Symmetrical English, took a similar course:
<a href="Lajos%20Portisch">Lajos Portisch</a>–<a href="Mikhail%20Tal">Mikhail Tal</a>, <a href="Candidates%20Match">Candidates Match</a> 1965: 1. Nf3 c5 2. c4 Nc6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. g3 g6 5. Bg2 Bg7 6. 0-0 0-0 7. d3 a6 8. a3 Rb8 9. Rb1 b5 10. cxb5 axb5 11. b4 cxb4 12. axb4 d6 13. Bd2 Bd7 (see diagram). Once again, White is on move in a symmetrical position, but it is not obvious what he can do with his first-move initiative. Soltis writes, "It's ridiculous to think Black's position is better. But Mikhail Tal said it is easier to play. By moving second he gets to see White's move and then decide whether to match it." 14. Qc1 Here, Soltis writes that Black could maintain equality by keeping the symmetry: 14...Qc8 15.Bh6 Bh3. Instead, he plays to prove that White's queen is misplaced. 14... Rc8! 15. Bh6 Nd4! Threatening 16...Nxe2+. 16. Nxd4 Bxh6 17. Qxh6 Rxc3 18. Qd2 Qc7 19. Rfc1 Rc8 (diagram). Although the pawn structure is still symmetrical, Black's control of the c- gives him the advantage. Black ultimately reached an endgame two pawns up, but White managed to hold a draw in 83 moves.

Tal himself lost a famous game as White from a symmetrical position in Tal–<a href="Alexander%20Beliavsky">Beliavsky</a>, <a href="Soviet%20Chess%20Championship">USSR Championship</a> 1974.

In <a href="chess%20tournament">chess tournament</a>s and matches, the frequency with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In <a href="round%20robin%20tournament">round robin tournament</a>s with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of whites and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the <a href="tournament%20director">tournament director</a> may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than whites, or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of whites and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.

In <a href="Swiss%20system%20tournament">Swiss system tournament</a>s, the tournament director tries to ensure that each player receives, as nearly as possible, the same number of games as White and Black, and that the player's color alternates from round to round. After the first round, the director may deviate from the otherwise prescribed pairings in order to give as many players as possible their equalizing or due colors. More substantial deviations are permissible to avoid giving a player two more blacks than whites (for example, three blacks in four games) than vice versa, since extra whites "cause far less player distress" than extra blacks, which impose "a significant handicap" on the affected player. Tournaments with an even number of rounds cause the most problems, since if there is a disparity, it is greater (e.g., a player receiving two whites and four blacks).

The game of chess is not <a href="solved%20game">solved</a>, meaning it has not been determined with certainty whether a perfectly played game would end in a win for White, a draw, or even a win for Black. Due to its high level of <a href="game%20complexity">complexity</a> and the limitations of computer technology it is considered unlikely that it will be solved in the foreseeable future.

In his 1950 paper "Programming a Computer for Playing Chess", <a href="Information%20theory">information theorist</a> <a href="Claude%20Shannon">Claude Shannon</a> argued that in principle the game of chess ought to be solvable. In practical terms, however, he argued that it is not feasible for any computer to actually do this. He estimated that a computer would need to calculate 10 positions from the initial position, which he said would take 10 years. It is thus theoretically possible to solve chess, however, according to Shannon the time frame required puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology.

<a href="Hans-Joachim%20Bremermann">Hans-Joachim Bremermann</a>, a professor of <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a> and <a href="biophysics">biophysics</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20California%20at%20Berkeley">University of California at Berkeley</a>, further argued in a 1965 paper that the "speed, memory, and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by certain physical barriers: the "<a href="Speed%20of%20light">light barrier</a>", the "<a href="Uncertainty%20principle">quantum barrier</a>", and the "<a href="Landauer%27s%20principle">thermodynamical barrier</a>". These limitations imply, for example, that no computer, however constructed, will ever be able to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess." Nonetheless, Bremermann did not foreclose the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess. He wrote, "In order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game [of chess] it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely ... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching. ...

Recent advances in computer science have not significantly changed that assessment.

Katheryn Elizabeth Hudson was born in <a href="Santa%20Barbara%2C%20California">Santa Barbara, California</a>, to <a href="Pentecostalism">Pentecostal</a> pastors Mary Christine (née Perry) and Maurice Keith Hudson. Her parents are <a href="born%20again%20%28Christianity%29">born again</a> Christians, each having turned to religion after a "wild youth". Perry has English, German, Irish, and Portuguese ancestry. Through her mother, she is a niece of film director <a href="Frank%20Perry">Frank Perry</a>. She has a younger brother named David, who is a singer, and an older sister, Angela. From ages 3 to 11, Perry often moved across the country as her parents set up churches before settling again in Santa Barbara. Growing up, she attended religious schools and camps, including Paradise Valley Christian School in <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> and Santa Barbara Christian School in California during her <a href="Primary%20school">elementary years</a>. Her family struggled financially, sometimes using <a href="Supplemental%20Nutrition%20Assistance%20Program">food stamps</a> and eating from the food bank intended to feed the congregation at her parents' church.

Growing up, Perry and her siblings were not allowed to eat the cereal <a href="Lucky%20Charms">Lucky Charms</a> as the term "luck" reminded their mother of <a href="Lucifer">Lucifer</a>, and had to call <a href="deviled%20egg">deviled egg</a>s "angeled eggs". Perry primarily listened to <a href="gospel%20music">gospel music</a>, as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through <a href="compact%20disc">CDs</a> she sneaked from her friends. While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, "I pray all the time – for self-control, for humility." Wanting to be like Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who let her take vocal lessons as Angela was at the time. She began <a href="Vocal%20pedagogy">training</a> at age 9, and was incorporated into her parents' ministry, singing in church from ages 9 to 17. At 13, Perry was given her first guitar for her birthday, and publicly performed songs she wrote. She tried to "be a bit like the typical Californian girl" while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. Perry's brother David described her as a <a href="tomboy">tomboy</a> during her adolescence. She took dancing lessons and learned how to <a href="swing%20%28dance%29">swing</a>, <a href="Lindy%20Hop">Lindy Hop</a>, and <a href="jitterbug">jitterbug</a>.

Perry completed her <a href="General%20Educational%20Development">General Educational Development</a> (GED) requirements at age 15, during her freshman year of high school, and left <a href="Dos%20Pueblos%20High%20School">Dos Pueblos High School</a> to pursue a musical career. She briefly studied <a href="Italian%20opera">Italian opera</a> at the <a href="Music%20Academy%20of%20the%20West">Music Academy of the West</a> in Santa Barbara. Her singing caught the attention of rock artists Steve Thomas and <a href="Jennifer%20Knapp">Jennifer Knapp</a> from <a href="Nashville%2C%20Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a>, who brought her there to improve her writing skills. In Nashville, she started recording <a href="demo%20%28music%29">demos</a> and learned how to write songs and play guitar. After signing with <a href="Pamplin%20Music">Red Hill Records</a>, Perry recorded her debut album, a gospel record titled "<a href="Katy%20Hudson%20%28album%29">Katy Hudson</a>". She released the album on March 6, 2001, and went on tour that year as part of <a href="Phil%20Joel">Phil Joel</a>'s Strangely Normal Tour while also embarking on other performances of her own in the United States. "Katy Hudson" received positive reviews from critics, though was commercially unsuccessful and sold an estimated 200 copies before the label ceased operations in December. Transitioning from gospel music to secular music, Perry started writing songs with producer <a href="Glen%20Ballard">Glen Ballard</a>, and moved to <a href="Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">Los Angeles</a> at age 17. In 2003, she briefly performed as Katheryn Perry to avoid confusion with actress <a href="Kate%20Hudson">Kate Hudson</a>. She later adopted the stage name Katy Perry, using her mother's maiden name.

In 2004, Perry signed to Ballard's label, Java, which was then affiliated with <a href="The%20Island%20Def%20Jam%20Music%20Group">The Island Def Jam Music Group</a>. She began work on a solo record, but the record was shelved after Java was dropped. Ballard then introduced Perry to <a href="Tim%20Devine">Tim Devine</a>, an <a href="Artists%20and%20repertoire">A&R</a> executive at <a href="Columbia%20Records">Columbia Records</a>, and she was signed as a solo artist. Over the course of the next two years, Perry wrote and recorded material for her Columbia debut, and worked with songwriters including <a href="Desmond%20Child">Desmond Child</a>, <a href="Greg%20Wells">Greg Wells</a>, <a href="Butch%20Walker">Butch Walker</a>, <a href="Scott%20Cutler">Scott Cutler</a>, <a href="Anne%20Preven">Anne Preven</a>, <a href="The%20Matrix%20%28production%20team%29">The Matrix</a>, <a href="Kara%20DioGuardi">Kara DioGuardi</a>, <a href="Max%20Martin">Max Martin</a> and <a href="Dr.%20Luke">Dr. Luke</a>.

After the label dropped her, she worked at an independent A&R company called <a href="TAXI%20%28A%26amp%3BR%29">Taxi Music</a>.

In September 2004, "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" named Perry "The Next Big Thing". She recorded background vocals on <a href="P.O.D.">P.O.D.</a>'s single "<a href="Goodbye%20for%20Now%20%28song%29">Goodbye for Now</a>" and was featured at the end of its music video in 2006.

Flom was convinced that she could be a breakthrough star and she was signed to <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol Records</a> in April 2007. The label arranged for her to work with Dr. Luke in order to add an "undeniable smash" to her existing material.

A campaign was started with the November 2007 release of the video to "<a href="Ur%20So%20Gay">Ur So Gay</a>", aimed at introducing her to the music market. A <a href="Ur%20So%20Gay%20%28EP%29">digital EP of the same name</a> was also released that month. <a href="Madonna%20%28entertainer%29">Madonna</a> helped publicize the song by praising it on the "JohnJay & Rich" radio show in April 2008, stating "Ur So Gay" was her "favorite song" at the time.

I think you become more relatable when you're vulnerable." <a href="Kristen%20Wiig">Kristen Wiig</a> commented that "as easy, breezy, and infectious as Perry's songs can be, beneath the surface lurks a sea of mixed emotions, jumbled motives, and contradictory impulses complicated enough to fill a <a href="Carole%20King">Carole King</a> record."

The proceeds from Perry's single "Part of Me" were donated to the charity <a href="MusiCares">MusiCares</a>, which helps musicians in times of need. During her California Dreams Tour, she raised over $175,000 for the Tickets-For-Charity fundraiser. The money was divided between three charities: the <a href="Children%27s%20Health%20Fund">Children's Health Fund</a> (CHF), Generosity Water, and <a href="The%20Humane%20Society%20of%20the%20United%20States">The Humane Society of the United States</a>. On her 27th birthday, Perry set up a donations page for the <a href="Society%20for%20the%20Prevention%20of%20Cruelty%20to%20Animals">Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</a> Auckland, and set up a similar page benefiting the <a href="David%20Lynch%20Foundation">David Lynch Foundation</a> for her 28th birthday. On March 29, 2014, she helped raise $2.4 million for the <a href="Museum%20of%20Contemporary%20Art%2C%20Los%20Angeles">Museum of Contemporary Art</a> in Los Angeles along with other celebrities such as <a href="Ryan%20Seacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a>, <a href="Pharrell%20Williams">Pharrell Williams</a>, <a href="Tim%20Allen">Tim Allen</a>, <a href="Lisa%20Edelstein">Lisa Edelstein</a>, and <a href="Riley%20Keough">Riley Keough</a>. In March 2018, Perry announced "Witness: Coming Home", a benefit concert that was held in her hometown of Santa Barbara, California on May 19, 2018. The concert benefited those recovering from the aftermath of the <a href="2017%20California%20wildfires">2017 California wildfires</a> and <a href="2018%20Southern%20California%20mudflows">2018 Southern California mudflows</a>. Perry partnered with the Santa Barbara Foundation, the 93108 Fund and The 805 UndocuFund, organizations which help in assisting members of the community in the Santa Barbara area through grants and various philanthropic efforts.

Perry performed at the <a href="One%20Love%20Manchester">One Love Manchester</a> benefit concert for the victims of the <a href="2017%20Manchester%20Arena%20bombing">2017 Manchester Arena bombing</a> amongst various other performers including its organizer <a href="Ariana%20Grande">Ariana Grande</a>, which was broadcast live on June 4, 2017 through radio and various television stations throughout the world.

Perry has publicly advocated for <a href="LGBT%20rights%20in%20the%20United%20States">LGBT rights</a>. She supported <a href="Stonewall%20%28charity%29">Stonewall</a> during their "It gets better... today" campaign to prevent <a href="homophobia">homophobic</a> bullying, and dedicated the music video to her song "Firework" to the <a href="It%20Gets%20Better%20Project">It Gets Better Project</a>. Perry told <a href="Do%20Something">Do Something</a> in November 2008 she was proud to be a LGBT rights activist, saying "I've always been a very open-minded person, but I definitely believe in equality." She confirmed that she voted against <a href="California%20Proposition%208%20%282008%29">Proposition 8</a>, an amendment (ultimately ruled unconstitutional) that legally defined marriage as a union solely between a man and a woman in <a href="California">California</a>. In June 2012, Perry expressed her hopes for LGBT equality, commenting "hopefully, we will look back at this moment and think like we do now concerning [other] <a href="Civil%20and%20political%20rights">civil rights</a> issues. We'll just shake our heads in disbelief, saying, 'Thank God we've evolved.' That would be my prayer for the future." In December 2012, Perry was awarded the Trevor Hero Award by <a href="The%20Trevor%20Project">The Trevor Project</a> for her work and activism on behalf of LGBT youth. On March 18, 2017, she received a Nation Equality Award from <a href="Human%20Rights%20Campaign">Human Rights Campaign</a> for "using her powerful voice and international platform to speak out for LGBTQ equality", with the organization further stating that "Katy's message of inclusion and equality continues to inspire us and the world".

Perry describes herself as a <a href="feminism">feminist</a>, and appeared in April 2013 in a video clip for the "Chime For Change" campaign that aimed to spread female empowerment. She has also said that America's lack of free <a href="Health%20care%20in%20the%20United%20States">health care</a> drove her "absolutely crazy". Following the <a href="2016%20Orlando%20nightclub%20shooting">shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando</a> in June 2016, Perry and nearly 200 other artists and executives in music signed an open letter organized by "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" addressed to <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> demanding increased <a href="gun%20control">gun control</a> in the United States.

Through Twitter and by performing at his rallies, Perry supported President <a href="Barack%20Obama">Barack Obama</a> in his run for re-election and praised his support for <a href="Same-sex%20marriage%20in%20the%20United%20States">same-sex marriage</a> and LGBT equality. She performed at three rallies for Obama, in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and Wisconsin, singing a rendition of "<a href="Let%27s%20Stay%20Together%20%28Al%20Green%20song%29">Let's Stay Together</a>" as well as a number of her songs. During her Las Vegas performance she wore a dress made to replicate a voting ballot, with Obama's box filled in. On Twitter, she encouraged her followers to vote for Obama.

In August 2013, Perry voiced criticism of <a href="Tony%20Abbott">Tony Abbott</a>, then-leader of conservative <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberal Party of Australia</a> and candidate for <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister of Australia</a>, due to his opposition to gay marriage and told Abbott, "I love you as a human being but I can't give you my vote." In April 2014, she publicly supported <a href="Marianne%20Williamson">Marianne Williamson</a> in her campaign for <a href="California%27s%2033rd%20congressional%20district">California's 33rd congressional district</a> by attending a political press event. She endorsed <a href="Kamala%20Harris">Kamala Harris</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20California%2C%202016">United States Senate election in California</a>, and organized a fundraiser for Harris at her home in Los Angeles in November 2016. Perry also publicly endorsed former <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="Hillary%20Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> for president in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%202016">2016</a>. She performed alongside <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a> at a fundraising concert for Clinton in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> in March 2016. Perry also spoke and performed at the <a href="2016%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">2016 Democratic National Convention</a> in support of Clinton.

Throughout her career, Perry has won five American Music Awards, fourteen <a href="People%27s%20Choice%20Awards">People's Choice Awards</a>, four Guinness World Records, a <a href="Brit%20Award">Brit Award</a>, and a <a href="Juno%20Award">Juno Award</a>. In September 2012, "Billboard" dubbed her the "Woman of the Year". From May 2010 to September 2011, the singer spent a record-breaking total of 69 consecutive weeks in the top ten of the "Billboard" Hot 100. "Teenage Dream" became the first album by a female artist to produce five number-one "Billboard" Hot 100 singles, and the second album overall after Michael Jackson's "Bad". In the United States, she has accumulated a total of nine number-one singles on the "Billboard" Hot 100, her most recent being "Dark Horse", and holds the record for having 18 consecutive number-one songs on the <a href="Dance%20Club%20Songs">Dance Club Songs</a> chart.

"Billboard" also named her the 15th most successful dance club artist of all time. The magazine additionally ranked her 4th on its "Greatest of All Time Pop Songs Artists" list, included "Teenage Dream" and "Prism" among its "Greatest of All Time "Billboard 200" Albums by Women" list, and ranked "Dark Horse" at number 100 on its "Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs" as well as one of its "Greatest of All Time Hot 100 Songs by Women" along with "E.T.", "Firework", and "California Gurls". In June 2015, her music video for "Dark Horse" became the first video by a female artist to reach 1 billion views on Vevo. The following month, her music video for "Roar" reached 1 billion views on Vevo, making her the first artist to have multiple videos with 1 billion views.

Perry was declared the Top Global Female Recording Artist of 2013 by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI).

Funerary art

Funerary art is any work of art forming, or placed in, a repository for the remains of the <a href="death">dead</a>. The term encompasses a wide variety of forms, including <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>s ("empty tombs"), tomb-like monuments which do not contain human remains, and communal memorials to the dead, such as <a href="war%20memorial">war memorial</a>s, which may or may not contain remains, and a range of prehistoric <a href="Megalith">megalithic</a> constructs. Funerary art may serve many cultural functions. It can play a role in burial rites, serve as an article for use by the dead in the afterlife, and celebrate the life and accomplishments of the dead, whether as part of kinship-centred practices of <a href="ancestor%20veneration">ancestor veneration</a> or as a publicly directed <a href="Dynasty">dynastic</a> display. It can also function as a reminder of the mortality of humankind, as an expression of cultural values and roles, and help to propitiate the spirits of the dead, maintaining their benevolence and preventing their unwelcome intrusion into the lives of the living.

The deposit of objects with an apparent aesthetic intention is found in almost all cultures—<a href="Hinduism">Hindu</a> culture, which has little, is a notable exception. Many of the best-known artistic creations of past cultures—from the <a href="Egyptian%20pyramids">Egyptian pyramids</a> and the <a href="KV62">Tutankhamun treasure</a>, to the <a href="Terracotta%20Army">Terracotta Army</a> surrounding the tomb of the <a href="Qin%20Shi%20Huang">Qin Emperor</a>, the <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Halicarnassus">Mausoleum of Halicarnassus</a>, the <a href="Sutton%20Hoo">Sutton Hoo</a> ship burial and the <a href="Taj%20Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>—are tombs or objects found in and around them. In most instances, specialized funeral art was produced for the powerful and wealthy, although the burials of ordinary people might include simple monuments and grave goods, usually from their possessions.

An important factor in the development of traditions of funerary art is the division between what was intended to be visible to visitors or the public after completion of the funeral ceremonies. The treasure of the <a href="Eighteenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">18th dynasty</a> Pharaoh <a href="Tutankhamun">Tutankhamun</a>, for example, though exceptionally lavish, was never intended to be seen again after it was deposited, while the exterior of the pyramids was a permanent and highly effective demonstration of the power of their creators. A similar division can be seen in grand East Asian tombs. In other cultures, nearly all the art connected with the burial, except for limited grave goods, was intended for later viewing by the public or at least those admitted by the custodians. In these cultures, traditions such as the sculpted <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a> and <a href="tomb%20monument">tomb monument</a> of the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Greek</a> and <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> empires, and later the <a href="Christendom">Christian</a> world, have flourished. The <a href="mausoleum">mausoleum</a> intended for visiting was the grandest type of tomb in the classical world, and later common in Islamic culture.

<a href="Tomb">Tomb</a> is a general term for any repository for human remains, while <a href="grave%20goods">grave goods</a> are other objects which have been placed within the tomb. Such objects may include the personal possessions of the deceased, objects specially created for the burial, or miniature versions of things believed to be needed in an <a href="afterlife">afterlife</a>. Knowledge of many non-literate cultures is drawn largely from these sources.

A <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a>, mound, <a href="kurgan">kurgan</a>, or <a href="long%20barrow">long barrow</a> covered important burials in many cultures, and the body may be placed in a sarcophagus, usually of stone, or a <a href="coffin">coffin</a>, usually of wood. A mausoleum is a building erected mainly as a tomb, taking its name from the Mausoleum of Mausolus at <a href="Halicarnassus">Halicarnassus</a>. <a href="Stele">Stele</a> is a term for erect stones that are often what are now called <a href="gravestone">gravestone</a>s. <a href="Ship%20burial">Ship burial</a>s are mostly found in coastal Europe, while <a href="chariot%20burial">chariot burial</a>s are found widely across <a href="Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. <a href="Catacombs">Catacombs</a>, of which the most famous examples are those in <a href="Catacombs%20of%20Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="Catacombs%20of%20Kom%20el%20Shoqafa">Alexandria</a>, are underground cemeteries connected by tunnelled passages. A large group of burials with traces remaining above ground can be called a <a href="necropolis">necropolis</a>; if there are no such visible structures, it is a <a href="grave%20field">grave field</a>. A <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> is a memorial without a burial.

The word "funerary" strictly means "of or pertaining to a <a href="funeral">funeral</a> or burial", but there is a long tradition in English of applying it not only to the practices and artefacts directly associated with funeral rites, but also to a wider range of more permanent memorials to the dead. Particularly influential in this regard was <a href="John%20Weever">John Weever</a>'s "Ancient Funerall Monuments" (1631), the first full-length book to be dedicated to the subject of tomb memorials and <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a>s. More recently, some scholars have challenged the usage: Phillip Lindley, for example, makes a point of referring to "tomb monuments", saying "I have avoided using the term 'funeral monuments' because <a href="Effigy%23Funeral%20effigies">funeral effigies</a> were, in the Middle Ages, temporary products, made as substitutes for the encoffined corpse for use during the funeral ceremonies". Others, however, have found this distinction "rather pedantic".

Related genres of commemorative art for the dead take many forms, such as the "<a href="moai">moai</a>" figures of <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a>, apparently a type of sculpted <a href="ancestor%20portrait">ancestor portrait</a>, though hardly individualized. These are common in cultures as diverse as Ancient Rome and China, in both of which they are kept in the houses of the descendants, rather than being buried. Many cultures have <a href="psychopomp">psychopomp</a> figures, such as the Greek <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a> and Etruscan <a href="Charun">Charun</a>, who help conduct the spirits of the dead into the afterlife.

Most of humanity's oldest known archaeological constructions are tombs. Mostly <a href="megalith">megalith</a>ic, the earliest instances date to within a few centuries of each other, yet show a wide diversity of form and purpose. Tombs in the <a href="Iberian%20peninsula">Iberian peninsula</a> have been dated through <a href="thermoluminescence">thermoluminescence</a> to c. 4510 BCE, and some burials at the <a href="Carnac%20stones">Carnac stones</a> in <a href="Brittany">Brittany</a> also date back to the fifth millennium BCE. The commemorative value of such burial sites are indicated by the fact that, at some stage, they became elevated, and that the constructs, almost from the earliest, sought to be monumental. This effect was often achieved by encapsulating a single corpse in a basic pit, surrounded by an elaborate ditch and drain. Over-ground commemoration is thought to be tied to the concept of collective memory, and these early tombs were likely intended as a form of <a href="ancestor-worship">ancestor-worship</a>, a development available only to communities that had advanced to the stage of settled livestock and formed social roles and relationships and specialized sectors of activity.

In <a href="Neolithic">Neolithic</a> and <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> societies, a great variety of tombs are found, with tumulus mounds, megaliths, and pottery as recurrent elements. In Eurasia, a <a href="dolmen">dolmen</a> is the exposed stone framework for a <a href="chamber%20tomb">chamber tomb</a> originally covered by earth to make a mound which no longer exists. Stones may be carved with geometric patterns (<a href="petroglyph">petroglyph</a>s), for example <a href="cup%20and%20ring%20mark">cup and ring mark</a>s. Group tombs were made, the social context of which is hard to decipher. <a href="Urn">Urn</a> burials, where bones are buried in a pottery container, either in a more elaborate tomb, or by themselves, are widespread, by no means restricted to the <a href="Urnfield%20culture">Urnfield culture</a> which is named after them, or even to Eurasia. <a href="Menhir">Menhir</a>s, or "<a href="standing%20stone">standing stone</a>s", seem often to mark graves or serve as memorials, while the later <a href="runestone">runestone</a>s and <a href="image%20stone">image stone</a>s often are <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>s, or memorials apart from the grave itself; these continue into the Christian period. The <a href="Senegambian%20stone%20circles">Senegambian stone circles</a> are a later African form of tomb markers.

Egyptian funerary art was inseparably connected to the <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20religion">religious belief</a> that life continued after death – even more, it expressed a belief that "death is a mere phase of life". Aesthetic objects and images connected with this belief were partially intended to preserve material goods, wealth and status for the journey between this life and the next, and to "commemorate the life of the tomb owner ... depict performance of the burial rites, and in general present an environment that would be conducive to the tomb owner's rebirth." In this context are the Egyptian <a href="mummy">mummies</a> encased in one or more layers of decorated coffin, and the <a href="canopic%20jar">canopic jar</a>s preserving internal organs. A special category of <a href="Ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">Ancient Egyptian funerary texts</a> clarify the purposes of the burial customs. The early <a href="mastaba">mastaba</a> type of tomb had a sealed underground burial chamber but an offering-chamber on the ground level for visits by the living, a pattern repeated in later types of tomb. A <a href="Ka%20statue">Ka statue</a> <a href="effigy">effigy</a> of the deceased might be walled up in a "<a href="serdab">serdab</a>" connected to the offering chamber by vents that allowed the smell of <a href="incense">incense</a> to reach the effigy. The walls of important tomb-chambers and offering chambers were heavily decorated with <a href="relief">relief</a>s in stone or sometimes wood, or paintings, depicting religious scenes, portraits of the deceased, and at some periods vivid images of everyday life, depicting the afterlife. The chamber decoration usually centred on a "false door", through which only the soul of the deceased could pass, to receive the offerings left by the living.

<a href="Representation%20%28arts%29">Representational art</a>, such as individual portraiture of the deceased, is found extremely early on and continues into the Roman period in the <a href="Encaustic%20painting">encaustic</a> <a href="Faiyum%20mummy%20portraits">Faiyum funerary portraits</a> applied to coffins. However, it is still hotly debated whether there was realistic <a href="portraiture%20in%20Ancient%20Egypt">portraiture in Ancient Egypt</a>. The purpose of the life-sized <a href="reserve%20head">reserve head</a>s found in burial shafts or tombs of nobles of the <a href="Fourth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Fourth dynasty</a> is not well understood; they may have been a discreet method of eliding an edict by <a href="Khufu">Khufu</a> forbidding nobles from creating statues of themselves, or may have protected the deceased's spirit from harm or magically eliminated any evil in it, or perhaps functioned as alternate containers for the spirit if the body should be harmed in any way.

Architectural works such as the massive <a href="Great%20Pyramid%20of%20Giza">Great Pyramid</a> and two smaller ones built during the <a href="Old%20Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a> in the <a href="Giza%20Necropolis">Giza Necropolis</a> and (much later, from about 1500 BCE) the tombs in the <a href="Valley%20of%20the%20Kings">Valley of the Kings</a> were built for royalty and the elite. The <a href="Theban%20Necropolis">Theban Necropolis</a> was later an important site for <a href="mortuary%20temple">mortuary temple</a>s and mastaba tombs. The <a href="Kushite">Kushite</a> kings who conquered Egypt and ruled as pharaohs during the <a href="Twenty-fifth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Twenty-fifth dynasty</a> were greatly influenced by Egyptian funerary customs, employing mummification, canopic jars and "<a href="ushabti">ushabti</a>" funerary figurines. They also built the <a href="Nubian%20pyramids">Nubian pyramids</a>, which in both size and design more closely resemble the smaller <a href="Seventeenth%20dynasty%20of%20Egypt">Seventeenth dynasty</a> pyramids at Thebes than those of the Old Kingdom near Memphis.

Lower-class citizens used common forms of funerary art—including "<a href="shabti">shabti</a>" figurines (to perform any labor that might be required of the dead person in the afterlife), <a href="Dung%20beetle%23Scarab%20in%20ancient%20Egypt">models of the scarab beetle</a> and <a href="ancient%20Egyptian%20funerary%20texts">funerary texts</a>—which they believed would protect them in the afterlife. During the <a href="Middle%20Kingdom%20of%20Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>, miniature wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to tombs. In an attempt to duplicate the activities of the living in the afterlife, these models show laborers, houses, boats and even military formations which are scale representations of the ideal ancient Egyptian afterlife.

The ancient Greeks did not generally leave elaborate grave goods, except for a <a href="Charon%27s%20obol">coin to pay Charon</a>, the <a href="Charon%20%28mythology%29">ferryman to Hades</a>, and pottery; however the "epitaphios" or <a href="Funeral%20oration%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">funeral oration</a> from which the word <a href="epitaph">epitaph</a> comes was regarded as of great importance, and <a href="animal%20sacrifice">animal sacrifice</a>s were made. Those who could afford them erected stone monuments, which was one of the functions of "<a href="kouros">kouros</a>" statues in the <a href="Archaic%20period%20in%20Greece">Archaic period</a> before about 500 BCE. These were not intended as portraits, but during the <a href="Hellenistic%20art">Hellenistic period</a>, realistic portraiture of the deceased was introduced and family groups were often depicted in <a href="bas-relief">bas-relief</a> on monuments, usually surrounded by an architectural frame. The walls of tomb chambers were often painted in <a href="fresco">fresco</a>, although few examples have survived in as good condition as the <a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Diver">Tomb of the Diver</a> from southern Italy or the tombs at <a href="Vergina">Vergina</a> in Macedon. Almost the only surviving painted portraits in the classical Greek tradition are found in Egypt rather than Greece. The <a href="Fayum%20mummy%20portraits">Fayum mummy portraits</a>, from the very end of the classical period, were portrait faces, in a <a href="Greco-Roman%20world">Graeco-Roman</a> style, attached to mummies.

Early Greek burials were frequently marked above ground by a large piece of pottery, and remains were also buried in urns. Pottery continued to be used extensively inside tombs and graves throughout the classical period. The great majority of surviving <a href="ancient%20Greek%20pottery">ancient Greek pottery</a> is recovered from tombs; some was apparently items used in life, but much of it was made specifically for placing in tombs, and the balance between the two original purposes is controversial. The "<a href="Larnax%20%28Archaeology%29">larnax</a>" is a small coffin or ash-chest, usually of decorated <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a>. The two-handled "<a href="loutrophoros">loutrophoros</a>" was primarily associated with weddings, as it was used to carry water for the <a href="nuptial">nuptial</a> bath. However, it was also placed in the tombs of the unmarried, "presumably to make up in some way for what they had missed in life." The one-handled "<a href="lekythos">lekythos</a>" had many household uses, but outside the household, its principal use was the decoration of tombs. Scenes of a <a href="descent%20to%20the%20underworld">descent to the underworld</a> of <a href="Hades">Hades</a> were often painted on these, with the dead depicted beside <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, Charon or both—though usually only with Charon. Small pottery figurines are often found, though it is hard to decide if these were made especially for placement in tombs; in the case of the <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> <a href="Tanagra%20figurines">Tanagra figurines</a>, this seems probably not the case. But silverware is more often found around the fringes of the Greek world, as in the royal <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ian tombs of <a href="Vergina">Vergina</a>, or in the neighbouring cultures such as those of <a href="Thrace">Thrace</a> or the <a href="Scythians">Scythians</a>.

The extension of the Greek world after the conquests of <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> brought peoples with different tomb-making traditions into the <a href="Hellenistic">Hellenistic</a> sphere, resulting in new formats for art in Greek styles. A generation before Alexander, Mausolus was a Hellenized <a href="satrap">satrap</a> or semi-independent ruler under the <a href="Persian%20Empire">Persian Empire</a>, whose enormous tomb (begun 353 BCE) was wholly exceptional in the Greek world – together with the Pyramids it was the only tomb to be included in the <a href="Seven%20Wonders%20of%20the%20Ancient%20World">Seven Wonders of the Ancient World</a>. The exact form of the <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Halicarnassus">Mausoleum of Halicarnassus</a>, which gave the name to the form, is now unclear, and there are several alternative reconstructions that seek to reconcile the archaeological evidence with descriptions in literature. It had the size and some elements of the design of the <a href="Greek%20temple">Greek temple</a>, but was much more vertical, with a square base and a pyramidal roof. There were quantities of large sculpture, of which most of the few surviving pieces are now in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>. Other local rulers adapted the high-relief temple <a href="frieze">frieze</a> for very large sarcophagi, starting a tradition which was to exert a great influence on Western art up to 18th-century <a href="Neo-Classicism">Neo-Classicism</a>. The late 4th-century <a href="Alexander%20Sarcophagus">Alexander Sarcophagus</a> was in fact made for another Hellenized Eastern ruler, one of a number of important sarcophagi found at <a href="Sidon">Sidon</a> in the modern <a href="Lebanon">Lebanon</a>. The two long sides show Alexander's great victory at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Issus">Battle of Issus</a> and a lion hunt; such violent scenes were common on ostentatious classical sarcophagi from this period onwards, with a particular revival in Roman art of the 2nd century. More peaceful mythological scenes were popular on smaller sarcophagi, especially of <a href="Dionysus">Bacchus</a>.

Objects connected with death, in particular <a href="sarcophagus">sarcophagi</a> and <a href="cinerary%20urn">cinerary urn</a>s, form the basis of much of current knowledge of the ancient <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscan civilization</a> and <a href="Etruscan%20art">its art</a>, which once competed with the <a href="culture%20of%20ancient%20Rome">culture of ancient Rome</a>, but was eventually absorbed into it. The sarcophagi and the lids of the urns often incorporate a reclining image of the deceased. The reclining figures in some Etruscan funerary art are shown using the "<a href="mano%20cornuta">mano cornuta</a>" to protect the grave.

The motif of the funerary art of the 7th and 6th centuries BCE was typically a feasting scene, sometimes with dancers and musicians, or athletic competitions. Household bowls, cups, and pitchers are sometimes found in the graves, along with food such as eggs, pomegranates, honey, grapes and olives for use in the afterlife. From the 5th century, the mood changed to more somber and gruesome scenes of parting, where the deceased are shown leaving their loved ones, often surrounded by underworld demons, and psychopomps, such as <a href="Charun">Charun</a> or the winged female <a href="Vanth">Vanth</a>. The underworld figures are sometimes depicted as gesturing impatiently for a human to be taken away. The handshake was another common motif, as the dead took leave of the living. This often took place in front of or near a closed double doorway, presumably the portal to the underworld. Evidence in some art, however, suggests that the "handshake took place at the other end of the journey, and represents the dead being greeted in the Underworld".

The burial customs of the <a href="Ancient%20Rome">ancient Romans</a> were influenced by both of the first significant cultures whose territories they conquered as their state expanded, namely the Greeks of <a href="Magna%20Graecia">Magna Graecia</a> and the Etruscans. The original Roman custom was <a href="cremation">cremation</a>, after which the burnt remains were kept in a pot, ash-chest or urn, often in a "<a href="columbarium">columbarium</a>"; pre-Roman burials around Rome often used hut-urns—little pottery houses. From about the 2nd century CE, <a href="inhumation">inhumation</a> (burial of unburnt remains) in sarcophagi, often elaborately carved, became more fashionable for those who could afford it. Greek-style medallion portrait sculptures on a "stela", or small mausoleum for the rich, housing either an urn or sarcophagus, were often placed in a location such as a roadside, where it would be very visible to the living and perpetuate the memory of the dead. Often a couple are shown, signifying a longing for reunion in the afterlife rather than a double burial (see <a href="married%20couple%20funerary%20reliefs">married couple funerary reliefs</a>).

In later periods, life-size sculptures of the deceased reclining as though at a meal or social gathering are found, a common Etruscan style. Family tombs for the grandest late Roman families, like the <a href="Tomb%20of%20the%20Scipios">Tomb of the Scipios</a>, were large mausoleums with facilities for visits by the living, including kitchens and bedrooms. The <a href="Castel%20Sant%27Angelo">Castel Sant'Angelo</a>, built for <a href="Hadrian">Hadrian</a>, was later converted into a fortress. Compared to the Etruscans, though, there was less emphasis on provision of a lifestyle for the deceased, although paintings of useful objects or pleasant activities, like hunting, are seen. Ancestor portraits, usually in the form of wax masks, were kept in the home, apparently often in little cupboards, although grand patrician families kept theirs on display in the "<a href="Domus">atrium</a>". They were worn in the funeral processions of members of the family by persons wearing appropriate costume for the figure represented, as described by <a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny the Elder</a> and <a href="Polybius">Polybius</a>. Pliny also describes the custom of having a bust-portrait of an ancestor painted on a round bronze shield ("<a href="clipeus">clipeus</a>"), and having it hung in a temple or other public place. No examples of either type have survived.

By the late <a href="Roman%20Republic">Republic</a> there was considerable competition among wealthy Romans for the best locations for tombs, which lined all the approach roads to the city up to the walls, and a variety of exotic and unusual designs sought to catch the attention of the passer-by and so perpetuate the memory of the deceased and increase the prestige of their family. Examples include the <a href="Tomb%20of%20Eurysaces%20the%20Baker">Tomb of Eurysaces the Baker</a>, a <a href="freedman">freedman</a>, the <a href="Pyramid%20of%20Cestius">Pyramid of Cestius</a>, and the Mausoleum of <a href="Caecilia%20Metella%20%28daughter%20of%20Metellus%20Creticus%29">Caecilia Metella</a>, all built within a few decades of the start of the <a href="Common%20Era">Common Era</a>.

In Italy, sarcophagi were mostly intended to be set against the wall of the tomb, and only decorated on three sides, in contrast to the free-standing styles of Greece and the Eastern Empire. The relief scenes of Hellenistic art became even more densely crowded in later Roman sarcophagi, as for example in the 2nd-century <a href="Portonaccio%20sarcophagus">Portonaccio sarcophagus</a>, and various styles and forms emerged, such as the columnar type with an "architectural background of columns and niches for its figures". A well-known Early Christian example is the <a href="Sarcophagus%20of%20Junius%20Bassus">Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus</a>, used for an important new convert who died in 359. Many sarcophagi from leading centres were exported around the Empire. The Romans had already developed the expression of religious and philosophical ideas in narrative scenes from <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, treated <a href="allegorically">allegorically</a>; they later transferred this habit to Christian ideas, using biblical scenes.

Funerary art varied greatly across Chinese history. Tombs of early rulers rival the ancient Egyptians for complexity and value of grave goods, and have been similarly pillaged over the centuries by <a href="tomb%20robber">tomb robber</a>s. For a long time, literary references to <a href="jade%20burial%20suit">jade burial suit</a>s were regarded by scholars as fanciful myths, but a number of examples were excavated in the 20th century, and it is now believed that they were relatively common among early rulers. Knowledge of pre-dynastic Chinese culture has been expanded by spectacular discoveries at <a href="Sanxingdui">Sanxingdui</a> and other sites. Very large tumuli could be erected, and later, mausoleums. Several special large shapes of <a href="Shang%20dynasty">Shang dynasty</a> <a href="Chinese%20ritual%20bronzes">bronze ritual vessels</a> were probably made for burial only; large numbers were buried in elite tombs, while other sets remained above ground for the family to use in making offerings in <a href="Ancestor%20veneration%20in%20China">ancestor veneration rituals</a>. The <a href="Tomb%20of%20Fu%20Hao">Tomb of Fu Hao</a> (c. BCE 1200) is one of the few undisturbed royal tombs of the period to have been excavated—most funerary art has appeared on the art market without archaeological context.

The discovery in 1974 of the <a href="Terracotta%20army">Terracotta army</a> located the tomb of the <a href="First%20Qin%20Emperor">First Qin Emperor</a> (died 210 BCE), but the main tumulus, of which literary descriptions survive, has not been excavated. Remains surviving above ground from several imperial tombs of the <a href="Han%20dynasty">Han dynasty</a> show traditions maintained until the end of imperial rule. The tomb itself is an "underground palace" beneath a sealed tumulus surrounded by a wall, with several buildings set at some distance away down avenues for the observation of rites of veneration, and the accommodation of both permanent staff and those visiting to perform rites, as well as gateways, towers and other buildings.
<a href="Tang%20dynasty%20tomb%20figures">Tang dynasty tomb figures</a>, in "three-colour" "<a href="sancai">sancai</a>" glazes or overglaze paint, show a wide range of servants, entertainers, animals and fierce tomb guardians between about 12 and 120 cm high, and were arranged around the tomb, often in niches along the sloping access path to the underground chamber. 

Chinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a "<a href="spirit%20way">spirit road</a>", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of <a href="Bixi%20%28mythology%29">Bixi</a> in the form of a <a href="tortoise">tortoise</a>, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of "lions" and "<a href="Chimera%20%28mythology%29">chimera</a>s"; in later periods they are much more varied. A looted tomb with fine paintings is the <a href="Empress%20Dowager%20Wenming%20tomb">Empress Dowager Wenming tomb</a> of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century <a href="Tang%20dynasty">Tang dynasty</a> <a href="Qianling%20Mausoleum">Qianling Mausoleum</a> group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.

The <a href="complex%20of%20Goguryeo%20Tombs">complex of Goguryeo Tombs</a>, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the <a href="Imperial%20Tombs%20of%20the%20Ming%20and%20Qing%20Dynasties">Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties</a> has been excavated, in 1956, with such <a href="Ming%20tombs%23Excavation%20of%20Dingling%20tomb">disastrous results</a> for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.

The <a href="Lei%20Cheng%20Uk%20Han%20Tomb%20Museum">Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum</a> in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of <a href="Jiaxiang%20County">Jiaxiang County</a>, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing. After the introduction of Buddhism, carved "funerary couches" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious. During the Han Dynasty, <a href="Science%20and%20technology%20of%20the%20Han%20Dynasty%23Ceramic%20model%20buildings">miniature ceramic models</a> of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture. Later, during the <a href="Six%20Dynasties">Six Dynasties</a>, sculptural miniatures depicting buildings, monuments, people and animals adorned the tops of the "<a href="hunping">hunping</a>" funerary vessels. The outsides of tombs often featured monumental brick or stone-carved pillar-gates (que 闕); an example from 121 CE appears to be the earliest surviving Chinese architectural structure standing above ground. Tombs of the <a href="Tang%20Dynasty">Tang Dynasty</a> (618–907) are often rich in glazed pottery figurines of horses, servants and other subjects, whose forceful and free style is greatly admired today. The tomb art reached its peak in the Song and Jin periods; most spectacular tombs were built by rich commoners.

Early burial customs show a strong belief in an afterlife and a spirit path to it that needed facilitating. Funerals and memorials were also an opportunity to reaffirm such important cultural values as <a href="filial%20piety">filial piety</a> and "the honor and respect due to seniors, the duties incumbent on juniors" The common Chinese funerary symbol of a woman in the door may represent a "basic male fantasy of an elysian afterlife with no restrictions: in all the doorways of the houses stand available women looking for newcomers to welcome into their chambers" Han Dynasty inscriptions often describe the filial mourning for their subjects, for example text from a funeral <a href="stele">stele</a> for the daughter of a <a href="scholar-official">scholar-official</a> of the dynasty, which described the "hurt and grief" of her two sons:

Murals painted on the walls of the <a href="Complex%20of%20Goguryeo%20Tombs">Goguryeo Tombs</a> are examples of Korean painting from its <a href="Three%20Kingdoms%20of%20Korea">Three Kingdoms</a> era. Although thousands of these tombs have been found, only about 100 have murals. These tombs are often named for the dominating theme of the murals – these include the Tomb of the Dancers, the Tomb of the Hunters, the Tomb of the Four Spirits, and the Tomb of the Wrestlers. Heavenly bodies are a common motif, as are depictions of events from the lives of the royalty and nobles whose bodies had been entombed. The former include the sun, represented as a <a href="three-legged%20bird">three-legged bird</a> inside a wheel, and the various constellations, including especially the <a href="Four%20Symbols%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">Four directional constellations</a>: the <a href="Azure%20Dragon">Azure Dragon</a> of the East, the <a href="Vermilion%20Bird">Vermilion Bird</a> of the South, the <a href="White%20Tiger%20%28Chinese%20constellation%29">White Tiger</a> of the West, and the <a href="Black%20Tortoise">Black Tortoise</a> of the North.

The <a href="Royal%20Tombs%20of%20the%20Joseon%20Dynasty">Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty</a> in <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, built between 1408 and 1966, reflect a combination of Chinese and Japanese traditions, with a tomb mound, often surrounded by a screen wall of stone blocks, and sometimes with stone animal figures above ground, not unlike the Japanese "haniwa" figures (see below). There is usually one or more T-shaped shrine buildings some distance in front of the tomb, which is set in extensive grounds, usually with a hill behind them, and facing a view towards water and distant hills. They are still a focus for <a href="ancestor%20worship">ancestor worship</a> rituals. From the 15th century, they became more simple, while retaining a large landscape setting.

The <a href="Kofun%20period">Kofun period</a> of Japanese history, from the 3rd to 6th centuries CE, is named after "<a href="kofun">kofun</a>", the often enormous keyhole-shaped Imperial mound-tombs, often on a moated island. None of these have ever been allowed to be excavated, so their possibly spectacular contents remain unknown. Late examples which have been investigated, such as the <a href="Kitora%20Tomb">Kitora Tomb</a>, had been robbed of most of their contents, but the <a href="Takamatsuzuka%20Tomb">Takamatsuzuka Tomb</a> retains mural paintings. Lower down the social scale in the same period, <a href="terracotta">terracotta</a> "haniwa" figures, as much as a metre high, were deposited on top of aristocratic tombs as grave markers, with others left inside, apparently representing possessions such as horses and houses for use in the afterlife. Both "kofun" mounds and "haniwa" figures appear to have been discontinued as Buddhism became the dominant Japanese religion.

Since then, Japanese tombs have been typically marked by elegant but simple rectangular vertical gravestones with inscriptions. Funerals are one of the areas in Japanese life where Buddhist customs are followed even by those who followed other traditions, such as <a href="Shinto">Shinto</a>. The "<a href="bodaiji">bodaiji</a>" is a special and very common type of temple whose main purpose is as a venue for rites of ancestor worship, though it is often not the actual burial site. This was originally a custom of the feudal lords, but was adopted by other classes from about the 16th century. Each family would use a particular "bodaiji" over generations, and it might contain a second "grave" if the actual burial were elsewhere. Many later emperors, from the 13th to 19th centuries, are buried simply at the Imperial "bodaiji", the <a href="Tsuki%20no%20wa%20no%20misasagi">Tsuki no wa no misasagi</a> mausoleum in the <a href="Senny%C5%AB-ji">Sennyū-ji</a> temple at <a href="Kyoto">Kyoto</a>.

Unlike many Western cultures, that of <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a> is generally lacking in <a href="sarcophagi">sarcophagi</a>, with a few notable exceptions such as that of <a href="Pacal%20the%20Great">Pacal the Great</a> or the now-lost sarcophagus from the <a href="Olmec">Olmec</a> site of <a href="La%20Venta">La Venta</a>. Instead, most Mesoamerican funerary art takes the form of grave goods and, in <a href="Oaxaca">Oaxaca</a>, <a href="funerary%20urn">funerary urn</a>s holding the ashes of the deceased. Two well-known examples of Mesoamerican grave goods are those from <a href="Jaina%20Island">Jaina Island</a>, a <a href="Maya%20civilization">Maya</a> site off the coast of <a href="Campeche">Campeche</a>, and those associated with the <a href="Western%20Mexico%20shaft%20tomb%20tradition">Western Mexico shaft tomb tradition</a>. The tombs of Mayan rulers can only normally be identified by inferences drawn from the lavishness of the grave goods and, with the possible exception of vessels made from stone rather than pottery, these appear to contain no objects specially made for the burial.

The Jaina Island graves are noted for their abundance of clay figurines. Human remains within the roughly 1,000 excavated graves on the island (out of 20,000 total) were found to be accompanied by glassware, slateware, or pottery, as well as one or more ceramic figurines, usually resting on the occupant's chest or held in their hands. The function of these figurines is not known: due to gender and age mismatches, they are unlikely to be portraits of the grave occupants, although the later figurines are known to be representations of goddesses.

The so-called shaft tomb tradition of western Mexico is known almost exclusively from grave goods, which include hollow ceramic figures, obsidian and shell jewelry, pottery, and other items (see <a href="https%3A//www.flickr.com/photos/petwerewolf/85154232/">this Flickr photo</a> for a reconstruction). Of particular note are the various ceramic tableaux including village scenes, for example, players engaged in a <a href="Mesoamerican%20ballgame">Mesoamerican ballgame</a>. Although these tableaux may merely depict village life, it has been proposed that they instead (or also) depict the underworld. Ceramic dogs are also widely known from looted tombs, and are thought by some to represent <a href="psychopomp">psychopomp</a>s (soul guides), although dogs were often the major source of protein in ancient Mesoamerica.

The <a href="Zapotec%20civilization">Zapotec civilization</a> of Oaxaca is particularly known for its clay funerary urns, such as the "bat god" shown at right. Numerous types of urns have been identified. While some show deities and other supernatural beings, others seem to be portraits. Art historian <a href="George%20Kubler">George Kubler</a> is particularly enthusiastic about the craftsmanship of this tradition:

No other American potters ever explored so completely the plastic conditions of wet clay or retained its forms so completely after firing ... [they] used its wet and ductile nature for fundamental geometric modelling and cut the material, when half-dry, into smooth planes with sharp edges of an unmatched brilliance and suggestiveness of form.

The Maya <a href="Naj%20Tunich">Naj Tunich</a> cave tombs and other sites contain paintings, carved stelae, and grave goods in pottery, <a href="jade">jade</a> and metal, including <a href="death%20mask">death mask</a>s. In dry areas, many ancient textiles have been found in graves from South America's <a href="Paracas%20culture">Paracas culture</a>, which wrapped its mummies tightly in several layers of elaborately patterned cloth. Elite <a href="Moche%20%28culture%29">Moche</a> graves, containing especially fine pottery, were incorporated into large <a href="adobe">adobe</a> structures also used for <a href="human%20sacrifice">human sacrifice</a>s, such as the <a href="Huaca%20de%20la%20Luna">Huaca de la Luna</a>. <a href="Cultural%20periods%20of%20Peru">Andean cultures</a> such as the <a href="Sican%20Culture">Sican</a> often practiced mummification and left grave goods in precious metals with jewels, including <a href="tumi">tumi</a> ritual knives and gold funerary masks, as well as pottery.

The Mimbres of the <a href="Mogollon%20culture">Mogollon culture</a> buried their dead with bowls on top of their heads and ceremonially "killed" each bowl with a small hole in the centre so that the deceased's spirit could rise to another world. Mimbres <a href="Mogollon%20culture%23Mimbres%20pottery">funerary bowls</a> show scenes of hunting, gambling, planting crops, fishing, sexual acts and births.

Some of the <a href="Mound%20builder%20%28people%29">North American mounds</a>, such as <a href="Grave%20Creek%20Mound">Grave Creek Mound</a> (c. 250–150 BCE) in <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a>, functioned as burial sites, while others had different purposes.

There is an enormous diversity of funeral art from traditional societies across the world, much of it in perishable materials, and some is mentioned elsewhere in the article. In traditional African societies, <a href="African%20traditional%20masks">masks</a> often have a specific association with death, and some types may be worn mainly or exclusively for funeral ceremonies. The funeral ceremonies of the <a href="Indigenous%20Australians">Indigenous Australians</a> typically feature <a href="body%20painting">body painting</a>; the <a href="Yolngu">Yolngu</a> and <a href="Tiwi%20people">Tiwi</a> people create carved "<a href="pukumani">pukumani</a>" burial poles from <a href="ironwood">ironwood</a> trunks, while elaborately carved <a href="burial%20tree">burial tree</a>s have been used in south-eastern Australia. The <a href="Toraja">Toraja</a> people of central <a href="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a> are famous for <a href="Toraja%23Funeral%20rites">their burial practices</a>, which include the setting-up of effigies of the dead on cliffs. The 19th- and 20th-century royal <a href="Kasubi%20Tombs">Kasubi Tombs</a> in <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a>, destroyed by fire in 2010, were a circular compound of thatched buildings similar to those inhabited by the earlier <a href="Kabaka%20of%20Buganda">Kabaka</a>s when alive, but with special characteristics.

In several cultures, goods for use in the afterlife are still interred or cremated, for example <a href="Hell%20bank%20note">Hell bank note</a>s in East Asian communities. In Ghana, mostly among the <a href="Ga%20people">Ga people</a>, elaborate figurative coffins in the shape of cars, boats or animals are made of wood. These were introduced in the 1950s by Seth <a href="Kane%20Kwei%20Carpentry%20Workshop">Kane Kwei</a>.

<a href="Cremation">Cremation</a> is traditional among Hindus, who also believe in <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a>, and there is far less of a tradition of funerary monuments in Hinduism than in other major religions. However, there are regional, and relatively recent, traditions among royalty, and the "samādhi mandir" is a memorial temple for a saint. Both may be influenced by Islamic practices. The mausoleums of the kings of <a href="Orchha">Orchha</a>, from the 16th century onwards, are among the best known. Other rulers were commemorated by memorial temples of the normal type for the time and place, which like similar buildings from other cultures fall outside the scope of this article, though <a href="Angkor%20Wat">Angkor Wat</a> in <a href="Cambodia">Cambodia</a>, the most spectacular of all, must be mentioned.

Buddhist tombs themselves are typically simple and modest, although they may be set within temples, sometimes large complexes, built for the purpose in the then-prevailing style. According to tradition, the remains of the <a href="Buddha">Buddha</a>'s body after <a href="cremation">cremation</a> were entirely divided up into relics ("<a href="cetiya">cetiya</a>"), which played an important part in early Buddhism. The "<a href="stupa">stupa</a>" developed as a monument enclosing deposits of relics of the Buddha from plain hemispherical mounds in the 3rd century BCE to elaborate structures such as those at <a href="Sanchi">Sanchi</a> in India and <a href="Borobudur">Borobudur</a> in <a href="Java">Java</a>. Regional variants such as the <a href="pagoda">pagoda</a> of China and Japan and the <a href="candi%20of%20Indonesia">candi of Indonesia</a> evolved from the Indian form. However, none of these can strictly be called tombs. Some important <a href="Tibet">Tibet</a>an <a href="lama">lama</a>s are buried in relatively small "chortens" (Tibetan stupas), sometimes of precious metal, inside or outside monasteries, sometimes after mummification. There are examples at <a href="Kursha%20Monastery">Kursha Monastery</a> in <a href="Zanskar">Zanskar</a> and <a href="Tashiding%20Monastery">Tashiding Monastery</a> in <a href="Sikkim">Sikkim</a>, as well as the <a href="Potala%20Palace">Potala Palace</a> in <a href="Lhasa">Lhasa</a> and many other monasteries. However, most chortens do not function as tombs.

The <a href="Catacombs%20of%20Rome">Catacombs of Rome</a> contain most of the surviving <a href="Christian%20art">Christian art</a> of the <a href="Early%20Christianity">Early Christian</a> period, mainly in the form of <a href="fresco">fresco</a>s and <a href="Early%20Christian%20sarcophagi">sculpted sarcophagi</a>. They show a Christian <a href="iconography">iconography</a> emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the <a href="Chi%20Rho">Chi Rho</a> monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously <a href="St%20Peter%27s%2C%20Rome">St Peter's, Rome</a>) over the burial places of <a href="martyr">martyr</a>s who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including <a href="Tumah">Judaism</a> and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead <a href="Ritual%20purification">ritually impure</a> and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture).
Christians believed in a bodily <a href="resurrection%20of%20the%20dead">resurrection of the dead</a> at the <a href="Second%20Coming%20of%20Christ">Second Coming of Christ</a>, and the Catholic Church only relaxed <a href="Cremation%23Roman%20Catholicism">its opposition to cremation</a> in 1963. Although mass <a href="ossuaries">ossuaries</a> have also been used, burial has always been the preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there was room, usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a <a href="crypt">crypt</a> or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the <a href="shrine">shrine</a>s of saints, which became the destinations of <a href="pilgrimage">pilgrimage</a>s. The monument to <a href="Maximilian%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor</a> in the <a href="Hofkirche%2C%20Innsbruck">Hofkirche, Innsbruck</a> took decades to complete, while the <a href="Arca%20di%20San%20Domenico">tomb of Saint Dominic</a> in <a href="Bologna">Bologna</a> took several centuries to reach its final form.

If only because its strong prejudice against free-standing and life-size sculpture, <a href="Eastern%20Orthodoxy">Eastern Orthodoxy</a> could not have developed the tomb monument in the same way as the Western Church, and the burials of rich or important individuals continued the classical tradition of sarcophagi carved in relief, with the richness of the carving tending to diminish over the centuries, until just simple religious symbols were left. <a href="Constantine%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">Constantine I</a> and most later <a href="Byzantine%20Emperor">Byzantine Emperor</a>s up to 1028 were buried in the <a href="Church%20of%20the%20Holy%20Apostles">Church of the Holy Apostles</a> in Constantinople, which was destroyed after the <a href="fall%20of%20Constantinople">fall of Constantinople</a> of 1453. Some massive but mostly plain <a href="Porphyry%20%28geology%29">porphyry</a> sarcophagi from the church are now placed outside the <a href="Istanbul%20Archaeology%20Museums">Istanbul Archaeology Museums</a>.

The <a href="Tomb%20of%20Antipope%20John%20XXIII">Tomb of Antipope John XXIII</a> in <a href="Florence">Florence</a> is a grand <a href="Early%20Renaissance">Early Renaissance</a> wall tomb by <a href="Donatello">Donatello</a> and <a href="Michelozzo">Michelozzo</a>; although classical in style, it reflects the somewhat inharmonious stacking up of different elements typical of major Gothic tombs. It has a life-size effigy, also known as a <a href="gisant">gisant</a>, lying on the sarcophagus, which was common from the <a href="Romanesque%20architecture">Romanesque</a> period through to the <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> and beyond. Ruling dynasties were often buried together, usually in monasteries; the <a href="Chartreuse%20de%20Champmol">Chartreuse de Champmol</a> was founded for that purpose by the <a href="House%20of%20Valois">Valois</a> <a href="Duke%20of%20Burgundy">Dukes of Burgundy</a> in 1383. The <a href="Scaliger%20tombs">Scaliger tombs</a> in <a href="Verona">Verona</a> are magnificent free-standing <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic</a> canopied tombs—they are outside the church in a special enclosure, and so are unrestricted in height. Important churches like Saint Peter's in Rome, <a href="Saint%20Paul%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20London">Saint Paul's Cathedral, London</a>, <a href="Santi%20Giovanni%20e%20Paolo%2C%20Venice">Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice</a> (twenty-five <a href="Doge">Doge</a>s), and the <a href="Basilica%20of%20Santa%20Croce%2C%20Florence">Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence</a> contain large numbers of impressive monuments to the great and the good, created by the finest architects and sculptors available. Local <a href="parish%20church">parish church</a>es are also often full of monuments, which may include large and artistically significant ones for local landowners and notables. Often a prominent family would add a special chapel for their use, including their tombs; in Catholic countries, <a href="mass%20bequest">bequests would pay for masses</a> to be said in perpetuity for their souls. By the <a href="High%20Renaissance">High Renaissance</a>, led by <a href="Michelangelo">Michelangelo</a>'s tombs, the effigies are often sitting up, and later may stand. Often they turn towards the altar, or are kneeling facing it in profile.

In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the <a href="Black%20Death">Black Death</a> and devotional writers, explicit "<a href="memento%20mori">memento mori</a>" imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the "<a href="transi">transi</a>" tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the <a href="Danse%20Macabre">Dance of Death</a> and works like the "<a href="Ars%20moriendi">Ars moriendi</a>", or "Art of Dying". It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of <a href="Pope%20Urban%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVIII">Pope Urban VIII</a> by <a href="Bernini">Bernini</a> (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy. As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in <a href="ossuaries">ossuaries</a> where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the <a href="Capuchin%20Crypt">Capuchin Crypt</a> in Rome or the Czech <a href="Sedlec%20Ossuary">Sedlec Ossuary</a>, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones.

The church struggled to eliminate the pagan habits of leaving grave goods except for the clothing and usual jewellery of the powerful, especially rings. Kings might be buried with a <a href="sceptre">sceptre</a>, and bishops with a <a href="crozier">crozier</a>, their respective symbols of office. The 7th-century <a href="Stonyhurst%20Gospel">Stonyhurst Gospel</a>, with a unique <a href="Insular%20art">Insular</a> original leather binding, was recovered from <a href="St%20Cuthbert%27s%20coffin">St Cuthbert's coffin</a>, itself a significant object. The armour and sword of a knight might be hung over his tomb, as those of <a href="Edward%20the%20Black%20Prince">the Black Prince</a> still are in <a href="Canterbury%20Cathedral">Canterbury Cathedral</a>. The Early Christian Church, to the frustration of historians of costume, encouraged burial in a plain white <a href="winding-sheet">winding-sheet</a>, as being all that would be required at the Second Coming. For centuries, most except royalty followed this custom, which at least kept clothing, which was very expensive for rich and poor alike, available for the use of the living. The use of a rich cloth <a href="Pall%20%28funeral%29">pall</a> to cover the coffin during the funeral grew during the Middle Ages; initially these were brightly coloured and patterned, only later black. They were usually then given to the Church to use for <a href="vestment">vestment</a>s or other decorations.

From the early 13th century to the 16th, a popular form of monument north of the Alps, especially for the smaller landowner and merchant classes, was the <a href="monumental%20brass">monumental brass</a>, a sheet of brass on which the image of the person or persons commemorated was engraved, often with inscriptions and an architectural surround. They could be on the floor or wall inside a church. These provide valuable evidence as to changes in costume, especially for women. Many bishops and even some German rulers were commemorated with brasses.

The "<a href="castrum%20doloris">castrum doloris</a>" was a temporary <a href="catafalque">catafalque</a> erected around the coffin for the <a href="lying%20in%20state">lying in state</a> of important people, usually in a church, the funerary version of the elaborate temporary decorations for other court festivities, like <a href="royal%20entries">royal entries</a>. These began in the late Middle Ages, but reached their height of elaboration in the 18th century. A particular feature in Poland was the <a href="coffin%20portrait">coffin portrait</a>, a bust-length painted portrait of the deceased, attached to the coffin, but removed before burial and often then hung in the church. Elsewhere, death masks were used in similar fashion. <a href="Funerary%20hatchment">Hatchment</a>s were a special lozenge-shaped painted <a href="coat%20of%20arms">coat of arms</a> which was displayed on the house of the deceased for a mourning period, before usually being moved to hang in the church. Like <a href="mourning">mourning clothes</a>, these fall outside a strict definition of art.

For some time after the <a href="Protestant%20Reformation">Protestant Reformation</a>, <a href="English%20church%20monuments">English church monuments</a> formed the majority of large-scale artworks added to Protestant churches, especially in sculpture. The English upper classes ceased to commission altarpieces and other religious art for churches, but their tomb monuments continued to grow in size to fill the empty wall spaces; similar trends were seen in <a href="Lutheran">Lutheran</a> countries, but <a href="Calvinism">Calvinists</a> tended to be more disapproving of figure sculpture. Many portraits were painted after death, and sometimes dead family members were included along with the living; a variety of indications might be used to suggest the distinction.

The large <a href="Baroque">Baroque</a> tomb monument continued likely to include a portrait of the deceased, and was more likely to include personified figures of Death, Time, Virtues or other figures than angels. The late medieval <a href="transi">transi</a> tomb vocabulary of images of bodily decay, such as skulls and skeletons, was sometimes re-introduced, but in a less confrontational manner. <a href="Neo-Classicism">Neo-Classicism</a>, led by <a href="Antonio%20Canova">Antonio Canova</a>, revived the classical "stela", either with a portrait or a personification; in this style there was little or no difference between the demands of Catholic and Protestant patrons.

By the 19th century, many <a href="Old%20World">Old World</a> churchyards and church walls had completely run out of room for new monuments, and cemeteries on the outskirts of cities, towns or villages became the usual place for burials. The rich developed the classical styles of the ancient world for small family tombs, while the rest continued to use gravestones or what were now usually false sarcophagi, placed over a buried coffin. The cemeteries of the large Italian cities are generally accepted to have outdone those of other nations in terms of extravagant statuary, especially the <a href="Monumental%20Cemetery%20of%20Staglieno">Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno</a> in <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, the <a href="Cimitero%20Monumentale%20di%20Milano">Cimitero Monumentale di Milano</a> and the <a href="Certosa%20di%20Bologna">Certosa di Bologna</a>. In Italy at least, funerary sculpture remained of equal status to other types during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and was made by the leading artists, often receiving reviews in the press, and being exhibited, perhaps in <a href="maquette">maquette</a> form.
Monuments kept up with contemporary stylistic developments during the 19th century, embracing <a href="Symbolism%20%28arts%29">Symbolism</a> enthusiastically, but then gradually became detached from the <a href="avant-garde">avant-garde</a> after <a href="Art%20Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> and a few <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> examples. Where burials in church crypts or floors took place, memorial <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows, mostly on normal religious subjects but with a commemorative panel, are often found. <a href="War%20memorial">War memorial</a>s, other than on the site of a battle, were relatively unusual until the 19th century, but became increasingly common during it, and after <a href="World%20War%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI">World War I</a> were erected even in villages of the main combatant nations.

Islamic funerary art is dominated by architecture. Grave goods are discouraged to the point that their absence is frequently one recognition criterion of Muslim burials. Royalty and important religious figures were typically buried in plain stone sarcophagi, perhaps with a religious inscription. However, funerary architecture often offered a means of "moving beyond the strictures of formal Muslim burial rites" and expressing social dimensions such as status, piety, love for the deceased, and Muslim identity. 

A number of distinct architectural traditions arose for expressing these social elements. The Islamic tradition was slow in starting; the "<a href="hadith">hadith</a>" "condemn the building of tombs, and <a href="Muhammad">Muhammad</a> himself set the example of requesting burial in an unmarked grave in one of the chambers of his house" in <a href="Medina">Medina</a>, though by at least the 12th century, buildings of the vast <a href="Al-Masjid%20an-Nabawi">Al-Masjid an-Nabawi</a> complex already marked the site. The earliest identified Muslim monumental tomb, in <a href="Samarra">Samarra</a> in Iraq, only dates from 862, and was commissioned by the Byzantine princess whose son was buried there. At some point, the tradition incorporated the idea of a garden setting, perhaps following the Islamic concept of <a href="Paradise">Paradise</a>, an association certainly made when the tradition was mature, although the difficulty of reconstructing gardens from archaeology makes the early stages of this process hard to trace. At any rate, gardens surrounding tombs became established in Islamic tradition in many parts of the world, and existing pleasure gardens were sometimes appropriated for this purpose. Versions of the formal Persian "<a href="charbagh">charbagh</a>" design were widely used in India, Persia and elsewhere.

Another influence may have been the octagonal <a href="Dome%20of%20the%20Rock">Dome of the Rock</a> in <a href="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, not a mausoleum itself, but "the earliest Islamic model for centrally planned commemorative buildings", adapting the Byzantine form of the martyrium in a building standing alone, though on a stone platform rather than in a garden. In the <a href="Persianate%20society">Persian sphere</a>, a tradition of relatively small mausoleums evolved, often in the shape of short hexagonal or octagonal <a href="dome">dome</a>d towers, usually containing a single chamber, like the <a href="Malek%20Tomb">Malek Tomb</a>. These single-chambered tombs developed into larger buildings in the <a href="Timurid%20dynasty">Timurid</a> and <a href="Mughal%20Empire">Mughal</a> Empires, like the <a href="Gur-e%20Amir">Gur-e Amir</a> tomb of <a href="Timur">Timur</a> at <a href="Samarkand">Samarkand</a> and the famous Mughal tombs of India, which culminated in the <a href="Taj%20Mahal">Taj Mahal</a>. The Mughal tombs are mostly set in a large walled "charbagh" ("chahar-bagh") or <a href="Mughal%20gardens">Mughal gardens</a>, often with <a href="pavilion">pavilion</a>s at the corners and a gatehouse. The Taj Mahal is atypically placed at the end of the garden, backing onto the river <a href="Yamuna">Yamuna</a>; a central placing is usual. They may have <a href="minaret">minaret</a>s, although they do not normally function as mosques. The <a href="Tomb%20of%20Jahangir">Tomb of Jahangir</a> lacks any dome, while the <a href="Tomb%20of%20Akbar%20the%20Great">Tomb of Akbar the Great</a> has only small decorative ones. Other Islamic Indian rulers built similar tombs, such as <a href="Gol%20Gumbaz">Gol Gumbaz</a>.

In all this tradition, the contemporary architectural style for mosques was adapted for a building with a smaller main room, and usually no courtyard. Decoration was often tilework, and could include "<a href="pietra%20dura">parchin kari</a>" inlays in semi-precious stone, painting, and decorative carving. No animals would be represented, but geometric patterns and written inscriptions were common. The sarcophagus might be in a small inner chamber, dimly visible through a grille of metal or stone, or might stand in the main room. Money would be bequeathed to pay for continuous readings of the <a href="Qur%27an">Qur'an</a> in the mausoleum, and they were normally open for visitors to pay their respects. The <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Khomeini">Mausoleum of Khomeini</a>, still under construction in a <a href="Tehran">Tehran</a> cemetery, and intended to be the centre of a huge complex, continues these traditions.

The tradition evolved differently in the <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman</a> world, where smaller single-roomed "<a href="t%C3%BCrbe">türbe</a>" typically stand on the grounds of mosque complexes, often built by the deceased. The sarcophagi (often purely symbolic, as the body is below the floor) may be draped in a rich pall, and surmounted by a real cloth or stone <a href="turban">turban</a>, which is also traditional at the top of ordinary <a href="Turkish%20people">Turkish</a> gravestones (usually in stylised form). Two of the most famous are in the <a href="S%C3%BCleymaniye%20Mosque">Süleymaniye Mosque</a> in <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>; the <a href="Ye%C5%9Fil%20T%C3%BCrbe">Yeşil Türbe</a> ("Green Tomb") of 1421 is an unusually large example in <a href="Bursa">Bursa</a>, and also unusual in having extensive tile work on the exterior, which is usually masonry, whereas the interiors are often decorated with brightly colored tiles.

Other parts of the Islamic world reflected local techniques and traditions. The 15th-century royal <a href="Tomb%20of%20Askia">Tomb of Askia</a> in <a href="Mali">Mali</a> used the local technique of mud-building to erect a 17 metre high pyramidal tomb set in a mosque complex. At the other end of the Islamic world, <a href="Java">Java</a>nese royalty are mostly buried in royal graveyards such as those at <a href="Kota%20Gede">Kota Gede</a> and <a href="Imogiri">Imogiri</a>.

In the Arab world, mausoleums of rulers are more likely to be a side-room inside a mosque or form part of a larger complex containing perhaps a hospital, "<a href="madrasah">madrasah</a>" or library. Large domes, elaborately decorated inside, are common. The tomb-mosque of Sultan <a href="Qaitbay">Qaitbay</a> (died 1496) is a famous example, one of many in <a href="Cairo">Cairo</a>, though here the tomb chamber is unusually large compared to the whole.

Funerary art tends to be conservative in style, and many grave markers in various cultures follow rather traditional patterns, while others reflect <a href="modernism">modernism</a> or other recent styles. Public monuments representing collective memorials to particular groups of dead people continue to be erected, especially <a href="war%20memorials">war memorials</a>, and in the Western world have now replaced individual or family memorials as the dominant types of very large memorials; Western political leaders now usually receive simple graves. Some large memorials are fairly traditional, while those reflecting more contemporary styles include the <a href="Vietnam%20Veterans%20Memorial">Vietnam Veterans Memorial</a>, and several <a href="Holocaust%20memorials">Holocaust memorials</a>, such as <a href="Yad%20Vashem">Yad Vashem</a> in Jerusalem, the <a href="Vel%27%20d%27Hiv%20Roundup%23Memorials%20and%20monuments%20%E2%80%93%20Paris">Vel d'Hiv Memorial</a> in Paris (1994), the <a href="Memorial%20to%20the%20Murdered%20Jews%20of%20Europe">Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe</a> in Berlin (2004), and the <a href="Judenplatz%20Holocaust%20Memorial">Judenplatz Holocaust Memorial</a> in Vienna (2000). These are in notable contrast to the style of most war memorials to the military of World War II; earlier modernist memorials to the dead of World War I were sometimes removed after a time as inappropriate. Some war memorials, especially in countries like Germany, have had a turbulent political history, for example the much-rededicated <a href="Neue%20Wache">Neue Wache</a> in Berlin and the <a href="Yasukuni%20Shrine">Yasukuni Shrine</a> in Tokyo, which is <a href="Controversies%20surrounding%20Yasukuni%20Shrine">internationally controversial</a>.

Several critics detect a crisis in public memorial style from 1945, when the traditional figurative symbolic language, and evocation of nationalist values, came to seem inadequate, especially in relation to <a href="genocide">genocide</a>, at least on the Western side of the <a href="Iron%20Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>. In the <a href="Eastern%20Bloc">Communist East</a> the established style of <a href="Socialist%20Realism">Socialist Realism</a> was still considered appropriate, at least by the authorities. The generation of abstracted and <a href="Conceptual%20art">conceptual</a> war and <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> memorials erected in the West from the 1990s onwards seems finally to have found a resolution for these issues.

Many large mausoleums have been constructed for political leaders, including <a href="Lenin%27s%20Mausoleum">Lenin's Mausoleum</a> and those for <a href="An%C4%B1tkabir">Atatürk</a>, <a href="Mazar-e-Quaid">Jinnah</a>, <a href="Kumsusan%20Memorial%20Palace">Kim Il-Sung</a>, <a href="Mausoleo%20Che%20Guevara">Che Guevara</a> and several <a href="Presidential%20memorials%20in%20the%20United%20States">Presidential memorials in the United States</a>, although the actual burials of recent presidents are very simple, with their <a href="Presidential%20library">Presidential library</a> and museum now usually their largest commemorative memorial. The <a href="Mausoleum%20of%20Ruhollah%20Khomeini">Mausoleum of Khomeini</a> is a grand mosque complex, as large as any medieval example, not least because it includes a 20,000 place parking lot.

Interstate 70 in West Virginia

Interstate 70 (I-70) is a portion of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> that runs from near <a href="Cove%20Fort%2C%20Utah">Cove Fort, Utah</a>, at a junction with <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20Utah">Interstate 15</a> to <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a>. It crosses the <a href="Northern%20Panhandle%20of%20West%20Virginia">Northern Panhandle</a> of <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> through <a href="Ohio%20County%2C%20West%20Virginia">Ohio County</a> and the city of <a href="Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia">Wheeling</a>. This segment is the shortest of all states' through which I-70 passes, crossing West Virginia in only . The longest segment is <a href="Interstate%2070%20in%20Colorado">Colorado's</a>, which measures . The <a href="Fort%20Henry%20Bridge">Fort Henry Bridge</a> carries I-70 from <a href="Wheeling%20Island">Wheeling Island</a> across the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> and into downtown Wheeling before the freeway enters the <a href="Wheeling%20Tunnel">Wheeling Tunnel</a>. <a href="Interstate%20470%20%28Ohio%E2%80%93West%20Virginia%29">I-470</a>, a southerly <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypass</a> of Wheeling and the lone auxiliary Interstate Highway in West Virginia, is intersected near <a href="Elm%20Grove%2C%20West%20Virginia">Elm Grove</a>. Before crossing into Pennsylvania, I-70 passes <a href="The%20Highlands%20%28Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia%29">The Highlands</a>, a major shopping center in the panhandle, and the <a href="Bear%20Rock%20Lakes%20Wildlife%20Management%20Area">Bear Rock Lakes Wildlife Management Area</a>. On average, between 27,000 and 53,000 vehicles use the freeway every day.

The first road that entered Wheeling was a <a href="post%20road">post road</a> completed in 1794 that connected Wheeling to <a href="Morgantown%2C%20West%20Virginia">Morgantown</a>. The <a href="National%20Road">National Road</a> was the first interstate road, completed in 1818, that connected Wheeling to <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland, Maryland</a>. When the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> was created in 1926, the National Road was designated <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20West%20Virginia">U.S. Route 40</a>. The I-70 designation was brought to the Northern Panhandle with the passage of the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956">Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956</a>, and it was built as a <a href="controlled-access%20highway">controlled-access highway</a>, bypassing portions of the old National Road. The first portions of I-70 in West Virginia were opened in 1963, and construction was completed in 1971.

Entering <a href="West%20Virginia">West Virginia</a> from <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, I-70 crosses the western channel of the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> onto <a href="Wheeling%20Island">Wheeling Island</a>, the most populated island along the Ohio River. The freeway passes above a light commercial zone, and has an interchange with Zane Street. <a href="U.S.%20Route%2040%20in%20West%20Virginia">US 40</a> and become <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrent</a> with I-70 at this interchange, before traveling east toward the <a href="Fort%20Henry%20Bridge">Fort Henry Bridge</a>. The bridge crosses the main channel of the river and the <a href="Greater%20Wheeling%20Trail">Greater Wheeling Trail</a>, a <a href="rail%20trail">rail trail</a> that parallels the eastern banks of the river. Elevated above the city of Wheeling, a complex interchange provides access to the downtown area and <a href="Benwood%2C%20West%20Virginia">Benwood</a>. Traveling eastbound, US 40 departs the freeway at this interchange and becomes concurrent with <a href="West%20Virginia%20Route%202">West Virginia Route 2</a> (WV 2) northbound. US 40 and WV 2 travel through downtown Wheeling on a <a href="one-way%20pair">one-way pair</a>, the southbound lanes passing under I-70 and the northbound lanes passing over I-70. After the interchange, I-70 enters the approximately <a href="Wheeling%20Tunnel">Wheeling Tunnel</a> which passes through Wheeling Hill. Immediately east of the tunnel, a <a href="Interchange%20%28road%29%23Directional%20T%20interchange">directional T interchange</a> provides access to WV 2 southbound near homes north of the highway. US 250 departs I-70 at this interchange. A <a href="stub%20ramp">stub ramp</a> present at this interchange would have carried WV 2 north of I-70 had it been extended.
As I-70 curves to the south, it intersects US 40 and with the ramps from the eastbound lanes of US 40 and WV 88 crossing underneath I-70, parallel to <a href="Wheeling%20Creek%20%28West%20Virginia%29">Wheeling Creek</a>. The interchange just west of the Wheeling Tunnel and this interchange are complicated by the fact that both are abutted by hills. <a href="Wheeling%20Jesuit%20University">Wheeling Jesuit University's</a> southeastern border is formed by the freeway as I-70 approaches the neighborhood of <a href="Elm%20Grove%2C%20West%20Virginia">Elm Grove</a>. Washington Avenue provides access to the college as the highway continues south before meeting the eastern terminus of I-470, which is a <a href="bypass%20%28road%29">bypass</a> of Wheeling and the only auxiliary interstate highway in West Virginia. Between the directional T interchange and I-470, I-70 is paralleled by the eastern branch of the Greater Wheeling Trail. A final interchange within Wheeling <a href="city%20limits">city limits</a> provides access to US 40 and WV 88. Leaving the city, the highway turns further east and enters a deep valley. The highway climbs over Two-Mile Hill, and intersects Cabela Drive (County Route 65), which provides access to <a href="The%20Highlands%20%28Wheeling%2C%20West%20Virginia%29">The Highlands</a>, a large shopping destination. Past The Highlands, I-70 continues northeast though woodlands to an interchange with the Dallas Pike (County Route 41). I-70 passes north of the <a href="Bear%20Rock%20Lakes%20Wildlife%20Management%20Area">Bear Rock Lakes Wildlife Management Area</a> before crossing the <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> state line into <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Pennsylvania">Washington County</a> southwest of <a href="West%20Alexander%2C%20Pennsylvania">West Alexander</a>.

Out of the ten states I-70 passes through, the segment in West Virginia is the shortest. By comparison, the longest stretch of I-70 through a single state is the segment in <a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>. Every year, the <a href="West%20Virginia%20Department%20of%20Transportation">West Virginia Department of Transportation</a> (WVDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2012, WVDOT calculated that as few as 27,000 vehicles traveled over the Fort Henry Bridge over the Ohio River, and as many as 53,000 vehicles used the highway near its junction with US 40 in Elm Grove. These counts are of the portion of the freeway in West Virginia and are not reflective of the entire Interstate. As part of the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a>, the entire route is listed on the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a system of roads that are important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

The first recorded road to reach what was then Wheeling, Virginia, was a <a href="post%20road">post road</a> linking it with <a href="Morgantown%2C%20West%20Virginia">Morgantown</a>, to the southeast. The post road was completed in 1794. The <a href="National%20Road">National Road</a> was the first interstate road that served Wheeling, linking the town to <a href="Cumberland%2C%20Maryland">Cumberland</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, in the east. The National Road started construction under order of then President <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> in 1806 and was completed in 1818. In 1926 the <a href="United%20States%20Numbered%20Highway%20System">United States Numbered Highway System</a> was established, and the National Road through the Northern Panhandle was <a href="numbered%20highways%20in%20the%20United%20States">designated</a> US 40. US 40 linked <a href="Vallejo%2C%20California">Vallejo, California</a>, in the west to <a href="Atlantic%20City%2C%20New%20Jersey">Atlantic City, New Jersey</a>, in the east. Passage of the <a href="Federal%20Aid%20Highway%20Act%20of%201956">Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956</a> formed the Interstate Highway System, designating as I-70 a then unconstructed <a href="controlled-access%20highway">controlled-access highway</a> across the panhandle by 1957. Since it was constructed as a separate controlled-access highway, much of I-70 is separate from the old National Road and US 40.
The first portion of what is now known as I-70 to be completed across West Virginia was the Fort Henry Bridge across the main channel of the Ohio River, built in 1955. WVDOT began obtaining <a href="right-of-way%20%28transportation%29">right-of-way</a> for I-70 in 1961. The Wheeling Tunnel, linking downtown Wheeling and the Fort Henry Bridge to the eastern suburb of Elm Grove, was completed in 1967 at a cost of $7 million (equivalent to $ in ). The bridge that carries I-70 from the Ohio state line onto Wheeling Island was completed in 1968. Construction of I-70 across the panhandle was almost completed in September 1971, with only one of the two <a href="carriageway">carriageway</a>s completed in the final segment of freeway near Elm Grove. Then Governor <a href="Arch%20A.%20Moore%2C%20Jr.">Arch A. Moore, Jr.</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senator">Senator</a> <a href="Jennings%20Randolph">Jennings Randolph</a> were present for the opening of this $17 million (equivalent to $ in ) portion of freeway. The second carriageway was completed by the end of 1971.

The Fort Henry Bridge, the <a href="Interstate%20470%20Bridge">Vietnam Veterans Memorial Bridge</a> (which carries <a href="Interstate%20470%20%28Ohio%E2%80%93West%20Virginia%29">I-470</a>), and the <a href="Wheeling%20Suspension%20Bridge">Wheeling Suspension Bridge</a> were all closed in January 2005, stopping any traffic from Ohio or Wheeling Island from entering mainland West Virginia for a few days because barges broke loose during heavy flooding along the Ohio River. The Wheeling Tunnel was closed for reconstruction work in 2007, 2008, and 2010, causing motorists who wished to travel through on I-70 to detour. The two detour routes were city streets in downtown Wheeling and the I-470 loop.

After traffic issues during the 2008 reconstruction work on the Wheeling Tunnel, local politicians suggested closing the twin tunnels altogether and building the freeway over Wheeling Hill instead. After opposition from the <a href="National%20Association%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Colored%20People">National Association for the Advancement of Colored People</a>, which represented the affected Wheeling Hill residents, the suggestions were dropped. The cost of completing the tunnel replacement project was estimated at between $60 and $80 million. The total $13.7 million cost of the tunnel reconstruction project was over double the original bid of $5.7 million, due in part to the work delays.

Broad Ripple Park Carousel

Broad Ripple Park Carousel is an antique <a href="carousel">carousel</a> in <a href="The%20Children%27s%20Museum%20of%20Indianapolis">The Children's Museum of Indianapolis</a>. It was installed in 1917 at <a href="White%20City%20%28Indianapolis%29">an amusement park</a> near the <a href="White%20River%20%28Indiana%29">White River</a> in <a href="Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana">Indianapolis, Indiana</a>, where it remained until the building housing it collapsed in 1956. The ride's mechanism was destroyed, but the animals were relatively unscathed and put into storage by the park's owners, the <a href="Indianapolis%20Department%20of%20Parks%20and%20Recreation">Indianapolis Department of Parks and Recreation</a>. The animals were carved by the <a href="Dentzel%20Carousel%20Company">Dentzel Carousel Company</a> some time before 1900 but were assembled by the <a href="William%20F.%20Mangels">William F. Mangels</a> carousel company, which also supplied the engine powering the ride.

The Children's Museum of Indianapolis acquired its first two carved animals from the ride in 1965, and the last few wooden animals in 1973. The museum planned to sell some to finance the restoration of others until the director of the museum, Mildred Compton, was convinced by carousel enthusiasts that the museum should instead restore all the animals and recreate the working carousel. Restoration of the carved animals began in 1966 and was only finished with the restoration of the entire carousel in 1977. No space had been allocated for the display of such a large exhibit in the museum's planned new building, which meant some re-designing was necessary to allow its installation on the fifth floor. A 1919 <a href="Wurlitzer">Wurlitzer</a> <a href="Fairground%20Organ">band organ</a> model #146-B, a type manufactured only for carousels, was also installed. As restored, the carousel is wide and has a total of 42 animals, including – as well as the usual horses – goats, giraffes, deer, a lion, and a tiger. It was designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> in 1987.

The Broad Ripple Park Carousel was installed in 1917 in an amusement park on the outskirts of Indianapolis, Indiana. The <a href="White%20City%20%28Indianapolis%29">White City Amusement Park</a> had been established in 1906 in what is now <a href="Broad%20Ripple%20Village">Broad Ripple Village</a>, alongside the White River. In 1908 a fire caused damage throughout the park, and only the swimming pool remained unscathed. The park closed for three years until its purchase by the <a href="Union%20Traction%20Company">Union Traction Company</a>, which restored it and operated it for eleven years. The carousel was installed during the Union Traction Company's ownership. The park was sold in May 1922 to the new Broad Ripple Amusement Park Association, and renamed Broad Ripple Park. In 1927 the park was sold again, and changed hands once more in 1938. The Board of Parks Commission of Indianapolis bought the property on May 18, 1945, paying $131,500 (approximately $ as of 2019) for the tract, and turned the property into a general-use park, destroying all rides it could not sell. The board's original plan was to sell the carousel and the narrow-gauge railway rides. Only the carousel remained in Indianapolis after it was unsold; the steam locomotive is now at the <a href="Indiana%20Transportation%20Museum">Indiana Transportation Museum</a> at <a href="Noblesville%2C%20Indiana">Noblesville, Indiana</a>.

The carousel was commissioned by William Hubbs, who had it installed in White City Amusement Park in 1917. Built on a Mangel-Illions mechanism, it used animals carved by the Dentzel carousel company of <a href="Philadelphia%2C%20Pennsylvania">Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>, sometime before 1900. The carousel was assembled by the William F. Mangels carousel company in 1917. It was probably not the first carousel in the park, as there are indications of a previous ride that came from <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>.

Nothing is known of the history of the animals before their installation in the 1917 carousel assembly. During the 1960s newspaper reports stated that it was believed that the animals had arrived in Indianapolis in 1917, imported from Germany by two brothers named Mangels, but later research revealed the animals were manufactured by the Dentzel carousel company. Also included in the installation were oil paintings on the canopy over the animals and mechanism.

Part of the installation appears to have involved the retrofitting of some animals to fit the Mangels mechanism. During this process some of the animals, which were carved in stationary or standing positions and thus not meant to be "jumpers" (animals that moved up and down), were modified to allow them to move.

Between 1917 and 1938 the carousel was located near the White City park pool, in an enclosed building with numerous large windows. In 1938, after the park was purchased by William McCurry, the ride was enclosed within an unwalled pavilion with a domed roof and moved to the area of the park set aside as a children's playground. The carousel was operated as a <a href="Concession%20%28contract%29">concession</a>, which one operator, William Hubbs, held for almost 10 years.

The park district does not appear to have moved the carousel after taking over in 1945, as a 1955 newspaper article noted it was still in the same spot it had occupied for 38 years. The carousel was again operated as a concession within the park, this time by the wife of Everett DuBois, the park superintendent. Like Hubbs, Mrs. DuBois operated the carousel for almost 10 years. Although the district did not change the ride's location, it noted in 1955 that the equipment was showing its age. In 1955 the park district attempted to paint over the oil paintings on the canopy, which had deteriorated. The <a href="Indianapolis%20Art%20Center">Indianapolis Art League</a> objected, and volunteered to restore the original paintings rather than have them painted over with <a href="List%20of%20Disney%20animated%20characters">Disney character</a>s.

The domed pavilion housing the mechanism collapsed in 1956, destroying the mechanism and the sweeps that supported the animals. The park district disposed of the destroyed mechanical parts and stored the animals. In 1961 the giraffes, along with other animals from the carousel, were used in a Christmas display at <a href="University%20Park%20%28Indianapolis%2C%20Indiana%29%23University%20Park">University Park</a> in Indianapolis. During this time, discussions began between the park district and the <a href="Indianapolis%20Zoological%20Society">Indianapolis Zoological Society</a> about the possibility of the Zoological Society acquiring the animals for use in its children's zoo section. In April 1962 newspaper reports stated that the animals were to be donated to the zoo, for installation in the main zoo; the zoo planned to purchase a smaller merry-go-round for the children's zoo. The animals were apparently still being offered to the zoo in December 1963, as a newspaper story announced that the park district had just given the zoo authorization to use the carousel parts, and volunteers were being sought to restore the animals. The president of the Zoological Society described the animals as "bigger and more realistically colored, and more intricately detailed, sturdier, and they have more different kinds of animals than that aluminum junk they throw out today".

In 1965 The Children's Museum of Indianapolis, then located in a building at 30th and Meridian Streets, acquired two horses from the carousel. Mildred Compton, the museum director, had seen the carousel in Broad Ripple Park before 1952, and hoped to secure the surviving animals, but the park district was initially unwilling to part with more than two, as the district was using five or six animals in the annual Christmas displays at <a href="Monument%20Circle">Monument Circle</a>. During the first half of 1966, the two horses were refinished by a museum volunteer. Both were stripped of old paint, one was repainted, and the other was refinished with lemon oil to feature the carvings on the animal. Compton obtained real horse tails from an Indianapolis slaughterhouse to replace the lost originals. By September 1966 the two horses were ready for display in the museum's front entrance.

The park district allowed the museum to use one of the surviving giraffes in a booth at a fall festival held at the <a href="Indianapolis%20Museum%20of%20Art">Indianapolis Museum of Art</a> in 1968. The museum subsequently acquired most of the remaining animals in 1969, after a search through the storage building containing the animals. The animals and parts of animals had to be searched for in corners and under boxes in the park district storage building. Besides a large number of horses, 2 more giraffes, a lion, and a tiger were found. Photographs of the animals were sent to Frederic Fried, an expert in carousels, who confirmed that the animals were made in the United States, not Germany, probably before 1900. He also confirmed that they were carved by the Dentzel company.

The museum intended to keep a few of the animals and sell the others to finance its operations, but Mildred Compton returned from a visit to the 1973 National Carousel Roundtable convinced that it should instead restore all of them and recreate the working carousel in its planned new building. But no space had been allocated to allow the display of such a large exhibit, requiring the plans to be adjusted. Columns required in the original layout were removed to allow the carousel's installation on the fifth floor.

While plans were under way to secure funding for the restoration of the carousel, efforts were made to find some missing animals. By studying old photographs of the carousel, it was determined there had been three deer or stags which had not been found in the park district storage building. No one at the park district knew of their whereabouts, and some employees believed the animals had disintegrated. As well as the missing deer, two horses were missing. The museum contacted local newspapers, which published stories on the efforts to restore the carousel. The reports mentioned the missing animals, and that the museum was trying to locate them. An anonymous tip received in December 1973 revealed the deer were used in the annual Christmas Gift and Hobby Show, where they served as escorts for Santa Claus. Compton was able to secure the animals from the park district for the museum.

The mechanical parts were assembled in the fifth-floor area in November 1975, using a non-original Mangel-Illions mechanism. A Wurlitzer carousel organ, which had belonged to an amusement park in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, was added. Before it was installed in the Children's Museum, the organ was refurbished and rebuilt by Carval Stoots of <a href="Plainfield%2C%20Indiana">Plainfield, Indiana</a>, in 1976.

An artist from Pennsylvania recreated the upper outside panels in the style of the carousels of the period around the time of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. The carvings on the panels were provided by Allen and Rita Orre of Ohio and the International Amusement Devices Company of Ohio; the mirrors were produced by an Indianapolis glass firm. The scenery panels were initially some discovered Dentzel company panels, and these were used in 1976 and 1977 while replica Mangels-Illions-style panels were built in the museum's shops.

The animals were restored between 1975 and 1977 by Bill and Caroline Von Stein of <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>. The Von Steins were experienced with other types of museum conservation work, but had never restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, no attempt was made to restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.

The original engine propelling the carousel was a <a href="belt%20%28mechanical%29">belt-driven</a> mechanism, but after the initial restoration it was exchanged for a <a href="Hydraulic%20drive%20system">fluid drive</a> provided by the Kissell Brothers Amusement Rides company of Cincinnati, Ohio, who suggested the platform for the carousel be improved. To provide crowd control, a pavilion was built over the carousel and a ticket booth was installed. Neither was based on any extant buildings, but each was a composite of several other structures. The animals are removed one at a time from the carousel for routine maintenance and refurbishment, which is carried out in the museum's own shops.

The carousel was designated a National Historic Landmark on February 27, 1987, and the National Historic Landmarks Program assessed its condition as "satisfactory" in 2008. The carousel is one of the largest displayed artifacts in the museum, and is available to be ridden by visitors.

The carousel features a <a href="QR%20code">QR code</a> as part of the museum's involvement in the <a href="QRpedia">QRpedia</a> project. Visitors may scan the code with a suitable <a href="mobile%20device">mobile device</a> and will be served the <a href="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a> article about it, in whatever language their device is set to use, if available.

The carousel is one of the three oldest surviving Dentzel menagerie carousels. Thirty-one of its 42 wood-carved animals are horses, 17 standing and 14 jumping. There are also three goats, three giraffes, three deer, one lion, and one tiger. The single lion and tiger are typical of Dentzel-created carousels, as are the three giraffes; Gustav Dentzel's love of that animal resulted in all of his carousels including at least one row of giraffes. The animals are arranged in three circles around the central mechanism, alternating leaping or jumping horses with stationary animals. Typical for a Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, there are 18 jumping animals, all but one of which is original; the horse that could not be found in 1975 was replaced with another Dentzel horse. Although the animals were not originally carved to display jewels, at some point they were so displayed at the amusement park, and thus the museum restored the animals on the outside circle with jewels.

The mechanism powering the ride is a diameter Mangels-Illions manufactured carousel, but it is uncertain whether this exactly matches the original Mangels-Illions mechanism. The whole assembly has a diameter of . The organ, a 1919 Wurlitzer carousel organ model #146-B, is of a type designed specifically for carousels.

Fork-marked lemur

Fork-marked lemurs or fork-crowned lemurs are <a href="Strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine</a> primates; the four <a href="species">species</a> comprise the <a href="genus">genus</a> Phaner. Like all <a href="lemur">lemur</a>s, they are native to <a href="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, where they are found only in the west, north, and east sides of the island. They are named for the two black stripes which run up from the eyes, converge on the top of the head, and run down the back as a single black stripe. They were originally placed in the <a href="Ring-tailed%20lemur">genus "Lemur"</a> in 1839, later moved between the genera "<a href="Dwarf%20lemur">Cheirogaleus</a>" and "<a href="Mouse%20lemur">Microcebus</a>", and given their own genus in 1870 by <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a>. Only one species ("<a href="Masoala%20fork-marked%20lemur">Phaner furcifer</a>") was recognized, until three subspecies described in 1991 were promoted to species status in 2001. New species may yet be identified, particularly in northeast Madagascar.

Fork-marked lemurs are among the least studied of all lemurs and are some of the largest members of the family <a href="Cheirogaleidae">Cheirogaleidae</a>, weighing around or more. They are the most <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> distinct of the cheirogaleids, and considered a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> to the rest of the family. Aside from their <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">dorsal</a> forked stripe, they have dark rings around their eyes, and large membranous ears. Males have a <a href="scent%20gland">scent gland</a> on their throat, but only use it during <a href="social%20grooming">social grooming</a>, not for marking territory. Instead, they are very vocal, making repeated calls at the beginning and end of the night. Like the other members of their family, they are <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a>, and sleep in tree holes and nests during the day. <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behaviour%23Monogamy">Monogamous pairing</a> is typical for fork-marked lemurs, and females are dominant. Females are thought to have only one offspring every two years or more.

These species live in a wide variety of habitats, ranging from <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry%20broadleaf%20forests">dry deciduous forests</a> to <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s, and run <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedally</a> across branches. Their diet consists primarily of tree <a href="Natural%20gum">gum</a> and other <a href="exudate">exudate</a>s, though they may obtain some of their <a href="protein">protein</a> and <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a> by hunting small <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s later at night. Three of the four species are <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a> and the other is listed as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>. Their populations are in decline due to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a>. Like all lemurs, they are protected against commercial trade under <a href="CITES%23Appendix%20I">CITES Appendix I</a>.

Fork-marked lemurs were first documented in 1839 by <a href="Henri%20Marie%20Ducrotay%20de%20Blainville">Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville</a> when he <a href="Species%20description">described</a> the <a href="Masoala%20fork-marked%20lemur">Masoala fork-marked lemur</a> ("P. furcifer") as "Lemur furcifer". The <a href="holotype">holotype</a> is thought to be MNHN 1834-136, a female specimen taken from Madagascar by French naturalist <a href="Justin%20Goudot">Justin Goudot</a>. The source of this specimen is unknown, but thought to be <a href="Antongil%20Bay">Antongil Bay</a>. In 1850, <a href="Isidore%20Geoffroy%20Saint-Hilaire">Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire</a> moved the fork-marked lemurs to the genus "Cheirogaleus" (<a href="dwarf%20lemur">dwarf lemur</a>s), but they were also commonly listed in the genus "Microcebus" (<a href="mouse%20lemur">mouse lemur</a>s). In 1870, <a href="John%20Edward%20Gray">John Edward Gray</a> assigned fork-marked lemurs to their own genus, "Phaner", after initially including them and the mouse lemurs in the genus "Lepilemur" (<a href="sportive%20lemur">sportive lemur</a>s). Although French naturalist <a href="Alfred%20Grandidier">Alfred Grandidier</a> accepted Gray's new genus (while also lumping the other cheirogaleids in "Cheirogaleus" and illustrating the <a href="Skull">cranial</a> similarities between cheirogaleids and "Lepilemur") in 1897, the genus "Phaner" was not widely accepted. In the early 1930s, <a href="Ernst%20Schwarz%20%28zoologist%29">Ernst Schwarz</a>, <a href="Guillaume%20Grandidier">Guillaume Grandidier</a>, and others resurrected the name, citing characteristics that were intermediate between "Cheirogaleus" and "Microcebus".

Until the late 20th century, there was only one recognized species of fork-marked lemur, although size and coloration differences had been noted previously. After comparing museum specimens, paleoanthropologist <a href="Ian%20Tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a> and physical anthropologist <a href="Colin%20Groves">Colin Groves</a> recognized three new subspecies in 1991: the <a href="Pale%20fork-marked%20lemur">Pale fork-marked lemur</a> ("P. f. pallescens"), <a href="Pariente%27s%20fork-marked%20lemur">Pariente's fork-marked lemur</a> ("P. f. parienti"), and the <a href="Amber%20Mountain%20fork-marked%20lemur">Amber Mountain fork-marked lemur</a> ("P. f. electromontis"). In 2001, Groves elevated all four subspecies to species status based on noticeable color, size, and body proportion differences between the fragmented populations. Although Tattersall disagreed with this promotion, citing inadequate information for the decision, the arrangement is generally accepted.

In December 2010, <a href="Russell%20Mittermeier">Russell Mittermeier</a> of <a href="Conservation%20International">Conservation International</a> and conservation geneticist <a href="Edward%20E.%20Louis%2C%20Jr.">Edward E. Louis, Jr.</a> announced the possibility of a new species of fork-marked lemur in the protected area of <a href="Daraina">Daraina</a> in northeast Madagascar. In October, a specimen was observed, captured, and released, although genetic tests have yet to determine if it is a new species. The specimen demonstrated a slightly different color pattern from other fork-marked lemur species. If shown to be a new species, they plan to name it after <a href="Fanamby">Fanamby</a>, a key conservation organization working in that protected forest.

The etymology of the genus "Phaner" puzzled researchers for many years. Gray often created mysterious and unexplained <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic names</a>. In 1904, <a href="Theodore%20Sherman%20Palmer">Theodore Sherman Palmer</a> attempted to document the etymologies of all mammalian taxa, but could not definitively explain the origins of the generic name "Phaner", noting only that it derived from the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> φανερός ("phaneros") meaning "visible, evident". In 2012, Alex Dunkel, Jelle Zijlstra, and Groves attempted to solve the mystery. Following some initial speculation, a search of the general literature published around 1870 revealed the source: the British comedy "<a href="The%20Palace%20of%20Truth">The Palace of Truth</a>" by <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>, which premiered in London on 19 November 1870, nearly one and a half weeks prior to the date written on the preface of Gray's manuscript (also published in London). The comedy featured characters bearing three names: King Phanor (sic), Mirza, and Azema. Since the genera "Mirza" (<a href="giant%20mouse%20lemur">giant mouse lemur</a>s) and "Azema" (for "<a href="Brown%20mouse%20lemur">M. rufus</a>", now a synonym for "Microcebus") were both described in the same publication and equally enigmatic, the authors concluded that Gray had seen the comedy and then based the names of three lemur genera on its characters.

Fork-marked lemurs were called "fork-marked dwarf lemurs" by <a href="Henry%20Ogg%20Forbes">Henry Ogg Forbes</a> in 1894 and "fork-crowned mouse lemur" by English missionary and naturalist <a href="James%20Sibree">James Sibree</a> in 1895. Literature searches by Dunkel "et al." also uncovered other names, such as "fork-lined lemur" and "squirrel lemur", during the early 1900s. By the 1970s, reference to dwarf and mouse lemurs had ended, and the "fork-crowned" prefix became popular between 1960 and 2001. Since then, the "fork-marked" prefix has become more widely used. These lemurs get their <a href="common%20name">common name</a> from the distinctive forked stripe on their head.

Within the family <a href="Cheirogaleidae">Cheirogaleidae</a>, fork-marked lemurs are the most <a href="Phylogenetics">phylogenetically</a> distinct, although their placement remained uncertain until recently. One uniting characteristic (<a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphy</a>) among all cheirogaleids, to the exclusion of other lemurs, is the branching of the <a href="Common%20carotid%20artery">carotid artery</a> along with how it enters the skull—a trait which is shared by fork-marked lemurs. Analyses based on <a href="Morphology%20%28biology%29">morphology</a>, <a href="immunology">immunology</a>, and <a href="Repeated%20sequence%20%28DNA%29">repetitive DNA</a> have given contradictory placements of "Phaner", while studies in 2001 and 2008 either lacked data or yielded poor resolution of their placement.

A study in 2009 of seven <a href="Mitochondrial%20DNA">mitochondrial genes</a> (mtDNA) and three <a href="Nuclear%20DNA">nuclear genes</a> grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering a host of explanations, such as a possible hybridization (<a href="introgression">introgression</a>) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43 morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae <a href="Paraphyly">paraphyletic</a>. Broad agreement between two <a href="Evolution%20of%20lemurs">lemur phylogeny</a> studies—one in 2004 using <a href="Retrotransposon%23SINEs">SINE</a> analysis and another in 2012 using <a href="Locus%20%28genetics%29">multilocus</a> phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a> relationship between fork-marked lemurs and the rest of the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between "Phaner" and the rest of the cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38 <a href="myr">mya</a> (million years ago), not long after the <a href="Adaptive%20radiation">radiation</a> of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43 mya.

Of the mostly small, <a href="Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> lemurs in family Cheirogaleidae, the genus "Phaner" contains some of the largest species, along with "Cheirogaleus". Their body weight ranges between , and their head-body length averages between , with a tail length between .

Fork-marked lemurs' <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">dorsal</a> (back) fur is either light brown or light grayish-brown, while their <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23Dorsal%20and%20ventral">ventral</a> (underside) fur can be yellow, cream, white, or pale brown. A black stripe extends from the tail, along the dorsal midline to the head, where it forks at the top of the head in a distinguishing Y-shape leading to the dark rings around both eyes, and sometimes extends down the snout. The dorsal stripe varies in width and darkness. The base of the tail is the same color as the dorsal fur and is usually tipped in black; the tail is bushy. The lemurs' ears are relatively large and membranous. Males have a <a href="scent%20gland">scent gland</a> on the middle of their <a href="Gular%20skin">throat</a>, which is approximately wide and pink in color. Females have a narrow, bare patch of white skin in the same location, but theirs does not appear to produce secretions.
These lemurs have relatively long hindlegs. For gripping tree trunks and large branches, they have large hands and feet with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the <a href="Natural%20gum">gum</a> and <a href="nectar">nectar</a>, as well as a long <a href="caecum">caecum</a>, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) <a href="Lemuriformes">lemuriform</a> <a href="toothcomb">toothcomb</a> (formed by the lower <a href="incisor">incisor</a>s and <a href="Canine%20tooth">canines</a>) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.

The genus is distinguished from other cheirogaleids by the toothrows on its <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a> (upper jaw), which are parallel and do not converge towards the front of the mouth. The fork-marked lemur <a href="Dentition%23Dental%20formula">dental formula</a> is ; on each side of the mouth, top and bottom, there are two incisors, one canine, three <a href="premolar">premolar</a>s, and three <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29">molar</a>s—a total of 36 teeth. Their upper first incisor (I) is long and curved towards the middle of the mouth (unique among lemurs), while the second upper incisor (I) is small with a gap (<a href="diastema">diastema</a>) between the two. The upper canines are large, with their tips curved. Their upper <a href="Anatomical%20terms%20of%20location%23anterior%20and%20posterior">anterior</a> premolars (P) are caniniform (canine-shaped) and more pronounced than in any other living lemur. The next upper premolar (P) is very small, with a single, pointed <a href="Cusp%20%28anatomy%29">cusp</a> that contacts the lingual cingulum (a crest or ridge on the tongue side), which circles the base of the tooth. The two cusps on the last upper premolar (P) are a large <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29%23Morphology">paracone</a> and a smaller <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29%23Morphology">protocone</a>. Like other cheirogaleids, their first lower premolar (P) is caniniform and large, while the cingulids (ridges) on the three lower premolars are more developed compared to most other cheirogaleids. The first two upper molars (M) have a developed <a href="Molar%20%28tooth%29%23Morphology">hypocone</a>, and the buccal cingulum (a crest or ridge on the cheek side) is well developed on all three upper molars. The molars are relatively small compared to other cheirogaleids, with the second upper and lower molars (M and M) having reduced functionality compared to those of mouse lemurs.

Males have relatively small <a href="Testicle">testes</a> compared to other lemurs, and their canine teeth are the same size as those seen in females. During the <a href="dry%20season">dry season</a>, females can weigh more than males. Both patterns of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> are consistent with the theory of <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> for <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behaviour%23Monogamy">monogamous species</a> and female dominance respectively. Females have two pairs of <a href="nipple">nipple</a>s.

Fork-marked lemurs are found in the west, north, and east of Madagascar, but their distribution is discontinuous. Their habitat ranges from <a href="Tropical%20and%20subtropical%20dry%20broadleaf%20forests">dry deciduous forests</a> on the western coast of the island to <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> in the east. They are also commonly found in <a href="secondary%20forest">secondary forest</a>, but not in areas lacking continuous forest cover. They are most common in the west of the island. Fork-marked lemurs are not found in the southern <a href="Madagascar%20spiny%20forests">spiny forests</a> in the dry southern part of the island, and only recently have been reported from the southeastern rainforest at <a href="Andohahela%20National%20Park">Andohahela National Park</a>, though this has not been confirmed. A team led by E. E. Louis Jr. has suggested that undescribed varieties may also exist elsewhere on the island.

The Masoala fork-marked lemur is found on the <a href="Masoala%20Peninsula">Masoala Peninsula</a> in the northeast of the island, while the Amber Mountain fork-marked lemur is located in the far north of the island, particularly at <a href="Amber%20Mountain%20National%20Park">Amber Mountain National Park</a>. Pariente's fork-marked lemur is found in the <a href="Sambirano%20region">Sambirano region</a> in the northwest, and the pale fork-marked lemur is in the west of the island.

Fork-marked lemurs are among the least studied of all lemurs, and little is known about them. Only the pale fork-marked lemur ("P. pallescens") has been studied relatively well, primarily by Pierre Charles-Dominique, <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Petter">Jean-Jacques Petter</a>, and Georges Pariente during two expeditions in the 1970s and a more extensive 1998 study in <a href="Kirindy%20Forest">Kirindy Forest</a>. Like the other cheirogaleids, these lemurs are nocturnal, sleeping in tree hollows (typically in large <a href="Adansonia">baobab trees</a>) or abandoned nests built by giant mouse lemurs ("Mirza coquereli") during the day. Some of the abandoned nests they sleep in are leaf-lined, and fresh leaves are often added when young are born. As many as 30 sleeping sites may be used over the course of a year, each for a variable length of time.

At night, fork-marked lemurs visit the feeding sites within their range by running <a href="Quadrupedalism">quadrupedally</a> across branches at high speed over long distances, leaping from tree to tree without pausing. They have been seen on the ground (typically during chases following fights) and as high as , but they are typically seen running along branches at a height of . While running, they can leap horizontally between tree branches without losing height or as much as while falling a short distance.

Fork-marked lemurs are sensitive to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again on their way to their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their <a href="Tapetum%20lucidum">eye shine</a> creates a unique pattern among lemurs because they tend to bob their heads up and down and from side to side.

These lemurs are <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, with territory size dependent upon food availability, though territories typically cover . Because of their fast movement, individuals can easily defend their territories by traversing it within 5 minutes. Territory overlap is minimal between males, and the same pattern is seen in females, though males and females may overlap their territories. In areas where territory overlap occurs ("meeting areas"), several neighbors may gather and vocalize together without aggression. Multiple family groups may gather in these meeting areas, and females will often socialize with the other females and young. Unlike other lemurs, fork-marked lemurs do not scent-mark, and instead use vocalizations during territorial confrontations. They are considered very vocal animals, and have a complex range of calls. On average, males make approximately 30 loud calls per hour, and are most vocal at dusk and dawn. Their high-pitched, whistling calls help researchers identify them in the field. As well as their stress call and fighting call, they emit a "Hon" call (contact call between male-female pairs), "Ki" and "Kiu" calls (more excited contact calls that identify the caller), and a "Kea" call (a loud call shared between males in adjacent territories). Females also make a ""bleating"" call when they have infants.

Males and females have been seen sleeping and <a href="Forage">foraging</a> together as monogamous pairs, although <a href="Animal%20sexual%20behaviour">polygamy</a> and solitary behavior has also been observed. At Kirindy Forest, pairs were observed staying together for multiple seasons, though they were only seen foraging alone, with most interactions resulting from conflicts over feeding sites. Nest sharing among pairs occurs one out of every three days. During <a href="social%20grooming">social grooming</a> (allogrooming), the male allomarks females using a scent gland on the throat, and grooming sessions can last several minutes. While feeding, females appear to be dominant, gaining first access to food. Females are also dominant over non-resident males, indicating true female dominance, comparable to that seen in the <a href="ring-tailed%20lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a> ("Lemur catta").

Mating has been observed to take place at the end of the dry season, in early November, and births were inferred between late February and early March. Only one infant is born per season, despite females having two pairs of nipples. Infants are initially parked in unguarded tree holes while the mother forages. Older infants have not been observed clinging to the mother, and as they get older, they are parked in vegetation until they can move independently. Females <a href="Lactation">produce milk</a> for two years following the birth of the young. The offspring may remain under the care of their parents for three years or more, and there is no information about their <a href="Biological%20dispersal">dispersal</a> at maturity. Females have not been observed giving birth in consecutive years.

These lemurs have a specialized diet of tree gums and <a href="Plant%20sap">sap</a>. Their diet consists mainly of gum from trees in the genus "<a href="Terminalia%20%28plant%29">Terminalia</a>" (known locally as "Talinala"), which are often <a href="Parasitism">parasitized</a> by beetle <a href="larva">larva</a>e that burrow beneath the bark. Fork-marked lemurs either consume the gum as it seeps from cracks in the bark of parasitized trees or gouge open the bark with their toothcomb to scoop it up directly with their long tongue. Between March and May, gums compose the majority of the diet. They have also been documented eating gums from "<a href="Commiphora">Commiphora</a>" species and "<a href="Colvillea%20racemosa">Colvillea racemosa</a>", bud <a href="exudate">exudate</a>s from "<a href="Zanthoxylum%20tsihanimposa">Zanthoxylum tsihanimposa</a>", sap from baobab trees ("Adansonia" species), nectar from "<a href="Crateva%20greveana">Crateva greveana</a>" flowers, the sugary excretions from bugs (family <a href="Machaerotidae">Machaerotidae</a>) which feed on trees of the genus "<a href="Rhopalocarpus">Rhopalocarpus</a>", and very small amounts of fruit. Although fork-marked lemurs have widely varied forest habitat, gum and other plant exudates of other species are likely to dominate their diet. They are not known to <a href="Aestivation">estivate</a> or accumulate fat reserves for the dry season.
To meet their <a href="protein">protein</a> requirements and obtain <a href="nitrogen">nitrogen</a>, these lemurs also hunt small <a href="arthropod">arthropod</a>s. In captivity, "P. furcifer" strongly favored <a href="Mantis">preying mantises</a> and <a href="moth">moth</a>s of the family <a href="Sphingidae">Sphingidae</a> while ignoring <a href="grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s, larva of the moth genus "<a href="Coeloptera">Coeloptera</a>", and small <a href="reptile">reptile</a>s. Hunting usually occurs later at night, following gum collection, and typically happens in the canopy or on tree trunks. Insects are captured by rapidly grasping them with the hands, a stereotypic behavior seen in other members of their family, as well as <a href="galago">galago</a>s. The exudates of several tree species they are known to feed on are high in protein, so some fork-marked lemurs may meet their protein requirements without preying on insects.

Other nocturnal lemurs are <a href="Sympatry">sympatric</a> with fork-marked lemurs. In western Madagascar, <a href="interspecific%20competition">interspecific competition</a> is reduced by restricting activity to specific levels of the <a href="Canopy%20%28biology%29">canopy</a>, such as using only the highest sleeping sites at least above the ground. Competition with other cheirogaleids, such as the <a href="gray%20mouse%20lemur">gray mouse lemur</a> ("Microcebus murinus") and <a href="Coquerel%27s%20giant%20mouse%20lemur">Coquerel's giant mouse lemur</a> ("Mirza coquereli"), is most intense for "Terminalia" gum during the dry season, but fork-marked lemurs always drive the other lemur species off. Studies of "P. pallescens" at Kirindy Forest found up to a 20% drop in body mass during the dry season despite no changes in exudate production, indicating flowers and insects have a significant impact on the species' health.

Fork-marked lemurs are thought to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the <a href="Madagascar%20owl">Madagascar owl</a> ("Asio madagascariensis"), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa ("<a href="Sanzinia%20madagascariensis">Sanzinia madagascariensis</a>"). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs exhibited <a href="Mobbing%20%28animal%20behavior%29">mobbing behavior</a> when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. <a href="Diurnality">Diurnal</a> <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a>, such as the <a href="Madagascar%20buzzard">Madagascar buzzard</a> ("Buteo brachypterus") and <a href="Madagascar%20cuckoo-hawk">Madagascar cuckoo-hawk</a> ("Aviceda madagascariensis") hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the <a href="Madagascar%20harrier-hawk">Madagascar harrier-hawk</a> ("Polyboroides radiatus") suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The <a href="Fossa%20%28animal%29">fossa</a> ("Cryptoprocta ferox") has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.

In 2012, the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN) listed "P. parienti", "P. electromontis", and "P. pallescens" as <a href="Endangered%20species">endangered</a>, and "P. furcifer" as <a href="Vulnerable%20species">vulnerable</a>. Before this assessment, it was assumed that their population was in decline due to <a href="habitat%20destruction">habitat destruction</a> for the creation of pasture and agriculture. Measures of their <a href="population%20density">population density</a> vary widely, from 50 to 550 individuals per square kilometer (250 acres), but these numbers are thought to reflect only small, gum-rich areas, and therefore only small, clustered populations with an overall low population density.

As with all lemurs, fork-marked lemurs were first protected in 1969 when they were listed as "Class A" of the <a href="African%20Convention%20on%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature%20and%20Natural%20Resources">African Convention on the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources</a>. This prohibited hunting and capture without authorization, which would only be given for scientific purposes or the national interest. They were also protected under <a href="CITES%23Appendix%20I">CITES Appendix I</a> as of 1973. This strictly regulates their trade and forbids commercial trade. Although enforcement is patchy, they are also protected under Malagasy law. Fork-marked lemurs are rarely kept in captivity, and their captive lifespan can range from 12 to 25 years.

John Wilton (general)

<a href="General%20%28Australia%29">General</a> Sir John Gordon Noel Wilton, (22 November 1910 – 10 May 1981) was a senior commander in the <a href="Australian%20Army">Australian Army</a>. He served as <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> (CGS), the Army's professional head, from 1963 until 1966, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force</a>, from 1966 until 1970. His eight-year tenure as senior officer of first the Army and then the Australian military spanned almost the entire period of the nation's <a href="Military%20history%20of%20Australia%20during%20the%20Vietnam%20War">involvement in the Vietnam War</a>.

Born in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>, Wilton entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in 1927. Owing to lack of opportunity in the Australian military at the time, he took a commission in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> following his graduation in 1930. He spent most of the remainder of the decade with the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a> in <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>. Wilton returned to Australia on the eve of World War II and was commissioned into the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Artillery">Royal Australian Artillery</a>. He saw action with the <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a> in <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">Syria</a> and the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a> in <a href="New%20Guinea%20Campaign">New Guinea</a>, earning a <a href="mention%20in%20despatches">mention in despatches</a> in the former campaign and the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> in the latter. Finishing the war a temporary <a href="colonel">colonel</a>, he was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> in 1947. Wilton was posted to <a href="Korean%20War">Korea</a> in 1953 to take command of the <a href="28th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">28th Commonwealth Brigade</a>, leading it in its <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Samichon%20River">final action of the war</a> in July. He was raised to <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> and awarded the US <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> for his performance in Korea.

Wilton was promoted to <a href="major%20general">major general</a> in 1957 and became Commandant of Duntroon. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> in 1962 and made CGS the following January, with the rank of <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a>. As CGS he oversaw a reorganisation of the Army's <a href="Division%20%28military%29">divisional</a> structure, the reintroduction of conscription, and deployments during the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia–Malaysia "Konfrontasi"</a> and the Vietnam War. Knighted in 1964, he handed over the position of CGS in May 1966 and was appointed CCOSC. In this role he had overall responsibility for Australia's forces in Vietnam, and worked to achieve an integrated defence organisation, including a <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force%20Academy">tri-services academy</a>, a <a href="Joint%20Intelligence%20Organisation%20%28Australia%29">joint intelligence group</a>, and the amalgamation of separate <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Army%20%28Australia%29">government departments for the Army</a>, <a href="Department%20of%20the%20Navy%20%28Australia%29">Navy</a> and <a href="Department%20of%20Air%20%28Australia%29">Air Force</a>. Wilton was promoted to <a href="general">general</a> in September 1968, and retired from the military in November 1970. He served as <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">Consul-General</a> in New York City from 1973 to 1975, and died in 1981, aged seventy.

John Wilton was born in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a> on 22 November 1910, the second of two sons to English migrants Noel and Muriel Wilton. Noel was an electrical engineer, and moved with his family to <a href="Hobart">Hobart</a> in 1915 to take up employment with the Tasmanian Hydro Electric Department. Attending various schools, John and his brother Maurice lived in Sydney for a time with Muriel following their parents' separation in 1917, before Noel brought them back to Hobart in 1921. In 1923 he moved with them to <a href="Grafton%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Grafton</a>, New South Wales, where he managed the Clarence River County Council. John attended Grafton High School, where he attained his <a href="leaving%20certificate">leaving certificate</a>. Considered by family to be a "loner", "a clear thinker", and a "quite, determined, achiever", he entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Duntroon">Royal Military College, Duntroon</a>, in February 1927, aged sixteen. Early on he was subjected to the usual <a href="hazing">bastardisation</a> handed out to younger cadets by seniors, but was not known to inflict the same treatment on juniors once he reached the senior class. Although somewhat aloof from his fellows, he did well in team sports such as rugby and hockey, as well as swimming and diving. Second academically in his class of twelve, Wilton graduated from Duntroon on 9 December 1930.

By 1930, the effects of the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a> had reduced the opportunities for Duntroon graduates. Only four of Wilton's classmates joined the <a href="Australian%20Military%20Forces">Australian Military Forces</a>, while four transferred to the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) and four to the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>. Wilton was among the last-mentioned, taking a commission as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> in the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>, with seniority from 22 November 1930. Seeking active duty, he requested a posting to <a href="British%20Raj">India</a>, and sailed with the <a href="6th%20%28Howitzer%29%20Brigade%20Royal%20Field%20Artillery">6th Field Brigade</a> to <a href="Bombay">Bombay</a> in November 1931. He spent the next three years based at <a href="Faizabad">Fyzabad</a>, near the Nepalese border. Promoted to <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a> in November 1933, he undertook training and exercises with his battery, and learned to speak <a href="Urdu">Urdu</a>, but saw no action. In February 1935 he was posted to <a href="British%20rule%20in%20Burma">Burma</a>, joining the 10th (<a href="Abbottabad">Abbottabad</a>) Battery of the Indian Mountain Artillery at <a href="Pyin%20U%20Lwin">Maymyo</a>, near <a href="Mandalay">Mandalay</a>. According to biographer <a href="David%20Horner">David Horner</a>, Wilton's "first taste of excitement" was in April 1935, when he joined the hunt for a rogue tiger and shot the animal as it attacked and mauled one of his companions. In November he saw operational service with his unit in skirmishes with local tribesmen in the <a href="Wa%20State">Wa State</a> of northern Burma, on the Chinese border.

After eight months extended leave in 1936, and a posting to the Indian Army Ordnance Corps, Wilton briefly returned to Australia to marry Helen Marshall on 9 July 1938 at St. Andrew's Church in <a href="Summer%20Hill%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Summer Hill</a>, New South Wales. John had met Helen, then a nurse, on a double date in Sydney while he was in his last year at Duntroon; the couple had two sons and a daughter. On the same trip home he was invited to transfer to the Australian military, and accepted. Promoted to <a href="Captain%20%28armed%20forces%29">captain</a> in December 1938, Wilton saw out his British service with a coastal battery in <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>, and was commissioned into the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Artillery">Royal Australian Artillery</a> on 26 May 1939. His service with the British Army in India and Burma had afforded him regimental experience that he could never have gained in Australia, as well as an understanding of mountainous and tropical conditions that would benefit him in years to come.

Wilton spent a year in coastal artillery posts at <a href="Sydney%20Heads">North Head</a> and <a href="Port%20Kembla%20%28New%20South%20Wales%29">Port Kembla</a> before transferring to the <a href="Second%20Australian%20Imperial%20Force">Second Australian Imperial Force</a>. He was promoted <a href="major">major</a> on 7 May 1940 and given command of a battery in the <a href="2/4th%20Field%20Regiment%20%28Australia%29">2/4th Field Regiment</a>, part of the recently formed <a href="7th%20Division%20%28Australia%29">7th Division</a>, which embarked for the <a href="Mediterranean%20and%20Middle%20East%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">Middle East</a> in October. On the voyage he wrote his wife a letter in case he was killed, admonishing: "Remember what has always been our motto—nothing can defeat us—not even death!" Appointed the division's <a href="Brigade%20Major">Brigade Major</a> Royal Artillery on 19 March 1941, Wilton served under Brigadier <a href="Frank%20Berryman">Frank Berryman</a> in the <a href="Syria-Lebanon%20Campaign">Syrian campaign</a>, and was responsible for coordinating operations during the <a href="Battle%20of%20Merdjayoun">Battle of Merdjayoun</a> in June. Assigned to the staff of Headquarters <a href="I%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">I Corps</a>, Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade 2 (Artillery) on 1 November; this would be the final artillery posting of his career. He was promoted to temporary <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> on 25 November. On 30 December, Wilton was <a href="mentioned%20in%20despatches">mentioned in despatches</a> for his service with the 7th Division. He entered the Middle East Staff School at <a href="Haifa">Haifa</a> in January 1942, and graduated in May.

Returning to Australia, Wilton became General Staff Officer Grade 1 in Major General <a href="Stanley%20Savige">Stanley Savige</a>'s <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28Australia%29">3rd Division</a> in August 1942. Savige later recalled that "I never had a more competent staff, nor such a co-operative team, than that staff after Wilton came along." The 3rd Division was part of Lieutenant General <a href="Edmund%20Herring">Edmund Herring</a>'s <a href="II%20Corps%20%28Australia%29">II Corps</a>. In October, Herring succeeded Lieutenant General <a href="Sydney%20Rowell">Sydney Rowell</a> as commander of <a href="New%20Guinea%20Force">New Guinea Force</a>, and Savige became acting corps commander. With his attention focused on the corps, Savige relied on Wilton to supervise the training of the 3rd Division. Wilton travelled to New Guinea in February 1943 to reconnoitre the terrain and begin plans for the division's forthcoming <a href="Salamaua%E2%80%93Lae%20campaign">campaign in Salamaua</a>. He was attached to <a href="Kanga%20Force">Kanga Force</a> in <a href="Wau%2C%20Papua%20New%20Guinea">Wau</a> during March 1943, prior to its absorption by 3rd Division the following month. Herring had ordered that the 3rd Division "threaten" <a href="Salamaua">Salamaua</a>, and despite Wilton's attempts to clarify precisely what this meant, the order remained vague. Savige and Wilton interpreted it as meaning that the 3rd Division was to capture Salamaua, when in fact its main purpose in the campaign was to divert Japanese forces from <a href="Lae">Lae</a>. In any event, 3rd Division progressed steadily and by August it had to be ordered to slow down so that Lae could be attacked before Salamaua. Wilton received much of the credit for 3rd Division's performance. He was awarded the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> (DSO) for his "skill and ability in New Guinea" between July 1942 and April 1943, the citation being promulgated on 27 April 1944.

In September 1943, following his service with 3rd Division, Wilton was posted to Washington, D.C. as General Staff Officer, Australian Military Mission; he spent November and December 1944 in Europe, observing the Allies' military organisation. He was promoted temporary <a href="colonel">colonel</a> in May 1945, and spent the remainder of the war on the staff of General <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Sir Thomas Blamey</a>'s Advanced Land Headquarters at <a href="Morotai">Morotai</a> in the <a href="Dutch%20East%20Indies">Dutch East Indies</a> and Forward Echelon Advance Land Headquarters at <a href="Manila">Manila</a> in the Philippines. On Blamey's recommendation, Wilton was honoured for the "particularly high standard" of his work on the general staff with appointment as an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE), promulgated on 6 March 1947.

Wilton was still only a substantive captain at the end of hostilities, but was considered by the Military Board to be among those "promising officers who have forced their way to the top during the war" and hence to deserve retention of their wartime rank. He became Deputy Director of Military Operations and Plans at Army Headquarters (AHQ), Melbourne, in March 1946, and took charge of the same directorate a year later. By now promoted to substantive colonel, in 1950 he was a member of the <a href="William%20Bridgeford">Bridgeford Mission</a>, which advised the Australian government on the state of the <a href="Malayan%20Emergency">Malayan Emergency</a>. On a visit to Singapore in February–March 1951 as part of a joint planning team, he urged his British counterparts to maintain their presence in <a href="Federation%20of%20Malaya">Malaya</a> as the basis of a combined force, without which Australia would be reluctant to commit any troops for the region's security. Wilton relinquished his post at AHQ in November 1951, and attended the <a href="Royal%20College%20of%20Defence%20Studies">Imperial Defence College</a> in London during 1952. Having been assigned a combat command in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a>, he was promoted to <a href="brigadier">brigadier</a> on 13 March 1953, arrived in <a href="Seoul">Seoul</a> within the week, and took over the <a href="28th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">28th Commonwealth Brigade</a> from fellow Duntroon graduate Brigadier <a href="Thomas%20Joseph%20Daly">Thomas Daly</a> on 25 March.
The 28th was described in the <a href="Australia%20in%20the%20Korean%20War%201950%E2%80%9353">official history of Australia's involvement in the Korean War</a> as "the most nationally diverse" <a href="brigade">brigade</a> in the <a href="1st%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BCommonwealth%20Division">1st Commonwealth Division</a>, consisting of Australian, British, Indian and New Zealand units, yet also "an outstandingly well-knit formation". After operating on the eastern side of the <a href="Jamestown%20Line">Jamestown Line</a> from April, the 28th was transferred westward to relieve the <a href="29th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">29th Brigade</a> at the Hook, the Commonwealth Division's most vulnerable position, on 9–10 July. At 6:15pm on 23 July, Wilton informed his <a href="battalion">battalion</a> chiefs that an <a href="Korean%20Armistice%20Agreement">armistice</a> was ready to be signed, and to keep patrols to the minimum level necessary for the line's security. The brigade's <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Samichon%20River">last action</a> took place over the next three days, when it used artillery, mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire to repulse a heavy assault by Chinese troops, inflicting as many as 3,000 casualties. Wilton later recalled the "terrible and gruesome sight" of no-man's land "literally carpeted with dead bodies". He was present for the armistice ceremony at <a href="Panmunjom">Panmunjom</a> on 27 July. Having succeeded in maintaining his command's discipline and morale during a potentially problematic time at the end of the conflict and the beginning of peace, he handed over the 28th to Brigadier <a href="Ian%20Murdoch%20%28general%29">Ian Murdoch</a> on 19 February 1954. For his service in Korea, Wilton was raised to <a href="Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) in the <a href="Queen%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">Queen's Birthday Honours</a> on 10 June 1954. He was also awarded the US <a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a> for his "outstanding leadership and initiative"; the decoration was <a href="London%20Gazette">gazetted</a> on 1 May 1956.

After returning to Australia, Wilton was appointed Brigadier in Charge of Administration at <a href="2nd%20Military%20District%20%28Australia%29">Headquarters Eastern Command</a>, his first administrative post. In November 1955 he was assigned to the General Staff at AHQ, where he was responsible for intelligence, operations and plans, and took part in Australian preparations for <a href="Southeast%20Asia%20Treaty%20Organization">SEATO</a> exercises. He was promoted to <a href="major%20general">major general</a> on 24 March 1957, and became Commandant of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. Although not strongly religious, Wilton considered himself responsible for the spiritual and moral development of younger cadets; he made a point of attending church parade regularly, and in 1959 personally launched an appeal for public funds to build the college's Anzac Memorial Chapel, which would open in 1966. His chief goal, though, was academic: concerned that graduates were at risk of falling behind their increasingly tertiary-qualified peers in industry and public service, he worked assiduously to make the college a degree-granting institution; this was realised in 1967. From June 1960 through 1962, Wilton was Chief of the Military Planning Office at SEATO Headquarters, <a href="Bangkok">Bangkok</a>. He believed Thailand to be strategically vital, declaring "if you want to hold Southeast Asia, you need to hold Thailand". His position allowed him to closely observe the <a href="Laotian%20Civil%20War">deteriorating situation in Laos</a>, which threatened to spill over into Thailand, and the Western Powers' growing focus on <a href="South%20Vietnam">South Vietnam</a>. He was appointed a <a href="Companion%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> (CB) in the 1962 Queen's Birthday Honours, in particular for his "conspicuous devotion to duty and his singleness of purpose" as Commandant of Duntroon. On 21 January 1963, Wilton was promoted <a href="lieutenant%20general">lieutenant general</a> and became <a href="Chief%20of%20Army%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the General Staff</a> (CGS), succeeding Lieutenant General <a href="Reg%20Pollard%20%28general%29">Sir Reginald Pollard</a>. He was appointed a <a href="Knight%20Commander%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> (KBE) in the 1964 <a href="New%20Year%20Honours">New Year Honours</a>.

Following the lead of the US Army, in 1960 the Australian Army had replaced its former "triangular" divisional structure of three infantry battalions under a brigade headquarters, with a "<a href="Pentropic%20organisation">pentropic</a>" organisation consisting of five larger battalions without a brigade layer between division and battalion headquarters. This had the effect of reducing the total number of Australian battalions, while increasing their individual strength. Wilton was unhappy with the pentropic structure, reasoning that the number of battalions, rather than their relative strength, was the overriding factor when considering potential overseas deployments. The US had in any event abandoned the system in June 1961. In October 1964, Wilton commissioned a review that ultimately recommended a return to the triangular formation. In the meantime, as a response to the <a href="Indonesia%E2%80%93Malaysia%20confrontation">Indonesia–Malaysia "Konfrontasi"</a>, the Australian government reintroduced conscription, which Wilton fought until convinced that the government was not going to improve pay and conditions sufficiently to attract by any other means the recruits needed to meet overseas commitments. Wilton was keen to mitigate any prejudices the national servicemen might have against the regular soldiery, and vice versa; when he found a memo from an Army committee asserting that "it must be recognised that the NS man was likely to be a reluctant soldier", he wrote on it "This assumption not justified". In February–March 1965, following a request from the Malaysian government, Australia despatched 1 Squadron, <a href="Special%20Air%20Service%20Regiment">Special Air Service Regiment</a>, and <a href="3rd%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a>, to <a href="Borneo">Borneo</a>—a commitment Wilton felt able to recommend as a result of the recent decisions to increase the Army's personnel and battalion numbers.
By mid-1964, Australia had already sent a <a href="Australian%20Army%20Training%20Team%20Vietnam">small team of military advisors</a>, as well as a <a href="RAAF%20Transport%20Flight%20Vietnam">flight</a> of newly acquired <a href="De%20Havilland%20Canada%20DHC-4%20Caribou">DHC-4 Caribou</a> transports, to aid the South Vietnamese government in its fight against the <a href="Viet%20Cong">Viet Cong</a>. The <a href="1st%20Battalion%2C%20Royal%20Australian%20Regiment">1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment</a>, was deployed in May 1965. It was attached to a <a href="173rd%20Airborne%20Brigade%20Combat%20Team">US Army brigade</a>, and Wilton was responsible for setting its operational parameters. In August, he recommended to his opposite number in the RAAF, Air Marshal <a href="Alister%20Murdoch">Alister Murdoch</a>, the despatch of two <a href="Bell%20UH-1%20Iroquois">UH-1 Iroquois</a> helicopters to Vietnam. Wilton believed that both services would benefit from gaining familiarisation with air/ground operations in the region before any large-scale commitment of Australian forces. He was exasperated when Murdoch rejected the idea on resourcing grounds, despite the fact that two-thirds of the RAAF's UH-1 complement had been purchased for the express purpose of army cooperation. According to the official history of the post-war Air Force, when the Federal government deployed <a href="No.%209%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 9 Squadron</a> and its UH-1s to Vietnam less than a year later, the unit was under-prepared for combat operations.

Wilton supported the RAAF's request that the deputy commander of Australian Forces Vietnam be an <a href="One-star%20rank">air officer</a>, despite the misgivings of some senior Army personnel and the fact that an appointment of this level was not commensurate with the services' relative commitments to the conflict. In what the <a href="The%20Official%20History%20of%20Australia%27s%20Involvement%20in%20Southeast%20Asian%20Conflicts%201948%E2%80%931975">official history of Australia in the Vietnam War</a> described as a "pragmatic and far-sighted approach", Wilton expressed his hope that such an arrangement would give the Air Force a closer understanding of land/air cooperation, and avoid "increasing differences of views about strategic and tactical concepts with the Australian Armed Forces". Following the Federal government's decision in March 1966 to despatch a <a href="1st%20Australian%20Task%20Force">task force of two battalions</a> to Vietnam, Wilton negotiated with US and South Vietnamese commanders a self-contained area of operations for the Australians, in <a href="Ph%C6%B0%E1%BB%9Bc%20Tuy%20Province">Phuoc Tuy Province</a>, where they could function with a reasonable degree of independence. He also approved <a href="Nui%20Dat">Nui Dat</a>, in the centre of the province forward of the major population areas, as the task force's main base, despite its distance from support units in <a href="V%C5%A9ng%20T%C3%A0u">Vung Tau</a> and the extra effort required to defend it. Wilton rejected a mobile role for the Australians that would have placed them under the control of a US division because, he believed, "their operations became a bit of a meat grinder" with "tremendous casualties". On 19 May 1966, he took over from Air Chief Marshal <a href="Frederick%20Scherger">Sir Frederick Scherger</a> as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), a position foreshadowing that of the modern <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20Defence%20Force%20%28Australia%29">Chief of the Defence Force</a>. He was succeeded as CGS by Lieutenant General Daly. According to the official history, the timing of the CCOSC handover was "especially significant" as it "coincided with the change in Vietnam from an Army force which was responsible to the Chief of the General Staff to a combined force responsive to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee. Wilton, therefore, carried through his responsibilities concerning the Vietnam commitment to his new appointment."

Wilton accepted the <a href="domino%20theory">domino theory</a> and never wavered in his commitment to Vietnam, but as early as mid-1967 he doubted that the war could be won unless the US was prepared to go all out and invade the <a href="North%20Vietnam">North</a>. Cautious about expanding Australia's involvement, he advocated deploying a <a href="Centurion%20tank">Centurion tank</a> squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase the strength of the task force in Vietnam, but in the end the Federal government announced both commitments in October 1967. Wilton also advised the government to reject any requests from the US command in Vietnam to rotate the Australian task force out of Phuoc Tuy and display its capabilities in a wider operational arena, reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in the countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people. He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander, Brigadier <a href="Ronald%20Lawrence%20Hughes">Ronald Hughes</a>, when the latter was criticised at home for conducting "American style operations" outside the immediate vicinity of Phuoc Tuy, such as the set-piece battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Coral%E2%80%93Balmoral">Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral</a> in mid-1968. Conflict continued to simmer between the Army and the RAAF regarding air support, and Wilton oversaw discussions between Daly and Murdoch that secured a separate Army air organisation, leading to the formation of the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Aviation">Australian Army Aviation Corps</a> in July 1968. On 22 August, the Federal government announced that Wilton would be promoted to <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">general</a>, effective 1 September, in recognition of his "outstanding contribution to the Commonwealth in his present appointment". He was the first Australian officer to attain the rank since Blamey, twenty-seven years before.
US troop reductions in 1969 under President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>'s <a href="Vietnamization">Vietnamization</a> policy led to increasing demands for similar withdrawals of Australian troops. Wilton, Daly and other senior officers argued that the "balanced" nature of the Australian task force would be damaged by a piecemeal withdrawal and that the only valid form of reduction would be "one out, all out"; the government chose a phased withdrawal, pulling out one battalion in October 1970 and the other two in October and December 1971. The divisive nature of the war caused conflict within Wilton's own family; all his children actively opposed it, and in September 1969 his son Robert publicly burnt his draft deferment notice outside <a href="Parliament%20House%2C%20Canberra">Parliament House, Canberra</a>, having earlier called upon students at the <a href="Australian%20National%20University">Australian National University</a> not to register for national service. "<a href="The%20Canberra%20Times">The Canberra Times</a>" ran an article on the Parliament House incident, complete with a photograph of Robert burning his notice. As Australia's senior soldier, Wilton refused to comment on the situation; Robert reported that he and his father respected one another's viewpoints, and relations within the family remained amicable.

One of the most controversial aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Phuoc Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground, Brigadier <a href="Stuart%20Clarence%20Graham">Stuart Graham</a>. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the Viet Cong, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was "better than sitting on his backside and not trying anything". He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was "the biggest blunder" Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was "like being wise after the event".

Wilton's position as CCOSC had no statutory authority over the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, nor a direct line of command to Australian Forces Vietnam. David Horner noted that in an emergency, Wilton "had to issue directives and then seek retrospective endorsement of them by either the minister or the Chiefs of Staff Committee." According to historian <a href="Eric%20Andrews">Eric Andrews</a>, Wilton "chaffed over his lack of command over the services and the need for organisational reform". While CGS, he had joined Scherger in calling for a single <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force">Australian Defence Force</a> organisation with one <a href="Minister%20for%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Minister of Defence</a>, in contrast to the existing arrangement where each service operated with virtual autonomy, supported by its own minister and department. In July 1967, he became a member of the Tertiary Education (Services' Cadet Colleges) Committee to plan a tri-service military academy, which was eventually opened as the <a href="Australian%20Defence%20Force%20Academy">Australian Defence Force Academy</a> in 1986. He was also able to push through a plan to establish, in 1970, the <a href="Joint%20Intelligence%20Organisation%20%28Australia%29">Joint Intelligence Organisation</a> to replace the former Joint Intelligence Bureau and three single-service intelligence groups.
In 1967, and again in 1970, Wilton recommended the creation of a single Defence Board of Administration, consisting of the Defence Minister, the Defence Secretary, CCOSC, and the three service chiefs, to take over the functions of the Air, Military, and Naval Boards, along with those of their separate ministers. While nothing came of this at the time, Wilton was consulted by the <a href="Australian%20Labor%20Party">Labor Party</a> prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20of%20Australia">Liberals</a> in the December 1972 Federal election. The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a>; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.

Wilton was succeeded as CCOSC by Admiral <a href="Victor%20Smith">Sir Victor Smith</a> on 23 November 1970, and retired from the military. He subsequently worked on the <a href="John%20Kerr%20%28governor-general%29">Kerr Committee</a> that reviewed pay and conditions in the armed forces, visiting several overseas bases including Nui Dat and Vung Tau. Wilton finished his career as a diplomat, serving as Australia's <a href="Consul%20%28representative%29">Consul-General</a> in New York from September 1973 to November 1975. In 1979 he became one of the first sponsors of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which advocated for a treaty between the Federal government and <a href="Aboriginal%20Australians">Aboriginal</a> representatives. He died of <a href="prostate%20cancer">prostate cancer</a> at his home in Canberra on 10 May 1981, aged seventy. Survived by his wife and children, Wilton was accorded a military funeral at Duntroon, in the Anzac Memorial Chapel he helped found, and cremated at Norwood Park Crematorium, Canberra.

Reflecting on Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War, Wilton considered that it was justified, and that the West's intervention helped delay the takeover of South Vietnam, and the spread of communism to Laos and Cambodia, by almost a decade. "Whether that was worthwhile", he added, "is a matter for the historian to judge". The key lesson, he felt, was not to intervene in a conflict "unless you are prepared to win", because it was "not something that you can just put one foot in and feel the temperature".

Biographer David Horner described Wilton as "arguably the most important and influential Australian Army officer in the second half of the twentieth century". Horner credited him with making significant contributions to the evolution of the Australian Defence Force through the pursuit of joint command and control. He further noted that whereas Wilton's predecessor as CCOSC, Scherger, had been promoted to 4-star rank after four years in the role, and Wilton himself after two-and-a-half, Wilton's successors gained their 4-star rank upon taking up the position, indicating its growing importance.

From an early age Wilton was considered cerebral and introspective; his colleagues in adulthood found him to have an incisive mind, high standards, and little inclination or capacity for small talk. His serious demeanour earned him the ironic nicknames "Happy Jack", "Smiling John" and "Sir Jovial", though he was capable of thoughtful gestures and flashes of humour. Major General <a href="Paul%20Cullen%20%28general%29">Paul Cullen</a>, the <a href="Australian%20Army%20Reserve">Citizen Military Forces</a> member of the Military Board from 1964 to 1966, described Wilton as "very stiff, very regular, very formal—but a pleasant man". Korean War historian <a href="Robert%20J.%20O%27Neill">Robert O'Neill</a> contended that "One of the most remarkable aspects of his career was that he rose so far through a highly competitive profession without ever playing to the gallery."

Noël Coward

Sir Noël Peirce Coward (16 December 189926 March 1973) was an English playwright, composer, director, actor and singer, known for his wit, flamboyance, and what "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" magazine called "a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise".

Coward attended a dance academy in London as a child, making his professional stage début at the age of eleven. As a teenager he was introduced into the high society in which most of his plays would be set. Coward achieved enduring success as a playwright, publishing more than 50 plays from his teens onwards. Many of his works, such as "<a href="Hay%20Fever%20%28play%29">Hay Fever</a>", "<a href="Private%20Lives">Private Lives</a>", "<a href="Design%20for%20Living">Design for Living</a>", "<a href="Present%20Laughter">Present Laughter</a>" and "<a href="Blithe%20Spirit%20%28play%29">Blithe Spirit</a>", have remained in the regular theatre repertoire. He composed hundreds of songs, in addition to well over a dozen musical theatre works (including the operetta "<a href="Bitter%20Sweet">Bitter Sweet</a>" and comic <a href="revue">revue</a>s), screenplays, poetry, several volumes of short stories, the novel "Pomp and Circumstance", and a three-volume autobiography. Coward's stage and film acting and directing career spanned six decades, during which he starred in many of his own works.

At the outbreak of the Second World War Coward volunteered for war work, running the British propaganda office in Paris. He also worked with the Secret Service, seeking to use his influence to persuade the American public and government to help Britain. Coward won an <a href="Academy%20Honorary%20Award">Academy Honorary Award</a> in 1943 for his naval film drama, "<a href="In%20Which%20We%20Serve">In Which We Serve</a>", and was knighted in 1969. In the 1950s he achieved fresh success as a cabaret performer, performing his own songs, such as "<a href="Mad%20Dogs%20and%20Englishmen%20%28song%29">Mad Dogs and Englishmen</a>", "<a href="London%20Pride%20%28song%29">London Pride</a>" and "<a href="I%20Went%20to%20a%20Marvellous%20Party">I Went to a Marvellous Party</a>".

Coward's plays and songs achieved new popularity in the 1960s and 1970s, and his work and style continue to influence popular culture. He did not publicly acknowledge his homosexuality, but it was discussed candidly after his death by biographers including <a href="Graham%20Payn">Graham Payn</a>, his long-time partner, and in Coward's diaries and letters, published posthumously. The former Albery Theatre (originally the New Theatre) in London was renamed the <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward%20Theatre">Noël Coward Theatre</a> in his honour in 2006.

Coward was born in 1899 in <a href="Teddington">Teddington</a>, <a href="Middlesex">Middlesex</a>, a south-western suburb of London. His parents were Arthur Sabin Coward (18561937), a piano salesman, and Violet Agnes Coward (18631954), daughter of , a captain and surveyor in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. Violet's cousin, Rachel Veitch, was mother of Field-Marshal <a href="Douglas%20Haig%2C%201st%20Earl%20Haig">Douglas Haig</a>. Noël Coward was the second of their three sons, the eldest of whom had died in 1898 at the age of six. Coward's father lacked ambition and industry, and family finances were often poor. Coward was bitten by the performing bug early and appeared in amateur concerts by the age of seven. He attended the <a href="Chapel%20Royal">Chapel Royal</a> Choir School as a young child. He had little formal schooling but was a voracious reader.

Encouraged by his ambitious mother, who sent him to a dance academy in London, Coward's first professional engagement was in January 1911 as Prince Mussel in the children's play "The Goldfish". In "Present Indicative", his first volume of memoirs, Coward wrote:

The leading actor-manager <a href="Charles%20Hawtrey%20%28actor%20born%201858%29">Charles Hawtrey</a>, whom the young Coward idolised and from whom he learned a great deal about the theatre, cast him in the children's play "<a href="Where%20the%20Rainbow%20Ends">Where the Rainbow Ends</a>". Coward played in the piece in 1911 and 1912 at the <a href="Garrick%20Theatre">Garrick Theatre</a> in London's <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a>. In 1912 Coward also appeared at the <a href="Savoy%20Theatre">Savoy Theatre</a> in "An Autumn Idyll" (as a dancer in the ballet) and at the <a href="London%20Coliseum">London Coliseum</a> in "A Little Fowl Play", by Harold Owen, in which Hawtrey starred. <a href="Italia%20Conti%20Academy">Italia Conti</a> engaged Coward to appear at the <a href="Liverpool%20Playhouse">Liverpool Repertory Theatre</a> in 1913, and in the same year he was cast as the <a href="Lost%20Boys%20%28Peter%20Pan%29">Lost Boy</a> Slightly in "<a href="Peter%20and%20Wendy">Peter Pan</a>". He reappeared in "Peter Pan" the following year, and in 1915 he was again in "Where the Rainbow Ends". He worked with other child actors in this period, including <a href="Hermione%20Gingold">Hermione Gingold</a> (whose mother threatened to turn "that naughty boy" out); <a href="Fabia%20Drake">Fabia Drake</a>; <a href="Esm%C3%A9%20Wynne-Tyson">Esmé Wynne</a>, with whom he collaborated on his earliest plays; Alfred Willmore, later known as <a href="Miche%C3%A1l%20Mac%20Liamm%C3%B3ir">Micheál Mac Liammóir</a>; and <a href="Gertrude%20Lawrence">Gertrude Lawrence</a> who, Coward wrote in his memoirs, "gave me an orange and told me a few mildly dirty stories, and I loved her from then onwards."
In 1914, when Coward was fourteen, he became the protégé and probably the lover of <a href="Philip%20Streatfeild">Philip Streatfeild</a>, a society painter. Streatfeild introduced him to Mrs Astley Cooper and her high society friends. Streatfeild died from <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1915, but Mrs Astley Cooper continued to encourage her late friend's protégé, who remained a frequent guest at her estate, <a href="Hambleton%20Hall">Hambleton Hall</a>.

Coward continued to perform during most of the First World War, appearing at the <a href="Scala%20Theatre">Prince of Wales's Theatre</a> in 1916 in "The Happy Family" and on tour with <a href="Amy%20Brandon%20Thomas">Amy Brandon Thomas</a>'s company in "<a href="Charley%27s%20Aunt">Charley's Aunt</a>". In 1917, he appeared in "The Saving Grace", a comedy produced by Hawtrey. Coward recalled in his memoirs, "My part was reasonably large and I was really quite good in it, owing to the kindness and care of Hawtrey's direction. He took endless trouble with me... and taught me during those two short weeks many technical points of comedy acting which I use to this day."

In 1918, Coward was conscripted into the <a href="Artists%20Rifles">Artists Rifles</a> but was assessed as unfit for active service because of a tubercular tendency, and he was discharged on health grounds after nine months. That year he appeared in the <a href="D.%20W.%20Griffith">D W Griffith</a> film "<a href="Hearts%20of%20the%20World">Hearts of the World</a>" in an uncredited role. He sold short stories to several magazines to help his family financially. He also began writing plays, collaborating on the first two ("Ida Collaborates" (1917) and "Women and Whisky" (1918)) with his friend Esmé Wynne. His first solo effort as a playwright was "<a href="The%20Rat%20Trap">The Rat Trap</a>" (1918) which was eventually produced at the <a href="Everyman%20Cinema%2C%20Hampstead">Everyman Theatre</a>, <a href="Hampstead">Hampstead</a>, in October 1926. During these years, he met Lorn McNaughtan, who became his private secretary and served in that capacity for more than forty years, until her death.

In 1920, at the age of 20, Coward starred in his own play, the light comedy "I'll Leave It to You". After a tryout in <a href="Manchester">Manchester</a>, it opened in London at the New Theatre (renamed the <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward%20Theatre">Noël Coward Theatre</a> in 2006), his first full-length play in the West End. <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a>'s praise in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Manchester Guardian</a>" was grudging. Notices for the London production were mixed, but encouraging. "<a href="The%20Observer">The Observer</a>" commented, "Mr Coward... has a sense of comedy, and if he can overcome a tendency to smartness, he will probably produce a good play one of these days." "The Times", on the other hand, was enthusiastic: "It is a remarkable piece of work from so young a head – spontaneous, light, and always 'brainy'."
The play ran for a month (and was Coward's first play seen in America), after which Coward returned to acting in works by other writers, starring as Ralph in "<a href="The%20Knight%20of%20the%20Burning%20Pestle">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</a>" in <a href="Birmingham%20Repertory%20Theatre">Birmingham</a> and then London. He did not enjoy the role, finding <a href="Francis%20Beaumont">Francis Beaumont</a> and his sometime collaborator <a href="John%20Fletcher%20%28playwright%29">John Fletcher</a> "two of the dullest Elizabethan writers ever known ... I had a very, very long part, but I was very, very bad at it". Nevertheless, "The Manchester Guardian" thought that Coward got the best out of the role, and "The Times" called the play "the jolliest thing in London".

Coward completed a one-act satire, "The Better Half", about a man's relationship with two women. It had a short run at The Little Theatre, London, in 1922. The critic <a href="St.%20John%20Greer%20Ervine">St John Ervine</a> wrote of the piece, "When Mr Coward has learned that tea-table chitter-chatter had better remain the prerogative of women he will write more interesting plays than he now seems likely to write." The play was thought to be lost until a typescript was found in 2007 in the archive of the <a href="Lord%20Chamberlain%27s%20Office">Lord Chamberlain's Office</a>, the official censor of stage plays in the UK until 1968.

In 1921, Coward made his first trip to America, hoping to interest producers there in his plays. Although he had little luck, he found the Broadway theatre stimulating. He absorbed its smartness and pace into his own work, which brought him his first real success as a playwright with "The Young Idea". The play opened in London in 1923, after a provincial tour, with Coward in one of the leading roles. The reviews were good: "Mr Noël Coward calls his brilliant little farce a 'comedy of youth', and so it is. And youth pervaded the Savoy last night, applauding everything so boisterously that you felt, not without exhilaration, that you were in the midst of a 'rag'." One critic, who noted the influence of <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">Bernard Shaw</a> on Coward's writing, thought more highly of the play than of Coward's newly found fans: "I was unfortunately wedged in the centre of a group of his more exuberant friends who greeted each of his sallies with 'That's a Noëlism!'" The play ran in London from 1 February to 24 March 1923, after which Coward turned to <a href="revue">revue</a>, co-writing and performing in <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Charlot">André Charlot</a>'s "<a href="London%20Calling%21">London Calling!</a>"
In 1924, Coward achieved his first great critical and financial success as a playwright with "<a href="The%20Vortex">The Vortex</a>." The story is about a nymphomaniac socialite and her cocaine-addicted son (played by Coward). Some saw the drugs as a mask for homosexuality; <a href="Kenneth%20Tynan">Kenneth Tynan</a> later described it as "a <a href="jeremiad">jeremiad</a> against narcotics with dialogue that sounds today not so much stilted as high-heeled". "The Vortex" was considered shocking in its day for its depiction of sexual vanity and drug abuse among the upper classes. Its notoriety and fiery performances attracted large audiences, justifying a move from a small suburban theatre to a larger one in the West End. Coward, still having trouble finding producers, raised the money to produce the play himself. During the run of "The Vortex", Coward met <a href="John%20C.%20Wilson">Jack Wilson</a>, an American stockbroker (later a director and producer), who became his business manager and lover. Wilson used his position to steal from Coward, but the playwright was in love and accepted both the larceny and Wilson's heavy drinking.

The success of "The Vortex" in both London and America caused a great demand for new Coward plays. In 1925 he premiered "<a href="Fallen%20Angels%20%28play%29">Fallen Angels</a>", a three-act comedy that amused and shocked audiences with the spectacle of two middle-aged women slowly getting drunk while awaiting the arrival of their mutual lover. "<a href="Hay%20Fever%20%28play%29">Hay Fever</a>", the first of Coward's plays to gain an enduring place in the mainstream theatrical repertoire, also appeared in 1925. It is a comedy about four egocentric members of an artistic family who casually invite acquaintances to their country house for the weekend and bemuse and enrage each other's guests. Some writers have seen elements of Coward's old mentor, Mrs Astley Cooper, and her set in the characters of the family. By the 1970s the play was recognised as a classic, described in "The Times" as a "dazzling achievement; like "<a href="The%20Importance%20of%20Being%20Earnest">The Importance of Being Earnest</a>", it is pure comedy with no mission but to delight, and it depends purely on the interplay of characters, not on elaborate comic machinery." By June 1925 Coward had four shows running in the West End: "The Vortex", "Fallen Angels", "Hay Fever" and "<a href="On%20with%20the%20Dance%20%28musical%29">On with the Dance</a>". Coward was turning out numerous plays and acting in his own works and others'. Soon, his frantic pace caught up with him, and he collapsed on stage in 1926 while starring in a stage adaptation of "<a href="The%20Constant%20Nymph%20%28novel%29">The Constant Nymph</a>" and had to take an extended rest, recuperating in <a href="Hawaii">Hawaii</a>.

Other Coward works produced in the mid-to-late 1920s included the plays "<a href="Easy%20Virtue%20%28play%29">Easy Virtue</a>" (1926), a drama about a divorcée's clash with her snobbish in-laws; "<a href="The%20Queen%20Was%20in%20the%20Parlour">The Queen Was in the Parlour</a>", a <a href="Ruritanian%20romance">Ruritanian romance</a>; "<a href="This%20Was%20a%20Man">This Was a Man</a>" (1926), a comedy about adulterous aristocrats; "The Marquise" (1927), an eighteenth-century costume drama; "Home Chat" (1927), a comedy about a married woman's fidelity; and the revues "On with the Dance" (1925) and "<a href="This%20Year%20of%20Grace">This Year of Grace</a>" (1928). None of these shows has entered the regular repertoire, but the last introduced one of Coward's best-known songs, "A Room with a View". His biggest failure in this period was the play "<a href="Sirocco%20%28play%29">Sirocco</a>" (1927), which concerns free love among the wealthy. It starred <a href="Ivor%20Novello">Ivor Novello</a>, of whom Coward said, "the two most beautiful things in the world are Ivor's profile and my mind". Theatregoers hated the play, showing violent disapproval at the curtain calls and spitting at Coward as he left the theatre. Coward later said of this flop, "My first instinct was to leave England immediately, but this seemed too craven a move, and also too gratifying to my enemies, whose numbers had by then swollen in our minds to practically the entire population of the British Isles."

By 1929 Coward was one of the world's highest-earning writers, with an annual income of £50,000, more than £2,000,000 in terms of 2007 values. Coward thrived during the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>, writing a succession of popular hits. They ranged from large-scale spectaculars to intimate comedies. Examples of the former were the <a href="operetta">operetta</a> "<a href="Bitter%20Sweet">Bitter Sweet</a>" (1929), about a woman who elopes with her music teacher, and the historical extravaganza "<a href="Cavalcade%20%28play%29">Cavalcade</a>" (1931) at <a href="Theatre%20Royal%2C%20Drury%20Lane">Drury Lane</a>, about thirty years in the lives of two families, which required a huge cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage. Its <a href="Cavalcade%20%281933%20film%29">1933 film adaptation</a> won the <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> for best picture. Coward's intimate-scale hits of the period included "<a href="Private%20Lives">Private Lives</a>" (1930) and "<a href="Design%20for%20Living">Design for Living</a>" (1932). In "Private Lives", Coward starred alongside his most famous stage partner, Gertrude Lawrence, together with the young <a href="Laurence%20Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>. It was a highlight of both Coward's and Lawrence's career, selling out in both London and New York. Coward disliked long runs, and after this he made a rule of starring in a play for no more than three months at any venue. "Design for Living", written for <a href="Alfred%20Lunt">Alfred Lunt</a> and <a href="Lynn%20Fontanne">Lynn Fontanne</a>, was so risqué, with its theme of bisexuality and a "ménage à trois", that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing that it would not survive the censor in London.
In 1933 Coward wrote, directed and co-starred with the French singer <a href="Yvonne%20Printemps">Yvonne Printemps</a> in both London and New York productions of an operetta, "<a href="Conversation%20Piece%20%28musical%29">Conversation Piece</a>" (1933). He next wrote, directed and co-starred with Lawrence in "<a href="Tonight%20at%208.30">Tonight at 8.30</a>" (1936), a cycle of ten short plays, presented in various permutations across three evenings. One of these plays, "<a href="Still%20Life%20%28play%29">Still Life</a>", was expanded into the 1945 <a href="David%20Lean">David Lean</a> film "<a href="Brief%20Encounter">Brief Encounter</a>". "Tonight at 8.30" was followed by a musical, "<a href="Operette%20%28musical%29">Operette</a>" (1938), from which the most famous number is "The Stately Homes of England", and a revue entitled "<a href="Set%20to%20Music">Set to Music</a>" (1938, a <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> version of his 1932 London revue, "Words and Music"). Coward's last pre-war plays were "<a href="This%20Happy%20Breed">This Happy Breed</a>", a drama about a working-class family, and "<a href="Present%20Laughter">Present Laughter</a>", a comic self-caricature with an egomaniac actor as the central character. These were first performed in 1942, although they were both written in 1939.

Between 1929 and 1936 Coward recorded many of his best-known songs for <a href="The%20Gramophone%20Company">His Master's Voice</a> (HMV), now reissued on CD, including the romantic "<a href="I%27ll%20See%20You%20Again">I'll See You Again</a>" from "Bitter Sweet", the comic "<a href="Mad%20Dogs%20and%20Englishmen%20%28song%29">Mad Dogs and Englishmen</a>" from "Words and Music", and "Mrs Worthington".

With the outbreak of the Second World War Coward abandoned the theatre and sought official war work. After running the British propaganda office in Paris, where he concluded that "if the policy of His Majesty's Government is to bore the Germans to death I don't think we have time", he worked on behalf of British intelligence. His task was to use his celebrity to influence American public and political opinion in favour of helping Britain. He was frustrated by British press criticism of his foreign travel while his countrymen suffered at home, but he was unable to reveal that he was acting on behalf of the Secret Service. In 1942 <a href="George%20VI">George VI</a> wished to award Coward a knighthood for his efforts, but was dissuaded by <a href="Winston%20Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. Mindful of the public view of Coward's flamboyant lifestyle, Churchill used, as his reason for withholding the honour, Coward's £200 fine for contravening currency regulations in 1941.

Had the Germans invaded Britain, Coward was scheduled to be arrested and killed, as he was in <a href="The%20Black%20Book">The Black Book</a> along with other figures such as <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, <a href="Paul%20Robeson">Paul Robeson</a>, <a href="Bertrand%20Russell">Bertrand Russell</a>, <a href="C.%20P.%20Snow">C. P. Snow</a> and <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>. When this came to light after the war, Coward wrote: "If anyone had told me at that time I was high up on the <a href="Nazi">Nazi</a> blacklist, I should have laughed ... I remember <a href="Rebecca%20West">Rebecca West</a>, who was one of the many who shared the honour with me, sent me a telegram which read: 'My dear – the people we should have been seen dead with'."
Churchill's view was that Coward would do more for the war effort by entertaining the troops and the home front than by intelligence work: "Go and sing to them when the guns are firing – that's your job!" Coward, though disappointed, followed this advice. He toured, acted and sang indefatigably in Europe, Africa, Asia and America. He wrote and recorded war-themed popular songs, including "<a href="London%20Pride%20%28song%29">London Pride</a>" and "<a href="Don%27t%20Let%27s%20Be%20Beastly%20to%20the%20Germans">Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans</a>". His London home was wrecked by German bombs in 1941, and he took up temporary residence at the <a href="Savoy%20Hotel">Savoy Hotel</a>. During one air raid on the area around the Savoy he joined <a href="Carroll%20Gibbons">Carroll Gibbons</a> and <a href="Judy%20Campbell">Judy Campbell</a> in impromptu cabaret to distract the captive guests from their fears. Another of Coward's wartime projects, as writer, star, composer and co-director (alongside David Lean), was the naval film drama "<a href="In%20Which%20We%20Serve">In Which We Serve</a>". The film was popular on both sides of the Atlantic, and he was awarded an <a href="Academy%20Honorary%20Award">honorary certificate of merit</a> at the <a href="15th%20Academy%20Awards">1943 Academy Awards</a> ceremony. Coward played a naval captain, basing the character on his friend <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Louis Mountbatten</a>. Lean went on to direct and adapt film versions of several Coward plays.

Coward's most enduring work from the war years was the hugely successful black comedy "<a href="Blithe%20Spirit%20%28play%29">Blithe Spirit</a>" (1941), about a novelist who researches the <a href="occult">occult</a> and hires a medium. A séance brings back the ghost of his first wife, causing havoc for the novelist and his second wife. With 1,997 consecutive performances, it broke box-office records for the run of a West End comedy, and was also produced on Broadway, where its original run was 650 performances. The play was adapted into a <a href="Blithe%20Spirit%20%28film%29">1945 film</a>, directed by Lean. Coward toured during 1942 in "Blithe Spirit", alternating the piece with his comedy "Present Laughter" and his working-class drama "This Happy Breed".

In his "Middle East Diary" Coward made several statements that offended many Americans. In particular, he commented that he was "less impressed by some of the mournful little <a href="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> boys lying there in tears amid the alien corn with nothing worse than a bullet wound in the leg or a fractured arm". After protests from both "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" and "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>", the Foreign Office urged Coward not to visit the United States in January 1945. He did not return to America again during the war. In the aftermath of the war, Coward wrote an <a href="alternate%20history">alternative reality</a> play, "<a href="Peace%20in%20Our%20Time%20%28play%29">Peace In Our Time</a>", depicting an England occupied by <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.

Coward's new plays after the war were moderately successful but failed to match the popularity of his pre-war hits. "<a href="Relative%20Values%20%28play%29">Relative Values</a>" (1951) addresses the culture clash between an aristocratic English family and a Hollywood actress with matrimonial ambitions; "<a href="South%20Sea%20Bubble%20%28play%29">South Sea Bubble</a>" (1951) is a political comedy set in a British colony; "<a href="Quadrille%20%28play%29">Quadrille</a>" (1952) is a drama about Victorian love and elopement; and "<a href="Nude%20with%20Violin">Nude with Violin</a>" (1956, starring <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a> in London and Coward in New York) is a satire on modern art and critical pretension. A revue, "<a href="Sigh%20No%20More%20%28musical%29">Sigh No More</a>" (1945), was a moderate success, but two musicals, "<a href="Pacific%201860">Pacific 1860</a>" (1946), a lavish <a href="South%20Seas%20%28genre%29">South Seas</a> romance, and "<a href="Ace%20of%20Clubs%20%28musical%29">Ace of Clubs</a>" (1949), set in a night club, were financial failures. Further blows in this period were the deaths of Coward's friends Charles Cochran and Gertrude Lawrence, in 1951 and 1952 respectively. Despite his disappointments, Coward maintained a high public profile; his performance as King Magnus in Shaw's "<a href="The%20Apple%20Cart">The Apple Cart</a>" for the Coronation season of 1953, co-starring <a href="Margaret%20Leighton">Margaret Leighton</a>, received much coverage in the press, and his cabaret act, honed during his wartime tours entertaining the troops, was a supreme success, first in London at the <a href="Caf%C3%A9%20de%20Paris%20%28London%29">Café de Paris</a>, and later in <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Strip">Las Vegas</a>. The theatre critic Kenneth Tynan wrote:
In 1955 Coward's cabaret act at Las Vegas, recorded live for the gramophone, and released as "<a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward%20at%20Las%20Vegas">Noël Coward at Las Vegas</a>" was so successful that <a href="CBS">CBS</a> engaged him to write and direct a series of three 90-minute television specials for the 1955–56 season. The first of these, "Together With Music", paired Coward with <a href="Mary%20Martin">Mary Martin</a>, featuring him in many of the numbers from his Las Vegas act. It was followed by productions of "Blithe Spirit" in which he starred with <a href="Claudette%20Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a>, <a href="Lauren%20Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a> and <a href="Mildred%20Natwick">Mildred Natwick</a> and "This Happy Breed" with <a href="Edna%20Best">Edna Best</a> and <a href="Roger%20Moore">Roger Moore</a>. Despite excellent reviews, the audience viewing figures were moderate.
During the 1950s and 1960s Coward continued to write musicals and plays. "<a href="After%20the%20Ball%20%28musical%29">After the Ball</a>", his 1953 adaptation of "<a href="Lady%20Windermere%27s%20Fan">Lady Windermere's Fan</a>", was the last musical he premiered in the West End; his last two musicals were first produced on Broadway. "<a href="Sail%20Away%20%28musical%29">Sail Away</a>" (1961), set on a luxury cruise liner, was Coward's most successful post-war musical, with productions in America, Britain and Australia. "<a href="The%20Girl%20Who%20Came%20to%20Supper">The Girl Who Came to Supper</a>", a musical adaptation of "<a href="The%20Sleeping%20Prince%20%28play%29">The Sleeping Prince</a>" (1963), ran for only three months. He directed the successful 1964 Broadway musical adaptation of "Blithe Spirit", called "<a href="High%20Spirits%20%28musical%29">High Spirits</a>". Coward's late plays include a farce, "<a href="Look%20After%20Lulu%21">Look After Lulu!</a>" (1959), and a tragi-comic study of old age, "<a href="Waiting%20in%20the%20Wings%20%28play%29">Waiting in the Wings</a>" (1960), both of which were successful despite "critical disdain". Coward argued that the primary purpose of a play was to entertain, and he made no attempt at modernism, which he felt was boring to the audience although fascinating to the critics. His comic novel, "Pomp and Circumstance" (1960), about life in a tropical British colony, met with more critical success.

Coward's final stage success came with "Suite in Three Keys" (1966), a trilogy set in a hotel penthouse suite. He wrote it as his swan song as a stage actor: "I would like to act once more before I fold my bedraggled wings." The trilogy gained glowing reviews and did good box office business in the UK. In one of the three plays, "<a href="A%20Song%20at%20Twilight">A Song at Twilight</a>", Coward abandoned his customary reticence on the subject and played an explicitly homosexual character. The daring piece earned Coward new critical praise. He intended to star in the trilogy on Broadway but was too ill to travel. Only two of the "Suite in Three Keys" plays were performed in New York, with the title changed to "Noël Coward in Two Keys", starring <a href="Hume%20Cronyn">Hume Cronyn</a>.

Coward won new popularity in several notable films later in his career, such as "<a href="Around%20the%20World%20in%2080%20Days%20%281956%20film%29">Around the World in 80 Days</a>" (1956), "<a href="Our%20Man%20in%20Havana%20%28film%29">Our Man in Havana</a>" (1959), "<a href="Bunny%20Lake%20Is%20Missing">Bunny Lake Is Missing</a>" (1965), "<a href="Boom%21%20%28film%29">Boom!</a>" (1968) and "<a href="The%20Italian%20Job">The Italian Job</a>" (1969). Stage and film opportunities he turned down in the 1950s included an invitation to compose a musical version of "<a href="Pygmalion%20%28play%29">Pygmalion</a>" (two years before "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>" was written), and offers of the roles of the king in the original stage production of "<a href="The%20King%20and%20I">The King and I</a>", and Colonel Nicholson in the film "<a href="The%20Bridge%20on%20the%20River%20Kwai">The Bridge on the River Kwai</a>". Invited to play the title role in the 1962 film "<a href="Dr.%20No%20%28film%29">Dr. No</a>", he replied, "No, no, no, a thousand times, no." In the same year, he turned down the role of Humbert Humbert in "<a href="Lolita%20%281962%20film%29">Lolita</a>", saying, "At my time of life the film story would be logical if the 12-year-old heroine was a sweet little old lady."

In the mid-1960s and early 1970s successful productions of his 1920s and 1930s plays, and new revues celebrating his music, including "<a href="Oh%2C%20Coward%21">Oh, Coward!</a>" on Broadway and "<a href="Cowardy%20Custard">Cowardy Custard</a>" in London, revived Coward's popularity and critical reputation. He dubbed this comeback "Dad's Renaissance". It began with a hit 1963 revival of "Private Lives" in London and then New York. Invited to direct "Hay Fever" with <a href="Edith%20Evans">Edith Evans</a> at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a>, he wrote in 1964, "I am thrilled and flattered and frankly a little flabbergasted that the National Theatre should have had the curious perceptiveness to choose a very early play of mine and to give it a cast that could play the Albanian telephone directory."

Other examples of "Dad's Renaissance" included a 1968 <a href="Off-Broadway">Off-Broadway</a> production of "Private Lives" at the <a href="Lucille%20Lortel%20Theatre">Theatre de Lys</a> starring <a href="Elaine%20Stritch">Elaine Stritch</a>, <a href="Lee%20Bowman">Lee Bowman</a> and <a href="Betsy%20von%20Furstenberg">Betsy von Furstenberg</a>, and directed by <a href="Charles%20Nelson%20Reilly">Charles Nelson Reilly</a>. Despite this impressive cast, Coward's popularity had risen so high that the theatre poster for the production used an <a href="Al%20Hirschfeld">Al Hirschfeld</a> caricature of Coward ("pictured") instead of an image of the production or its stars. The illustration captures how Coward's image had changed by the 1960s: he was no longer seen as the smooth 1930s sophisticate, but as the doyen of the theatre. As "<a href="New%20Statesman">The New Statesman</a>" wrote in 1964, "Who would have thought the landmarks of the Sixties would include the emergence of Noël Coward as the grand old man of British drama? There he was one morning, flipping verbal tiddlywinks with reporters about "Dad's Renaissance"; the next he was... beside <a href="E.%20M.%20Forster">Forster</a>, <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a> and the <a href="Order%20of%20Merit">OMs</a>, demonstrably the greatest living English playwright." "Time" wrote that "in the 60s... his best work, with its inspired inconsequentiality, seemed to exert not only a period charm but charm, period."

By the end of the 1960s, Coward suffered from <a href="arteriosclerosis">arteriosclerosis</a> and, during the run of "Suite in Three Keys", he struggled with bouts of memory loss. This also affected his work in "The Italian Job", and he retired from acting immediately afterwards. Coward was <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> in 1969 and was elected a fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a>. He received a <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a> for lifetime achievement. In 1972, he was awarded an honorary <a href="Doctor%20of%20Letters">Doctor of Letters</a> degree by the <a href="University%20of%20Sussex">University of Sussex</a>.

Coward died at his home, <a href="Firefly%20Estate">Firefly Estate</a>, in <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a> on 26 March 1973 of heart failure and was buried three days later on the brow of Firefly Hill, overlooking the north coast of the island. A memorial service was held in <a href="St%20Martin-in-the-Fields">St Martin-in-the-Fields</a> in London on 29 May 1973, for which the <a href="Poet%20Laureate">Poet Laureate</a>, <a href="John%20Betjeman">John Betjeman</a>, wrote and delivered a poem in Coward's honour, John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier read verse and <a href="Yehudi%20Menuhin">Yehudi Menuhin</a> played <a href="Johann%20Sebastian%20Bach">Bach</a>. On 28 March 1984 a memorial stone was unveiled by the <a href="Elizabeth%20Bowes-Lyon">Queen Mother</a> in <a href="Poets%27%20Corner">Poets' Corner</a>, <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a>. Thanked by Coward's partner, <a href="Graham%20Payn">Graham Payn</a>, for attending, the Queen Mother replied, "I came because he was my friend."

The <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward%20Theatre">Noël Coward Theatre</a> in <a href="St%20Martin%27s%20Lane">St Martin's Lane</a>, originally opened in 1903 as the New Theatre and later called the Albery, was renamed in his honour after extensive refurbishment, re-opening on 1 June 2006. A statue of Coward by <a href="Angela%20Conner">Angela Conner</a> was unveiled by the Queen Mother in the foyer of the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1998. There are also sculptures of Coward displayed in New York and Jamaica, and a bust of him in the library in Teddington, near where he was born. In 2008 an exhibition devoted to Coward was mounted at the National Theatre in London. The exhibition was later hosted by the <a href="Museum%20of%20Performance%20%26amp%3B%20Design">Museum of Performance & Design</a> in San Francisco and the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> in <a href="Beverly%20Hills">Beverly Hills</a>, California.

Coward was homosexual but, following the convention of his times, this was never publicly mentioned. The critic Kenneth Tynan's description in 1953 was close to an acknowledgment of Coward's sexuality: "Forty years ago he was Slightly in "Peter Pan", and you might say that he has been wholly in "Peter Pan" ever since. No private considerations have been allowed to deflect the drive of his career; like Gielgud and <a href="Terence%20Rattigan">Rattigan</a>, like the late Ivor Novello, he is a congenital bachelor." Coward firmly believed his private business was not for public discussion, considering ""any" sexual activities when over-advertised" to be tasteless. Even in the 1960s, Coward refused to acknowledge his sexual orientation publicly, wryly observing, "There are still a few old ladies in <a href="Worthing">Worthing</a> who don't know." Despite this reticence, he encouraged his secretary Cole Lesley to write a frank biography once Coward was safely dead.

Coward's most important relationship, which began in the mid-1940s and lasted until his death, was with the South African stage and film actor Graham Payn. Coward featured Payn in several of his London productions. Payn later co-edited with <a href="Sheridan%20Morley">Sheridan Morley</a> a collection of Coward's diaries, published in 1982. Coward's other relationships included the playwright Keith Winter, actors <a href="Louis%20Hayward">Louis Hayward</a> and <a href="Alan%20Webb%20%28actor%29">Alan Webb</a>, his manager <a href="John%20C.%20Wilson">Jack Wilson</a> and the composer <a href="Ned%20Rorem">Ned Rorem</a>, who published details of their relationship in his diaries. Coward had a 19-year friendship with <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20Duke%20of%20Kent">Prince George, Duke of Kent</a>, but biographers differ on whether it was platonic. Payn believed that it was, although Coward reportedly admitted to the historian Michael Thornton that there had been "a little dalliance". Coward said, on the duke's death, "I suddenly find that I loved him more than I knew."

Coward maintained close friendships with many women, including the actress and author Esmé Wynne-Tyson, his first collaborator and constant correspondent; <a href="Gladys%20Calthrop">Gladys Calthrop</a>, who designed sets and costumes for many of his works; his secretary and close confidante Lorn Loraine; the actresses Gertrude Lawrence, <a href="Joyce%20Carey">Joyce Carey</a> and Judy Campbell; and "his loyal and lifelong "amitié amoureuse"", <a href="Marlene%20Dietrich">Marlene Dietrich</a>.

In his profession, Coward was widely admired and loved for his generosity and kindness to those who fell on hard times. Stories are told of the unobtrusive way in which he relieved the needs or paid the debts of old theatrical acquaintances who had no claim on him. From 1934 until 1956, Coward was the president of the <a href="Actors%20Orphanage">Actors Orphanage</a>, which was supported by the theatrical industry. In that capacity, he befriended the young <a href="Peter%20Collinson%20%28film%20director%29">Peter Collinson</a>, who was in the care of the orphanage. He became Collinson's godfather and helped him to get started in show business. When Collinson was a successful director, he invited Coward to play a role in "The Italian Job". Graham Payn also played a small role in the film.
In 1926, Coward acquired <a href="Goldenhurst%20Farm">Goldenhurst Farm</a>, in <a href="Aldington%2C%20Kent">Aldington, Kent</a>, making it his home for most of the next thirty years, except when the military used it during the Second World War. It is a <a href="Grade%20II%2A%20listed%20buildings%20in%20Kent">Grade II listed building</a>. In the 1950s, Coward left the UK for tax reasons, receiving harsh criticism in the press. He first settled in <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> but later bought houses in Jamaica and Switzerland (in the village of <a href="Les%20Avants">Les Avants</a>, near <a href="Montreux">Montreux</a>), which remained his homes for the rest of his life. His expatriate neighbours and friends included <a href="Joan%20Sutherland">Joan Sutherland</a>, <a href="David%20Niven">David Niven</a>, <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a> and <a href="Elizabeth%20Taylor">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, and <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a> and <a href="Blake%20Edwards">Blake Edwards</a> in Switzerland and <a href="Ian%20Fleming">Ian Fleming</a> and his wife <a href="Ann%20Fleming">Ann</a> in Jamaica. Coward was a witness at the Flemings' wedding, but his diaries record his exasperation with their constant bickering.

Coward's political views were conservative, but not unswervingly so: he despised the government of <a href="Neville%20Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a> for its policy of <a href="appeasement">appeasing</a> Nazi Germany, and he differed sharply with Winston Churchill over the <a href="Edward%20VIII%20abdication%20crisis">abdication crisis</a> of 1936. Whereas Churchill supported <a href="Edward%20VIII">Edward VIII</a>'s wish to marry "his cutie", <a href="Wallis%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Windsor">Wallis Simpson</a>, Coward thought the king irresponsible, telling Churchill, "England doesn't wish for a Queen Cutie." Coward disliked propaganda in plays; "The theatre is a wonderful place, a house of strange enchantment, a temple of illusion. What it most emphatically is not and never will be is a scruffy, ill-lit, fumed-oak drill hall serving as a temporary soap box for political propaganda." Nevertheless, his own views sometimes surfaced in his plays: both "Cavalcade" and "This Happy Breed" are, in the words of the playwright <a href="David%20Edgar%20%28playwright%29">David Edgar</a>, "overtly Conservative political plays written in the <a href="Bertolt%20Brecht">Brechtian</a> epic manner." In religion, Coward was agnostic. He wrote of his views, "Do I believe in God? I can't say No and I can't say Yes, To me it's anybody's guess."

Coward spelled his first name with the <a href="Diaeresis%20%28diacritic%29">diæresis</a> (""I" didn't put the dots over the 'e' in Noël. The language did. Otherwise it's not Noël but Nool!"). The press and many book publishers failed to follow suit, and his name was printed as 'Noel' in "The Times", "The Observer" and other contemporary newspapers and books. The papers of Noël Coward are held in the <a href="University%20of%20Birmingham">University of Birmingham</a>.

"Why", asked Coward, "am I always expected to wear a dressing-gown, smoke cigarettes in a <a href="Cigarette%20holder">long holder</a> and say 'Darling, how wonderful'?" The answer lay in Coward's assiduous cultivation of a carefully crafted image. As a suburban boy who had been taken up by the upper classes he rapidly acquired the taste for high life: "I am determined to travel through life first class." He first wore a dressing gown onstage in "The Vortex" and used the fashion in several of his other famous plays, including "Private Lives" and "Present Laughter". <a href="George%20Walden">George Walden</a> identifies him as a modern <a href="dandy">dandy</a>. In connection with the National Theatre's 2008 exhibition, "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" commented, "His famous silk, polka-dot dressing gown and elegant cigarette holder both seem to belong to another era. But 2008 is proving to be the year that Britain falls in love with Noël Coward all over again."

As soon as he achieved success he began polishing the Coward image: an early press photograph showed him sitting up in bed holding a cigarette holder: "I looked like an advanced Chinese decadent in the last phases of dope." Soon after that, Coward wrote, "I took to wearing coloured turtle-necked jerseys, actually more for comfort than for effect, and soon I was informed by my evening paper that I had started a fashion. I believe that to a certain extent this was true; at any rate, during the ensuing months I noticed more and more of our seedier West-End chorus boys parading about London in them." He soon became more cautious about overdoing the flamboyance, advising <a href="Cecil%20Beaton">Cecil Beaton</a> to tone down his outfits: "It is important not to let the public have a loophole to lampoon you." However, Coward was happy to generate publicity from his lifestyle. In 1969 he told "Time" magazine, "I acted up like crazy. I did everything that was expected of me. Part of the job." "Time" concluded, "Coward's greatest single gift has not been writing or composing, not acting or directing, but projecting a sense of personal style, a combination of cheek and chic, pose and poise."

Coward's distinctive clipped diction arose from his childhood: his mother was deaf and Coward developed his staccato style of speaking to make it easier for her to hear what he was saying; it also helped him eradicate a slight lisp. His nickname, "The Master", "started as a joke and became true", according to Coward. It was used of him from the 1920s onwards. Coward himself made light of it: when asked by a journalist why he was known as "The Master", he replied, "Oh, you know – Jack of all trades, master of none." He could, however, joke about his own immodesty: "My sense of my importance to the world is relatively small. On the other hand, my sense of my own importance to myself is tremendous." When a "Time" interviewer apologised, "I hope you haven't been bored having to go through all these interviews for your [70th] birthday, having to answer the same old questions about yourself", Coward rejoined, "Not at all. I'm fascinated by the subject."

The playwright <a href="John%20Osborne">John Osborne</a> said, "Mr Coward is his own invention and contribution to this century. Anyone who cannot see that should keep well away from the theatre." Tynan wrote in 1964, "Even the youngest of us will know, in fifty years' time, exactly what we mean by 'a very Noel Coward sort of person'." In praise of Coward's versatility, <a href="Louis%20Mountbatten%2C%201st%20Earl%20Mountbatten%20of%20Burma">Lord Mountbatten</a> said, in a tribute on Coward's seventieth birthday, "There are probably greater painters than Noël, greater novelists than Noël, greater librettists, greater composers of music, greater singers, greater dancers, greater comedians, greater tragedians, greater stage producers, greater film directors, greater cabaret artists, greater TV stars. If there are, they are fourteen different people. Only one man combined all fourteen different labels – The Master."
Tynan's was the first generation of critics to realise that Coward's plays might enjoy more than ephemeral success. In the 1930s, <a href="Cyril%20Connolly">Cyril Connolly</a> wrote that they were "written in the most topical and perishable way imaginable, the cream in them turns sour overnight". What seemed daring in the 1920s and 1930s came to seem old-fashioned in the 1950s, and Coward never repeated the success of his pre-war plays. By the 1960s, critics began to note that underneath the witty dialogue and the <a href="Art%20Deco">Art Deco</a> glamour of the inter-war years, Coward's best plays also dealt with recognisable people and familiar relationships, with an emotional depth and pathos that had been often overlooked. By the time of his death, "The Times" was writing of him, "None of the great figures of the English theatre has been more versatile than he", and the paper ranked his plays in "the classical tradition of <a href="William%20Congreve">Congreve</a>, <a href="Richard%20Sheridan">Sheridan</a>, Wilde and Shaw".

A symposium published in 1999 to mark the centenary of Coward's birth listed some of his major productions scheduled for the year in Britain and North America, including "Ace of Clubs, After the Ball, Blithe Spirit, Cavalcade, Easy Virtue, Hay Fever, Present Laughter, Private Lives, Sail Away, A Song at Twilight, The Young Idea" and "Waiting in the Wings", with stars including Lauren Bacall, <a href="Rosemary%20Harris">Rosemary Harris</a>, <a href="Ian%20McKellen">Ian McKellen</a>, <a href="Corin%20Redgrave">Corin Redgrave</a>, <a href="Vanessa%20Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a> and Elaine Stritch. In another tribute, <a href="Tim%20Rice">Tim Rice</a> said of Coward's songs: "The wit and wisdom of Noël Coward's lyrics will be as lively and contemporary in 100 years' time as they are today", and many have been recorded by <a href="Damon%20Albarn">Damon Albarn</a>, <a href="Ian%20Bostridge">Ian Bostridge</a>, <a href="The%20Divine%20Comedy%20%28band%29">The Divine Comedy</a>, <a href="Elton%20John">Elton John</a>, <a href="Valerie%20Masterson">Valerie Masterson</a>, <a href="Paul%20McCartney">Paul McCartney</a>, <a href="Michael%20Nyman">Michael Nyman</a>, <a href="Pet%20Shop%20Boys">Pet Shop Boys</a>, <a href="Vic%20Reeves">Vic Reeves</a>, <a href="Sting%20%28musician%29">Sting</a>, Joan Sutherland, <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a> and others.

Coward's music, writings, characteristic voice and style have been widely parodied and imitated, for instance in "<a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a>", "<a href="Round%20the%20Horne">Round the Horne</a>" and "<a href="Privates%20on%20Parade">Privates on Parade</a>". Coward has frequently been depicted as a character in plays, films, television and radio shows, for example, in the 1968 Julie Andrews film "<a href="Star%21%20%28film%29">Star!</a>" (in which Coward was portrayed by his godson, <a href="Daniel%20Massey%20%28actor%29">Daniel Massey</a>), the BBC <a href="sitcom">sitcom</a> "<a href="Goodnight%20Sweetheart%20%28TV%20series%29">Goodnight Sweetheart</a>" and a BBC Radio 4 series written by <a href="Marcy%20Kahan">Marcy Kahan</a> in which Coward was dramatised as a detective in "Design For Murder" (2000), "A Bullet at Balmain's" (2003) and "Death at the Desert Inn" (2005), and as a spy in "Blithe Spy" (2002) and "Our Man In Jamaica" (2007), with <a href="Malcolm%20Sinclair%20%28actor%29">Malcolm Sinclair</a> playing Coward in each. On stage, characters based on Coward have included Beverly Carlton in the 1939 Broadway play "<a href="The%20Man%20Who%20Came%20to%20Dinner">The Man Who Came to Dinner</a>". A play about the friendship between Coward and Dietrich, called "<a href="Lunch%20with%20Marlene">Lunch with Marlene</a>", by Chris Burgess, ran at the <a href="New%20End%20Theatre">New End Theatre</a> in 2008. The second act presents a musical revue, including Coward songs such as "Don't Let's Be Beastly to the Germans".

Coward was an early admirer of the plays of <a href="Harold%20Pinter">Harold Pinter</a> and backed Pinter's film version of "<a href="The%20Caretaker">The Caretaker</a>" with a £1,000 investment. Some critics have detected Coward's influence in Pinter's plays. Tynan compared Pinter's "elliptical patter" to Coward's "stylised dialogue". Pinter returned the compliment by directing the National Theatre's revival of "Blithe Spirit" in 1976.

Coward wrote more than three hundred songs. The Noël Coward Society's website, drawing on performing statistics from the publishers and the <a href="PRS%20for%20Music">Performing Rights Society</a>, names "<a href="Mad%20About%20the%20Boy">Mad About the Boy</a>" (from "Words and Music") as Coward's most popular song, followed, in order, by:
In the society's second tier of favourites are:

Coward was no fan of the works of <a href="Gilbert%20and%20Sullivan">Gilbert and Sullivan</a>, but as a songwriter was nevertheless strongly influenced by them. He recalled: "I was born into a generation that still took light music seriously. The lyrics and melodies of Gilbert and Sullivan were hummed and strummed into my consciousness at an early age. My father sang them, my mother played them... my aunts and uncles, who were legion, sang them singly and in unison at the slightest provocation." His colleague Terence Rattigan wrote that as a lyricist Coward was "the best of his kind since <a href="W.%20S.%20Gilbert">W. S. Gilbert</a>."

New York State Route 319

New York State Route 319 (NY 319) was a <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> in <a href="Chenango%20County%2C%20New%20York">Chenango County</a>, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>, in the United States. It was long and connected the <a href="hamlet%20%28New%20York%29">hamlet</a> of Preston to the nearby city of <a href="Norwich%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Norwich</a>. The route began in the hamlet at an intersection with three county-maintained highways and proceeded eastward through the <a href="Preston%2C%20New%20York">town of Preston</a> to downtown Norwich, where it terminated at an intersection with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2012">NY 12</a>.

What became NY 319 was originally built during the early 19th century as the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, one of many privately maintained turnpikes in the state of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. The state of New York assumed ownership of the turnpike's routing in the early 20th century, and the Preston–Norwich state highway was designated as NY 319 as part of the <a href="1930%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28New%20York%29">1930 renumbering of state highways in New York</a>. Maintenance of NY 319 was split between the state and the city of Norwich, with the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation">New York State Department of Transportation</a> (NYSDOT) handling the part of the route west of the city limits.

In 1962, the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> approved a highway maintenance swap that would transfer the state-maintained section of NY 319 to Chenango County when a new alignment was constructed for <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2023">NY 23</a> through the northwestern part of the county. The project was completed in July 1984, at which time the NY 319 designation was completely removed and Chenango County assumed maintenance of the route's former alignment west of Norwich. The new county road was redesignated County Route 10A (CR 10A).

NY 319 began at an intersection with three county routes (<a href="County%20Route%204%20%28Chenango%20County%2C%20New%20York%29">CR 4</a>, <a href="County%20Route%2010%20%28Chenango%20County%2C%20New%20York%29">CR 10</a>, and <a href="County%20Route%2019%20%28Chenango%20County%2C%20New%20York%29">CR 19</a>) in the hamlet of Preston, a small community in the northern portion of the <a href="Preston%2C%20New%20York">town of the same name</a>. The highway proceeded eastward, climbing the side of a hill approximately above <a href="sea%20level">sea level</a> at its peak. NY 319 briefly descended to cross a creek then continued climbing, reaching an elevation of near Packer–Mason Cemetery. The route slowly descended in elevation from the cemetery, crossing Gilmore Brook on its way into the <a href="Norwich%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">town of Norwich</a>, where it intersected CR 19 for a second time just east of the town line. Past CR 19, the highway turned southeastward to descend the side of a ridge overlooking the <a href="Norwich%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">city of Norwich</a>.

At the bottom of the descent, the route turned eastward and crossed over Canasawacta Creek, a tributary of the Chenango River, as it entered the city of Norwich and became known as West Main Street. In Norwich, NY 319 served <a href="Emmanuel%20Episcopal%20Church%20Complex">Emmanuel Episcopal Church</a> and passed through the <a href="Chenango%20County%20Courthouse%20District">Chenango County Courthouse District</a>, established in 1975 in the city's downtown area. In the center of the historic district, NY 319 reached its eastern terminus at its intersection with <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2012">NY 12</a> (Broad Street). West Main Street becomes East Main Street at this junction, and the latter continues eastward as <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%20990L">NY 990L</a>, one of New York's <a href="reference%20route%20%28New%20York%29">reference route</a>s.

The <a href="Norwich%20%28town%29%2C%20New%20York">town of Norwich</a> was created on January 19, 1793, comprising a much larger area than it does today. On April 2, 1806, part of the town was split off to form a new town named <a href="Preston%2C%20New%20York">Preston</a>. A charter on April 8, 1808, established the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, a <a href="Toll%20road">turnpike</a> connecting the town of Preston in the west to the town of Norwich in the east. The Norwich and Preston Turnpike was privately owned and maintained, as most turnpikes in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a> were at the time.

The routing of the Norwich and Preston Turnpike was taken over by the state of New York in the early 20th century. On December 14, 1907, a contract was let to improve a long portion of the former turnpike. Construction cost $57,714 (equivalent to $ in 2019) and was completed by late 1908. The improved highway was added to the state highway system on November 16, 1908, as State Highway 598 (SH 598). A second contract to improve an additional of the turnpike was let on April 9, 1910. Work on this segment cost approximately $6,000 (equivalent to $ in 2019) and was completed by mid-1911. This section of the turnpike was added to the state highway system on July 22, 1911 as SH 598A. The first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924; however, none of the former Norwich and Preston Turnpike was assigned a designation at that time.

In the <a href="1930%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28New%20York%29">1930 renumbering of state highways in New York</a>, several of the routes assigned during the 1920s were renumbered or modified. At the same time, hundreds of state-maintained highways which did not yet have a route number, such as the Preston–Norwich state highway, were assigned one. The road was designated as NY 319 and maintained by the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Department%20of%20Transportation">New York State Department of Transportation</a> west of the <a href="Norwich%20%28city%29%2C%20New%20York">Norwich</a> city limits and by the city of Norwich within the city. The alignment of NY 319 remained unchanged for the next half-century.
Ownership and maintenance of NY 319 west of the Norwich city limits was slated to be transferred from the state of New York to <a href="Chenango%20County%2C%20New%20York">Chenango County</a> as part of a highway maintenance swap approved by the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Legislature">New York State Legislature</a> and signed into law on February 13, 1962. However, the swap in maintenance was contingent on the construction and completion of a new alignment for <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2023">NY 23</a> in northwestern Chenango County. The new road would extend from the Chenango–<a href="Cortland%20County%2C%20New%20York">Cortland</a> county border in the town of <a href="Pitcher%2C%20New%20York">Pitcher</a> to Scotts Corners in the town of <a href="Pharsalia%2C%20New%20York">Pharsalia</a>, a point west of the hamlet of North Pharsalia. At the time, NY 23 began at <a href="New%20York%20State%20Route%2026">NY 26</a> in northwest Pharsalia and followed an easterly and southerly routing to Scotts Corners, where it turned eastward onto its modern alignment. The portion of the exchange describing the roads that would be transferred to Chenango County is written in New York State Highway Law as follows, with annotations in parentheses:

The new highway in the towns of Pitcher and Pharsalia was completed in July 1984, at which time NY 23 was rerouted to follow the highway and the entirety of the pre-approved highway maintenance swap went into effect. Thus, ownership and maintenance of NY 23's old alignment through Pharsalia and the entirety of NY 319 west of Norwich was transferred to Chenango County. The former alignment of NY 23 became <a href="County%20Route%2042%20%28Chenango%20County%2C%20New%20York%29">CR 42</a> while the now county-maintained section of NY 319 was redesignated CR 10A, a spur of the pre-existing <a href="County%20Route%2010%20%28Chenango%20County%2C%20New%20York%29">CR 10</a>. The NY 319 designation was also removed from West Main Street in the city of Norwich at this time.

In 1997, the bridge that had carried NY 319 over Gilmore Brook in the town of Preston was replaced. The new structure handles an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">average</a> of 1,154 vehicles per day. Farther east, the bridge over Canasawacta Creek was also reconstructed in 1997. It was built in 1937 and carries an average of 2,093 cars per day.

Funerary Monument to Sir John Hawkwood

The Funerary Monument (or Equestrian Monument) to Sir John Hawkwood is a <a href="fresco">fresco</a> by <a href="Paolo%20Uccello">Paolo Uccello</a>, commemorating <a href="English%20people">English</a> "<a href="condottieri">condottiero</a>" <a href="John%20Hawkwood">John Hawkwood</a>, commissioned in 1436 for <a href="Florence">Florence</a>'s <a href="Florence%20Cathedral">Basilica di Santa Maria del Fiore</a>. The fresco is an important example of art commemorating a <a href="mercenary">soldier-for-hire</a> who fought in the Italian peninsula and is a seminal work in the development of <a href="perspective%20%28graphical%29">perspective</a>.

The politics of the commissioning and recommissioning of the fresco have been analyzed and debated by historians. The fresco is often cited as a form of "<a href="Florence">Florentine</a> propaganda" for its appropriation of a foreign soldier of fortune as a Florentine hero and for its implied promise to other "condottieri" of the potential rewards of serving Florence. The fresco has also been interpreted as a product of internal political competition between the <a href="Albizzi">Albizzi</a> and <a href="Medici">Medici</a> factions in <a href="History%20of%20Florence%23Renaissance">Renaissance Florence</a>, due to the latter's modification of the work's symbolism and iconography during its recommissioning.

The fresco is the oldest extant and authenticated work of Uccello, from a relatively well-known aspect of his career compared to the periods before and after its creation. The fresco has been restored (once by <a href="Lorenzo%20di%20Credi">Lorenzo di Credi</a>, who added the frame) and is now detached from the wall; it has been repositioned twice in modern times.

Hawkwood had a long military career and a complicated relationship with Florence. He fought for England during the <a href="Hundred%20Years%20War">Hundred Years War</a> and then with the "<a href="Great%20Company%20%28English%29">Great Company</a>" which had harassed the <a href="Avignon%20Papacy">Avignon Papacy</a>. After gaining command of the "<a href="White%20Company">White Company</a>" from <a href="List%20of%20condottieri">Albert Sterz</a> in the 1360s, Hawkwood led the company <a href="Principal%20passes%20of%20the%20Alps">across the Alps</a> in 1363 in the employ of <a href="John%20II%2C%20Marquess%20of%20Montferrat">John II, Marquess of Montferrat</a>, to take part in his war against <a href="Duchy%20of%20Milan">Milan</a>. Hawkwood and the "White Company" remained in Italy, accepting money from many <a href="Historical%20states%20of%20Italy">city-states</a>, both to wage war and to refrain from it. Hawkwood's reputation as one of the ablest "condottieri" in the peninsula developed in the ensuing decades, during which he was employed (by both sides) in the <a href="Pisa">Pisa</a>n–Florentine War (1363–1364), notably winning the <a href="Cascina">Battle of Cascina</a> (1364) for Florence, in the wars of <a href="Perugia">Perugia</a> against the Pope (1369), and in the service of <a href="Bernab%C3%B2%20Visconti">Bernabò Visconti</a> in his war against a coalition that included Pisa and Florence, and even (in 1372) the Marquis of Monteferrato.

Hawkwood then entered the service of <a href="Pope%20Gregory%20XI">Pope Gregory XI</a> in his wars against Milan (1372–1375) and in the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Eight%20Saints">War of the Eight Saints</a> (1375–1378), during which Hawkwood helped put down the Florentine-instigated rebellions in the <a href="Papal%20States">Papal States</a>. During the conflict, Hawkwood was paid 130,000 florins—which was extracted from local clergy, bishops, abbots, monasteries, and ecclesiastical institutions—to confine his activities to suppressing the rebellions in the Papal States, rather than directly attacking Florence. Hawkwood also received a 600 florin annual salary for the next five years and a lifetime annual pension of 1,200 florins.

Hawkwood married Donnina, the illegitimate daughter of <a href="Bernab%C3%B2%20Visconti">Bernabò Visconti</a>, in 1377. In that same year he defected to Florence. Hawkwood's 1377 massacre at <a href="Cesena">Cesena</a> during the twilight of his papal employment in the War of the Eight Saints continues to tarnish his legacy. Thus, until 1377, Hawkwood had principally served the <a href="House%20of%20Visconti">Visconti</a> of Milan and their allies in Pisa, <a href="Lucca">Lucca</a>, and <a href="Siena">Siena</a>, usually against the interests of Florence, making him an ironic candidate for a monument in the <a href="Florence%20cathedral">Duomo of Florence</a>. At the bidding of Pisa, Hawkwood attacked the <a href="Filippo%20Brunelleschi">Brunelleschi</a> family's Villa Petraia in Castello, burned Florentine subject territories around Incisa after defeating Florentine "condottiero" <a href="Ranuccio%20Farnese%20il%20Vecchio">Ranuccio Farnese il Vecchio</a>, and even taunted Florence from outside the city walls.

However, Hawkwood was the de facto commander-in-chief (<a href="Captain%20General">Captain-General</a>) of Florence's military from 1377 until immediately prior to his death in 1394. Hawkwood won many victories for Florence, including his suppression of the <a href="Ciompi">Ciompi revolt</a> in January 1382, but contemporary Florentines would have regarded Hawkwood's successful retreat from Milan late in his career, across three rivers—including the notorious <a href="Oglio">Oglio</a>—and across a barren countryside, as his "greatest military feat".

Hawkwood, now in his seventies, made preparations to return to England, where he had been sending money to acquire land, and set up a <a href="chantry">chantry</a>. Just as he was liquidating his affairs in Italy, he died, on March 17, 1394.

In 1395, <a href="Richard%20II%20of%20England">Richard II of England</a> petitioned Florence for the return of Hawkwood's body, as he had done for <a href="Robert%20de%20Vere%2C%20Duke%20of%20Ireland">Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland</a>, the local magnate to the Hawkwood family in England, in whose service he had begun his military career. Florence acquiesced to Richard II's request in a June 3, 1395 letter:
Our devotion can deny nothing to the eminence of your highness. We will leave nothing undone that is possible to do, so that we may fulfill your good pleasure. So, therefore, although we consider it reflected glory on us and our people to keep the ashes and bones of the late brave and most magnificent captain John Hawkwood, who, as commander of our army, fought most gloriously for us and who at public expense was interred in the principal church of Santa Reparata ... nevertheless, according to the tenor of your request, we freely concede permission that his remains shall return to their native land.

However, it remains an open question whether Hawkwood's remains were ever transferred to England, to the tomb prepared for him at St. Peter's in <a href="Sible%20Hedingham">Sible Hedingham</a>, or whether his remains were reburied in 1405 under the old <a href="choir%20%28architecture%29">choir</a> of the Duomo, of which record has been lost since it was repaved in the 16th century. In any case, the tomb monument would have run into difficulty, as a ban on tombs above floor level in the Cathedral was passed on April 5, 1400.

In the <a href="Quattrocento">Quattrocento</a>, it was traditional for "<a href="condottieri">condottieri</a>" like Hawkwood to be buried in major public churches, even when their careers had produced mixed results for the city-state in question. The genre of the <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian statue</a> was revived during the Quattrocento for the purpose of commemorating "condottieri"; <a href="Donatello">Donatello's</a> <a href="equestrian%20statue%20of%20Erasmo%20of%20Narni">Equestrian Statue of Gattamelata</a> (c. 1447–1453) in <a href="Padua">Padua</a> is the first surviving bronze equestrian statue since <a href="Ancient%20Rome">Ancient Rome</a>. <a href="List%20of%20condottieri">Tibertino Brandolino</a> was interred at <a href="San%20Francesco">San Francesco</a> in <a href="Venice">Venice</a>; <a href="List%20of%20condottieri">Jacopo de' Cavalli</a> at <a href="Santi%20Giovanni%20e%20Paolo%20%28Rome%29">SS. Giovanni e Paolo</a> in Rome; <a href="Savelli%20family">Paolo Savelli</a> at <a href="Frari">Basilica dei Frari</a> in Venice, along with a wooden equestrian statue on a marble sarcophagus, which—along with the bronze horses on the façade of St. Mark—may have inspired Uccello's "Hawkwood"; and <a href="List%20of%20condottieri">Konrad Aichelberg</a> at a church in Pisa. When such burials were not possible, frescoes were an acceptable substitute: <a href="List%20of%20condottieri">Guidoriccio da Fogliano</a> was <a href="Guidoriccio%20da%20Fogliano%20at%20the%20siege%20of%20Montemassi">painted on horseback</a> by <a href="Simone%20Martini">Simone Martini</a> in <a href="Palazzo%20Pubblico">Palazzo Pubblico</a> in Siena in 1328; <a href="Pietro%20Farnese">Pietro Farnese</a> was depicted in a <a href="papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9">papier-mâché</a> equestrian monument atop a sarcophagus in the Florence Cathedral in 1363.

Holding ever more lavish funeral ceremonies for fallen "condottieri" was only one way in which Italian city-states competed with each other to attract the services of the most skilled mercenaries. Hawkwood's funeral was sandwiched between the funerals in Siena of <a href="List%20of%20condottieri">Giovanni d'Azzo degli Ubaldini</a>—who had been poisoned by the Florentines in the Visconti wars—and <a href="List%20of%20condottieri">Giovanni "Tedesco" da Pietramala</a>.
The commissioning of Uccello to repaint the fresco came at the "climax" of a war with Lucca, which had recently begun a monument to honor <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20Piccinino">Niccolò Piccinino</a>, in contrast to Piccinino's "<a href="pittura%20infamante">defaming portrait</a>" in the <a href="Palazzo%20Vecchio">Palazzo della Signoria</a> in 1428, depicting him hanging upside-down in chains, which was "depaint[ed]" in April 1430.

On August 20, 1393—when the <a href="Signoria%20of%20Florence">Signoria</a>, at the suggestion of Coluccio Salutati, voted to erect a marble statue of Hawkwood in the Duomo, "that brave men may know that the commune of Florence recompenses true service"—Hawkwood was liquidating his Tuscan properties and preparing to return to England. It was unprecedented for the Signoria to vote to erect a monument to a living person in the cathedral. The ambiguous plans of the Signoria—which likely was aware of Hawkwood's health status—might well have been for a tomb rather than a <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a>; Hawkwood died soon after, on March 17, 1394. The Signoria went to great lengths (unsuccessfully) to entice Donnina to remain in the city—voting to transfer various sums of money to her (in exchange for Hawkwood's Tuscan fortress), despite "thorny legal issues" which required multiple acts of the city council—indicating to some extent the market value of Hawkwood's symbolic capital. 

Hawkwood's March 20 funeral began in the <a href="Piazza%20della%20Signoria">Piazza della Signoria</a>, continued to the <a href="Florence%20Baptistry">Battistero di San Giovanni</a>, where his body was placed on the baptismal font for public viewing, and culminated in the Cathedral, at a cost of 410 florins, not counting the substantial expenses of the Guilds.

The plans for Hawkwood's commemoration were modified on December 2, 1395, when it was decided to also rework the wooden monument of <a href="List%20of%20condottieri">Pietro Farnese</a>, the hero of the Pisan war, and to place marble tomb monuments to Farnese and Hawkwood on the north aisle, facing the high altar. Painters <a href="Agnolo%20Gaddi">Agnolo Gaddi</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Italian%20painters">Giuliano Arrighi</a> were selected by a committee to sketch directly onto the Duomo wall models for the Hawkwood and Farnese tombs. Although neither tomb was realized, documentary evidence suggests that a painting of Hawkwood—with a figure of Hawkwood by Gaddi and a sarcophagus by <a href="Francesco%20di%20Pesello">Pesello</a>—was completed by June 16, 1396. Historian <a href="Frances%20Stonor%20Saunders">Frances Stonor Saunders</a> speculates that Uccello may have based his representation of Hawkwood on this early painting and that the earlier painting may have been based on a <a href="death%20mask">death mask</a> of Hawkwood. The Hawkwood fresco is situated in the third bay of the northern wall, today flanked by paintings of <a href="Dante">Dante</a> (c. 1455) and a <a href="Equestrian%20Statue%20of%20Niccol%C3%B2%20da%20Tolentino">similar fresco monument</a> to fellow mercenary <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20da%20Tolentino">Niccolò da Tolentino</a> (1456, by <a href="Andrea%20del%20Castagno">Andrea del Castagno</a>); fictive tombs in fresco of two humanist ecclesiasts—Bishop Corsini (c. 1422, probably by <a href="List%20of%20Italian%20painters">Giovanni dal Ponte</a>) and Fra Luigi de' Marsigli (c. 1439 by <a href="Bicci%20di%20Lorenzo">Bicci di Lorenzo</a>), an Augustinian monk who founded a literary academy—are much smaller than those of the two "condottieri". The fresco probably came to replace the tomb (rather than serving as a place marker for it), maybe for reasons of expedience and frugality, although there is little documentary evidence on this regard.

The fresco was initially commissioned, decades after Hawkwood's death, in May 1433 by the Albizzi government, just months before the regime's collapse. Perhaps the project was an attempt by the Albizzi to hearken back to a time when the oligarchic elite of Florence had been more aligned with their own conservative interests. On July 13, 1433, design competition notices for the new monument were placed at the Duomo, the Baptistry, and <a href="Orsanmichele">Orsanmichele</a>. The instigators of the renewed project were the grandsons of Guido di Soletto del Pera Baldovinetti, one of the ambassadors who (unsuccessfully) pleaded with Hawkwood to return to Florence's service in 1389, and <a href="list%20of%20historians">Donato Velluti</a>, a 14th-century military and political historian. It is almost inconceivable that the commissioners of the monument would not have regarded Hawkwood as a self-interested mercenary, knowing that he often acted against the interests of Florence. After the launching of the design competition, in September 1433, <a href="Cosimo%20de%27%20Medici">Cosimo</a> and <a href="Medici">Averardo de' Medici</a> were exiled from Florence, for—among other things—allegedly attempting to embroil Florence in a war with Lucca.

After Cosimo's triumphant return to Florence, rather than scrapping the project, in May 1436 the Medici regime hired Uccello to replace the Gaddi and Pesello fresco. Hugh Hudson suggests that it would have been too risky for the Medici to cancel the Albizzi project, so they instead shrewdly modified it to fit their interests. There is, of course, some weakness to attributing the commissioning and recommissioning of the monument to Albizzi or Medici intrigues, as only two (maybe three) of the eight "operai" on July 13, 1433 were members of the Albizzi faction and only one was a Medici when it was resumed on May 18, 1436; yet the influences of both factions doubtlessly did not require blood relation. Around this time, documents attest to multiple repairs of a nearby window, opening the possibility that the original fresco had experienced water damage, and would have needed to be restored in any case. Others have suggested that the recommissioning was part of the "refurbishing" of the cathedral associated with its rededication as <a href="Florence%20Cathedral">Santa Maria del Fiore</a> by <a href="Pope%20Eugene%20IV">Pope Eugene IV</a> in March 1436. Yet, Borsi concludes that "undoubtedly under pressure from the Medici" the "operai" discarded their plans for a straightforward restoration of the Gaddi fresco and opted for a completely new monument.

The choice of Paolo Uccello (born in Florence in 1397), who had apprenticed for <a href="Lorenzo%20Ghiberti">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a> from June 1407, busying himself polishing the "<a href="Florence%20Baptistry%23Baptistry%20doors">Gates of Paradise</a>", may have been an attempt to find a painter knowledgeable in bronze and statuary, which the fresco was to mimic. For centuries, art historians have regarded Uccello as a less-prominent artist at the time of the Hawkwood commission: he is not mentioned in the preface of <a href="Leone%20Battista%20Alberti">Alberti</a>'s "De Pictura", nor in <a href="Domenico%20Veneziano">Domenico Veneziano</a>'s 1438 letter to <a href="Piero%20di%20Cosimo%20de%27%20Medici">Piero di Cosimo de' Medici</a> listing the major contemporary painters; nor have art historians even attempted to speculate that he studied the frescoes at the <a href="Brancacci%20Chapel">Brancacci Chapel</a>. One difficulty for art historians attempting to gauge Uccello's reputation at the time of the "Hawkwood"'s commissioning is the 10-year blind spot in the reconstruction of Uccello's career between 1415—when Uccello was made a member of the <a href="Guilds%20of%20Florence">Guild of Doctors and Apothecaries</a> ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali")—and his trip to Venice in 1425. Similarly, all the works of Uccello's Venetian period are either missing or else of uncertain attribution: Uccello is thought to have made a no-longer-existing mosaic of <a href="St.%20Peter">St. Peter</a> on the façade of <a href="St.%20Mark%27s%20Basilica">St. Mark's Basilica</a>, to have collaborated on the design of architectural structures for the mosaics in the Mascoli Chapel of St. Mark's by <a href="Michele%20Giambono">Michele Giambono</a>, and possibly to have made some geometrical pattern decorations for the interior of St. Mark's.

Uccello was known to have been in Venice in 1427 and to have returned to Florence by 1431, allowing a second window for historiographical speculation: some say he may have gone to Rome; others say he went directly to Florence. Uccello probably painted the "Creation of the Animals and Creation of Adam" (c. 1431) in the upper part of one of the bays of the Chiostro Verde (the "Green Cloister") in <a href="Santa%20Maria%20Novella">Santa Maria Novella</a>, which—like the "Hawkwood", as specified in its commission—is in the "terra verde" <a href="grisaille">grisaille</a> manner. Perhaps Uccello worked on the stories from the life of the <a href="Mary%20%28mother%20of%20Jesus%29">Virgin</a> and <a href="St.%20Stephen">St. Stephen</a> in the Chapel of Our Lady of the Assumption in the <a href="Prato%20Cathedral">Prato Cathedral</a> around 1435, although <a href="John%20Pope-Hennessy">Pope-Hennessy</a>, Pudelko, and Salmi all dispute this attribution.

Thus, the <a href="Florence%20Cathedral">Florence Cathedral</a> is the repository of all the extant works of Uccello whose attribution is firmly rooted in contemporary documents: two murals—the "Hawkwood" and the "Clock Face with Four Heads of Prophets or Evangelists" (1443)—and two stained glass windows—"Resurrection" (1443–1444) and "Nativity" (1443–1444). The "Hawkwood" is Uccello's "earliest dated and fully authenticated extant work".

Uccello's "Hawkwood" was completed, only to be ordered redone by the "capo maestro" of the Opera del Duomo, on June 28, 1436. Uccello was found not to have been at fault on July 6, and paid for both his first and second versions, the latter of which was finished before August 31. Incidentally, the second version—copied from the original, rather than direct observation—is the only true extant testimony to Hawkwood's appearance. The demanded redesign—which was ordered soon after post-Albizzi members secured a majority among the "operai"—is at the heart of any discussion about the political implications of the fresco. For centuries, art historians have argued that the rejection was rooted in questions of perspective and color, while more recent scholarship suggests it was the content of the fresco to which the "capo maestro" objected. The specific objections of the "capo maestro" are not documented—except that the fresco was "not painted as it should be", but it is clear that only the portion containing the horse and rider was to be erased and redone. A preparatory drawing in the <a href="Uffizi">Uffizi</a> with the same static scene is the primary clue to the appearance of the original fresco, in which Hawkwood was apparently more armored, taller, and—along with his horse—in a more militaristic stance. The "Hawkwood" thus both participated in and reinforced the Quattrocento trend that every Florentine public monument to a soldier of fortune employ a parade horse rather than a battle charger, in less than complete armor, and at a pace more suited for reviewing troops than charging into battle. A study which subjected the drawing to <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> rays confirmed that Uccello had originally depicted Hawkwood as "more threatening", with his baton raised and horse "at the ready".

The fresco's current appearance is not identical to the version redone by Uccello. The frame with <a href="candelabra">candelabra</a>-pattern decorations was added by <a href="Lorenzo%20di%20Credi">Lorenzo di Credi</a> in 1524, when he restored the fresco. In 1688, it was restored again, in refurbishments celebrating the marriage of <a href="Ferdinando%20%28III%29%20de%27%20Medici">Ferdinand de' Medici</a> and Violante of Bavaria. The fresco was restored and <a href="Transfer%20of%20panel%20paintings">transferred to canvas</a> in 1842 by Giovanni Rizzoli and moved to the west wall of the Duomo, only to be moved back to the north wall in 1947, after being mounted on a <a href="masonite">masonite</a> and aluminum support. It has been argued, based on Uccello's alleged use of <a href="Masaccio">Masaccio's</a> <a href="Perspective%20%28visual%29">eye-point perspective</a>, that the painting was originally five feet higher than it stands today. The fully restored fresco was also briefly taken down in 1953–1954 to be shown in the "Quattro Maestri" ("Four Masters") exhibition in Florence.

The reworked fresco has been seen as "classicizing" the image of the "condottieri", with the "terra verde" technique giving the <a href="conceit">conceit</a> of an <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian bronze statue</a>. The horse's proportions are based loosely upon those prescribed by Alberti in "De equo animante", which in turn is based upon the anonymous "Sonetto del Cavallo Perfetto"; however, in many ways the horse departs radically from Alberti's ideal of a harmonious and "lithe" creature in the style of <a href="Leonello%20d%27Este">Leonello d'Este's</a> monument to <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20III%20d%27Este">Niccolò III d'Este</a>, "Arco del Cavallo" in Ferrara. Furthermore, Uccello's perspective in the Hawkwood monument openly flaunted Alberti's conception of perspective as demarcated in "<a href="De%20Pictura">De Pictura</a>" (1435, translated into Italian as "Della Pittura" in 1436): the <a href="vanishing%20point">vanishing point</a> is at the eye-level of the spectator rather than within the field of the fresco, for example. Alberti's "De re aedificatoria" also objected to statues of soldiers and/or lay burials in churches. Although the fresco is often called "monochrome", its background is dark red, the horse and tomb are accented in red, black, white, and orange. The "<a href="Trompe-l%27%C5%93il">Trompe-l'œil</a>" perspective from the base, the "<a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>" <a href="relief">relief</a>-effect of the horse and the rider, and lighting from the left are similar to <a href="Masaccio">Masaccio's</a> <a href="Holy%20Trinity%20%28Masaccio%29">"Holy Trinity"</a>. The connection to Masaccio is so strong (or so often reported) that <a href="Albertini">Francesco Albertini</a> actually attributed the work to Massaccio in 1510. However, Uccello's fresco has two viewpoints: the horse and rider are painted as if on level with the spectator, and the <a href="cenotaph">cenotaph</a> is seen as if from below.

A variety of explanations have been proposed for this split perspective, which has even been suggested by <a href="Frederick%20Hartt">Frederick Hartt</a> to have been a <a href="practical%20joke">practical joke</a>. Entangled in these questions of perspective is <a href="Giorgio%20Vasari">Vasari</a>'s criticism of the horse's raising both its right legs at the same time, which would likely topple the horse, if accomplished. However, it is clear from Uccello's other works that he was not interested in using perspective simply for realism; rather, Uccello "placed in an unnatural, fantastic overall atmosphere, the fruit of this painter's complex and unique imagination". This style has even been cited as an example of synthetic realism in line with the late <a href="Gothic%20art">Gothic</a> movement.

Underscoring the classical elements of the fresco is the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> inscription, added on December 17, 1436 and penned by Bartolomeo Fortini de Orlandini, son of Benedetto di Ser Landi Fortini, former treasurer of Florence and apprentice of <a href="Alberti%20%28surname%29">Spinello Alberti</a>, one of the chief negotiators of Florence during the <a href="War%20of%20the%20Eight%20Saints">War of the Eight Saints</a>—the first such inscription on an antique sarcophagus in a Florentine painting. The inscription reads: ""Ioannes Acutus" "eques brittanicus dux aetatis suae cautissimus et rei militaris peritissimus habitus est"" (John Hawkwood, British knight, most prudent leader of his age and most expert in the art of war). The epitaph, likely a reference to Hawkwood's aforementioned "cautissimus" ("most prudent") retreat across the <a href="Oglio">Oglio</a>, is borrowed from the eulogy of Roman general <a href="Quintus%20Fabius%20Maximus%20Verrucosus">Fabius Maximus</a>, who wore down <a href="Hannibal">Hannibal</a> by tactical retreat and avoiding battle. The eulogy of Fabius Maximus comports so distinctly with <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">Quattrocento humanism</a> that some scholars have even dubbed it a "Renaissance fake".

By classicizing the "condottieri", the portrait may have represented an opportunity to—as <a href="Leonardo%20Bruni">Leonardo Bruni</a> had advocated—"revive the ancient form of tribute" by choosing a "long-dead and uncontroversial subject". Mallett has interpreted the fresco as a Medicean attempt to exalt "the praiseworthiness of "condottieri" to a populace with mixed feelings". In fact, Cosimo may have allowed the former Albizzi project to go through merely to pave the way for a similar honor for <a href="Niccol%C3%B2%20da%20Tolentino">Niccolò da Tolentino</a> (died 1435), a "condottiero" whom the Medici would have favored over Hawkwood. The Tolentino fresco was commissioned 20 years after the soldier of fortune's death, and was specified in its contract to be painted in "the same manner and form as the Hawkwood". Thus, the recommissioning of the portrait may be read as part of an ongoing debate over the appropriateness of "condottieri" for a Republic. Bruni raises this subject in "De militia" (1420), arguing for a standing Florentine militia, especially given the close ties between Tolentino and the Medici. Intending to depict Hawkwood as an "obedient captain conducting an inspection of troops", the conceit of Hawkwood patiently reviewing troops is "suggestive of a loyal communal servant".

The Medici may have wished to emphasize that point that any "condottiero", no matter how hostile or fickle, could be bought off and manipulated to Florentine interests and truly Florentinized. Attempts to claim Hawkwood as Florentine were well underway even before his death; for example, <a href="Pier%20Paolo%20Vergerio%20the%20Elder">Pier Paolo Vergerio the Elder</a> wrote in 1391 that Hawkwood "no longer has any foreign blood ... and has become regenerated more strongly and more healthful in fiber and body under the moderating sky of Italy". Such a viewpoint has even crept into modern scholarship: the 19th-century Italian historian <a href="Ercole%20Ricotti">Ercole Ricotti</a> called Hawkwood "the last of the foreign "condottieri" or the first of the Italian ones"; his 18th-century biography Domenico Maria Manni called him "general captain of Florentine armies" and virtually ignored two decades of Hawkwood's service to other city-states; even in the 20th century, <a href="list%20of%20historians">Friedrich Gaupp</a> attempted to characterize Hawkwood's direct attack on Florence as a "marriage proposal".

Decipherment of rongorongo

There have been numerous attempts to decipher the "<a href="rongorongo">rongorongo</a>" script of <a href="Easter%20Island">Easter Island</a> since its discovery in the late nineteenth century. As with most <a href="undeciphered%20scripts">undeciphered scripts</a>, many of the proposals have been fanciful. Apart from a portion of one tablet which has been shown to deal with a <a href="lunar%20calendar">lunar calendar</a>, none of the texts are understood, and even the calendar cannot actually be read. It is not known if "rongorongo" directly represents the <a href="Rapa%20Nui%20language">Rapa Nui language</a> – that is, if it is a true writing system – and oral accounts report that experts in one category of tablet were unable to read other tablets, suggesting either that "rongorongo" is not a unified system, or that it is <a href="proto-writing">proto-writing</a> that requires the reader to already know the text. There are three serious obstacles to decipherment, assuming that "rongorongo" is writing: the small number of <a href="Rongorongo%23classic%20texts">remaining texts</a>, comprising only 15,000 legible <a href="glyph">glyph</a>s; the lack of context in which to interpret the texts, such as illustrations or parallels to texts which can be read; and the fact that the modern Rapa Nui language is heavily mixed with <a href="Tahitian%20language">Tahitian</a> and is unlikely to closely reflect the language of the tablets—especially if they record a specialized <a href="register%20%28sociolinguistics%29">register</a> such as incantations—while the few remaining examples of the old language are heavily restricted in genre and may not correspond well to the tablets either.

Since a proposal by <a href="%23Butinov%20and%20Knorozov">Butinov and Knorozov</a> in the 1950s, the majority of <a href="philologists">philologists</a>, <a href="linguists">linguists</a> and cultural historians have taken the line that "rongorongo" was not true writing but proto-writing, that is, an <a href="ideogram">ideographic</a>- and <a href="rebus">rebus</a>-based <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> device, such as the <a href="Dongba%20script">Dongba script</a> of the <a href="Nakhi%20people">Nakhi people</a>, which would in all likelihood make it impossible to decipher. This skepticism is justified not only by the failure of the numerous attempts at decipherment, but by the extreme rarity of independent writing systems around the world. Of those who have attempted to decipher "rongorongo" as a true writing system, the vast majority have assumed it was <a href="logographic">logographic</a>, a few that it was <a href="syllabary">syllabic</a> or mixed. Statistically it appears to have been compatible with neither a pure logography nor a pure syllabary. The topic of the texts is unknown; various investigators have speculated they cover genealogy, navigation, astronomy, or agriculture. Oral history suggests that only a small elite were ever literate, and that the tablets were considered sacred.

In the late 19th century, within a few years to decades of the destruction of Easter Island society by slave raiding and introduced epidemics, two amateur investigators recorded readings and recitations of "rongorongo" tablets by Easter Islanders. Both accounts were compromised at best, and are often taken to be worthless, but they are the only accounts from people who may have been familiar with the script first-hand.

In 1868 the Bishop of Tahiti, <a href="Florentin-%C3%89tienne%20Jaussen">Florentin-Étienne Jaussen</a>, received a gift from recent converts on Easter Island: a long cord of human hair wound around a discarded rongorongo tablet. He immediately recognized the importance of the tablet, and asked Father <a href="Hippolyte%20Roussel">Hippolyte Roussel</a> on Easter Island to collect more tablets and to find islanders capable of reading them. Roussel was able to acquire only a few additional tablets, and he could find no-one to read them, but the next year in Tahiti Jaussen found a laborer from Easter Island, Metoro Tau‘a Ure, who was said to know the inscriptions "by heart".

Sometime between 1869 and 1874, Jaussen worked with Metoro to decipher four of the tablets in his possession: <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20A">A "Tahua</a>," <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20B">B "Aruku kurenga</a>," <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20C">C "Mamari</a>," and <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20E">E "Keiti</a>." A list of the glyphs they identified was published posthumously, along with a complete account of the chants for A and B. This is the famous "Jaussen list". Though at first taken for a <a href="Rosetta%20Stone">Rosetta Stone</a> of rongorongo, it has not led to an understanding of the script. It has been criticized for, among other inadequacies, glossing five glyphs as "<a href="porcelain">porcelain</a>", a material not found on Easter Island. However, this is a mistranslation: Jaussen glossed the five glyphs as "<a href="wikt%3Aporcelaine">porcelaine</a>," French for both "<a href="cowrie">cowrie</a>" and the cowrie-like <a href="Chinese%20ceramic">Chinese ceramic</a> which is called "porcelain" in English. Jaussen's Rapanui gloss, "pure," means specifically "cowrie".

Almost a century later, <a href="Thomas%20Barthel">Thomas Barthel</a> published some of Jaussen's notes. He compared Metoro's chants with parallel passages in other tablets and discovered that Metoro had read the lines of "Keiti" forwards on the reverse but backwards on the obverse. <a href="Jacques%20Guy">Jacques Guy</a> found that Metoro had also read the lunar calendar in "Mamari" backwards, and failed to recognize the "very obvious" pictogram of the full moon within it, demonstrating a lack of any understanding of the contents of the tablets.

William J. Thomson, paymaster on the <a href="USS%20Mohican%20%281883%29">USS "Mohican"</a>, spent twelve days on Easter Island from 19 December to 30 December 1886, during which time he made an impressive number of observations, including some which are of interest for the decipherment of the rongorongo.

Among the ethnographic data Thomson collected were the names of the nights of the <a href="lunar%20month">lunar month</a> and of the months of the year. This is key to interpreting the <a href="%23Barthel">single identifiable sequence of rongorongo</a>, and is notable in that it contains thirteen months; other sources mention only twelve. Métraux criticizes Thomson for translating "Anakena" as August when in 1869 Roussel identified it as July, and Barthel restricts his work to Métraux and Englert, because they are in agreement while "Thomson's list is off by one month". However, Guy calculated the dates of the new moon for years 1885 to 1887 and showed that Thomson's list fit the phases of the moon for 1886. He concluded that the ancient Rapanui used a <a href="lunisolar%20calendar">lunisolar calendar</a> with "kotuti" as its <a href="embolismic%20month">embolismic month</a> (its "leap month"), and that Thomson chanced to land on Easter Island in a year with a leap month.

Thomson was told of an old man called Ure Va‘e Iko who "professes to have been under instructions in the art of hieroglyphic reading at the time of the Peruvian raids, and claims to understand most of the characters". He had been the steward of <a href="King%20Nga%27ara">King Nga‘ara</a>, the last king said to have had knowledge of writing, and although he was not able to write himself, he knew many of the rongorongo chants and was able to read at least one memorized text. When Thomson plied him with gifts and money to read the two tablets he had purchased, Ure "declined most positively to ruin his chances for salvation by doing what his Christian instructors had forbidden" and finally fled. However, Thomson had taken photographs of Jaussen's tablets when the USS "Mohican" was in Tahiti, and he eventually cajoled Ure into reading from those photographs. The English-Tahitian landowner <a href="Alexander%20Salmon%2C%20Jr">Alexander Salmon</a> took down Ure's dictation, which he later translated into English, for the following tablets:

Salmon's Rapanui was not fluent, and apart from "Atua Matariri," which is almost entirely composed of proper names, his English translations do not match what he transcribed of Ure's readings. The readings themselves, seemingly reliable although difficult to interpret at first, become clearly ridiculous towards the end. The last recitation, for instance, which has been accepted as a love song on the strength of Salmon's English translation, is interspersed with Tahitian phrases, including words of European origin, such as "the French flag" "(te riva forani)" and "give money for revealing [this]" "(horoa moni e fahiti)," which would not be expected on a pre-contact text. 
The very title is a mixture of Rapanui and Tahitian: "pohera‘a" is Tahitian for "death"; the Rapanui word is "matenga". Ure was an unwilling informant: even with duress, Thomson was only able to gain his cooperation with "the cup that cheers" (that is, rum):
Nonetheless, while no one has succeeded in correlating Ure's readings with the rongorongo texts, they may yet have value for decipherment. The first two recitations, "Apai" and "Atua Matariri," are not corrupted with Tahitian. The verses of "Atua Matariri" are of the form "X ki ‘ai ki roto Y, ka pû te Z" "X, by mounting into Y, let Z come forth", 
and when taken literally, they appear to be nonsense: 
These verses have generally been interpreted as <a href="creation%20myth">creation chants</a>, with various beings begetting additional beings. However, they do not conform to Rapanui or other Polynesian creation mythology. Guy notes that the phrasing is similar to the way compound <a href="Chinese%20character">Chinese character</a>s are described. For example, the composition of the Chinese character 銅 "tóng" "copper" may be described as "add 同 "tóng" to 金 "jīn" to make 銅 "tóng"" (meaning "add Together to Metal to make Copper"), which is also nonsense when taken literally. He hypothesizes that the "Atua Matariri" chant which Ure had heard in his youth, although unconnected to the particular tablet for which he recited it, was a genuine rongorongo chant: A mnemonic which taught students how the glyphs were composed.

Since the late nineteenth century, there has been all manner of speculation about rongorongo. Most remained obscure, but a few attracted considerable attention.

In 1892 the Australian pediatrician Alan Carroll published a fanciful translation, based on the idea that the texts were written by an extinct "<a href="Hanau%20epe">Long-Ear</a>" population of Easter Island in a diverse mixture of <a href="Quechua%20languages">Quechua</a> and other languages of Peru and Mesoamerica. Perhaps due to the cost of casting special <a href="Movable%20type">type</a> for rongorongo, no method, analysis, or sound values of the individual glyphs were ever published. Carroll continued to publish short communications in "Science of Man," the journal of the <a href="Royal%20Anthropological%20Society%20of%20Australasia">(Royal) Anthropological Society of Australasia</a> until 1908. Carroll had himself founded the society, which is "nowadays seen as forming part of the 'lunatic fringe'."

In 1932 the Hungarian Vilmos Hevesy (Guillaume de Hevesy) published an article claiming a relationship between rongorongo and the <a href="Indus%20Valley%20script">Indus Valley script</a>, based on superficial similarities of form. This was not a new idea, but was now presented to the <a href="Acad%C3%A9mie%20des%20Inscriptions%20et%20Belles-Lettres">French Academy of Inscriptions and Literature</a> by the French <a href="Sinologist">Sinologist</a> <a href="Paul%20Pelliot">Paul Pelliot</a> and picked up by the press. Due to the lack of an accessible rongorongo corpus for comparison, it was not apparent that several of the rongorongo glyphs illustrated in Hevesy's publications were spurious. Despite the fact that both scripts were undeciphered (as they are to this day), separated by half the world and half of history ( and 4000 years), and had no known intermediate stages, Hevesy's ideas were taken seriously enough in academic circles to prompt a 1934 Franco–Belgian expedition to Easter Island led by <a href="Henri%20Lavachery">Lavachery</a> and <a href="Alfred%20M%C3%A9traux">Métraux</a> to debunk them (Métraux 1939). The Indus Valley connection was published as late as 1938 in such respected anthropological journals as "<a href="Man%20%28journal%29">Man</a>."

At least a score of decipherments have been claimed since then, none of which have been accepted by other rongorongo <a href="epigrapher">epigrapher</a>s. 
For instance, ethnographer <a href="Irina%20Konstantinovna%20Feodorova">Irina Fedorova</a> published purported translations of the two St Petersburg tablets and portions of four others. More rigorous than most attempts, she restricts each glyph to a single <a href="logogram">logographic</a> reading. However, the results make little sense as texts. For example, <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20P">tablet P</a> begins (with each rongorongo <a href="Typographic%20ligature">ligature</a> set off with a comma in the translation):

and continues in this vein to the end:

The other texts are similar. For example, the <a href="%23Barthel">"Mamari" calendar</a> makes no mention of time or the moon in Fedorova's account:

which even Fedorova characterized as "worthy of a maniac".

Moreover, the <a href="%23Pozdniakov">allographs detected by Pozdniakov</a> are given different readings by Fedorova, so that, for example, otherwise parallel texts repeatedly substitute the purported verb "take" for the purported noun "a kind of yam". (Pozdniakov has demonstrated that these are graphic variants of the same glyph.) As it was, Fedorova's catalog consisted of only 130 glyphs; Pozdniakov's additional allography would have reduced that number and made her interpretation even more repetitive. Such extreme repetition is a problem with all attempts to read rongorongo as a logographic script.

Many recent scholars are of the opinion that, while many researchers have made modest incremental contributions to the understanding of rongorongo, notably <a href="%23Kudrjavtsev">Kudrjavtsev "et al."</a>, <a href="%23Butinov%20and%20Knorozov">Butinov and Knorozov</a>, and <a href="%23Barthel">Thomas Barthel</a>, the attempts at actual decipherment, such as those of Fedorova here or of Fischer <a href="%23Fischer">below</a>, "are not accompanied by the least justification". All fail the key test of decipherment: a meaningful application to novel texts and patterns.

James Park Harrison, a council member of the <a href="Royal%20Anthropological%20Institute%20of%20Great%20Britain%20and%20Ireland">Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland</a>, noticed that lines Gr3–7 of the <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20G">Small Santiago tablet</a> featured a compound glyph, (a sitting figure holding a rod with a line of chevrons (a garland?) repeated 31 times, each time followed by one to half a dozen glyphs before its next occurrence. He believed that this broke the text into sections containing the names of chiefs. Barthel later found this pattern on tablet K, which is a paraphrase of Gr (in many of the K sequences the compound is reduced to as well as on A, where it sometimes appears as 380.1.3 and sometimes as 380.1; on C, E, and S as 380.1; and, with the variant on N. In places it appears abbreviated as or without the human figure, but parallels in the texts suggest these have the same separating function. Barthel saw the sequence as a "tangata rongorongo" (rongorongo expert) holding an inscribed staff like the Santiago Staff.

During World War II, a small group of students in Saint Petersburg (then Leningrad), Boris Kudrjavtsev, Valeri Chernushkov, and Oleg Klitin, became interested in tablets <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20P">P</a>, and <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20Q">Q</a>, which they saw on display at the <a href="Peter%20the%20Great%20Museum%20of%20Anthropology%20and%20Ethnography">Museum of Ethnology and Anthropology</a>. They discovered that they bore, with minor variation, the same text, which they later found on tablet <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20H">H</a> as well:

Barthel would later call this the "Grand Tradition", though its contents remain unknown.

The group later noticed that tablet <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20K">K</a> was a close paraphrase of the recto of <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20G">G</a>. Kudrjavtsev wrote up their findings, which were published posthumously. Numerous other parallel, though shorter, sequences have since been identified through statistical analysis, with texts <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20N">N</a> and <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20R">R</a> found to be composed almost entirely of phrases shared with other tablets, though not in the same order.

Identifying such shared phrasing was one of the first steps in unraveling the structure of the script, as it is the best way to detect ligatures and allographs, and thus to establish the inventory of rongorongo glyphs.

In 1957 the Russian epigraphers Nikolai Butinov and <a href="Yuri%20Knorozov">Yuri Knorozov</a> (who in 1952 had provided the key insights which would later lead to the decipherment of the <a href="Maya%20script">Maya writing system</a>) suggested that the repetitive structure of a sequence of some fifteen glyphs on Gv5–6 (lines 5 and 6 of the verso of the <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20G">Small Santiago Tablet</a>) was compatible with a genealogy. It reads in part,

Now, if the repeated independent glyph is a title, such as "king", and if the repeated attached glyph is a <a href="patronymic">patronymic</a> marker, then this means something like:

and the sequence is a lineage.

Although no-one has been able to confirm Butinov and Knorozov's hypothesis, it is widely considered plausible. If it is correct, then, first, we can identify other glyph sequences which constitute personal names. Second, the Santiago Staff would consist mostly of persons' names as it bears 564 occurrences of glyph 76, the putative patronymic marker, one fourth of the total of 2320 glyphs. Third, the sequence 606.76 700, translated by Fischer (<a href="%23Fischer">below</a>) as "all the birds copulated with the fish", would in reality mean "(So-and-so) son of 606 was killed." The Santiago Staff, with 63 occurrences of glyph a rebus for "îka" "victim", would then be in part a "kohau îka" (list of war casualties).

German ethnologist <a href="Thomas%20Barthel">Thomas Barthel</a>, who first published the rongorongo corpus, identified three lines on the recto (side a) of <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20C">tablet C</a>, also known as "Mamari," as a lunar calendar. Guy proposed that it was more precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two <a href="Intercalation%20%28timekeeping%29">intercalary</a> nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to keep it in sync with the phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come before or after the full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the intercalary nights should appear. The "Mamari" calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.

In Guy's interpretation, the core of the calendar is a series of 29 left-side crescents ("☾", colored red on the photo of the table at right) on either side of the full moon, a pictogram of "te nuahine kā ‘umu ‘a rangi kotekote" 'the old woman lighting an <a href="Earth%20oven%23the%20Pacific">earth oven</a> in the "kotekote" sky'—the <a href="Man%20in%20the%20Moon">Man in the Moon</a> of Oceanic mythology. These correspond to the 28 basic and two intercalary nights of the <a href="Rapa%20Nui%20calendar">old Rapa Nui lunar calendar</a>.

These thirty nights, starting with the new moon, are divided into eight groups by a "heralding sequence" of four glyphs (above, and colored purple on the tablet at right) which ends in the pictogram of a fish on a line (yellow). The heralding sequences each contain two right-side lunar crescents ("☽"). In all four heralding sequences preceding the full moon the fish is head up; in all four following it the fish is head down, suggesting the waxing and waning of the moon. The way the crescents are grouped together reflects the patterns of names in the old calendar. The two ☾ crescents at the end of the calendar, introduced with an expanded heralding sequence, represent the two intercalary nights held in reserve. The eleventh crescent, with the bulge, is where one of those nights is found in Thomson's and Métraux's records.

Guy notes that the further the Moon is from the Earth in its eccentric orbit, the <a href="Kepler%27s%20laws%20of%20planetary%20motion">slower it moves</a>, and the more likely the need to resort to an intercalary night to keep the calendar in sync with its phases. He hypothesizes that the "heralding sequences" are instructions to observe the apparent diameter of the Moon, and that the half-size superscripted crescents (orange) preceding the sixth night before and sixth night after the full moon represent the small apparent diameter at <a href="apogee">apogee</a> which triggers intercalation. (The first small crescent corresponds to the position of "hotu" in Thomson and Métraux.)

Seven of the calendrical crescents (red) are accompanied by other glyphs (green). Guy suggests syllabic readings for some of these, based on possible rebuses and correspondences with the names of the nights in the old calendar. The two sequences of six and five nights without such accompanying glyphs (beginning of line 7, and transition of lines 7–8) correspond to the two groups of six and five numbered "kokore" nights, which do not have individual names.

In 1995 independent linguist Steven Fischer, who also claims to have deciphered the enigmatic <a href="Phaistos%20Disc">Phaistos Disc</a>, announced that he had cracked the rongorongo "code", making him the only person in history to have deciphered two such scripts. In the decade since, this has not been accepted by other researchers, who feel that Fischer overstated the single pattern which formed the basis of his decipherment, and note that it has not led to an understanding of other patterns.

Fischer notes that the long text of the 125-cm <a href="Rongorongo%20text%20I">Santiago Staff</a> is unlike other texts in that it appears to have punctuation: The 2,320-glyph text is divided by "103 vertical lines at odd intervals" which do not occur on any of the tablets. Fischer remarked that glyph identified as a possible patronymic marker by Butinov and Knorozov, is attached to the first glyph in each section of text, and that "almost all" sections contain a multiple of three glyphs, with the first bearing a 76 "suffix".

Fischer identified glyph 76 as a <a href="phallus">phallus</a> and the text of the Santiago Staff as a <a href="Creation%20myth">creation chant</a> consisting of hundreds of repetitions of "X–phallus Y Z," which he interpreted as "X copulated with Y, there issued forth Z." His primary example was this one:

about half-way through line 12 of the Santiago Staff. Fischer interpreted glyph 606 as "bird"+"hand", with the phallus attached as usual at its lower right; glyph 700 as "fish"; and glyph 8 as "sun".

On the basis that the Rapanui word "ma‘u" "to take" is nearly homophonous with a plural marker "mau," he posited that the hand of 606 was that plural marker, via a semantic shift of "hand" → "take", and thus translated 606 as "all the birds". Taking "penis" to mean "copulate", he read the sequence 606.76 700 8 as "all the birds copulated, fish, sun".

Fischer supported his interpretation by claiming similarities to the recitation "<a href="%23Atua%20Matariri">Atua Matariri</a>," so called from its first words, which was collected by William Thomson. This recitation is a litany where each verse has the form "X, ki ‘ai ki roto ki Y, ka pû te Z," literally "X having been inside Y the Z comes forward". Here is the first verse, according to Salmon and then according to Métraux (neither of whom wrote glottal stops or long vowels):

Fischer proposed that the glyph sequence 606.76 700 8, literally "bird:hand.penis fish sun", had the analogous phonetic reading of:

He claimed similar phallic triplets for several other texts. However, in the majority of texts glyph 76 is not common, and Fischer proposed that these were a later, more developed stage of the script, where the creation chants had been abbreviated to "X Y Z" and omit the phallus. He concluded that 85% of the rongorongo corpus consisted of such creation chants, and that it was only a matter of time before rongorongo would be fully deciphered.

There are a number of objections to Fischer's approach:




In the 1950s, Butinov and Knorozov had performed a statistical analysis of several rongorongo texts and had concluded that either the language of the texts was not Polynesian, or that it was written in a condensed <a href="Telegraphese">telegraphic style</a>, because it contained no glyphs comparable in frequency to Polynesian <a href="grammatical%20particle">grammatical particle</a>s such as the Rapanui <a href="article%20%28grammar%29">articles</a> "te" and "he" or the preposition "ki." These findings have since been used to argue that rongorongo is not a writing system at all, but <a href="mnemonic">mnemonic</a> <a href="proto-writing">proto-writing</a>. However, Butinov and Knorozov had used Barthel's preliminary encoding, which Konstantin Pozdniakov, senior researcher at the <a href="Kunstkamera">Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography</a> of the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a> in Saint Petersburg (until 1996), noted was inappropriate for statistical analysis. The problem, as Butinov and Knorozov, and Barthel himself, had admitted, was that in many cases distinct numerical codes had been assigned to ligatures and allographs, as if these were independent glyphs. The result was that while Barthel's numerical transcription of a text enabled a basic discussion of its contents for the first time, it failed to capture its linguistic structure and actually interfered with inter-text comparison.

In 2011, Pozdniakov released a pre-press publication analyzing Text E "Keiti", including a glyph-by-glyph comparison of the transcription in Barthel (1958), with misidentified glyphs corrected per Horley (2010).

To resolve this deficiency, Pozdniakov (1996) reanalyzed thirteen of the better preserved texts, attempting to identify all ligatures and allographs in order to better approach a one-to-one correspondence between <a href="grapheme">grapheme</a>s and their numeric representation. He observed that all these texts but I and G "verso" consist predominantly of shared phrases (sequences of glyphs), which occur in different orders and contexts on different tablets. By 2007 he had identified some one hundred shared phrases, each between ten and one hundred glyphs long. Even setting aside the completely parallel texts Gr–K and the 'Grand Tradition' of H–P–Q, he found that half of the remainder comprises such phrases:

These shared sequences begin and end with a notably restricted set of glyphs. For example, many begin or end, or both, with glyph 62 (an arm ending in a circle: or with a ligature where glyph 62 replaces the arm or wing of a figure (see the ligature image under <a href="%23Kudrjavtsev">Kudrjavtsev "et al."</a>).

Contrasting these phrases allowed Pozdniakov to determine that some glyphs occur in apparent <a href="free%20variation">free variation</a> both in isolation and as components of ligatures. Thus he proposed that the two hand shapes, (three fingers and a thumb) and (a four-fingered forked hand), are graphic variants of a single glyph, which also attaches to or replaces the arms of various other glyphs:

The fact the two hands appear to substitute for each other in all these pairs of glyphs when the repeated phrases are compared lends credence to their identity. Similarly, Pozdniakov proposed that the heads with "gaping mouths", as in glyph are variants of the bird heads, so that the entirety of Barthel's 300 and 400 series of glyphs are seen as either ligatures or variants of the 600 series.

Despite finding that some of the forms Barthel had assumed were allographs appeared instead to be independent glyphs, such as the two orientations of his glyph 27, the overall conflation of allographs and ligatures greatly reduced the size of Barthel's published 600-glyph inventory. By recoding the texts with these findings and then recomparing them, Pozdniakov was able to detect twice as many shared phrases, which enabled him to further consolidate the inventory of glyphs. By 2007, he and his father, a pioneer in Russian computer science, had concluded that 52 glyphs accounted for 99.7% of the corpus. From this he deduced that rongorongo is essentially a <a href="syllabary">syllabary</a>, though mixed with non-syllabic elements, possibly determinatives or logographs for common words (see below). The data analysis, however, has not been published.

The shared repetitive nature of the phrasing of the texts, apart from Gv and I, suggests to Pozdniakov that they are not integral texts, and cannot contain the varied contents which would be expected for history or mythology. In the following table of characters in the Pozdniakov & Pozdniakov inventory, ordered by descending frequency, the first two rows of 26 characters account for 86% of the entire corpus.

With a rigorously derived inventory, Pozdniakov was able to test his ideas about the nature of the script. He tabulated the <a href="Probability%20distribution">frequency distributions</a> of glyphs in ten texts (excluding the divergent Santiago Staff) and found that they coincided with the distribution of syllables in ten archaic Rapanui texts such as the "<a href="%23Apai">Apai</a>" recitation, with nearly identical deviations from an ideal <a href="Zipf%27s%20law">Zipfian distribution</a>. He took this as evidence both for rongorongo being essentially syllabic and for its being consistent with the Rapanui language. For example, the most common glyph, 6, and the most common syllable, , both make up 10% of their corpora; the syllables "te" and "he," which Butinov and Knorozov found so problematic, could at 5.7% and 3.5% be associated with any number of common rongorongo glyphs. In addition, the numbers of glyphs linked or fused together closely match the numbers of syllables in Rapanui words, both in the texts overall and in their respective <a href="lexicon">lexicon</a>s, suggesting that each combination of glyphs represents a word:

In both corpora there were many more monosyllables/single glyphs in running text than in the lexicon. That is, in both a relatively small number of such forms are very frequent, suggesting that rongorongo is compatible with Rapanui, which has a small number of very frequent monosyllabic grammatical particles. Rongorongo and Rapanui are also almost identical in the proportion of syllables/glyphs found in isolation and in initial, medial, and final position within a word/ligature.

However, while such statistical tests demonstrate that rongorongo is "consistent" with a syllabic Rapanui script, syllables are not the only thing which can produce this result. In the Rapanui texts, some two dozen common polysyllabic words, such as "ariki" 'leader', "ingoa" 'name', and "rua" 'two', have the same frequency as a score of syllables, while other syllables such as are less frequent than these words.

This suspicion that rongorongo may not be fully syllabic is supported by positional patterns within the texts. The distributions of Rapanui syllables within polysyllabic words and of rongorongo glyphs within ligatures are very similar, strengthening the syllabic connection. However, monosyllabic words and isolated glyphs behave very differently; here rongorongo does not look at all syllabic. For example, all glyphs but are attested in isolation, whereas only half of the 55 Rapanui syllables occur as monosyllabic words. Furthermore, among those syllables which do occur in isolation, their rate of doing so is much lower than that of the glyphs: Only three syllables, , , and , occur more than half the time in isolation (as grammatical particles), whereas a score of glyphs are more commonly found in isolation than not. Contextual analysis may help explain this: Whereas Rapanui monosyllables are grammatical particles and generally precede polysyllabic nouns and verbs, so that monosyllables rarely occur together, isolated rongorongo glyphs are "usually" found together, suggesting a very different function. Pozdniakov hypothesizes that the difference may be due to the presence of <a href="determinative">determinative</a>s, or that glyphs have dual functions, as <a href="phonogram%20%28linguistics%29">phonograms</a> in combination but as <a href="logogram">logogram</a>s in isolation, parallel to the <a href="Maya%20script">Maya script</a>. On the other hand, no glyph approaches the frequency, when in isolation, of the articles "te" and "he" or the preposition "ki" in running text. It may be that these particles were simply not written, but Pozdniakov suspects that they were written together with the following word, as is the case with prepositions and articles in <a href="Classical%20Latin">Classical Latin</a> and <a href="Arabic%20language%23writing%20system">written Arabic</a>.

Further complicating this picture are repetition patterns. There are two types of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in "mamari," and grammatical <a href="reduplication">reduplication</a> of disyllables, as seen in "rongorongo." In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in "mamari" are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as "rongorongo" are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice as likely as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.

The results of statistical analysis will be strongly affected by any errors in identifying the inventory of glyphs, as well as by divergence from a purely syllabic representation, such as a glyph for reduplication. There are also large differences in the frequencies of individual syllables among the Rapanui texts, which makes any direct identification problematic. While Pozdniakov has not been able to assign any phonetic values with any certainty, statistical results do place constraints on which values are possible.

One possibility for a logogram of the most common word in Rapanui, the article "te," is the most common glyph, which does not pattern like a phonogram. Glyph 200 occurs mostly in initial position and is more frequent in running text than any syllable in the Rapanui lexicon, both characteristics of the article. A possibility for a reduplicator glyph is which is also very common and does not pattern like a phonogram, but occurs predominantly in final position.

Because a repeated word or phrase, such as the ubiquitous "ki ‘ai ki roto" in the "Atua Matariri" recitation, will skew the statistics of that text, phonetic frequencies are best compared using word lists (considering each word individually) rather than the full texts. Pozdniakov used a few basic correlations between Rapanui and rongorongo to help narrow down the possible phonetic values of the glyphs. For instance, the relative frequencies of rongorongo glyphs in initial, medial, and final position in a ligature presumably constrain their possible sound values to syllables with similar distributions within the lexicon. Syllables beginning with "ng," for example, are more common at the ends of words than in initial position. The overall frequencies, and the patterns of doubling and reduplication, on the other hand, seem to associate arm glyphs specifically with vocalic syllables:


The exceptionally high frequencies of glyph and of the syllable , everywhere except when doubled, suggest that glyph 6 may have the sound value . Pozdniakov proposes with less confidence that the second most extreme glyph, might have the sound value .

As Pozdniakov readily admits, his analysis is highly sensitive to the accuracy of the glyph inventory. Since he has not published the details of how he established this inventory, it is not possible for others to verify his work.

As of 2008, there has been little response to Pozdniakov's approach. However, Sproat (2007) believes that the results from the frequency distributions are nothing more than an effect of <a href="Zipf%27s%20Law">Zipf's Law</a>, and furthermore that neither rongorongo nor the old texts were representative of the Rapanui language, so that a comparison between them is unlikely to be enlightening.

Freedom of Worship (painting)

Freedom of Worship or Freedom to Worship is the second of the "<a href="Four%20Freedoms%20%28Norman%20Rockwell%29">Four Freedoms</a>" oil paintings produced by the American artist <a href="Norman%20Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a>. The series was based on the goals known as the <a href="Four%20Freedoms">Four Freedoms</a> enunciated by the 32nd President of the United States, <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>, in his <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">State of the Union Address</a> delivered on January 6, 1941. Rockwell considered this painting and "<a href="Freedom%20of%20Speech%20%28painting%29">Freedom of Speech</a>" the most successful of the series. "Freedom of Worship" was published on the 27th of February, 1943, issue of "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>" alongside an essay by philosopher <a href="Will%20Durant">Will Durant</a>.

"Freedom of Worship" is the second of a series of four oil paintings by <a href="Norman%20Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a> entitled "<a href="Four%20Freedoms%20%28Norman%20Rockwell%29">Four Freedoms</a>". The works were inspired by President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">State of the Union Address</a> delivered to the <a href="77th%20United%20States%20Congress">77th United States Congress</a> on January 6, 1941, known as <a href="Four%20Freedoms">Four Freedoms</a>. Of the Four Freedoms, the only two described in the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a> are <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">freedom of speech</a> and <a href="freedom%20of%20religion">freedom of religion</a>. The Four Freedoms' theme was later incorporated into the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allies</a>' World War II policy statement, the <a href="Atlantic%20Charter">Atlantic Charter</a>, and became part of the charter of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. The series of paintings ran on four consecutive weeks in "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>", accompanied by essays from noted writers: "<a href="Freedom%20of%20Speech%20%28painting%29">Freedom of Speech</a>" (February 20), "Freedom of Worship" (February 27), "<a href="Freedom%20from%20Want%20%28painting%29">Freedom from Want</a>" (March 6) and "<a href="Freedom%20from%20Fear%20%28painting%29">Freedom from Fear</a>" (March 13). For the essay accompanying "Freedom of Worship", "Post" editor Ben Hibbs chose Durant, who was a best-selling author at the peak of his fame. At the time, Durant was in the midst of working on his ten-volume "<a href="The%20Story%20of%20Civilization">The Story of Civilization</a>", coauthored with his wife, <a href="Ariel%20Durant">Ariel Durant</a>. Will Durant also lectured on history and philosophy. Eventually, the series of paintings became widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the <a href="Series%20E%20bond">U.S. Government War Bond</a> Drive.

The painting shows the profiles of eight heads in a modest space. The various figures represent people of different faiths in a moment of prayer. Particularly, three figures on the bottom row (right to left): a man with <a href="Kippah">his head covered</a> carrying a religious book who is <a href="American%20Jews">Jewish</a>, an older woman who is <a href="Protestantism%20in%20the%20United%20States">Protestant</a>, and a younger woman with a well-lit face holding <a href="rosary%20beads">rosary beads</a> who is <a href="Catholic%20Church%20in%20the%20United%20States">Catholic</a>. In 1966, Rockwell used "Freedom of Worship" to show his admiration for <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a> in a "<a href="Look%20%28American%20magazine%29">Look</a>" story illustration entitled "JFK's Bold Legacy". The work depicts Kennedy in profile in a composition similar to "Freedom of Worship" along with <a href="Peace%20Corps">Peace Corps</a> volunteers.

The original version of the painting was set in a barbershop with patrons of a variety of religions and races all waiting their turn in the barber's chair. His first workup was a oil on canvas depicting tolerance as "the basis for a democracy's religious diversity". It included a Jew being served by a Protestant barber as a black man and a Roman Catholic priest awaited the barber's services. The problem was painting easily recognizable depictions of different religions and races because there was little agreement on what a person of a certain religion should look like. However, as he attempted to clarify the characters' depictions he found himself resorting to offensive overexaggeration, especially of the non-clerical characters. Making a Jewish man appear stereotypically Semitic, making a white customer preppy and relegating the black man to agrarian workman attire bogged down the work without speaking on behalf of the government as it should. Rockwell's intended theme was religious tolerance, but he felt the original composition did not successfully make this point.

In June 1942, "Post" editor Ben Hibbs became supportive of Rockwell's Four Freedoms sketches, and gave Rockwell two months to complete the works. By October, the "Post" was worried about Rockwell's progress on the "Four Freedoms" and sent their art editor to Arlington to evaluate. At that time Rockwell was working on "Freedom of Worship", his second painting in the series. Rockwell spent two months (October and most of November 1942) on this work, that was inspired by the phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience." His <a href="Arlington%2C%20Vermont">Arlington, Vermont</a>, neighbors served as his models: Three months pregnant with her hair upbraided, Rose Hoyt posed as a Catholic with a rosary, even though she was actually Protestant of the <a href="Episcopal%20Church%20%28United%20States%29">Episcopal Church</a>. Other models were a Mrs. Harrington, Rockwell's carpenter Walter Squires, Squire's wife Clara Squires (at the right-hand edge), Winfield Secoy, and Jim Martin (center). His final version relied on other visual clues, including a rosary and a religious book. The work had dark-skinned black worshipers juxtaposed on the edges. This placement did not rock the boat with "The Post" who had not yet featured blacks prominently on its pages. Rockwell said he made these ethnics palatable by "'furtively' painting the face of the black woman at the top; the man at the bottom, with his <a href="fez%20%28hat%29">fez</a>, was too obviously foreign to offend." The image is commonly enhanced and often darkened in reproduction because it uses a color combination of soft greys, beiges and browns. The paint was applied thinly, which allows the weave of the canvas to contribute to the image.

Rockwell has stated that he feels hands are second only to heads in importance to the expression of a story. He stated with regards to "Freedom of Worship", "I depended on the hands alone to convey about half of the message I wish to put over." Rockwell's extensive effort on this work was due to his belief that religion "is an extremely delicate subject. It is so easy to hurt so many people's feelings."

"Post" editor Ben Hibbs said of "Speech" and "Worship", "To me they are great human documents in the form of paint and canvas. A great picture, I think is one which moves and inspires millions of people. The "Four Freedoms" did — and do." <a href="Walt%20Disney">Walt Disney</a> wrote, "I thought your Four Freedoms were great. I especially loved the Freedom of Worship and the composition and symbolism expressed in it." Rockwell believed that "Freedom of Worship" and "<a href="Freedom%20of%20Speech%20%28painting%29">Freedom of Speech</a>" were his better results in the series. <a href="Laura%20Claridge">Laura Claridge</a> has written that the inspirational phrase "Each according to the dictates of his own conscience" is a "platitude that suggests the plurality of Rockwell's own thoughts on religion: its likely source was a phrase included in the "<a href="Articles%20of%20Faith%20%28Latter%20Day%20Saints%29">Thirteen Articles of Faith</a>" by <a href="Joseph%20Smith">Joseph Smith</a>." In fact, Rockwell repeatedly asked colleagues about possible sources of the quote and was not told about Smith's writing until after the series was published. The expression "according to the dictates of his conscience" (or a similar variation) was used in many United States state constitutions in the eighteenth century.

Critical review of the painting shows that some practitioners of particular faiths are disappointed by the acceptance of all faiths expressed in "Freedom of Religion". Claridge feels that the tight amalgam of faces ... and even the crepey skin on elderly hands, which have become the objects of worship, push the theme over the edge from idealistic tolerance into gooey sentiment, where human differences seem caught up in a magical moment of dispensation from the Light. The restraint demanded by art that deals with heightened emotion is lacking. Claridge stated that the earlier version was "clean, impressively sparse, in counterpoise to a dense narrative content. Beautifully painted even at the preliminary oil sketch stage." Murray and McCabe note that the work is a divergence from the "storytelling style" that Rockwell is known for.

<a href="Deborah%20Solomon">Deborah Solomon</a> considers the painting the least satisfactory of the series as she feels it is congested and somewhat "didactic". Maureen Hart Hennessey, chief curator of the <a href="Norman%20Rockwell%20Museum">Norman Rockwell Museum</a>, and curator Anne Knutson consider the scale of the picture that only shows heads and hands in prayer as disruptive. Bruce Cole of "<a href="The%20Wall%20Street%20Journal">The Wall Street Journal</a>" noted that Rockwell's "depiction of spectral close-up faces and hands raised in prayer is bland, without any real message about religious freedom—again, no wallop. This is because faith, like the absence of fear and the absence of want, is essentially private, something personal, intangible and unpicturable."

In 2018 <a href="Sharon%20Brous">Sharon Brous</a>, among others, was on the cover of "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>"; the cover was based on this painting.

Freedom from Want (painting)

Freedom from Want, also known as The Thanksgiving Picture or I'll Be Home for Christmas, is the third of the <a href="Four%20Freedoms%20%28Norman%20Rockwell%29">"Four Freedoms" series</a> of four <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a>s by American artist <a href="Norman%20Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a>. The works were inspired by <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">United States President</a> <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s 1941 <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union%20Address">State of the Union Address</a>, known as <a href="Four%20Freedoms">Four Freedoms</a>.

The painting was created in November 1942 and published in the March 6, 1943 issue of "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>". All of the people in the picture were friends and family of Rockwell in <a href="Arlington%2C%20Vermont">Arlington</a>, <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a>, who were photographed individually and painted into the scene. The work depicts a group of people gathered around a dinner table for a holiday meal. Having been partially created on <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving Day</a> to depict the celebration, it has become an iconic representation for Americans of the Thanksgiving holiday and family holiday gatherings in general. "The Post" published "Freedom from Want" with a corresponding essay by <a href="Carlos%20Bulosan">Carlos Bulosan</a> as part of the "Four Freedoms" series. Despite many who endured <a href="sociopolitical">sociopolitical</a> hardships abroad, Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring the <a href="socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> hardships domestically, and it thrust him into prominence.

The painting has had a wide array of adaptations, parodies, and other uses, such as for the cover for the 1946 book "Norman Rockwell, Illustrator". Although the image was popular at the time in the United States and remains so, it caused resentment in Europe where the masses were enduring wartime hardship. Artistically, the work is highly regarded as an example of mastery of the challenges of white-on-white painting and as one of Rockwell's most famous works.

"Freedom from Want" is the third in a series of four oil paintings entitled "<a href="Four%20Freedoms%20%28Norman%20Rockwell%29">Four Freedoms</a>" by <a href="Norman%20Rockwell">Norman Rockwell</a>. They were inspired by , known as <a href="Four%20Freedoms">Four Freedoms</a>, delivered to the <a href="77th%20United%20States%20Congress">77th United States Congress</a> on January 6, 1941. In the early 1940s, Roosevelt's Four Freedoms themes were still vague and abstract to many, but the government used them to help boost patriotism. The Four Freedoms' theme was eventually incorporated into the <a href="Atlantic%20Charter">Atlantic Charter</a>, and it became part of the charter of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. The series of paintings ran in "<a href="The%20Saturday%20Evening%20Post">The Saturday Evening Post</a>" accompanied by essays from noted writers on four consecutive weeks: "<a href="Freedom%20of%20Speech%20%28painting%29">Freedom of Speech</a>" (February 20), "<a href="Freedom%20of%20Worship%20%28painting%29">Freedom of Worship</a>" (February 27), "Freedom from Want" (March 6), and "<a href="Freedom%20from%20Fear%20%28painting%29">Freedom from Fear</a>" (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the <a href="Series%20E%20bond">U.S. Government War Bond Drive</a>.

The illustration is an <a href="Oil%20Painting%23Supports%20for%20oil%20painting">oil painting on canvas</a>, measuring . The <a href="Norman%20Rockwell%20Museum">Norman Rockwell Museum</a> describes it as a story illustration for "The Saturday Evening Post", complementary to the theme, but the image is also an autonomous visual expression.

The painting shows an aproned matriarch presenting a roasted <a href="Turkey%20%28bird%29">turkey</a> to a family of several generations, in Rockwell's idealistic presentation of family values. The patriarch looks on with fondness and approval from the head of the table, which is the central element of the painting. Its creased tablecloth shows that this is a special occasion for "sharing what we have with those we love", according to Lennie Bennett. The table has a bowl of fruit, celery, pickles, and what appears to be <a href="cranberry%20sauce">cranberry sauce</a>. There is a covered silver serving dish that would traditionally hold potatoes, according to Richard Halpern, but Bennett describes this as a covered <a href="casserole">casserole</a> dish. The servings are less prominent than the presentation of white linen, white plates and water-filled glasses. The people in the painting are not yet eating, and the painting contrasts the empty plates and vacant space in their midst with images of overabundance.

In mid-June Rockwell sketched in charcoal the "Four Freedoms" and sought commission from the <a href="United%20States%20Office%20of%20War%20Information">Office of War Information</a> (OWI). He was rebuffed by an official who said, "The last war, you illustrators did the posters. This war, we're going to use fine arts men, real artists." However, "Saturday Evening Post" editor, Ben Hibbs, recognized the potential of the set and encouraged Rockwell to produce them right away. By early fall, the authors for the Four Freedoms had submitted their essays. Rockwell was concerned that "Freedom from Want" did not match Bulosan's text. In mid-November, Hibbs wrote Rockwell pleading that he not scrap his third work to start over. Hibbs alleviated Rockwell's thematic concern; he explained that the illustrations only needed to address the same topic rather than be in unison. Hibbs pressured Rockwell into completing his work by warning him that the magazine was on the verge of being compelled by the government to place restrictions on four-color printing, so Rockwell had better get the work published before relegation to halftone printing.

In 1942, Rockwell decided to use neighbors as <a href="model%20%28art%29">models</a> for the series. In "Freedom from Want", he used his living room for the setting and relied on neighbors for advice, critical commentary, and their service as his models. For "Freedom from Want", Rockwell photographed his cook as she presented the turkey on <a href="Thanksgiving%20%28United%20States%29">Thanksgiving Day</a> 1942. He said that he painted the turkey on that day and that, unlike "Freedom of Speech" and "Freedom of Worship", this painting was not difficult to execute. Rockwell's wife Mary is in this painting, and the family cook, Mrs. Thaddeus Wheaton, is serving the turkey, which the Rockwell family ate that day. The nine adults and two children depicted were photographed in Rockwell's studio and painted into the scene later. The models are (clockwise from Wheaton) Lester Brush, Florence Lindsey, Rockwell's mother Nancy, Jim Martin, Mr. Wheaton, Mary Rockwell, Charles Lindsey, and the Hoisington children. Jim Martin appears in all four paintings in the series. Shirley Hoisington, the girl at the end of the table, was six at the time.

After the "Four Freedoms" series ran in "The Saturday Evening Post", the magazine made sets of reproductions available to the public and received 25,000 orders. Additionally the OWI, which six months earlier had declined to employ Rockwell to promote the Four Freedoms, requested 2.5 million sets of posters featuring the Four Freedoms for its war-bond drive in early 1943.

Rockwell bequeathed this painting to a custodianship that became the Norman Rockwell Museum in <a href="Stockbridge%2C%20Massachusetts">Stockbridge</a>, <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>, and it is now part of the museum's permanent collection. Rockwell lived in Stockbridge from 1953 until his death in 1978.

"Freedom from Want" is considered one of Rockwell's finest works. Of the four paintings in the "Four Freedoms", it is the one most often seen in art books with critical review and commentary. Although all were intended to promote patriotism in a time of war, "Freedom from Want" became a symbol of "family togetherness, peace, and plenty", according to Linda Rosenkrantz, who compares it to "a '<a href="Hallmark%20Cards">Hallmark</a>' Christmas". Embodying nostalgia for an enduring American theme of holiday celebration, the painting is not exclusively associated with Thanksgiving, and is sometimes known as "I'll Be Home for Christmas". The abundance and unity it shows were the idyllic hope of a post-war world, and the image has been reproduced in various formats.

According to author Amy Dempsey, during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, Rockwell's images affirmed traditional American values, depicting Americans as prosperous and free. Rockwell's work came to be categorized within <a href="art%20movements">art movements</a> and <a href="Style%20%28visual%20arts%29">styles</a> such as <a href="Regionalism%20%28art%29">Regionalism</a> and <a href="American%20scene%20painting">American scene painting</a>. Rockwell's work sometimes displays an idealized vision of America's rural and agricultural past. Rockwell summed up his own idealism: "I paint life as I would like it to be."

Despite Rockwell's general optimism, he had misgivings about having depicted such a large turkey when much of Europe was "starving, overrun [and] displaced" as <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a> raged. Rockwell noted that this painting was not popular in Europe: "The Europeans sort of resented it because it wasn't freedom from want, it was overabundance, the table was so loaded down with food." Outside the United States, this overabundance was the common perception. However, Richard Halpern says the painting not only displays overabundance of food, but also of "family, conviviality, and security", and opines that "overabundance rather than mere sufficiency is the true answer to want." He parallels the emotional nourishment provided by the image to that of the food nourishment that it depicts, remarking that the picture is noticeably inviting. However, by depicting the table with nothing but empty plates and white dishes on white linen, Rockwell may have been invoking the <a href="Puritan">Puritan</a> origins of the Thanksgiving holiday.

To art critic <a href="Robert%20Hughes%20%28critic%29">Robert Hughes</a>, the painting represents the theme of family continuity, virtue, homeliness, and abundance without extravagance in a Puritan tone, as confirmed by the modest beverage choice of water. Historian <a href="Lizabeth%20Cohen">Lizabeth Cohen</a> says that by depicting this freedom as a celebration in the private family home rather than a worker with a job or a government protecting the hungry and homeless, Rockwell suggests that ensuring this freedom was not as much a government responsibility as something born from participation in the mass consumer economy.

One of the notable and artistically challenging elements of the image is Rockwell's use of white-on-white: white plates sitting on a white tablecloth. Art critic <a href="Deborah%20Solomon">Deborah Solomon</a> describes this as "one of the most ambitious plays of white-against-white since <a href="James%20Abbott%20McNeill%20Whistler">Whistler</a>'s """. Solomon further describes the work as "a new level of descriptive realism. Yet, the painting doesn't feel congested or fussy; it is open and airy in the center. Extensive passages of white paint nicely frame the individual faces."

Jim Martin, positioned in the lower right, gives a coy and perhaps mischievous glance back at the viewer. He is a microcosm of the entire scene in which no one appears to be giving thanks in a traditional manner of a Thanksgiving dinner. Solomon finds it a departure from previous depictions of Thanksgiving in that the participants do not lower their heads or raise their hands in the traditional poses of prayer. She sees it as an example of treating American traditions in both sanctified and casual ways. Theologian <a href="David%20Brown%20%28theologian%29">David Brown</a> sees gratitude as implicit in the painting, while Kenneth Bendiner writes that Rockwell was mindful of the <a href="Last%20Supper">Last Supper</a> and that the painting's perspective echoes its <a href="Last%20Supper%20%28Tintoretto%29">rendition by Tintoretto</a>.
"Freedom from Want" was published with an essay by <a href="Carlos%20Bulosan">Carlos Bulosan</a> as part of the "Four Freedoms" series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic <a href="socioeconomic">socioeconomic</a> hardships rather than <a href="sociopolitical">sociopolitical</a> hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of "Freedom From Want". Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. "Post" editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20the%20Philippines">Commonwealth of the Philippines</a>, a United States territory, was <a href="Japanese%20occupation%20of%20the%20Philippines">occupied by Japan</a>. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by "The Post", and Bulosan, who had no <a href="carbon%20copy">carbon copy</a>, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in <a href="Tacoma%2C%20Washington">Tacoma</a>.

"Freedom From Want" had previously been less entwined in the standard <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a> philosophies of the <a href="western%20world">western world</a> than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats <a href="Negative%20liberty">negative liberties</a> as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be "given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities", an echo of <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a>'s "from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs". In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase "The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world" describes an egalitarian America. In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as "<a href="The%20Grapes%20of%20Wrath">The Grapes of Wrath</a>", Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as "haunting and sharp" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty. It proposed that while citizens had obligations to the state, the state had an obligation to provide a basic level of subsistence. Unlike Roosevelt, Bulosan presented the case that the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> had not already granted freedom from want as it did not guarantee Americans the essentials of life.

USS Princess Matoika

USS "Princess Matoika" (ID-2290) was a transport ship for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> during World War I. Before the war, she was a that sailed as SS "Kiautschou for the <a href="Hamburg%20America%20Line">Hamburg America Line</a> and as SS "Princess Alice (sometimes spelled Prinzess Alice) for <a href="North%20German%20Lloyd">North German Lloyd</a>. After her World War I Navy service ended, she served as the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> transport ship USAT "Princess Matoika. In post-war civilian service she was SS "Princess Matoika until 1922, SS "President Arthur until 1927, and SS "City of Honolulu until she was scrapped in 1933.

Built in 1900 for the <a href="German%20Empire">German</a> Far East mail routes, SS "Kiautschou" traveled between Hamburg and Far East ports for most of her Hamburg America Line career. In 1904, she was traded to competitor North German Lloyd for five <a href="cargo%20ship">freighters</a>, and renamed SS "Princess Alice". She sailed both transatlantic and Far East mail routes until the outbreak of World War I, when she was interned in the neutral port of <a href="Cebu%20City">Cebu</a> in the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a>. Seized by the U.S. in 1917, the newly renamed USS "Princess Matoika" carried over 50,000 U.S. troops to and from France in U.S. Navy service from 1918 to 1919. As an Army transport after that, she continued to return troops and repatriated the remains of Americans killed overseas in the war. In July 1920, she was a last-minute substitute to carry a large portion of the United States team to the <a href="1920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920 Summer Olympics</a> in Antwerp. From the perspective of the Olympic team, the trip was disastrous and a majority of the team members published a list of grievances and demands of the <a href="United%20States%20Olympic%20Committee">American Olympic Committee</a> in an action known today as the <a href="Mutiny%20of%20the%20Matoika">Mutiny of the "Matoika"</a>.

After her Army career ended, "Princess Matoika" was transferred to the <a href="United%20States%20Mail%20Steamship%20Line">United States Mail Steamship Line</a> for European passenger service in early 1921. After that company's financial troubles resulted in her seizure, "Princess Matoika" was assigned to the newly formed <a href="United%20States%20Lines">United States Lines</a> and resumed passenger service. In 1922, the ship was renamed SS "President Arthur", in honor of the 21st <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a>, <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>. When changes in U.S. laws severely curtailed the number of immigrants that could enter the country in the early 1920s, the ship was laid up in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> in late 1923.

"President Arthur" was purchased in October 1924 by the Jewish-owned <a href="American%20Palestine%20Line">American Palestine Line</a> to begin regular service between New York, <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, and <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a>. On her maiden voyage to Palestine, she reportedly became the first ocean liner to fly the <a href="Flag%20of%20Israel">Zionist flag</a> at sea and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers. Financial difficulties for American Palestine ended the service after three roundtrips, and the liner was sold to the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Steamship%20Company">Los Angeles Steamship Company</a> for Los Angeles–<a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a> service. Following three years of carrying tourists and freight, the liner burned in <a href="Honolulu%20Harbor">Honolulu Harbor</a> in 1930. She was deemed too expensive to repair and was eventually scrapped in Japan in 1933.

In March 1900 the <a href="Hamburg%20America%20Line">Hamburg America Line</a> (German: Hamburg-Amerikanische Packetfahrt-Aktien-Gesellschaft or HAPAG) announced the plans for 22 new ships totaling at a cost of $11,000,000. One of the two largest ships announced was SS "Kiautschou" at an announced . The ship was <a href="Keel%20laying">laid down</a> at <a href="AG%20Vulcan%20Stettin">AG Vulcan Stettin</a> in <a href="Stettin">Stettin</a>, Germany (present-day <a href="Szczecin">Szczecin</a>, Poland). During her construction, HAPAG renamed the ship twice before finally settling on <a href="Kiautschou%20Bay%20concession">Kiautschou</a>, the German colony in China, as her namesake. Built, along with sister ship , for HAPAG's entry into the <a href="Reichspost%23Deutsche%20Reichspost">Deutsche Reichspost's</a> Far East routes, "Kiautschou" was launched on 14 September 1900, and sailed on her maiden voyage from <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> to the Far East on 22 December 1900.

The ship was long and featured twin screws powered by two <a href="quadruple%20expansion">quadruple expansion</a> <a href="steam%20engine">steam engine</a>s that generated . The liner also featured <a href="bilge%20keel">bilge keel</a>s that helped stabilize her ride. On the interior, "Kiautschou"s first-class <a href="state%20room">state room</a>s were described as "light and large" and located in the center of the ship. She had two large <a href="promenade%20deck">promenade deck</a>s, a music room, and a library. Her <a href="smoking%20room">smoking room</a> was at the rear of the upper promenade deck, and her large dining room featured a balcony where the ship's orchestra could serenade diners.

"Kiautschou" sailed on the Hamburg–Far East route until May 1902. For one round trip that month, "Kiautschou" replaced fellow HAPAG steamer on Hamburg–New York service, calling at <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> and <a href="Cherbourg">Cherbourg</a> on her eastbound trip, and at Cherbourg and <a href="Plymouth">Plymouth</a> on her westbound return. After this one transatlantic excursion, "Kiautschou" was returned to Hamburg–Far East service. On 20 February 1904, in exchange for abandoning the mail routes shared with <a href="North%20German%20Lloyd">North German Lloyd</a>, HAPAG traded "Kiautschou" for Lloyd <a href="cargo%20ship">freighters</a> "Bamberg", "Königsberg", "Nürnberg", "Stolberg", and "Strassburg".

North German Lloyd renamed the newly acquired ship "Princess Alice", though the German spelling "Prinzess Alice" was widely used in contemporary press coverage and, often, by the Lloyd themselves. There is some confusion as to who exactly was the namesake of the ship. Edwin Drechsel, in his two-volume work "Norddeutscher Lloyd, Bremen, 1857–1970", reports that the ship was named equally for <a href="Princess%20Alice%2C%20Countess%20of%20Athlone">Princess Alice of Albany</a> and <a href="Alice%20Roosevelt%20Longworth">Alice Roosevelt</a>. Princess Alice of Albany was a granddaughter of <a href="Victoria%2C%20Queen%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom</a>, and the new bride of <a href="Alexander%20Cambridge%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Athlone">Prince Alexander</a> of <a href="Teck">Teck</a> in <a href="W%C3%BCrttemberg">Württemberg</a>. Alice Roosevelt, daughter of the then-current U.S. President <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>, was nicknamed "Princess Alice" by the press, and had <a href="ship%20naming%20and%20launching">launched</a> the racing yacht of <a href="William%20II%2C%20German%20Emperor">Kaiser Wilhelm II</a>, "Meteor", at <a href="Staten%20Island">Staten Island</a> two years before. <a href="William%20Lowell%20Putnam">William Lowell Putnam</a> gives the namesake as <a href="Princess%20Alice%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Princess Alice of the United Kingdom</a>, the daughter of Queen Victoria.
"Princess Alice" departed her new homeport of <a href="Bremen">Bremen</a> on 22 March 1904 for her maiden voyage under her new owners. After arriving in New York draped in flags and bunting, her dining room was the site of a press luncheon thrown by Lloyd staff celebrating her first arrival in that city. "Princess Alice" made four more roundtrips through early August, then shifted to Bremen–<a href="Suez%20Canal">Suez Canal</a>–Far East service, making her first Lloyd voyage on that route 31 August. "Princess Alice" would continue this pattern—sailing the North Atlantic during the heaviest-trafficked season and shifting to the Far East runs for the balance of the year—through 1910.

Throughout the rest of her Lloyd North Atlantic career she carried some notable passengers to and from Europe. In May 1905, for example, noted Baltimore <a href="gynecologist">gynecologist</a> <a href="Howard%20Atwood%20Kelly">Howard Atwood Kelly</a>, one of the co-founders of <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a>, sailed from New York; author <a href="Hamilton%20Wright%20Mabie">Hamilton Wright Mabie</a> and his wife sailed from New York the following month. American botanist <a href="Charles%20Frederick%20Millspaugh">Charles Frederick Millspaugh</a> returned to New York aboard the German liner in June 1906, and retired U.S. Navy <a href="Rear%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Rear admiral</a> <a href="Alfred%20Thayer%20Mahan">Alfred Thayer Mahan</a> did the same in June 1907. Senator <a href="Augustus%20Octavius%20Bacon">Augustus O. Bacon</a> (<a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">D</a>-<a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">GA</a>), sailed for Europe on 1 August 1908.

Prompted by the successful use of <a href="radio">wireless</a> in saving lives during the sinking of in January 1909, and by proposed U.S. legislation (later passed as the <a href="Wireless%20Ship%20Act%20of%201910">Wireless Ship Act of 1910</a>) requiring wireless for ships calling at U.S. ports, "Princess Alice" received her first wireless set in February 1909. Operating with call letters "DKZ" on the 300 m band, her radio had a range.
At 10:00 on 27 May 1909, loaded with over 1,000 passengers headed for Europe, "Princess Alice" departed the Lloyd pier in <a href="Hoboken%2C%20New%20Jersey">Hoboken</a>, New Jersey. As she neared <a href="The%20Narrows">The Narrows</a> in a heavy fog, she steamed to stay clear of outbound <a href="Compagnie%20G%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20Transatlantique">French Line</a> steamer and ran hard aground on a submerged rocky ledge near the <a href="seawall">seawall</a> of <a href="Fort%20Wadsworth">Fort Wadsworth</a> a few minutes after 11:00. After the fog lifted, it was revealed that the bow of "Princess Alice" had stopped some from the outer walls of the Staten Island fort. <a href="Lighthouse%20tender">Lighthouse tender</a> "Larkspur" was the first ship to come to the aid of the "Princess", followed by <a href="United%20States%20Army">U.S. Army</a> <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Quartermaster%20Corps">Quartermaster's ship</a> "General Meigs" and <a href="Cutter%20%28ship%29">revenue cutter</a> <a href="USRC%20Seneca">"Seneca"</a>. No passengers were hurt in the incident and it was determined there was no damage to the hull of the liner. But, despite the effort of attending ships, she remained stuck on the ledge. Eventually, after offloading of cargo from her front <a href="Hold%20%28ship%29">hold</a> onto <a href="lighter%20%28barge%29">lighters</a> called to the scene, ten steam <a href="tug">tug</a>s and power from "Princess Alice"s own engines freed the ship at 01:47 on 28 May, almost 15 hours after running aground. The force required to free the liner was great enough that she was then propelled into SS "Marken", at anchor some distance away, damaging one of that ship's <a href="Fender%20%28boating%29">fenders</a>. After then making her way to the nearby <a href="New%20York%20City%20Quarantine%20Station">New York City Quarantine Station</a>, "Princess Alice" anchored to reload her cargo, and by 09:05, she was underway again. However, she ran aground again in soft mud in <a href="Ambrose%20Channel">Ambrose Channel</a> at 10:15. This time she was able to free herself and proceeded on to Bremen, a little more than 24 hours late. This voyage was further marred by the apparent suicide of a despondent New York attorney on 30 May. The man, headed to the spa town of <a href="Bad%20Nauheim">Bad Nauheim</a> in Hesse, had previously suffered a <a href="nervous%20breakdown">nervous breakdown</a> and was under the care of a doctor on board the ship at the time he jumped overboard.
In May 1910, "Princess Alice" sailed her last North Atlantic passage for her German owners. Put permanently on the Far East route, she plied Pacific waters for North German Lloyd until the outbreak of World War I. In late July 1914, as war spread across Europe, "Princess Alice" neared her destination of Hong Kong with £850,000 of gold from <a href="India">India</a>. Rather than face seizure of the ship and her cargo by British authorities there, "Princess Alice" instead sped to the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> and deposited the gold with the German Consul at <a href="Manila">Manila</a>. Leaving the neutral port in under 24 hours, the ship then rendezvoused with German <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> at <a href="Angaur">Angaur</a> before returning to the Philippines in early August and putting in at <a href="Cebu%20City">Cebu</a> where she was interned.

On 6 April 1917 the United States declared war and immediately seized interned German ships at U.S. and territorial ports, but unlike most other German ships interned by the United States, "Princess Alice" had not been sabotaged by her German crew before her seizure. Assigned the Identification Number of 2290, she was soon renamed "Princess Matoika". Sources disagree about the identity of the ship's namesake, who is often reported as either a member of the Philippine Royal Family, or a Japanese princess. Putnam, however, provides another answer: one of the given names of <a href="Pocahontas">Pocahontas</a> was "Matoaka", which was sometimes spelled "Matoika". The newly renamed ship was taken to <a href="Olongapo%20City">Olongapo City</a>, north of <a href="Manila">Manila</a> and placed in the <a href="drydock">drydock</a> "<a href="Drydock%20Dewey%20%28YFD-1%29">Dewey</a>" at <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Base%20Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a> where temporary repairs were made. She then made her way to San Francisco, and eventually to the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">east coast</a>. "Princess Matoika" was the last ex-German ship to be commissioned.

Placed under the command of <a href="William%20D.%20Leahy">William D. Leahy</a> in April 1918, the ship was readied for her first transatlantic troop run. At <a href="Newport%20News%2C%20Virginia">Newport News</a>, Virginia, elements of the <a href="4th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">4th Infantry Division</a> boarded on 9 May. Sailing at 18:30 the next day, "Princess Matoika" was accompanied by American transports , , , , and , the British steamer "Kursk", and the Italian . The group rendezvoused with a similar group that left New York the same day, consisting of , , , British troopship , and Italian steamers and . American <a href="cruiser">cruiser</a> served as escort for the assembled ships, which were the 35th U.S. convoy of the war. During the voyage—because of the inability to finish serving three meals for all the men during daylight hours—mess service was curtailed to two daily meals, a practice continued on later voyages. On 20 May, the convoy sighted and fired on a "submarine" that turned out to be a bucket; the next day escort "Frederick" left the convoy after being relieved by nine destroyers. Three days later the convoy sighted land at 06:30 and anchored at <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a> that afternoon. "Princess Matoika" sailed for Newport News and arrived there safely on 6 June with "Pastores" and "Lenape". Fate, however, was not as kind to former convoy mates "President Lincoln" and "Dwinsk". On their return journeys they were sunk by German submarines <a href="SM%20U-90">"U-90"</a> and <a href="SM%20U-151">"U-151"</a>, respectively.
After loading officers and men from the <a href="29th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">29th Infantry Division</a> on 13 June, "Princess Matoika" set sail from Newport News the next day with "Wilhelmina", "Pastores", "Lenape", and British troopship . On the morning of 16 June, lookouts on "Princess Matoika" spotted a submarine and, soon after, a torpedo heading directly for the ship. The torpedo missed her by a few yards and gunners manning the ship's  guns claimed a hit on the sub with their second shot. Later that morning, the Newport News ships met up with the New York portion of the convoy—which included , , , , "Covington", "Rijndam", "Dante Alighieri", and British steamer "Vauben"—and set out for France. The convoy was escorted by cruisers and "Frederick", and <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s and ; <a href="battleship">battleship</a> and several other destroyers joined in escort duties for the group for a time. The convoy had a false alarm when a floating barrel was mistaken for submarine, but otherwise uneventfully arrived at Brest on the afternoon of 27 June. "Princess Matoika", "Covington", "Lenape", "Rijndam", "George Washington", "DeKalb", "Wilhelmina", and "Dante Alighieri" left Brest as a group on 30 June. The following evening at 21:15, "Covington" was torpedoed by <a href="Unterseeboot%2086%20%281916%29">"U-86"</a> and sank the next afternoon. "Princess Matoika" and "Wilhelmina" arrived back at Newport News on 13 July.
Around this time, Commander Leahy left "Princess Matoika" to serve as Director of Gunnery Exercises and Engineering Performance in Washington. For his service on "Princess Matoika", though, Leahy was awarded the <a href="Navy%20Cross%20%28United%20States%29">Navy Cross</a>. He was cited for distinguished service as commander of the ship while "engaged in the important, exacting and hazardous duty of transporting and escorting troops and supplies through waters infested with enemy submarines and mines".

In the next months, "Princess Matoika" successfully completed two additional roundtrips from Newport News. On the first trip, she left Newport News with "DeKalb", "Dante Alighiere", "Wilhelmina", "Pastores", and British troopship on 18 July. The group joined a New York contingent and arrived in France on 30 July. Departing soon after, the "Princess" returned to Newport News on 13 August. Nine days later she departed in the company of the same ships from her last convoy—with French steamer "Lutetia" replacing "DeKalb"—and arrived in France on 3 September. "Princess Matoika" returned stateside two weeks later.

On 23 September, "Princess Matoika" departed New York with 3,661 officers and men accompanied by transports , , "Rijndam", "Wilhelmina", British steamer "Ascanius", and was escorted by battleship , cruisers and "North Carolina", and destroyer . As with other Navy ships throughout 1918, "Princess Matoika" was not immune to the worldwide <a href="Spanish%20flu">Spanish flu</a> pandemic. On this particular crossing, two of her crewmen were felled by the disease as her convoy reached <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a> on 6 October. After her return to the U.S. on 21 October, she departed New York once again on 28 October, arriving in France on 9 November, two days before the <a href="Armistice%20with%20Germany%20%28Compi%C3%A8gne%29">Armistice</a>. In all, she carried 21,216 troops to France on her six trips overseas.

With the fighting at an end, the task of bringing home American soldiers began almost immediately. "Princess Matoika" did her part by carrying home 30,110 healthy and wounded men in eight roundtrips. On 20 December, 3,000 troops boarded her and departed France for Newport News, arriving there on 1 January 1919. Among those carried were <a href="Major%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Major General</a> <a href="Charles%20T.%20Menoher">Charles T. Menoher</a>, the newly appointed chief of the air service, and elements of the <a href="39th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">39th Infantry Division</a>. The "Matoika" arrived with another 2,000 troops on 11 February.
In March 1919, "Princess Matoika" and "Rijndam" raced each other from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News in a friendly competition that received national press coverage in the United States. "Rijndam", the slower ship, was just able to edge out the "Princess"—and cut two days from her previous fastest crossing time—by appealing to the honor of the soldiers of the 133rd Field Artillery (returning home aboard the former <a href="Holland%20America">Holland America</a> liner) and employing them as extra <a href="stoker%20%28occupation%29">stokers</a> for her boilers.

On her next trip, the veteran transport loaded troops at <a href="Saint-Nazaire">Saint-Nazaire</a> that included nine complete hospital units. After two days delay because of storms in the <a href="Bay%20of%20Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a>, "Princess Matoika" departed on 16 April, and arrived at Newport News on 27 April with 3,500 troops. Shifting south to <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston</a>, South Carolina, the "Matoika" embarked 2,200 former German <a href="prisoner%20of%20war">prisoners of war</a> (POWs) and hauled them to <a href="Rotterdam">Rotterdam</a>. This trip was followed up in May with the return of portions of the <a href="79th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">79th Infantry Division</a> from Saint-Nazaire to New York.

In mid-July, "Princess Matoika" delivered another load of 1,900 former German POWs from Charleston to Rotterdam; most of these prisoners were officers and men from interned German passenger liners and included Captain Heinler the former commander of . One former POW, shortly after debarking in Europe, presciently commented that "this [was] no peace; only a temporary truce". After loading American crews of returned Dutch ships, "Princess Matoika" called at <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> and Brest before returning to New York on 1 August.

The ship departed New York on 8 August for her final roundtrip as a Navy transport. She departed Brest 23 August and returned to New York on 10 September. She was decommissioned there on 19 September, and handed over to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> for use as a United States Army transport.

As her career as an Army transport began, "Princess Matoika" picked up where her Navy career had ended and continued the return of American troops from Europe. After returning to France she loaded 2,965 troops at Brest—including <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="Wilds%20P.%20Richardson">W. P. Richardson</a> and members of the <a href="Polar%20Bear%20Expedition">Polar Bear Expedition</a>, part of the <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War</a>—for a return to New York on 15 October. In December, Congressman <a href="Charles%20Hiram%20Randall">Charles H. Randall</a> (<a href="Prohibitionist">Prohibitionist</a>-<a href="California">CA</a>) and his wife sailed on the "Matoika" to <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a> and the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>.

On 5 April, "Princess Matoika" carried a group of 18 men and three officers of the U.S. Navy who were to attempt a transatlantic flight in the rigid airship "<a href="R38%20%28ZR-2%29">R38</a>", being built in England for the Navy. Several of the group that traveled on the "Matoika" were among the 45 men killed when the airship crashed on 24 August 1921.
In May 1920 "Princess Matoika" took on board the bodies of ten female nurses and over 400 soldiers who died while on duty in France during the war. The ship then transited the <a href="Kiel%20Canal">Kiel Canal</a> and picked up 1,600 U.S. residents of <a href="Poland">Polish</a> descent at <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, all of whom had enlisted in the <a href="Polish%20Army">Polish Army</a> at the outset of the war. Also included among the passengers were 500 U.S. soldiers who had been released from occupation duty at <a href="Koblenz">Koblenz</a>. The ship arrived at New York on 23 May with little fanfare and no ceremony; bodies returned but not claimed by families were buried at <a href="Arlington%20National%20Cemetery">Arlington National Cemetery</a>. On 21 July, "Princess Matoika" arrived in New York after a similar voyage with 25 <a href="war%20bride">war bride</a>s, many repatriated Polish troops among its 2,094 <a href="steerage">steerage</a> passengers, and the remains of 881 soldiers. In between these two trips, the <a href="Belgium">Belgian</a> Ambassador to the United States, <a href="Baron">Baron</a> <a href="Emile%20de%20Cartier%20de%20Marchienne">Emile de Cartier de Marchienne</a>, sailed from New York to Belgium on board the "Matoika". It was, however, "Princess Matoika"s next trip to Belgium that was the most infamous.

Beginning 26 July 1920, a majority of the U.S. Olympic contingent destined for the <a href="1920%20Summer%20Olympics">1920 Summer Olympics</a> in Antwerp, Belgium, endured a troubled transatlantic journey aboard "Princess Matoika". The voyage and the events onboard—later called the "Mutiny of the "Matoika" "—were still being discussed in the popular press years later. The "Matoika" was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to the athletes, did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board. Near the end of the voyage, the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">United States Secretary of War</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Olympic%20Committee">American Olympic Committee</a> members, and the press. The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time.

After the contingent of athletes <a href="%3Awikt%3Adebarked">debarked</a> at Antwerp on 8 August, "Princess Matoika" made one more voyage of note while under U.S. Army control. The "Matoika" sailed for New York on 24 August and arrived on 4 September carrying a portion of the returning Olympic team, American <a href="Boy%20Scouting%20%28Boy%20Scouts%20of%20America%29">Boy Scouts</a> returning from the <a href="1st%20World%20Scout%20Jamboree">International Boy Scout Jamboree</a> in London, and the remains of 1,284 American soldiers for repatriation.

At the conclusion of her Army service, "Princess Matoika" was handed over to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), who chartered the vessel to the <a href="United%20States%20Mail%20Steamship%20Company">United States Mail Steamship Company</a> for service from New York to <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. This solution of how to use the "Princess" for civilian service was the culmination of efforts by the USSB to find a suitable civilian use for her. In 1919, she was one of the ships suggested for a proposed service from <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a>, Louisiana, to <a href="Valparaiso">Valparaiso</a>, Chile, and in November 1919, tentative plans were announced for her service with the <a href="Munson%20Line">Munson Line</a> between New York and <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a> beginning in mid-1920, but both of these proposals fell through.
"Princess Matoika"—outfitted for 350 cabin-class and 500 third-class passengers and at —kicked off her U.S. Mail Line service on 20 January 1921 when she sailed from New York to <a href="Naples">Naples</a> and <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a> on her first of three roundtrips between these ports. After a storm damaged the "Matoika"s steering gear, she had to be towed back in to New York on 28 January.

After repairs and a successful eastbound crossing, "Princess Matoika" had an encounter with an <a href="iceberg">iceberg</a> off <a href="Newfoundland%20%28island%29">Newfoundland</a> while carrying some 2,000 Italian immigrants on her first return trip from Italy. On the night of 24 February, the fully laden ship struck what was reported in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" as either "an iceberg or a submerged wreck" off <a href="Cape%20Race">Cape Race</a>. The ship's steering gear was damaged in the collision, leaving the ship adrift for over seven hours before repairs were effected. The "Matoika"s captain indicated that no passengers were hurt in the collision. According to the story of one third-class passenger, she, suspecting there was something seriously amiss, made inquiry after the commotion. A crew member told her that the "Matoika" had only stopped to greet a ship passing in the night. When she went on deck, insistent on seeing the other ship herself, she saw the iceberg and observed the first-class passengers queued up to board the already-lowered <a href="lifeboat%20%28shipboard%29">lifeboats</a>. She took her daughter with her to join one of the queues, and, though initially rebuffed, was allowed to remain. The lifeboats were never deployed, however, and the "Matoika" arrived in Boston, where she had been diverted due to a <a href="typhus">typhus</a> scare, on 28 February without further incident.

On the "Matoika"s third and final return voyage from Italy, begun on 17 May, <a href="United%20States%20Customs%20Service">U.S. Customs Service</a> agents at New York seized $150,000 worth of <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>—along with valuable silks and jewels—being smuggled into the United States. Officials speculated that because of a maritime strike, members of a smuggling ring were able to infiltrate the crew of the ship.

After her withdrawal from the Italian route, "Princess Matoika" was transferred to New York–Bremen service, sailing on her first commercial trip to Germany since before World War I on 14 June. In July, during her second roundtrip on the Bremen route, late rental payments to the USSB resulted in action to seize the nine ships chartered by the U.S. Mail Line, including the "Matoika", after its return from Bremen. The ships were turned over to <a href="United%20American%20Lines">United American Lines</a>—<a href="W.%20Averell%20Harriman">W. Averell Harriman</a>'s steamship company—for temporary operation. After some legal wrangling by both the USSB and the U.S. Mail Line—and in light of financial irregularities by the U.S. Mail Line that were uncovered—the ships were permanently retained by the USSB in August.

Upon the formation of the United States Lines in August 1921, "Princess Matoika" and the eight other ex-German liners formerly operated by the U.S. Mail Line were transferred to the new company for operation. The "Princess", still on New York–Bremen service, sailed on her first voyage for the new steamship line on 15 September. In October, "Matoika" crewmen were reported as taking advantage of the <a href="Inflation%20in%20the%20Weimar%20Republic">German inflation</a> by consuming champagne available for $1.00 per quart and mugs of "the best beer" for an American penny. In November, United States Lines announced that "Princess Matoika" would be replaced on the Bremen route in order to better compete with <a href="North%20German%20Lloyd">North German Lloyd</a>, the liner's former owner, but that never came about. The "Princess" continued on runs to Bremen, calling at the additional ports of <a href="Cobh">Queenstown</a>, <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a>, and <a href="Danzig">Danzig</a>, as her schedule shifted from time to time.

On 28 January 1922, the "Matoika" departed with 400 passengers, among them, 312 <a href="Poland">Polish</a> orphans headed for repatriation in their homeland. Two days and out of New York, the liner experienced a heavy <a href="gale">gale</a> that disabled her steering gear, and forced her return to New York after temporary repairs failed. The captain was able to steer her through the use of the ship's engines, and arrived safely back in port on 31 January. This incident was the yet another misfortune that had befallen the young Poles. After being orphaned by the fighting between Polish and <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> forces, the orphans had been taken across <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>, evacuated to Japan, transported to <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, Washington, and taken by rail to Chicago, Illinois, where they were enrolled in school while searches for relatives in Poland were conducted.
After four Bremen roundtrips for United States Lines, "Princess Matoika" had sailed her last voyage under that name. When newly built Type 535 vessels named for American presidents came into service for the company in May 1922, the "Princess" was renamed SS "President Arthur" in honor of the 21st <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20the%20United%20States">U.S. President</a>, <a href="Chester%20A.%20Arthur">Chester A. Arthur</a>, matching the naming style of the new ships.

After her rename, she continued plying the North Atlantic between New York and Bremen, and was involved in a few episodes of note during this time. In June 1922, two years into <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition in the United States</a>, "President Arthur" was raided while at her dock in Hoboken, New Jersey, which netted 150 cases of smuggled spirits. Officials involved denied reports that the raid was conducted as a legal <a href="Test%20case%20%28law%29">test case</a> intended to test the determination of USSB chair <a href="Albert%20Lasker">Albert Lasker</a> that United States-flagged ships could carry and sell alcohol outside the <a href="three-mile%20limit">three-mile territorial limit</a> of the United States. Congressman <a href="James%20A.%20Gallivan">James A. Gallivan</a> (<a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">D</a>-<a href="Massachusetts">MA</a>), an anti-prohibition leader, publicly demanded to know why the ship had not been seized for violating U.S. laws.

In September, "President Arthur" carried <a href="Irish%20republicanism">Irish republicans</a> Muriel MacSwiney, widow of the recently deceased <a href="Lord%20Mayor%20of%20Cork">Lord Mayor of Cork</a> <a href="Terence%20MacSwiney">Terence MacSwiney</a>, and Linda Mary Kearns, who had been jailed for murder under the <a href="Black%20and%20Tans">Black and Tans</a>, to New York. Wearing buttons with pictures of <a href="Harry%20Boland">Harry Boland</a>, an anti-<a href="Anglo-Irish%20Treaty">treaty</a> Irish nationalist who had been killed the previous month, the two women were there to raise funds for orphans of <a href="Irish%20Republican%20Army%20%281922%E2%80%931969%29">Anti-Treaty IRA</a> forces, who were then fighting in southern Ireland. In October, a Hoboken man, after securing a last-minute <a href="court%20order">court order</a>, was able to halt the deportation of his German niece on "President Arthur"; she was retrieved from the ship ten minutes before sailing time.

In November 1922, U.S. Customs Service agents, seized a cache of <a href="Colt%27s%20Manufacturing%20Company">Colt</a> <a href="Magazine%20%28firearms%29">magazine</a> guns aboard "President Arthur". The entire crew was questioned but all denied any knowledge of the eight weapons found stowed behind a <a href="bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a>. In August the following year, "President Arthur" took on board a seaman suffering from <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> from the <a href="Norway">Norwegian</a> freighter "Eastern Star" in a mid-ocean transfer. The ship's doctor and nurse attended to the sailor but were unable to save him.

"President Arthur" sailed on her last transatlantic voyage from Bremen on 18 October 1923, carrying 656 passengers to New York. Anchoring off <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Brooklyn">Gravesend Bay</a> on 30 October, "President Arthur" was one of 15 passenger ships whose arrival in New York was timed to coincide with the opening of the November immigration quota period. Under the <a href="Emergency%20Quota%20Act">Emergency Quota Act</a> passed in 1921, numerical limits on European immigration were imposed which created nationality quotas. At the conclusion of this voyage, "President Arthur" was <a href="%3Awikt%3Alaid%20up">laid up</a> in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a>, Maryland, for almost a year.

On 9 October 1924, the newly formed <a href="American%20Palestine%20Line">American Palestine Line</a> announced that it had purchased "President Arthur" from the USSB, with plans to inaugurate service between New York and <a href="Palestine%20%28region%29">Palestine</a> the following March. The American Palestine Line was formed in 1924 for the purpose of providing direct passenger service from New York to Palestine and was reportedly the first steamship company owned and operated by Jews. The company had negotiated to purchase three <a href="ocean%20liner">ocean liner</a>s from the USSB but was only able to purchase "President Arthur". After refurbishing the liner, the company inaugurated service between New York and Palestine in March 1925, when "President Arthur" sailed on her maiden voyage. A crowd of 15,000 witnessed ceremonies that included songs, prayers, and speeches in English and <a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a>. The company claimed that "President Arthur" was the first ocean liner to fly the <a href="Flag%20of%20Israel">Zionist flag</a> at sea, and the first ocean liner ever to have female officers.

The line had labor difficulties and financial difficulties throughout its existence. Rumors of a mutiny during "President Arthur"s first trip were reported in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", and several crew members got into an altercation with members of the <a href="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</a>, the Italian fascist paramilitary group, when the liner made an intermediary stop in <a href="Naples">Naples</a>. On her second voyage, the ship's <a href="master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a> was killed by a fellow crew member. Financial difficulties included unpaid bills and resultant court actions, and accusations of fraud against company officers that were leveled in the press. In late 1925 the company was placed in the hands of a <a href="receiver%20%28legal%29">receiver</a>, "President Arthur"—after a two-alarm fire in her forward cargo hold—ended up back in the hands of the USSB, and the company's office furniture and fixtures were sold at auction in early 1926.

In August 1926 the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Steamship%20Company">Los Angeles Steamship Company</a> (LASSCO) announced the acquisition of "President Arthur" from the USSB. The liner would be extensively rebuilt and then sail opposite of (the former North German Lloyd liner "Grosser Kurfürst") on a Los Angeles–Hawaii route. Arriving from New York on 24 September, the ship was docked at <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Shipbuilding%20and%20Drydock">Los Angeles Shipbuilding and Drydock</a> to immediately begin a $2,500,000 refit. Although initially planned to be ready for February 1927 sailings, progress was slowed by drydock access, and her completion date was pushed to May. During her refit, the ship was renamed "City of Honolulu", becoming the second LASSCO ship of that name. At the conclusion of her reconstruction in May, "City of Honolulu" sailed on a 24-hour shakedown cruise.

"City of Honolulu" was rebuilt to and had accommodations for around 450 first-class and 50 third-class passengers. Her hull was painted all white for LASSCO service, and she sported period designs in her common areas. The dining room, large enough to seat 300 in a single sitting, was decorated in a <a href="Greek%20Revival%20architecture">Grecian</a> theme, and featured 18 <a href="stained%20glass%20window">stained glass window</a>s designed by San Diego architect <a href="Carleton%20Winslow">Carleton Winslow</a>. The <a href="smoking%20room">smoking room</a> was done up in a <a href="Tudor%20style%20architecture">Tudor style</a>; the music room was decorated in a combined <a href="Second%20Empire%20%28architecture%29">French</a> and <a href="Italianate%20architecture">Italian</a> Renaissance manner; and the writing room was in <a href="Adam%20style">Adam style</a>. The <a href="suite%20%28hotel%29">suites</a> were all done in either Adam, <a href="Queen%20Anne%20Style%20architecture">Queen Anne</a>, or <a href="Louis%20XVI%20style">Louis XVI</a> styles. The ship featured six passenger elevators, and a swimming pool patterned on a <a href="Pompei">Pompei</a>an design. One of the few remaining traces of her pre-war German decoration was the <a href="rosewood">rosewood</a> railing on her grand staircase.

On 4 June 1927, a crowd of 7,000 well-wishers saw "City of Honolulu" depart on her maiden voyage. The festivities were also broadcast on radio station KGFO, a portable station operating form the front cargo deck of the ship. During the journey, broadcasts of the "City of Honolulu"s orchestra, along with radio personalities and musicians from Los Angeles station <a href="KHJ%20%28AM%29">KHJ</a>, entertained both passengers and listeners on shore (while the ship was in range).

Several notable passengers sailed on the liner's maiden voyage. <a href="Jay%20Gould%20II">Jay Gould II</a>, tennis champion and grandson of railroad <a href="tycoon">tycoon</a> <a href="Jay%20Gould">Jay Gould</a>, sailed for a three-month stay at his Hawaiian home. Also sailing were movie star <a href="Laura%20La%20Plante">Laura La Plante</a> and her husband, director <a href="William%20A.%20Seiter">William A. Seiter</a>, and, <a href="Western%20Auto">Western Auto</a> founder <a href="George%20Pepperdine">George Pepperdine</a>, who began a three-month tour of the <a href="Orient">Orient</a> with his daughters. On arrival in Honolulu on 10 June, "City of Honolulu" was adorned with flowers and received a welcome from airplanes and a flotilla of <a href="outrigger%20canoe">outrigger canoe</a>s that escorted her into the harbor. After a ten-day stay in the islands, she departed for Los Angeles, returning there on 26 June.

After completion of her maiden voyage, "City of Honolulu" began regular service from Los Angeles to Honolulu and <a href="Hilo%2C%20Hawaii">Hilo</a> on what LASSCO called the "Great Circle Route of Sunshine". After arriving at Honolulu, the ship would sail southeast to Hilo, passing the islands of <a href="Molokai">Molokai</a> and <a href="Maui">Maui</a> on their north sides. On the return from Hilo, the liner would traverse the <a href="%CA%BBAlal%C4%81keiki%20Channel">ʻAlalākeiki</a>, the <a href="%CA%BBAu%CA%BBau%20Channel">ʻAuʻau</a>, and the <a href="Kalohi%20Channel">Kalohi Channel</a>s, taking the ship between Maui and Molokai on the north and the islands of <a href="Kahoolawe">Kahoolawe</a> and <a href="Lanai">Lanai</a> on the south.

Throughout her career, "City of Honolulu" transported many notable passengers to Hawaii. In July 1927, for example, <a href="Henry%20Smith%20Pritchett">Henry Smith Pritchett</a>, president of the <a href="The%20Carnegie%20Foundation%20for%20the%20Advancement%20of%20Teaching">Carnegie Foundation</a>, sailed to Hawaii en route to a meeting with the <a href="Institute%20of%20Pacific%20Relations">Institute of Pacific Relations</a>. In June 1928, movie stars <a href="Norma%20Talmadge">Norma Talmadge</a>, <a href="Gilbert%20Roland">Gilbert Roland</a>, and <a href="Lottie%20Pickford">Lottie Pickford</a> began a Hawaiian vacation, and on 28 July, <a href="Jane%20Addams">Jane Addams</a>, the founder of <a href="Hull%20House">Hull House</a> and a pioneer of the <a href="settlement%20movement">settlement movement</a>, headed there as well. Addams was on her way to attend the Pan-Pacific Women's Conference and the congress of the <a href="Women%27s%20International%20League%20for%20Peace%20and%20Freedom">Women's International League for Peace and Freedom</a>; a former <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20Hawaii">Governor of Hawaii</a>, <a href="Walter%20F.%20Frear">Walter F. Frear</a>, returned to the islands on that same voyage. In December, <a href="Al%20Jolson">Al Jolson</a> and his wife, <a href="Ruby%20Keeler">Ruby Keeler</a>, sailed on the liner for a vacation, and early the next February, the reigning <a href="The%20Open%20Championship">British Open</a> golf champion, <a href="Walter%20Hagen">Walter Hagen</a>, sailed to start a four-month golfing tour and exhibition in Australia. Hagan was accompanied by Australian golfer <a href="Joe%20Kirkwood%2C%20Sr.">Joe Kirkwood</a>; <a href="Arctic%20explorer">Arctic explorer</a> <a href="Donald%20B.%20MacMillan">Donald B. MacMillan</a> also left for Hawaii on the same sailing.
"City of Honolulu" also carried notable visitors to the <a href="Continental%20United%20States">mainland</a>. Farris M. Brown, a dealer in <a href="Stradivarius">Stradivarius instruments</a>, arrived in Los Angeles in May 1928 with three of the famous maker's violins, including the <a href="Baron%20Knoop%20Stradivarius">Baron Knoop Stradivarius</a>. In April 1929, <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a> swimmer <a href="Arne%20Borg">Arne Borg</a>, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Los Angeles on a world swimming tour, and in May, Sir <a href="James%20Gunnson">James Gunnson</a>, a former <a href="Mayor%20of%20Auckland">Mayor of Auckland</a>, arrived for a one-month visit to promote increased trade between California and New Zealand. The next January, <a href="Herbert%20James%20Hagerman">Herbert Hagerman</a>, former <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20New%20Mexico%20Territory">Governor of New Mexico Territory</a>; author <a href="Basil%20Woon">Basil Woon</a>, who had been doing research for a Hawaiian story; and aviation promoter and chewing gum magnate <a href="William%20Edward%20Easterwood">William Easterwood</a> all sailed stateside on the ship.

Apart from notable passengers carried during her tenure, "City of Honolulu" also frequently served as a conveyance for newlyweds heading for Hawaiian honeymoons. She also carried, in addition to passengers, cargo in both directions, transporting commodities, such as fertilizer and oil, to Hawaii, and Hawaiian goods, like sugar and fresh and canned pineapple to the mainland.

"City of Honolulu"s career as a tropical liner, however, was short-lived. On the afternoon of 25 May 1930, just shy of completing three years of LASSCO service, a fire broke out on her B deck while she was docked in her namesake city. Although aided by <a href="fireboat%20Leleiona">fireboat "Leleiona"</a> and U.S. Navy submarine rescue ship , firefighters were unable to bring the blaze under control quickly, and it spread to of <a href="potash">potash</a> aboard the liner. Fears that her cargo of of oil would explode caused firefighters to intentionally sink the liner at her pier in order to help extinguish the conflagration. Through firefighters' efforts, the fire was contained to the upper three decks, leaving the ship's power plant relatively undamaged. All crew members and LASSCO employees on board the ship got off safely; no passengers were on the ship at the time of the fire.

The ship was pumped out and raised on 9 June, and taken to the naval drydock at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a> for inspection on 12 June. While remaining in Hawaii, one engine was restored to working order and the ship departed for Los Angeles under her own power on 30 October. After her arrival, further inspections were conducted, and it was determined that repairs would be too expensive, especially given the <a href="Great%20Depression">global economic conditions</a>. "City of Honolulu" was declared a total loss, and was laid up in the West Basin of Los Angeles Harbor for almost three years. During her lay up, fittings and fixtures stripped from the vessel were auctioned in July 1932, and in December, film crews from <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures Corporation</a> spent ten days filming on board the ship.

"City of Honolulu" was sold to Japanese <a href="ship%20breaking">shipbreakers</a> in mid 1933, and—in the company of , another LASSCO ship destined for the scrap heap—the "City of Honolulu" departed Los Angeles in late August under her own power. Manned by a <a href="Philippines">Filipino</a> crew, the 33-year-old liner developed a problem with one of her boilers almost immediately and had to put into San Francisco for repairs. Getting underway after a lengthy delay, one of her engines failed in mid-ocean, leaving her to plod on to Japan on one engine. She eventually arrived in <a href="Osaka">Osaka</a> at the shipbreaker in mid-December, and was scrapped shortly thereafter.

Charles Inglis (engineer)

Sir Charles Edward Inglis, <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a>, <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">FRS</a> (; 31 July 1875 – 19 April 1952) was a British <a href="civil%20engineer">civil engineer</a>. The son of a doctor, he was educated at <a href="Cheltenham%20College">Cheltenham College</a> and won a scholarship to <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">King's College, Cambridge</a>, where he would later forge a career as an academic. Inglis spent a two-year period with the engineering firm run by <a href="John%20Wolfe-Barry">John Wolfe-Barry</a> before he returned to King's College as a lecturer. Working with Professors <a href="James%20Alfred%20Ewing">James Alfred Ewing</a> and <a href="Bertram%20Hopkinson">Bertram Hopkinson</a>, he made several important studies into the effects of vibration on structures and defects on the strength of plate steel.

Inglis served in the <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> during the First World War and invented the Inglis Bridge, a reusable steel bridging system – the precursor to the more famous <a href="Bailey%20bridge">Bailey bridge</a> of the Second World War. In 1916 he was placed in charge of bridge design and supply at the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> and, with <a href="Giffard%20Le%20Quesne%20Martel">Giffard Le Quesne Martel</a>, pioneered the use of temporary bridges with tanks. Inglis retired from military service in 1919 and was appointed an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a>. He returned to Cambridge University after the war as a professor and head of the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Engineering%20Department">Engineering Department</a>. Under his leadership, the department became the largest in the university and one of the best regarded engineering schools in the world. Inglis retired from the department in 1943.

Inglis was associated with the <a href="Royal%20Institution%20of%20Naval%20Architects">Institution of Naval Architects</a>, <a href="Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">Institution of Civil Engineers</a>, <a href="Institution%20of%20Mechanical%20Engineers">Institution of Mechanical Engineers</a>, <a href="Institution%20of%20Structural%20Engineers">Institution of Structural Engineers</a>, Institution of Waterworks Engineers and British Waterworks Association; he sat on several of their councils and was elected the Institution of Civil Engineers' president for the 1941–42 session. He was also a <a href="fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">fellow of the Royal Society</a>. Inglis sat on the <a href="Public%20inquiry">board of inquiry</a> investigating the loss of the <a href="airship%20R101">airship R101</a> and was chair of a <a href="Ministry%20of%20War%20Transport">Ministry of War Transport</a> railway modernisation committee in 1946. Knighted in 1945, he spent his later years developing his theories on the education of engineers and wrote a textbook on <a href="applied%20mechanics">applied mechanics</a>. He has been described as the greatest teacher of engineering of his time and has a building named in his honour at Cambridge University.

Charles Inglis was the second son of Dr. Alexander Inglis (a <a href="general%20practitioner">general practitioner</a> in <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>) and his first wife, Florence, the daughter of newspaper proprietor <a href="John%20Frederick%20Feeney">John Frederick Feeney</a>. His elder brother was the historian <a href="John%20Alexander%20Inglis">John Alexander Inglis</a> <a href="FRSE">FRSE</a> Their father, Alexander Inglis was born in Scotland to a respectable family – his grandfather, John Inglis, was an Admiral in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> and had captained <a href="HMS%20Belliqueux%20%281780%29">HMS "Belliqueux"</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Camperdown">Battle of Camperdown</a> in 1797.

Charles Inglis was born on 31 July 1875. He was not expected to survive and was hurriedly baptised in his father's drawing room; his mother died from complications eleven days later. His family moved to Cheltenham and Inglis was schooled at <a href="Cheltenham%20College">Cheltenham College</a> from 1889 to 1894. In his final year, he was elected <a href="head%20boy">head boy</a> and received a scholarship to study the <a href="Mathematics%20Tripos">Mathematics Tripos</a> at <a href="King%27s%20College%2C%20Cambridge">King's College, Cambridge</a>. Inglis was <a href="Wrangler%20%28University%20of%20Cambridge%29">22nd wrangler</a> when he received his <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in 1897; he remained for a fourth year, achieving <a href="first%20class%20honours">first class honours</a> in Mechanical Sciences. Inglis was a keen sportsman and enjoyed long distance running, walking, mountaineering and sailing. At Cambridge, he nearly achieved a <a href="Blue%20%28university%20sport%29">blue</a> for long distance running but was forced to withdraw from a significant race because of a pulled muscle. He was also a follower of the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20R.U.F.C.">Cambridge University Rugby Union team</a>, watching their matches at <a href="Grange%20Road%2C%20Cambridge">Grange Road</a>.

After graduation, Inglis began work as an apprentice for the civil engineering firm of <a href="John%20Wolfe-Barry">John Wolfe-Barry & Partners</a>. He worked as a <a href="draughtsman">draughtsman</a> in the drawing office for several months before being placed with <a href="Alexander%20Gibb">Alexander Gibb</a>, who was acting as resident engineer on an extension to the <a href="District%20Railway">Metropolitan District Railway</a> between <a href="Whitechapel">Whitechapel</a> and <a href="Bow%2C%20London">Bow</a>. Inglis was responsible for the design and supervision of all thirteen bridges on the route. It was during this time that he began his lifelong study of vibration and its effects on materials, particularly bridges.

In 1901 Inglis was made a <a href="fellow">fellow</a> of King's College after writing a thesis entitled "The Balancing of Engines", the first general treatment of <a href="engine%20balance">the subject</a> – which was becoming increasingly important due to the growing speeds of locomotives. In the same year, he received his <a href="Master%20of%20Arts%20%28Oxbridge%20and%20Dublin%29">Master of Arts</a> degree and was accepted as an <a href="Institution%20of%20Civil%20Engineers">Institution of Civil Engineers</a> (ICE) associate member after winning the institution's Miller Prize for his student paper on "The Geometrical Methods in Investigating Mechanical Problems". Inglis left his employment with Wolfe-Barry, having completed two years of his five-year apprenticeship, to return to King's College and become an assistant to <a href="James%20Alfred%20Ewing">James Alfred Ewing</a>, professor of mechanism and applied mechanics. Inglis maintained his interest in engine balancing and filed a US patent on 16 April 1902 for an improved engine with the <a href="Cylinder%20%28locomotive%29">cylinders</a> mounted end to end to balance out the forces acting between them.

Professor Ewing left the university in 1903 to become the first Director of Naval Education at the <a href="Admiralty">Admiralty</a> but Inglis remained; he was appointed a <a href="List%20of%20academic%20ranks%23United%20Kingdom">university demonstrator</a> in <a href="Mechanism%20%28engineering%29">mechanism</a> by Professor <a href="Bertram%20Hopkinson">Bertram Hopkinson</a>, Ewing's successor, and worked with him to study the effects of vibration. Inglis was promoted to lecturer of mechanical engineering in 1908. Hopkinson recognised Inglis' academic abilities and assigned him the heaviest teaching load of all the staff, covering statics, dynamics, structural engineering theory, materials engineering, drawing, engine balance and the design of steel girders and reinforced concrete. Inglis later recalled that if he wished to learn more on a subject then he volunteered to teach a course on it. From 1911 Inglis became involved in hydraulic engineering and served on the board of the <a href="Cambridge%20Water%20Company">Cambridge University and Town Waterworks Company</a>, serving as deputy chairman from 1924 to 1928 and chairman from 1928 to 1952.

Inglis conducted research into the problem of fracture in the metal plates of ships' hulls and noticed that the <a href="rivet">rivet</a> holes along the path of a crack were often deformed into an elliptical shape. This phenomenon led him to investigate the magnification of stress caused at the edges of an elliptical defect; in 1913 he published a paper of his theories that has been described as his most important contribution to engineering and the first serious modern work on the fracturing of materials. <a href="Alan%20Arnold%20Griffith">Alan Arnold Griffith</a> later drew on Inglis' paper for his work on the <a href="Griffith%27s%20criterion">apparent discrepancy between calculated and actual strengths of materials</a>. Inglis's 1913 paper has been cited by around 1,200 subsequent works.

Inglis had married Eleanor Moffat, daughter of <a href="Lieutenant-Colonel">Lieutenant-Colonel</a> Herbert Moffat of the <a href="South%20Wales%20Borderers">South Wales Borderers</a>, in 1901, having met on holiday in Switzerland. They lived at Maitland House, <a href="Cambridge">Cambridge</a>, until 1904, when Inglis built a house he named Balls Grove at nearby <a href="Grantchester">Grantchester</a>, where his two daughters were born and the family resided until 1925. They later moved to 10 Latham Road, which Inglis renamed Niddrys after the first known address of his ancestors in Edinburgh.

Inglis was involved with the Cambridge University <a href="Officer%20Training%20Corps">Officer Training Corps</a> (CUOTC), being commissioned a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> on 24 May 1909. He served with the CUOTC's engineering detachment and noticed that when the unit was deployed on field days with the rest of the force it often had little to do. To remedy this, Inglis designed a reusable steel bridge, with the intention that it could be erected and dismantled by the unit in a single afternoon. An army general who was inspecting the unit noticed his design and offered advice: "If you're making anything for the army, keep it simple – no complicated gadgets". Upon the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in 1914, Inglis volunteered for active service in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and was officially listed as an Assistant Instructor in the <a href="Royal%20School%20of%20Military%20Engineering">School of Military Engineering</a>, with the temporary rank of <a href="lieutenant">lieutenant</a>. The army expressed interest in Inglis' bridge design; it was approved for use by a panel of army officers that included the general who had first commented on the design, to whom Inglis said "I hope, Sir, you will find I have profited by your advice". The design remained in service with the British Army until the higher-capacity <a href="Bailey%20bridge">Bailey bridge</a> was introduced during the <a href="Second%20World%20War">Second World War</a>.
The Inglis Bridge was designed so that all of its components could be moved by manpower alone; moreover, it could be erected with few tools in a short span of time – a <a href="troop">troop</a> of 40 sappers could erect a bridge in 12 hours. The design was composed of a series of <a href="Warren%20truss">Warren truss</a> bays made from tubular steel sections, to a maximum span of six bays (). The design went through three revisions, with the Mark II replacing the original design's variable-length tubes with identical-length ones and, during the Second World War, the Mark III using higher strength steel but smaller tube diameters, increasing the carrying capacity to . In addition to his bridge design, during the war's course he developed the similar Inglis Tubular Observation Tower. Inglis received a US Patent for his bridge on 25 April 1916 and for the type of joints used in it on 26 June 1917.

In 1916, Inglis was placed in charge of bridge design and supply at the <a href="War%20Office">War Office</a> in which role he was a proponent for the increased use of <a href="girder%20bridge">girder bridge</a>s in military applications. It was Inglis that first proved to the army that the heavy components essential to girder bridges did not prevent their rapid assembly in field conditions. This led to the greater use of such bridges, particularly the Inglis Bridge, for tanks later in the war. He received promotion to the rank of <a href="Captain%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">captain</a> on the <a href="General%20Service%20Corps">General List of Officers</a> on 6 May 1916 and became a <a href="Staff%20Officer">staff captain</a> attached to the War Office on 26 June 1917. He was promoted to the <a href="brevet%20rank">brevet rank</a> of <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">major</a> as part of the <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> on 3 June 1918 and later that year worked with <a href="Giffard%20Le%20Quesne%20Martel">Giffard Le Quesne Martel</a> to develop some of the earliest <a href="Armoured%20vehicle-launched%20bridge">bridgelaying tanks</a>. Inglis retired from the army on 9 March 1919, having been rewarded for his military service with an appointment as an <a href="Officer%20of%20the%20Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Officer of the Order of the British Empire</a>.

Inglis returned to Cambridge in 1918 and was appointed as the professor of Mechanism and Applied Mechanics (renamed Mechanical Sciences in 1934). On 25 March 1919, he was selected to head the <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Engineering%20Department">Cambridge University Engineering Department</a> as the successor of Hopkinson, who had died in an air crash the previous year. Though he made no radical changes, such as had occurred under his predecessors, under Inglis' supervision the department became the largest in the university and one of the best engineering schools in the world. He was responsible for expanding the department to meet the increased post-war demand for engineers and for the move from its traditional home at <a href="Free%20School%20Lane">Free School Lane</a>. Inglis acquired the Scroope House on Trumpington Street for the department and constructed a laboratory on the site by 1923, followed in 1931 by a structure containing lecture theatres and a drawing office.

At Cambridge Inglis' students included Sir <a href="Frank%20Whittle">Frank Whittle</a> (developer of the <a href="jet%20engine">jet engine</a>), <a href="James%20N.%20Goodier">James N. Goodier</a> (mechanical engineer and academic), Sir <a href="Morien%20Morgan">Morien Morgan</a> (called the "Father of <a href="Concorde">Concorde</a>") and <a href="Beryl%20Platt%2C%20Baroness%20Platt%20of%20Writtle">Beryl Platt, Baroness Platt</a> (Conservative peer). He was also in contact with Russian railway engineer <a href="Yury%20Lomonosov">Yury Lomonosov</a> and lectured to biochemist <a href="Albert%20Chibnall">Albert Chibnall</a>. Despite mentoring some of the best engineers of their generation Inglis was realistic about the actual intentions of many of his students at the time. He once told a new intake class: "Your fathers, gentlemen, have sent you to Cambridge to be educated, not to become engineers. They think, however, that reading engineering is a very good way of becoming educated. In 10 years' time, however, 90% of you will have become managers, whether of design, manufacturing, sales, research or even accounts departments in industry. The remaining 10% of you will have become successful lawyers, novelists, and things of that sort". Undeterred, Inglis sought to give his students the broadest possible engineering education, covering all fields to prevent them becoming "cramped by premature specialisation".
Inglis had close contacts with industry and was able to establish a professorship in <a href="aeronautical%20engineering">aeronautical engineering</a> and links with a nearby Air Ministry experimental flight station. He was also successful in arranging with the War Office for <a href="Royal%20Engineers">Royal Engineers</a> officers to study the <a href="Tripos">Engineering Tripos</a> at the university. The university drew praise for the quality of its teaching during Inglis' tenure, though his department has been criticised for its "comparative neglect of original research". From 1923, he was involved with the analysis of vibration and its effects on railway bridges, including a period spent working with <a href="Christopher%20Hinton%2C%20Baron%20Hinton%20of%20Bankside">Christopher Hinton</a> during the latter's final year as a student at Cambridge. Inglis was appointed to a sub-committee of the British government's <a href="Department%20of%20Scientific%20and%20Industrial%20Research%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Department of Scientific and Industrial Research</a> <a href="Bridge%20Stress%20Committee">Bridge Stress Committee</a> by Ewing, who was chairman, and became responsible for almost all of the mathematics of the investigation. Inglis derived a theory that allowed for the accurate assessment of the vibrations caused by <a href="hammer%20blow">hammer blow</a> force imparted to the bridge by locomotives, and the committee's 1928 report included recommendations that the hammer blow force be included in bridge design calculations in the future. During the course of this work Inglis was able to show that the increased oscillation of bridges at train speeds beyond those that corresponded with the <a href="natural%20frequency">natural frequency</a> of the bridge was due to the influence of the locomotive's suspension – the first time that this phenomenon had been explained. Inglis' work on bridge vibration has been described as his most important post-war research. He followed up the work by using a <a href="Harmonic%20series%20%28mathematics%29">harmonic series</a> and <a href="Macaulay%27s%20method">Macaulay's method</a> to approximate the vibration of beams of non-uniform mass distribution or <a href="bending%20modulus">bending modulus</a>. This work is related to the later <a href="Rotordynamics%23History">method used by Myklestad and Prohl</a> in the field of <a href="rotordynamics">rotordynamics</a>.

Inglis was elected an Institution of Civil Engineers member in 1923 and became a member of its council in 1928. He was very active professionally and also served on the councils of the <a href="Institution%20of%20Naval%20Architects">Institution of Naval Architects</a>, <a href="Institution%20of%20Structural%20Engineers">Institution of Structural Engineers</a> and the Institution of Waterworks Engineers; he was an <a href="Institution%20of%20Mechanical%20Engineers">Institution of Mechanical Engineers</a> honorary member. Inglis was also a prolific writer, publishing 25 books and academic papers on a wide range of engineering topics. He received the ICE's <a href="Telford%20Medal">Telford Medal</a> in 1924 for a paper entitled "The Theory of Transverse Oscillations in Girders and its Relation to Live Load and Impact Allowance". In 1926, he was appointed to a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> considering cross-river traffic in London with particular reference to the <a href="Waterloo%20Bridge">Waterloo</a> and <a href="Blackfriars%20Railway%20Bridge">St Paul's</a> bridges. Inglis founded the Cambridge Engineers' Association to promote social activities at the University, and saw <a href="Charles%20Algernon%20Parsons">Sir Charles Parsons</a> appointed as its first president in 1929. In the same year, he was awarded the honorary degree of <a href="Doctor%20of%20Laws">Doctor of Laws</a> by the University of Edinburgh.
In 1930 Inglis was appointed to the <a href="Public%20inquiry">board of inquiry</a> looking into the crash of the <a href="airship%20R101">airship R101</a>, and in the same year was made a <a href="Fellow%20of%20the%20Royal%20Society">Fellow of the Royal Society</a>. He was a member of the <a href="London%2C%20Midland%20and%20Scottish%20Railway">London, Midland and Scottish Railway</a>'s Advisory Committee on Scientific Research from 1931 to 1947 and conducted numerous experiments on their behalf in the laboratories at Cambridge. He was able to prove the factors behind <a href="hunting%20oscillation">hunting oscillation</a>, a violent oscillation of railway carriages, and developed testing equipment to approximate the wear of rail track and wheels in the field.

Inglis published the book "A Mathematical Treatise on Vibrations in Railway Bridges" in 1934, which was described by a reviewer as "a valuable asset for both the mathematician and engineer", and also submitted several papers on the matter to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE). Inglis delivered the <a href="Richard%20Trevithick">Trevithick</a> Memorial Lecture for the ICE in 1933, and was elected British Waterworks Association president in 1935. At around this time, he was appointed to the governing council of Cheltenham College, of which he remained a member for the rest of his life. Inglis was the president of the 1934 International Congress on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics held at Cambridge, one of the series of Congresses that gave rise to the <a href="International%20Union%20of%20Theoretical%20and%20Applied%20Mechanics">IUTAM</a>. He was a proposer for the Royal Society fellowship of <a href="Andrew%20Robertson%20%28engineer%29">Andrew Robertson</a>, the mechanical engineer, in 1936.

Inglis was due to retire from the university in 1940, but was persuaded to remain for another three years so that <a href="John%20Baker%2C%20Baron%20Baker">John Baker</a> could be appointed in his stead. Interest in Inglis' army bridge was rekindled in the Second World War and the Mark III design introduced in 1940. Inglis applied for a United States patent for the particular type of triangular trusses used in his bridge in 1940; which was approved and granted in 1943. Testing of a prototype of the Mark III revealed a weakness in the top chord of the truss and the subsequent redesign complicated the production process. Whilst the bridge was produced in limited quantities from 1940 it was largely replaced by the Bailey bridge, introduced in 1941, a fact that disappointed Inglis. The Inglis design remained in service for some time owing to a lack of resources for production of the Bailey bridge and saw service in rear areas and with the <a href="1st%20Canadian%20Infantry%20Division">1st Canadian Infantry Division</a>.

Inglis was elected as ICE president for the 1941–42 session, having been vice-president in 1938, and gave an inaugural address on the education of engineers that was judged to be one of the best ever given. In his address, he stated that "the soul and spirit of education is that habit of mind which remains when a student has completely forgotten everything he has ever been taught", a quote which has since been used by several organisations to describe the importance of an engineering education. He delivered the <a href="Thomas%20Hawksley">Thomas Hawksley</a> Lecture on "Gyroscopic Principles and Applications" for the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1943 and the fiftieth ICE James Forrest lecture on "Mechanical Vibrations, their Cause and Prevention" in 1944, being awarded the ICE's Charles Parsons medal the same year. He gave the Parsons Memorial Lecture to the <a href="Institute%20of%20Marine%20Engineering%2C%20Science%20and%20Technology">North-East Coast Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders</a> in 1945 in which he presented his Basic Function Method, an alternative to the use of <a href="Fourier%20series">Fourier series</a> for the analysis of vibrations in beams.

After his retirement as department head Inglis served as <a href="Provost%20%28education%29">Vice-Provost</a> of King's College from 1943 to 1947. He received a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighthood</a> in the 1945 King's Birthday Honours, and in 1946 was appointed as chair of the committee charged with advising the <a href="Minister%20of%20War%20Transport">Minister of War Transport</a> on railway modernisation. Inglis continued to develop his theories on teaching engineering and wrote in the "Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers" in 1947 on the teaching of engineering mathematics: "Mathematics [required by engineers] though it must be sound and incisive as far as goes, need not be of that artistic and exalted quality which calls for the mentality of the real mathematician. It can be termed mathematics of the tin-opening variety, and in contrast to real mathematicians, engineers are more interested in the contents of the tin than in the elegance of the tin-opener employed". He published the textbook "Applied Mechanics for Engineers" in 1951, following which he spent three months as a <a href="visiting%20professor">visiting professor</a> at the <a href="University%20of%20the%20Witwatersrand">University of the Witwatersrand</a> in South Africa. His wife, Lady Eleanor Inglis, died on 1 April 1952, and Charles died eighteen days later at <a href="Southwold">Southwold</a>, Suffolk. The Cambridge University Engineering Department's Inglis Building is named in his honour. Inglis has been described as the greatest teacher of engineering of his time.

Pulmonary contusion

A pulmonary contusion, also known as lung contusion, is a <a href="bruise">bruise</a> of the <a href="lung">lung</a>, caused by <a href="chest%20trauma">chest trauma</a>. As a result of damage to <a href="capillary">capillaries</a>, blood and other fluids accumulate in the lung tissue. The excess fluid interferes with <a href="gas%20exchange">gas exchange</a>, potentially leading to inadequate oxygen levels (<a href="hypoxia%20%28medical%29">hypoxia</a>). Unlike <a href="pulmonary%20laceration">pulmonary laceration</a>, another type of lung injury, pulmonary contusion does not involve a cut or tear of the lung tissue.
A pulmonary contusion is usually caused directly by <a href="blunt%20trauma">blunt trauma</a> but can also result from explosion injuries or a <a href="shock%20wave">shock wave</a> associated with <a href="penetrating%20trauma">penetrating trauma</a>. With the use of explosives during World Wars I and II, pulmonary contusion resulting from blasts gained recognition. In the 1960s its occurrence in civilians began to receive wider recognition, in which cases it is usually caused by traffic accidents. The use of seat belts and airbags reduces the risk to vehicle occupants.
Diagnosis is made by studying the cause of the injury, <a href="physical%20examination">physical examination</a> and <a href="Chest%20X-ray">chest radiography</a>. Typical signs and symptoms include direct effects of the physical trauma, such as chest pain and <a href="Hemoptysis">coughing up blood</a>, as well as signs that the body is not receiving enough oxygen, such as <a href="cyanosis">cyanosis</a>. The contusion frequently heals on its own with supportive care. Often nothing more than supplemental oxygen and close monitoring is needed; however, <a href="intensive%20care">intensive care</a> may be required. For example, if breathing is severely compromised, <a href="mechanical%20ventilation">mechanical ventilation</a> may be necessary. <a href="Fluid%20replacement">Fluid replacement</a> may be required to ensure adequate blood volume, but fluids are given carefully since <a href="fluid%20overload">fluid overload</a> can worsen <a href="pulmonary%20edema">pulmonary edema</a>, which may be lethal.
The severity ranges from mild to severe: small contusions may have little or no impact on health, yet pulmonary contusion is the most common type of potentially lethal chest trauma. It occurs in 30–75% of severe chest injuries. The risk of death following a pulmonary contusion is between 14–40%. Pulmonary contusion is usually accompanied by other injuries. Although associated injuries are often the cause of death, pulmonary contusion is thought to cause death directly in a quarter to half of cases. Children are at especially high risk for the injury because the relative flexibility of their bones prevents the chest wall from absorbing force from an impact, causing it to be transmitted instead to the lung. Pulmonary contusion is associated with complications including <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="acute%20respiratory%20distress%20syndrome">acute respiratory distress syndrome</a>, and it can cause long-term respiratory disability.

Pulmonary contusion and laceration are injuries to the lung tissue. <a href="Pulmonary%20laceration">Pulmonary laceration</a>, in which lung tissue is torn or cut, differs from pulmonary contusion in that the former involves disruption of the <a href="macroscopic">macroscopic</a> architecture of the lung, while the latter does not. When lacerations fill with blood, the result is <a href="pulmonary%20hematoma">pulmonary hematoma</a>, a collection of blood within the lung tissue. Contusion involves hemorrhage in the <a href="pulmonary%20alveolus">alveoli</a> (tiny air-filled sacs responsible for absorbing oxygen), but a <a href="hematoma">hematoma</a> is a discrete clot of blood not interspersed with lung tissue. A collapsed lung can result when the <a href="pleural%20cavity">pleural cavity</a> (the space outside the lung) accumulates blood (<a href="hemothorax">hemothorax</a>) or air (<a href="pneumothorax">pneumothorax</a>) or both (<a href="hemopneumothorax">hemopneumothorax</a>). These conditions do not inherently involve damage to the lung tissue itself, but they may be associated with it. Injuries to the chest wall are also distinct from but may be associated with lung injuries. Chest wall injuries include <a href="rib%20fracture">rib fracture</a>s and <a href="flail%20chest">flail chest</a>, in which multiple ribs are broken so that a segment of the ribcage is detached from the rest of the chest wall and moves independently.

Presentation may be subtle; people with mild contusion may have no symptoms at all. However, pulmonary contusion is frequently associated with <a href="Medical%20sign">signs</a> (objective indications) and <a href="symptom">symptom</a>s (subjective states), including those indicative of the lung injury itself and of accompanying injuries. Because gas exchange is impaired, signs of low blood <a href="oxygen%20saturation">oxygen saturation</a>, such as low concentrations of oxygen in <a href="arterial%20blood%20gas">arterial blood gas</a> and <a href="cyanosis">cyanosis</a> (bluish color of the skin and mucous membranes) are commonly associated. <a href="Dyspnea">Dyspnea</a> (painful breathing or difficulty breathing) is commonly seen, and tolerance for exercise may be lowered. <a href="Tachypnea">Rapid breathing</a> and <a href="tachycardia">a rapid heart rate</a> are other signs. With more severe contusions, <a href="breath%20sounds">breath sounds</a> heard through a stethoscope may be decreased, or <a href="rales">rales</a> (an abnormal crackling sound in the chest accompanying breathing) may be present. People with severe contusions may have <a href="bronchorrhea">bronchorrhea</a> (the production of watery <a href="sputum">sputum</a>). Wheezing and coughing are other signs. <a href="hemoptysis">Coughing up blood</a> or bloody sputum is present in up to half of cases. <a href="Cardiac%20output">Cardiac output</a> (the volume of blood pumped by the heart) may be reduced, and <a href="hypotension">hypotension</a> (low blood pressure) is frequently present. The area of the chest wall near the contusion may be <a href="tenderness%20%28medicine%29">tender</a> or painful due to associated chest wall injury.

Signs and symptoms take time to develop, and as many as half of cases are <a href="asymptomatic">asymptomatic</a> at the initial presentation. The more severe the injury, the more quickly symptoms become apparent. In severe cases, symptoms may occur as quickly as three or four hours after the trauma. <a href="Hypoxemia">Hypoxemia</a> (low oxygen concentration in the arterial blood) typically becomes progressively worse over 24–48 hours after injury. In general, pulmonary contusion tends to worsen slowly over a few days, but it may also cause rapid deterioration or death if untreated.

Pulmonary contusion is the most common injury found in blunt chest trauma, occurring in 25–35% of cases. It is usually caused by the rapid deceleration that results when the moving chest strikes a fixed object. About 70% of cases result from motor vehicle collisions, most often when the chest strikes the inside of the car. Falls, assaults, and sports injuries are other causes. Pulmonary contusion can also be caused by explosions; the organs most vulnerable to <a href="blast%20injury">blast injuries</a> are those that contain gas, such as the lungs. Blast lung is severe pulmonary contusion, bleeding, or <a href="edema">edema</a> with damage to alveoli and blood vessels, or a combination of these. This is the primary cause of death among people who initially survive an explosion. Unlike other mechanisms of injury in which pulmonary contusion is often found alongside other injuries, explosions can cause pulmonary contusion without damage to the chest wall.

In addition to <a href="blunt%20trauma">blunt trauma</a>, <a href="penetrating%20trauma">penetrating trauma</a> can cause pulmonary contusion. Contusion resulting from penetration by a rapidly moving projectile usually surrounds the path along which the projectile traveled through the tissue. The <a href="P-wave">pressure wave</a> forces tissue out of the way, creating a temporary <a href="cavitation">cavity</a>; the tissue readily moves back into place, but it is damaged. Pulmonary contusions that accompany gun and knife wounds are not usually severe enough to have a major effect on outcome; penetrating trauma causes less widespread lung damage than does blunt trauma. An exception is shotgun wounds, which can seriously damage large areas of lung tissue through a blast injury mechanism.

The physical processes behind pulmonary contusion are poorly understood. However, it is known that lung tissue can be crushed when the chest wall bends inward on impact. Three other possible mechanisms have been suggested: the <a href="inertia">inertia</a>l effect, the <a href="spall">spall</a>ing effect, and the <a href="Implosion%20%28mechanical%20process%29">implosion</a> effect.

Contusion usually occurs on the lung directly under the site of impact, but, as with <a href="traumatic%20brain%20injury">traumatic brain injury</a>, a <a href="Coup%20contrecoup%20injury">contrecoup</a> contusion may occur at the site opposite the impact as well. A blow to the front of the chest may cause contusion on the back of the lungs because a shock wave travels through the chest and hits the curved back of the chest wall; this reflects the energy onto the back of the lungs, concentrating it. (A similar mechanism may occur at the front of the lungs when the back is struck.)

The amount of energy transferred to the lung is determined in a large part by the compliance (flexibility) of the chest wall. Children's chests are more flexible because their ribs are more elastic and there is less <a href="ossification">ossification</a> of their intercostal <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a>. Therefore, their chest walls bend, absorbing less of the force and transmitting more of it to the underlying organs. An adult's more bony chest wall absorbs more of the force itself rather than transmitting it. Thus children commonly get pulmonary contusions without fractures overlying them, while elderly people are more likely to suffer fractures than contusions. One study found that pulmonary contusions were accompanied by fractures 62% of the time in children and 80% of the time in adults.

Pulmonary contusion results in bleeding and fluid leakage into lung tissue, which can become stiffened and lose its normal elasticity. The water content of the lung increases over the first 72 hours after injury, potentially leading to frank <a href="pulmonary%20edema">pulmonary edema</a> in more serious cases. As a result of these and other pathological processes, pulmonary contusion progresses over time and can cause hypoxia (insufficient oxygen).

In contusions, torn <a href="capillary">capillaries</a> leak fluid into the tissues around them. The membrane between alveoli and capillaries is torn; damage to this <a href="Alveolar-capillary%20barrier">capillary–alveolar membrane</a> and small blood vessels causes blood and fluids to leak into the alveoli and the <a href="Interstitial%20fluid">interstitial space</a> (the space surrounding cells) of the lung. With more severe trauma, there is a greater amount of edema, bleeding, and tearing of the alveoli. Pulmonary contusion is characterized by <a href="hemorrhage">microhemorrhage</a>s (tiny bleeds) that occur when the <a href="alveoli">alveoli</a> are traumatically separated from airway structures and blood vessels. Blood initially collects in the interstitial space, and then edema occurs by an hour or two after injury. An area of bleeding in the contused lung is commonly surrounded by an area of edema. In normal <a href="gas%20exchange">gas exchange</a>, <a href="carbon%20dioxide">carbon dioxide</a> <a href="diffusion">diffuses</a> across the <a href="endothelium">endothelium</a> of the capillaries, the interstitial space, and across the alveolar epithelium; oxygen diffuses in the other direction. Fluid accumulation interferes with gas exchange, and can cause the alveoli to fill with proteins and collapse due to edema and bleeding. The larger the area of the injury, the more severe respiratory compromise will be.

Pulmonary contusion can cause parts of the lung to <a href="consolidation%20%28medicine%29">consolidate</a>, alveoli to collapse, and <a href="atelectasis">atelectasis</a> (partial or total lung collapse) to occur. Consolidation occurs when the parts of the lung that are normally filled with air fill with material from the pathological condition, such as blood. Over a period of hours after the injury, the alveoli in the injured area thicken and may become consolidated. A decrease in the amount of <a href="surfactant">surfactant</a> produced also contributes to the collapse and consolidation of alveoli; inactivation of surfactant increases their <a href="surface%20tension">surface tension</a>. Reduced production of surfactant can also occur in surrounding tissue that was not originally injured.

<a href="Inflammation">Inflammation</a> of the lungs, which can result when components of blood enter the tissue due to contusion, can also cause parts of the lung to collapse. <a href="Macrophage">Macrophage</a>s, <a href="neutrophils">neutrophils</a>, and other <a href="White%20blood%20cell">inflammatory cell</a>s and blood components can enter the lung tissue and release factors that lead to inflammation, increasing the likelihood of respiratory failure. In response to inflammation, excess <a href="mucus">mucus</a> is produced, potentially plugging parts of the lung and leading to their collapse. Even when only one side of the chest is injured, inflammation may also affect the other lung. Uninjured lung tissue may develop edema, thickening of the septa of the alveoli, and other changes. If this inflammation is severe enough, it can lead to dysfunction of the lungs like that seen in acute respiratory distress syndrome.

Normally, the <a href="Ventilation/perfusion%20ratio">ratio of ventilation to perfusion</a> is about one-to-one; the volume of air entering the alveoli (<a href="ventilation%20%28physiology%29">ventilation</a>) is about equal to that of blood in the capillaries around them (<a href="perfusion">perfusion</a>). This ratio is reduced in pulmonary contusion; fluid-filled alveoli cannot fill with air, oxygen does not fully saturate the <a href="hemoglobin">hemoglobin</a>, and the blood leaves the lung without being fully oxygenated. Insufficient inflation of the lungs, which can result from inadequate mechanical ventilation or an associated injury such as flail chest, can also contribute to the ventilation/perfusion mismatch. As the mismatch between ventilation and perfusion grows, blood oxygen saturation is reduced. Pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction, in which blood vessels near the hypoxic alveoli <a href="vasoconstriction">constrict</a> (narrow their diameter) in response to the lowered oxygen levels, can occur in pulmonary contusion. The <a href="vascular%20resistance">vascular resistance</a> increases in the contused part of the lung, leading to a decrease in the amount of blood that flows into it, directing blood to better-ventilated areas. Although reducing blood flow to the unventilated alveoli is a way to compensate for the fact that blood passing unventilated alveoli is not oxygenated, the oxygenation of the blood remains lower than normal. If it is severe enough, the hypoxemia resulting from fluid in the alveoli cannot be corrected just by giving supplemental oxygen; this problem is the cause of a large portion of the fatalities that result from trauma.

To diagnose pulmonary contusion, health professionals use clues from a physical examination, information about the event that caused the injury, and <a href="radiography">radiography</a>. Laboratory findings may also be used; for example, arterial blood gasses may show insufficient oxygen and excessive carbon dioxide even in someone receiving supplemental oxygen. However, blood gas levels may show no abnormality early in the course of pulmonary contusion.

<a href="Chest%20X-ray">Chest X-ray</a> is the most common method used for diagnosis, and may be used to confirm a diagnosis already made using <a href="medical%20sign">clinical signs</a>. Consolidated areas appear white on an X-ray film. Contusion is not typically restricted by the anatomical boundaries of the lobes or segments of the lung. The X-ray appearance of pulmonary contusion is similar to that of <a href="Pulmonary%20aspiration">aspiration</a>, and the presence of <a href="hemothorax">hemothorax</a> or <a href="pneumothorax">pneumothorax</a> may obscure the contusion on a radiograph. Signs of contusion that progress after 48 hours post-injury are likely to be actually due to aspiration, pneumonia, or ARDS.

Although chest radiography is an important part of the diagnosis, it is often not sensitive enough to detect the condition early after the injury. In a third of cases, pulmonary contusion is not visible on the first chest radiograph performed. It takes an average of six hours for the characteristic white regions to show up on a chest X-ray, and the contusion may not become apparent for 48 hours. When a pulmonary contusion is apparent in an X-ray, it suggests that the trauma to the chest was severe and that a CT scan might reveal other injuries that were missed with X-ray.

<a href="Computed%20tomography">Computed tomography</a> (CT scanning) is a more sensitive test for pulmonary contusion, and it can identify <a href="abdominal%20trauma">abdominal</a>, chest, or other injuries that accompany the contusion. In one study, chest X-ray detected pulmonary contusions in 16.3% of people with serious blunt trauma, while CT detected them in 31.2% of the same people. Unlike X-ray, CT scanning can detect the contusion almost immediately after the injury. However, in both X-ray and CT a contusion may become more visible over the first 24–48 hours after trauma as bleeding and edema into lung tissues progress. CT scanning also helps determine the size of a contusion, which is useful in determining whether a patient needs mechanical ventilation; a larger volume of contused lung on CT scan is associated with an increased likelihood that ventilation will be needed. CT scans also help differentiate between contusion and <a href="pulmonary%20hematoma">pulmonary hematoma</a>, which may be difficult to tell apart otherwise. However, pulmonary contusions that are visible on CT but not chest X-ray are usually not severe enough to affect outcome or treatment.

Pulmonary <a href="ultrasound">ultrasound</a>, performed at the bedside or on the accident scene, is being explored as a diagnosis for pulmonary contusion. Its use is still not widespread, being limited to facilities which are comfortable with its use for other applications, like pneumothorax, airway management, and hemothorax. Accuracy has been found to be comparable to <a href="CT%20scanning">CT scanning</a>.

Prevention of pulmonary contusion is similar to that of other chest trauma. Airbags in combination with seat belts can protect vehicle occupants by preventing the chest from striking the interior of the vehicle during a collision, and by distributing forces involved in the crash more evenly across the body. However, in rare cases, an airbag causes pulmonary contusion in a person who is not properly positioned when it deploys. Child restraints such as carseats protect children in vehicle collisions from pulmonary contusion. Equipment exists for use in some sports to prevent chest and lung injury; for example, in softball the catcher is equipped with a chest protector. Athletes who do not wear such equipment, such as basketball players, can be trained to protect their chests from impacts. Protective garments can also prevent pulmonary contusion in explosions. Although traditional <a href="body%20armor">body armor</a> made from rigid plates or other heavy materials protects from projectiles generated by a blast, it does not protect against pulmonary contusion, because it does not prevent the blast's shock wave from being transferred to the lung. Special body armor has been designed for military personnel at high risk for blast injuries; these garments can prevent a shock wave from being propagated across the chest wall to the lung, and thus protect wearers from blast lung injuries. These garments alternate layers of materials with high and low <a href="acoustic%20impedance">acoustic impedance</a> (the product of a material's density and a wave's velocity through it) in order to "decouple" the blast wave, preventing its propagation into the tissues.

No treatment is known to speed the healing of a pulmonary contusion; the main care is supportive. Attempts are made to discover injuries accompanying the contusion, to prevent additional injury, and to provide supportive care while waiting for the contusion to heal. Monitoring, including keeping track of <a href="fluid%20balance">fluid balance</a>, respiratory function, and oxygen saturation using <a href="pulse%20oximetry">pulse oximetry</a> is also required as the patient's condition may progressively worsen. Monitoring for complications such as <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and acute respiratory distress syndrome is of critical importance. Treatment aims to prevent <a href="respiratory%20failure">respiratory failure</a> and to ensure adequate blood <a href="Oxygenation%20%28medical%29">oxygenation</a>. Supplemental oxygen can be given and it may be warmed and humidified. When the contusion does not respond to other treatments, <a href="extracorporeal%20membranous%20oxygenation">extracorporeal membranous oxygenation</a> may be used, pumping blood from the body into a machine that oxygenates it and removes carbon dioxide prior to pumping it back in.

<a href="Positive%20pressure%20ventilation">Positive pressure ventilation</a>, in which air is forced into the lungs, is needed when oxygenation is significantly impaired. <a href="Non-invasive%20%28medical%29">Noninvasive</a> positive pressure ventilation including <a href="continuous%20positive%20airway%20pressure">continuous positive airway pressure</a> (CPAP) and <a href="bi-level%20positive%20airway%20pressure">bi-level positive airway pressure</a> (BiPAP), may be used to improve oxygenation and treat atelectasis: air is blown into the airways at a prescribed pressure via a face mask. Noninvasive ventilation has advantages over <a href="invasive%20%28medical%29">invasive</a> methods because it does not carry the risk of infection that intubation does, and it allows normal coughing, swallowing, and speech. However, the technique may cause complications; it may force air into the stomach or cause aspiration of stomach contents, especially when <a href="level%20of%20consciousness">level of consciousness</a> is decreased.

People with signs of inadequate <a href="respiration%20%28physiology%29">respiration</a> or oxygenation may need to be <a href="Tracheal%20intubation">intubated</a> and <a href="ventilator">mechanically ventilated</a>. Mechanical ventilation aims to reduce pulmonary edema and increase oxygenation. Ventilation can reopen collapsed alveoli, but it is harmful for them to be repeatedly opened, and positive pressure ventilation can also damage the lung by overinflating it. Intubation is normally reserved for when respiratory problems occur, but most significant contusions do require intubation, and it may be done early in anticipation of this need. People with pulmonary contusion who are especially likely to need ventilation include those with prior severe <a href="lung%20disease">lung disease</a> or kidney problems; the elderly; those with a lowered level of consciousness; those with low blood oxygen or high carbon dioxide levels; and those who will undergo operations with <a href="anesthesia">anesthesia</a>. Larger contusions have been correlated with a need for ventilation for longer periods of time.

Pulmonary contusion or its complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome may cause lungs to lose <a href="pulmonary%20compliance">compliance</a> (stiffen), so higher pressures may be needed to give normal amounts of air and oxygenate the blood adequately. <a href="Positive%20end-expiratory%20pressure">Positive end-expiratory pressure</a> (PEEP), which delivers air at a given pressure at the end of the expiratory cycle, can reduce edema and keep alveoli from collapsing. PEEP is considered necessary with mechanical ventilation; however, if the pressure is too great it can expand the size of the contusion and injure the lung. When the compliance of the injured lung differs significantly from that of the uninjured one, the lungs can be ventilated independently with two ventilators in order to deliver air at different pressures; this helps avoid injury from overinflation while providing adequate ventilation.

The administration of <a href="fluid%20resuscitation">fluid therapy</a> in individuals with pulmonary contusion is controversial. Excessive fluid in the circulatory system (<a href="hypervolemia">hypervolemia</a>) can worsen <a href="hypoxia%20%28medical%29">hypoxia</a> because it can cause fluid leakage from injured capillaries (pulmonary edema), which are more permeable than normal. However, low blood volume (<a href="hypovolemia">hypovolemia</a>) resulting from insufficient fluid has an even worse impact, potentially causing hypovolemic <a href="shock%20%28circulatory%29">shock</a>; for people who have lost large amounts of blood, fluid resuscitation is necessary. A lot of the evidence supporting the idea that fluids should be withheld from people with pulmonary contusion came from animal studies, not <a href="clinical%20trial">clinical trial</a>s with humans; human studies have had conflicting findings on whether fluid resuscitation worsens the condition. Current recommendations suggest giving enough fluid to ensure sufficient blood flow but not giving any more fluid than necessary. For people who do require large amounts of <a href="intravenous">intravenous</a> fluid, a <a href="catheter">catheter</a> may be placed in the <a href="pulmonary%20artery">pulmonary artery</a> to measure the pressure within it. Measuring pulmonary artery pressure allows the clinician to give enough fluids to prevent shock without exacerbating edema. <a href="Diuretic">Diuretic</a>s, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, can be used when fluid overload does occur, as long as there is not a significant risk of shock. <a href="Furosemide">Furosemide</a>, a diuretic used in the treatment of pulmonary contusion, also relaxes the <a href="smooth%20muscle">smooth muscle</a> in the veins of the lungs, thereby decreasing pulmonary <a href="vascular%20resistance">venous resistance</a> and reducing the pressure in the pulmonary capillaries.

Retaining secretions in the airways can worsen hypoxia and lead to infections. Thus, an important part of treatment is <a href="pulmonary%20toilet">pulmonary toilet</a>, the use of suction, deep breathing, coughing, and other methods to remove material such as mucus and blood from the airways. <a href="Chest%20physiotherapy">Chest physical therapy</a> makes use of techniques such as breathing exercises, stimulation of coughing, suctioning, percussion, movement, vibration, and drainage to rid the lungs of secretions, increase oxygenation, and expand collapsed parts of the lungs. People with pulmonary contusion, especially those who do not respond well to other treatments, may be positioned with the uninjured lung lower than the injured one to improve oxygenation. Inadequate pulmonary toilet can result in pneumonia. People who do develop infections are given antibiotics. No studies have yet shown a benefit of using antibiotics as a preventative measure before infection occurs, although some doctors do recommend prophylactic antibiotic use even without scientific evidence of its benefit. However, this can cause the development of <a href="antibiotic%20resistance">antibiotic resistant</a> strains of bacteria, so giving antibiotics without a clear need is normally discouraged. For people who are at especially high risk of developing infections, the <a href="sputum">sputum</a> can be <a href="Microbiological%20culture">culture</a>d to test for the presence of infection-causing bacteria; when they are present, antibiotics are used.

<a href="Pain%20control">Pain control</a> is another means to facilitate the elimination of secretions. A chest wall injury can make coughing painful, increasing the likelihood that secretions will accumulate in the airways. Chest injuries also contribute to <a href="hypoventilation">hypoventilation</a> (inadequate breathing) because the chest wall movement involved in breathing adequately is painful. Insufficient expansion of the chest may lead to <a href="atelectasis">atelectasis</a>, further reducing oxygenation of the blood. <a href="Analgesic">Analgesic</a>s (pain medications) can be given to reduce pain. Injection of anesthetics into nerves in the chest wall, called <a href="nerve%20block">nerve block</a>ade, is another approach to pain management; this does not depress respiration the way some pain medications can.

Pulmonary contusion usually resolves itself without causing permanent complications; however it may also have long-term ill effects on respiratory function. Most contusions resolve in five to seven days after the injury. Signs detectable by radiography are usually gone within 10 days after the injury—when they are not, other conditions, such as pneumonia, are the likely cause. Chronic lung disease correlates with the size of the contusion and can interfere with an individual's ability to return to work. <a href="Fibrosis">Fibrosis</a> of the lungs can occur, resulting in <a href="dyspnea">dyspnea</a> (shortness of breath), low blood oxygenation, and reduced <a href="functional%20residual%20capacity">functional residual capacity</a> for as long as six years after the injury. As late as four years post-injury, decreased functional residual capacity has been found in most pulmonary contusion patients studied. During the six months after pulmonary contusion, up to 90% of people suffer difficulty breathing. In some cases, dyspnea persists for an indefinite period. Contusion can also permanently reduce the <a href="Pulmonary%20compliance">compliance of the lungs</a>.

Pulmonary contusion can result in respiratory failure—about half of such cases occur within a few hours of the initial trauma. Other severe complications, including infections and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occur in up to half of cases. Elderly people and those who have heart, lung, or kidney disease prior to the injury are more likely to stay longer in hospital and have complications from the injury. Complications occur in 55% of people with heart or lung disease and 13% of those without. Of people with pulmonary contusion alone, 17% develop ARDS, while 78% of people with at least two additional injuries develop the condition. A larger contusion is associated with an increased risk. In one study, 82% of people with 20% or more of the lung volume affected developed ARDS, while only 22% of people with less than 20% did so.

<a href="Pneumonia">Pneumonia</a>, another potential complication, develops in as many as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the <a href="endotracheal%20tube">endotracheal tube</a> is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People who are at risk for <a href="pulmonary%20aspiration">pulmonary aspiration</a> (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.

A large amount of force is required to cause pulmonary contusion; a person injured with such force is likely to have other types of injuries as well. In fact, pulmonary contusion can be used to gauge the severity of trauma. Up to three quarters of cases are accompanied by other chest injuries, the most common of these being hemothorax and pneumothorax. Flail chest is usually associated with significant pulmonary contusion, and the contusion, rather than the chest wall injury, is often the main cause of respiratory failure in people with these injuries. Other indications of <a href="Thorax">thoracic</a> trauma may be associated, including <a href="sternal%20fracture">fracture of the sternum</a> and bruising of the chest wall. Over half of <a href="Scapular%20fracture">fractures of the scapula</a> are associated with pulmonary contusion. The contusion is frequently found underlying fracture sites. When accompanied by a fracture, it is usually concentrated into a specific location—the contusion is more diffuse when there is no fracture. <a href="Pulmonary%20laceration">Pulmonary laceration</a>s may result from the same blunt or penetrating forces that cause contusion. Lacerations can result in pulmonary hematomas; these are reported to develop in 4–11% of pulmonary contusions.

Pulmonary contusion is found in 30–75% of severe cases of chest injury, making it the most common serious injury to occur in association with <a href="thorax">thoracic</a> trauma. Of people who have multiple injuries with an <a href="injury%20severity%20score">injury severity score</a> of over 15, pulmonary contusion occurs in about 17%. It is difficult to determine the death rate (<a href="mortality%20rate">mortality</a>) because pulmonary contusion rarely occurs by itself. Usually, deaths of people with pulmonary contusion result from other injuries, commonly traumatic brain injury. It is controversial whether pulmonary contusion with <a href="flail%20chest">flail chest</a> is a major factor in mortality on its own or whether it merely contributes to mortality in people with multiple injuries. The estimated mortality rate of pulmonary contusion ranges from 14–40%, depending on the severity of the contusion itself and on associated injuries. When the contusions are small, they do not normally increase the chance of death or poor outcome for people with blunt chest trauma; however, these chances increase with the size of the contusion. One study found that 35% of people with multiple significant injuries including pulmonary contusion die. In another study, 11% of people with pulmonary contusion alone died, while the number rose to 22% in those with additional injuries. Pulmonary contusion is thought to be the direct cause of death in a quarter to a half of people with multiple injuries (<a href="polytrauma">polytrauma</a>) who die. An accompanying flail chest increases the <a href="disability">morbidity</a> and mortality to more than twice that of pulmonary contusion alone.

Pulmonary contusion is the most common cause of death among vehicle occupants involved in accidents, and it is thought to contribute significantly in about a quarter of deaths resulting from vehicle collisions. As vehicle use has increased, so has the number of auto accidents, and with it the number of chest injuries. However an increase in the number of airbags installed in modern cars may be decreasing the incidence of pulmonary contusion. Use of child restraint systems has brought the approximate incidence of pulmonary contusion in children in vehicle accidents from 22% to 10%.

Differences in the bodies of children and adults lead to different manifestations of pulmonary contusion and associated injuries; for example, children have less body mass, so the same force is more likely to lead to trauma in multiple body systems. Since their chest walls are more flexible, children are more vulnerable to pulmonary contusion than adults are, and thus suffer from the injury more commonly. Pulmonary contusion has been found in 53% of children with chest injuries requiring hospitalization. Children in forceful impacts suffer twice as many pulmonary contusions as adults with similar injury mechanisms, yet have proportionately fewer rib fractures. The rates of certain types of injury mechanisms differ between children and adults; for example, children are more often hit by cars as pedestrians. Some differences in children's physiology might be advantageous (for example they are less likely to have other medical conditions), and thus they have been predicted to have a better outcome. However, despite these differences, children with pulmonary contusion have similar mortality rates to adults.

In 1761, the Italian anatomist <a href="Giovanni%20Battista%20Morgagni">Giovanni Battista Morgagni</a> was first to describe a lung injury that was not accompanied by injury to the chest wall overlying it. Nonetheless, it was the French military surgeon <a href="Guillaume%20Dupuytren">Guillaume Dupuytren</a> who is thought to have coined the term "pulmonary contusion" in the 19th century. It still was not until the early 20th century that pulmonary contusion and its clinical significance began to receive wide recognition. With the use of explosives during World War I came many casualties with no external signs of chest injury but with significant bleeding in the lungs. Studies of World War I injuries by D.R. Hooker showed that pulmonary contusion was an important part of the concussive injury that results from explosions.

Pulmonary contusion received further attention during World War II, when the bombings of Britain caused blast injuries and associated respiratory problems in both soldiers and civilians. Also during this time, studies with animals placed at varying distances from a blast showed that protective gear could prevent lung injuries. These findings suggested that an impact to the outside of the chest wall was responsible for the internal lesions. In 1945, studies identified a phenomenon termed "wet lung", in which the lungs accumulated fluid and were simultaneously less able to remove it. They attributed the respiratory failure often seen in blunt chest trauma in part to excessive fluid resuscitation, and the question of whether and how much to administer fluids has remained controversial ever since.

During the Vietnam War, combat again provided the opportunity for study of pulmonary contusion; research during this conflict played an important role in the development of the modern understanding of its treatment. The condition also began to be more widely recognized in a non-combat context in the 1960s, and symptoms and typical findings with imaging techniques such as X-ray were described. Before the 1960s, it was believed that the respiratory insufficiency seen in flail chest was due to "paradoxical motion" of the flail segment of the chest wall (the flail segment moves in the opposite direction as the chest wall during respiration), so treatment was aimed at managing the chest wall injury, not the pulmonary contusion. For example, <a href="positive%20pressure%20ventilation">positive pressure ventilation</a> was used to stabilize the flail segment from within the chest. It was first proposed in 1965 that this respiratory insufficiency is most often due to injury of the lung rather than to the chest wall, and a group led by J.K. Trinkle confirmed this hypothesis in 1975. Hence the modern treatment prioritizes the management of pulmonary contusion. Animal studies performed in the late 1960s and 1970s shed light on the pathophysiological processes involved in pulmonary contusion. Studies in the 1990s revealed a link between pulmonary contusion and persistent respiratory difficulty for years after the injury in people in whom the injury coexisted with flail chest. In the next decade studies demonstrated that function in contused lungs improves for years after the injury.

Along this southern half, it followed <a href="Single%20carriageway">undivided highways</a> and <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">ran concurrently</a> along two freeways, <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">Interstate 75</a> (I-75) and <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a>. Near the foot of the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> in Port Huron, US 25 turned north and northwesterly along the <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a> shoreline to Port Austin.

Created with the initial US Highway System on November 11, 1926, US 25 replaced several previous state highway designations. Some of the preceding highways followed roadways created in the 19th and the early 20th centuries. It initially was only routed as far north as Port Huron; the northern extension to Port Austin happened in 1933. By the end of the 1950s, the entire route was paved. Starting in the early 1960s, segments of I-75 and I-94 were built, and US 25 was shifted to follow them south of Detroit to Port Huron. A business loop was created when the main highway bypassed downtown Port Huron, and then in 1973, the entire designation was removed from the state. The final routing of the highway is still maintained by the state under eight different designations, some <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned</a>.

In its final configuration before it was decommissioned in the state, US 25 entered Michigan south of <a href="Erie%2C%20Michigan">Erie</a> and followed Dixie Highway north-northeasterly away from the state line. The highway ran parallel to <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a> (Telegraph Road) about to the east of that roadway. At <a href="LaSalle%2C%20Michigan">LaSalle</a>, the roadway turned more to the northeast toward <a href="Monroe%2C%20Michigan">Monroe</a>. US 25 then turned back to the north-northeast and followed Monroe Street next to Lake Monroe and through downtown Monroe over the <a href="River%20Raisin">River Raisin</a>. North of town, Dixie Highway turned due north and terminated at an intersection with US 24; US 25 merged onto Telegraph Road, and the two highways <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">ran concurrently</a> northeasterly through rural <a href="Monroe%20County%2C%20Michigan">Monroe County</a>. At the crossing of the <a href="Huron%20River%20%28Michigan%29">Huron River</a>, US 24/US 25 entered <a href="Flat%20Rock%2C%20Michigan">Flat Rock</a> and <a href="Wayne%20County%2C%20Michigan">Wayne County</a>.

The highway followed Telegraph Road through downtown Flat Rock and continued into the suburban area of <a href="Downriver">Downriver</a>. At the intersection with Dix–Toledo Road near <a href="Woodhaven%2C%20Michigan">Woodhaven</a>, US 25 separated from US 24 and continued northeasterly for about to an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a> where it merged onto the freeway. I-75/US 25 continued on the Fisher Freeway through the Downriver suburbs of <a href="Taylor%2C%20Michigan">Taylor</a>, <a href="Southgate%2C%20Michigan">Southgate</a>, <a href="Allen%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Allen Park</a>, <a href="Lincoln%20Park%2C%20Michigan">Lincoln Park</a>, and <a href="Melvindale%2C%20Michigan">Melvindale</a> before entering the city of <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a>. The freeway curved to run east-northeasterly and passed through an industrial area of the city, crossing the <a href="River%20Rouge%20%28Michigan%29">River Rouge</a>. At Clark Avenue, US 25 left the freeway to turn a block south and run along <a href="M-85%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Fort Street</a> parallel to I-75. The highway continued along Fort Street running under the approaches to the <a href="Ambassador%20Bridge">Ambassador Bridge</a> and into downtown.

In Downtown Detroit, Fort Street ended at <a href="Campus%20Martius%20Park">Campus Martius Park</a> at <a href="M-1%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-1</a> (Woodward Avenue). US 25 looped around the park and followed the street named Cadillac Square over to Randolph Street, turning north to connect to Gratiot Avenue, a major thoroughfare on the east side of Detroit. The highway followed Gratiot through the east side of Detroit running north-northeasterly. US 25 intersected the eastern end of the there-unnumbered Fisher Freeway. Gratiot Avenue carried the highway through residential neighborhoods and connected it to the <a href="Detroit%20City%20Airport">Detroit City Airport</a>. East of the airport, the highway intersected the southern end of <a href="M-97%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-97</a> as well. At <a href="M-102%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-102</a> (8 Mile Road), US 25 exited Detroit and entered <a href="East%20Detroit%2C%20Michigan">East Detroit</a>, a suburb in <a href="Macomb%20County%2C%20Michigan">Macomb County</a>. The highway continued, roughly parallel to <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> through <a href="Roseville%2C%20Michigan">Roseville</a> and <a href="Mount%20Clemens%2C%20Michigan">Mount Clemens</a>. At Hall Road near <a href="Selfridge%20Air%20National%20Guard%20Base">Selfridge Air National Guard Base</a>, <a href="M-59%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-59</a> merged with US 25 to follow Gratiot Avenue. At 23 Mile Road west of <a href="New%20Baltimore%2C%20Michigan">New Baltimore</a>, US 25/M-59 turned eastward onto 23 Mile to an interchange with I-94. At that interchange, US 25 turned northeasterly onto the I-94 freeway while M-59 terminated; 23 Mile continued eastward as <a href="M-29%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-29</a> into New Baltimore.

I-94/US 25 ran northeasterly through rural areas of Macomb County, intersecting the southern end of <a href="M-19%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-19</a> near <a href="New%20Haven%2C%20Michigan">New Haven</a>. The freeway crossed into rural southern <a href="St.%20Clair%20County%2C%20Michigan">St. Clair County</a> south of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Michigan">Richmond</a> and continued northeastward to <a href="Marysville%2C%20Michigan">Marysville</a>, where it turned northward, crossing Gratiot Avenue. A business loop, <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">Business US 25</a> (Bus. US 25) ran northeasterly from the freeway along Gratiot Avenue to run parallel to the <a href="St.%20Clair%20River">St. Clair River</a>. From Marysville, the freeway skirted the western side of the <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a> area, intersecting the <a href="M-21%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-21</a> freeway immediately east of the city before turning eastward to curve around the north side of town. After the freeway crossed the <a href="Black%20River%20%28St.%20Clair%20County%29">Black River</a>, US 25 turned northward to separate from I-94.

North of downtown Port Huron, US 25 followed Pine Grove Avenue to the eastern terminus of <a href="M-136%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-136</a> and then followed 24th Avenue out of town. South of <a href="Lakeport%2C%20Michigan">Lakeport</a>, the highway changed names to Lakeshore Road and ran along the <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a> shoreline in <a href="The%20Thumb">The Thumb</a> region of the state. US 25 stayed close to the shoreline and passed <a href="Lakeport%20State%20Park">Lakeport State Park</a> in the <a href="Lakeport%2C%20Michigan">town of the same name</a>. North of the park, the highway crossed into southern <a href="Sanilac%20County%2C%20Michigan">Sanilac County</a> and followed the shoreline to the community of <a href="Lexington%2C%20Michigan">Lexington</a> where it intersected the eastern end of <a href="M-90%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-90</a>. Further north, the highway intersected the eastern end of <a href="M-46%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-46</a> in <a href="Port%20Sanilac%2C%20Michigan">Port Sanilac</a>.

North of the community of <a href="Richmondville%2C%20Michigan">Richmondville</a>, US 25 passed <a href="Sanilac%20State%20Park">Sanilac State Park</a>, and then north of <a href="Forestville%2C%20Michigan">Forestville</a>, it crossed into <a href="Huron%20County%2C%20Michigan">Huron County</a>. On the other side of the county line, the highway passed through the community of <a href="White%20Rock%2C%20Michigan">White Rock</a> and continued along the lake to <a href="Harbor%20Beach%2C%20Michigan">Harbor Beach</a>. There, US 25 intersected the eastern end of <a href="M-142%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-142</a> and began to curve around to the northwest to follow the northern tip of The Thumb. About north of Harbor Beach, the highway passed through <a href="Port%20Hope%2C%20Michigan">Port Hope</a> and turned even more to the northwest on Lakeshore Road. US 25 turned due west at <a href="Huron%20City%2C%20Michigan">Huron City</a> and passed south of <a href="Grindstone%20City%2C%20Michigan">Grindstone City</a> on Grindstone Road. The highway was further inland on this east–west segment as it ran south of <a href="Pointe%20Aux%20Barques%2C%20Michigan">Pointe Aux Barques</a> to <a href="Port%20Austin%2C%20Michigan">Port Austin</a>. At an intersection with <a href="M-53%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-53</a> (Van Dyke Road), US 25 merged with M-53 to run five blocks north along Lake Street to the waterfront in Port Austin. At the intersection with Spring Street just south of the marina, US 25/M-53 jointly terminated while <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a> continued westward along Spring Street.

The chief transportation routes in 1701 were the Indian trails that crossed the future state of Michigan; the one connecting what are now <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a> was one of these 13 trails at the time. Detroit created rights-of-way for the principal streets of the city, the modern Gratiot Avenue included, in 1805. This street plan was devised by Augustus Woodward and others following a devastating fire in Detroit. Gratiot Avenue, then also called Detroit–Port Huron Road, was authorized by the <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> on March 2, 1827, as a supply road from Detroit to Port Huron for <a href="Fort%20Gratiot">Fort Gratiot</a>. Construction started in Detroit in 1829, and the roadway was completed in the same year to Mount Clemens. The rest was finished in 1833. The road was named for the fort near Port Huron, which was in turn named for Colonel <a href="Charles%20Gratiot">Charles Gratiot</a>, the supervising engineer in charge of construction of the structure in the aftermath of the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>.

<a href="Telegraph">Telegraph</a> lines were first installed from the Detroit area south to the Monroe area in the mid-19th century with additional lines north to Pontiac completed around 1868. As these communication lines were installed, roadways were added as needed to provide access for maintenance. The parallel road from <a href="Dearborn%2C%20Michigan">Dearborn</a> south was named for these lines, becoming Telegraph Road. In 1915, the <a href="Dixie%20Highway">Dixie Highway</a>, an <a href="auto%20trail">auto trail</a> that ran south to <a href="Miami%2C%20Florida">Miami, Florida</a>, was extended northward to Detroit, and further in 1919 to the <a href="Straits%20of%20Mackinac">Straits of Mackinac</a>.

When the state highway system was first signed in 1919, five separate highways were designated along US 25's general route from the state line north through <a href="Detroit">Detroit</a> and <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a> to <a href="Port%20Austin%2C%20Michigan">Port Austin</a>. From the state line north to Monroe, the roadway was given the first <a href="M-56%20%281919%E2%80%931957%20Michigan%20highway%29">M-56</a> designation. From there northward, there was no state highway that corresponded to the future US 25, but the first <a href="M-10%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-10</a> followed the future <a href="U.S.%20Route%2024%20in%20Michigan">US 24</a> into the Detroit area. Near <a href="Dearborn%2C%20Michigan">Dearborn</a>, M-10 ran further inland than the future US 25 and included a <a href="concurrency%20%28road%29">concurrency</a> with <a href="M-17%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-17</a> into Detroit. From Detroit northward, Gratiot Avenue was assigned the <a href="M-19%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-19</a> number into the Port Huron area. Through downtown Port Huron, the future US 25 was numbered as the first <a href="M-27%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-27</a> and along the lakeshore north to <a href="Harbor%20Beach%2C%20Michigan">Harbor Beach</a>, the highway was <a href="M-31%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-31</a>. From Harbor Beach into Port Austin, M-27 took over the route.

When the US Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, US 25 was included in Michigan's section of the system. The US Highway designation was assigned to run along Dixie Highway replacing that segment of M-56. From Monroe northward, US 25 overlapped US 24 on Telegraph Road to the Dearborn area and then followed M-17 (Ecorse Road) to Fort Street and into Downtown Detroit. From there, the highway replaced M-19 to <a href="Marysville%2C%20Michigan">Marysville</a> and overlapped M-29 into Port Huron to an intersection with <a href="M-21%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-21</a>; the remainder of the highway to Port Austin was numbered M-29 only. The highway was rerouted off Telegraph Road along Dix–Toledo Highway into downtown Detroit in 1929. By the end of 1932, US 25 was rerouted from downtown Monroe along Dixie Highway north to US 24 instead of turning westward in the city. The next year, US 25 was extended northward from Port Huron to Port Austin, replacing that section of M-29 in the process. The remainder of M-29 westward to <a href="Bay%20City%2C%20Michigan">Bay City</a> was renumbered <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a>.
In 1936, US 25 was changed to traffic along a <a href="one-way%20pair">one-way pair</a>ing of streets on the southwest side of Port Huron. Northbound traffic remained on Military Avenue while southbound traffic was diverted to Electric Avenue. Two US 25A routings were created in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first, near <a href="Erie%2C%20Michigan">Erie</a>, was numbered in 1937, and renumbered US 24A by 1945. The second in Port Huron provided access to the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> from the mainline of the highway starting in 1940. That last segment of US 25 to be paved was completed near <a href="Port%20Hope%2C%20Michigan">Port Hope</a> at the end of the 1950s.

With the completion of a segment of <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a> between <a href="Roseville%2C%20Michigan">Roseville</a> and <a href="Marysville%2C%20Michigan">Marysville</a> in 1963, US 25 was rerouted to follow I-94 from the <a href="Mount%20Clemens%2C%20Michigan">Mount Clemens</a> area north to Marysville. The next year, an additional freeway from the northern end of I-94 at Marysville to Port Huron was completed. I-94/US 25 was extended north and east, replacing part of <a href="M-146%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-146</a> to the Blue Water Bridge. The former route of US 25 through downtown was redesignated <a href="U.S.%20Route%2025%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">Bus. US 25</a> while US 25A became a part of the mainline highway to connect to I-94. In 1967, another segment, this time south of Detroit, was rerouted to follow another freeway, <a href="Interstate%2075%20in%20Michigan">I-75</a>.

Six years later, the US 25 designation was decommissioned in Michigan, although all sections of it are still state highways. The southern section from the state line northward through Monroe was renumbered <a href="M-125%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-125</a> and the US 25 designation was removed from US 24 (Telegraph Road). In the Detroit area, the connection between US 24 and I-75 in <a href="Woodhaven%2C%20Michigan">Woodhaven</a> was redesignated as an <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned connector highway</a> (now <a href="Connector%2024%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Connector 24</a>). The US 25 designation was removed from I-75 northward into Detroit, while the routing along Clark Street became another unsigned connector highway (now <a href="Connector%20850%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Connector 850</a>). The routing along Fort Street and Gratiot Avenue was numbered as <a href="M-3%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-3</a>. The US 25 designation was removed from I-94, and the routing through Port Huron and northward to Port Austin became part of an extended M-25. One segment of highway near Port Huron became an unsigned highway now designated <a href="Connector%2025%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Connector 25</a>.

There were three additional trunkline highways related to US 25 in Michigan, two <a href="alternate%20route">alternate route</a>s and a <a href="business%20loop">business loop</a>.

US Highway 25A (US 25) was an alternate route that started at the <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>–<a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> state line south of <a href="Erie%2C%20Michigan">Erie</a> and ran northward along Summit Street to an intersection with US 25 near Erie. The highway was designated in 1937, and it was replaced by US 24A in 1945. The southern half of the highway was later designated as part of I-75 in 1959, and the northern half is now an <a href="unsigned%20highway">unsigned highway</a> designated <a href="Connector%2075%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">Connector 75</a> by MDOT.

US Highway 25A (US 25A) was an alternate route near Port Huron that provided a connection to the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> to Canada. The highway split from its parent north of Port Huron and followed 24th Avenue south to connect to <a href="M-51%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-51</a> (Pine Grove Avenue) while US 25 followed Lakeshore Road and Gratiot Avenue into Port Huron. The parent highway crossed under the approaches to the Blue Water Bridge, and the alternate route, along with M-51, provided a signed path between US 25 and the bridge. The designation was created in early 1940 and was deleted when US 25 was rerouted in 1963 through Port Huron and over the alternate route.

Business US 25 (Bus. US 25) was an business loop serving the cities of <a href="Marysville%2C%20Michigan">Marysville</a> and <a href="Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan">Port Huron</a>. It started southwest of Marysville near <a href="St.%20Clair%20County%20International%20Airport">St. Clair County International Airport</a> at <a href="Interstate%2094%20in%20Michigan">I-94</a>/US 25 and ran northeasterly along Gratiot Avenue into Marysville. It then passed through the city's downtown area and turned northward along Gratiot Boulevard near the <a href="St.%20Clair%20River">St. Clair River</a>. North of Ravenswood Road, Bus. US 25 split into the <a href="one-way%20pair">one-way pair</a>ing of Military Street (northbound) and Electric Avenue (southbound) until the two directions merged on the south side of Port Huron. The business loop continued northward along through downtown Port Huron and across the <a href="Black%20River%20%28St.%20Clair%20County%29">Black River</a> near its mouth. North of the river. the business loop followed Huron Avenue through the northern side of downtown Port Huron and turned northwesterly onto Pine Grove Avenue. The business loop passed under the approaches to the <a href="Blue%20Water%20Bridge">Blue Water Bridge</a> before terminating at an intersection with US 25.

In 1963, the route of US 25 through the Port Huron area was realigned. In the process, that highway replaced its <a href="%23Port%20Huron%20alternate%20route">alternate route</a>, and the former alignment through downtown was redesignated as a business loop. This arrangement lasted until 1973 when US 25 itself was decommissioned in Michigan. The former routing of Bus. US 25 through downtown Port Huron became part of an extended <a href="M-25%20%28Michigan%20highway%29">M-25</a>. In 1986, the former business loop was redesignated <a href="Interstate%2094%20Business%20%28Port%20Huron%2C%20Michigan%29">Business Loop I-94</a>.

World Science Festival, 2008

The 2008 <a href="World%20Science%20Festival">World Science Festival</a> was a <a href="science%20festival">science festival</a> held in New York City. The festival (May 28 – June 1, 2008) consisted mainly of panel discussions and on-stage conversations, accompanied by multimedia presentations. A youth and family program presented topics such as sports from a scientific perspective and included an extensive street fair. A cultural program led by actor and writer <a href="Alan%20Alda">Alan Alda</a> focused on art inspired by science. The festival also included a "World Science Summit", a meeting of high-level participants from the worlds of science, politics, administration, and business.

The festival was the brainchild of <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> physicist <a href="Brian%20Greene">Brian Greene</a> and his wife, <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>-winning television journalist Tracy Day. It was held in partnership with major New York City cultural and academic institutions, including <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a>, <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> and the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a>.

The World Science Festival was founded by <a href="Brian%20Greene">Brian Greene</a>, a <a href="Columbia%20University">Columbia University</a> physics professor and author of several popular-science books (such as "<a href="The%20Elegant%20Universe">The Elegant Universe</a>"), and his wife, <a href="Emmy%20Award">Emmy Award</a>-winning television journalist Tracy Day. Inspired by a visit to the 2005 <a href="Festival%20della%20Scienza">Festival della Scienza</a> in <a href="Genoa">Genoa</a>, where Greene had been invited to speak, the two decided that founding a similar festival in New York City would be a unique opportunity to bring science to the wider public. As they envisioned it, such a festival would allow them to combine Greene's skills as a scientist and science communicator with Day's as a journalist and producer: the events were meant to be rooted in science, but also to conform to the production standards of professional TV or theater productions.

Day and Greene sounded out scientists and science communicators about their idea, enlisting many of their contacts as the festival's scientific advisors. They met with the presidents of the city's major universities and its cultural and scientific institutions, forging partnerships for the festival's organization. According to Greene, their idea fell on open ears wherever they went, and the most frequent reaction to their proposal was the expression of disbelief that a festival like this did not already exist in New York City. Early 2006 saw the founding of the Science Festival Foundation (SFF), a <a href="non-profit%20organization">non-profit organization</a> based in New York City, dedicated to organizing the festival and related events. Greene serves as the foundation's chairman, and is also on its board of directors. The other members of the board are <a href="Alan%20Alda">Alan Alda</a>, Columbia University president <a href="Lee%20Bollinger">Lee Bollinger</a>, the foundation's president Judith Cox, <a href="New%20York%20University">New York University</a> president <a href="John%20Sexton">John Sexton</a>, and Tracy Day, who also serves as the festival's executive director.

Next came the assembly of a team of producers who were to organize the festival's events. Notably Kyle Gibson, an Emmy Award-winning former producer of <a href="Nightline%20%28US%20news%20program%29">Nightline with Ted Koppel</a>, joined the festival as senior program producer, while production of the Youth and Family Program was put into the hands of Robin Reardon, a former show producer for <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Imagineering">Walt Disney Imagineering</a> and former vice president of <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal Studios</a> Creative, who also became the festival's managing director.

Financial support comes from individuals, from numerous foundations, and from corporate sponsors which, for the 2008 festival, included the <a href="Sloan%20Foundation">Sloan Foundation</a>, the <a href="Simons%20Foundation">Simons Foundation</a>, the <a href="Templeton%20Foundation">Templeton Foundation</a>, the <a href="Rockefeller%20Foundation">Rockefeller Foundation</a>, the Cullman Foundation, and <a href="Credit%20Suisse">Credit Suisse</a>.

The inaugural World Science Festival took place from May 28 to June 1, 2008, at 22 venues throughout New York City. It included 46 events, a street fair and, on its first day, the one-day World Science Summit at Columbia University. The Festival was attended by 120,000 people. It featured several different kinds of presentations: science events for a general audience, a cultural program focusing on art inspired by science, and a youth and family program.Although inaugural, no other festival is planned.

Preceding the public events was the invitation-only World Science Summit on May 28, 2008; New York City Mayor <a href="Michael%20Bloomberg">Michael Bloomberg</a> opened the Festival. At the summit, an invited audience interacted with eminent scientists in several panel discussions. Participants included <a href="Nina%20Federoff">Nina Federoff</a> (Science and Technology Advisor to U. S. Secretary of State, <a href="Condoleezza%20Rice">Condoleezza Rice</a>), biologist <a href="David%20Baltimore">David Baltimore</a> and cancer researcher <a href="Harold%20Varmus">Harold Varmus</a>.

As part of the summit, the winners of the first <a href="Fred%20Kavli%23Kavli%20Prizes">Kavli Prizes</a> were announced in a <a href="simulcast">simulcast</a> linking New York City and <a href="Oslo">Oslo</a>. The first Kavli Prize for astrophysics was awarded to <a href="Maarten%20Schmidt">Maarten Schmidt</a> and <a href="Donald%20Lynden-Bell">Donald Lynden-Bell</a> for their pioneering work on <a href="quasars">quasars</a>. <a href="Louis%20E.%20Brus">Louis E. Brus</a> and <a href="Sumio%20Iijima">Sumio Iijima</a> shared the nanoscience prize for their contributions to the science of <a href="quantum%20dot">quantum dot</a>s and <a href="carbon%20nanotubes">carbon nanotubes</a>, respectively. <a href="Pasko%20Rakic">Pasko Rakic</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Jessell">Thomas Jessell</a> and <a href="Sten%20Grillner">Sten Grillner</a> were awarded the neuroscience prize for their research into how <a href="neuronal%20networks">neuronal networks</a> develop and communicate.

Events covered a wide variety of scientific topics, and combined talks, demonstrations, video presentations and panel discussions. A number of events addressed "big questions". For example, a roster of scientists including physicist <a href="William%20Daniel%20Phillips">William Phillips</a>, philosopher <a href="Patricia%20Churchland">Patricia Churchland</a>, neuroscientist <a href="Antonio%20Damasio">Antonio Damasio</a>, philosopher <a href="Daniel%20Dennett">Daniel Dennett</a>, cognitive scientist <a href="Marvin%20Minsky">Marvin Minsky</a>, and cancer researcher <a href="Harold%20Varmus">Harold Varmus</a>, debated "What It Means to Be Human" in a panel discussion moderated by <a href="Charlie%20Rose">Charlie Rose</a>. A recurring theme was the wider implications of scientific results, as exemplified by a discussion on the promises and consequences of <a href="personal%20genomics">personal genomics</a> involving biochemist <a href="Paul%20Nurse">Paul Nurse</a>, sociologist <a href="Nikolas%20Rose">Nikolas Rose</a>, and <a href="human%20genome%20project">human genome project</a> leader <a href="Francis%20Collins%20%28geneticist%29">Francis Collins</a>. A number of events explored the interface between science and the arts; for instance, a panel including psychologist <a href="Nancy%20C.%20Andreasen">Nancy C. Andreasen</a>, choreographer and dancer <a href="Bill%20T.%20Jones">Bill T. Jones</a>, and actor and writer <a href="Michael%20York%20%28actor%29">Michael York</a> focused on the scientific study of <a href="creativity">creativity</a>.

The Stolen Earth

"The Stolen Earth" is the twelfth episode of the <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%204%29">fourth series</a> and the 750th overall episode of the British <a href="science%20fiction%20on%20television">science fiction television</a> series "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>". It was first broadcast on <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a> on . The episode was written by <a href="show%20runner">show runner</a> and <a href="head%20writer">head writer</a> <a href="Russell%20T%20Davies">Russell T Davies</a> and is the first of a two-part <a href="Fictional%20crossover%23Spin-offs">crossover</a> story with <a href="Spin-off%20%28media%29">spin-offs</a> "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>" and "<a href="Torchwood">Torchwood</a>"; the concluding episode is "<a href="Journey%27s%20End%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Journey's End</a>", the finale of the fourth series, broadcast on 5 July.

The finale's narrative brings closure to several prominent story arcs created during Davies' tenure as show runner. In the episode, contemporary Earth and twenty-six other planets are stolen by the <a href="Dalek">Dalek</a>s, aided by their megalomaniacal creator <a href="Davros">Davros</a> and a shattered but precognitive <a href="Cult%20of%20Skaro">Dalek Caan</a>. As the <a href="Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doctor</a> (<a href="David%20Tennant">David Tennant</a>) and his <a href="companion%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">companion</a> <a href="Donna%20Noble">Donna Noble</a> (<a href="Catherine%20Tate">Catherine Tate</a>) try to find Earth, his previous companions <a href="Jack%20Harkness">Jack Harkness</a> (<a href="John%20Barrowman">John Barrowman</a>), <a href="Martha%20Jones">Martha Jones</a> (<a href="Freema%20Agyeman">Freema Agyeman</a>), <a href="Sarah%20Jane%20Smith">Sarah Jane Smith</a> (<a href="Elisabeth%20Sladen">Elisabeth Sladen</a>), and <a href="Rose%20Tyler">Rose Tyler</a> (<a href="Billie%20Piper">Billie Piper</a>) convene to contact him and mount a defence against the Daleks. In the episode's <a href="climax%20%28narrative%29">climax</a>, the Doctor is shot by a Dalek and begins to <a href="regeneration%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">regenerate</a>.

The episode marks the first appearance of Davros since the 1988 serial "<a href="Remembrance%20of%20the%20Daleks">Remembrance of the Daleks</a>"; he is portrayed by <a href="Julian%20Bleach">Julian Bleach</a>. It is also the first "Doctor Who" appearance of <a href="Gwen%20Cooper">Gwen Cooper</a> (<a href="Eve%20Myles">Eve Myles</a>); <a href="Ianto%20Jones">Ianto Jones</a> (<a href="Gareth%20David-Lloyd">Gareth David-Lloyd</a>); <a href="Luke%20Smith%20%28The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures%29">Luke Smith</a> (<a href="Tommy%20Knight">Thomas Knight</a>); and <a href="Mr%20Smith%20%28The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures%29">Mr Smith</a> (voiced by <a href="Alexander%20Armstrong%20%28comedian%29">Alexander Armstrong</a>), though Myles and Armstrong appeared in other episodes playing different roles. <a href="Adjoa%20Andoh">Adjoa Andoh</a> and <a href="Penelope%20Wilton">Penelope Wilton</a> reprise supporting roles as Martha's mother <a href="Francine%20Jones">Francine Jones</a> and former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Harriet%20Jones">Harriet Jones</a> respectively. <a href="Paul%20O%27Grady">Paul O'Grady</a> and <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> make <a href="cameo%20appearance">cameo appearance</a>s as themselves as television personalities who attempt to assuage public fear.

The two-part finale's epic scale and underlying plot was first conceived in early 2007 as the last regular-series story for departing <a href="television%20producer">producer</a>s Russell T Davies, <a href="Julie%20Gardner">Julie Gardner</a>, and <a href="Phil%20Collinson">Phil Collinson</a>: the fourth series finale is the last story produced by Collinson; and <a href="Steven%20Moffat">Steven Moffat</a> and <a href="Piers%20Wenger">Piers Wenger</a> replaced Davies and Gardner as show runner and <a href="executive%20producer">executive producer</a> respectively in 2010. Major concepts were already specified by July 2007 and the script was written in December 2007; Davies began on the 7th and finished on the 31st. Filming for the finale took place in February and March 2008, and post-production finished in mid-June 2008, only two weeks before the episode aired. To conceal as many plot elements as possible, "The Stolen Earth"'s title was not disclosed until sixteen days before broadcast, preview DVDs omitted the scene where the Doctor regenerates—the last scene is the Doctor being shot by a Dalek—and the episode aired without a preview trailer for "Journey's End".

The episode was reviewed positively by both the audience and professional reviewers. The <a href="Appreciation%20Index">Audience Appreciation Index</a> score was 91: an unprecedented figure for "Doctor Who" and one of the highest ratings ever given to a television programme. On its original broadcast, it was viewed by 8.78 million viewers and was the second most-watched programme of the week; at the time of broadcast, it was the highest position "Doctor Who" had ever reached. Critical reaction was overwhelmingly positive. <a href="Nicholas%20Briggs">Nicholas Briggs</a> and Julian Bleach were commended for their portrayal of Dalek Caan and Davros respectively; and most aspects of Davies' writing were applauded. Most notably, the <a href="twist%20ending">twist ending</a> of the episode was universally appreciated. The shock regeneration created an unprecedented level of public interest in the show, which continued until the transmission of "Journey's End".

At the start of the episode, the Earth is teleported out of its spatial location shortly after the <a href="Tenth%20Doctor">Doctor</a> and <a href="Donna%20Noble">Donna</a> arrive to investigate <a href="Rose%20Tyler">Rose Tyler</a>'s warning at the end of "<a href="Turn%20Left%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Turn Left</a>". The Doctor contacts the <a href="Whoniverse%23Features">Shadow Proclamation</a>, a universal <a href="police">police</a> force, to find Earth. They determine twenty-seven missing <a href="List%20of%20Doctor%20Who%20planets">planets</a>—including Earth, Adipose III, Pyrovillia, and the Lost Moon of Poosh—automatically reorganise into a specific pattern when placed near each other. Donna mentions the disappearance of bees on contemporary Earth; this allows the Doctor to trace the planets to the Medusa Cascade, an inter-universal rift.

A <a href="Dalek">Dalek</a> force, led by their creator <a href="Davros">Davros</a> and the red <a href="The%20Supreme%20Dalek">Supreme Dalek</a>, quickly subjugate Earth despite humanity's fierce resistance. Military bases, including <a href="UNIT">UNIT</a>'s headquarters in New York City and their aircraft carrier "<a href="Valiant%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Valiant</a>", are destroyed. Davros, who was thought to have perished during the <a href="Time%20War%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Time War</a>, was saved by <a href="Cult%20of%20Skaro">Dalek Caan</a>, who entered the conflict after performing an emergency temporal shift. The power needed to enter the Time War—which is "time-locked", preventing time-travellers from entering the conflict—caused Caan to become <a href="precognition">precognitive</a> at the cost of his sanity.

The Doctor's former companions Captain <a href="Jack%20Harkness">Jack Harkness</a>, <a href="Martha%20Jones">Martha Jones</a>, <a href="Sarah%20Jane%20Smith">Sarah Jane Smith</a>, and Rose Tyler—who have all encountered the Daleks before—hide in various places: Jack takes refuge in the <a href="Torchwood%20Institute">Torchwood Hub</a> with his team; Martha uses Project Indigo—an experimental teleport device scavenged from the <a href="Sontaran">Sontaran</a>s—to escape UNIT New York with the "Osterhagen Key", a device that detonates a defensive last resort <a href="nuclear%20weapons">nuclear weapons</a> system; Sarah Jane stays in her home with her son <a href="Luke%20Smith%20%28The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures%29">Luke Smith</a> and supercomputer <a href="Mr%20Smith%20%28The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures%29">Mr Smith</a>; and Rose tracks down Donna's <a href="Sylvia%20Noble">mother</a> and <a href="Wilfred%20Mott">grandfather</a>. They are contacted by former <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Harriet%20Jones">Harriet Jones</a> through a secret "Subwave Network" designed by Mr Copper—a humanoid alien who met the Doctor in "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Voyage of the Damned</a>"—to contact the Doctor's companions in an emergency (although Rose is unable to contact the others). They attempt to reach the Doctor by amplifying the sub-wave signal; Sarah uses Mr Smith's computing power and Torchwood manipulates the <a href="Cardiff%20Rift">spatial-temporal rift in Cardiff</a>. The Doctor, and consequently the Daleks, receive the transmission and trace the signal: the Daleks kill Harriet Jones; and the Doctor is able to locate Earth in a temporally desynchronised <a href="pocket%20universe">pocket universe</a>.

At the end of the episode, the Doctor travels into the pocket universe and receives transmitted images of his companions in the subwave signal. After Davros hijacks the signal and taunts the Doctor about his resurrection and imminent victory, the Doctor breaks communication and attempts to convene with his companions. The Doctor lands on the same street Rose is searching for him on and runs to embrace her, but is shot by a Dalek. Jack promptly destroys the Dalek and helps Rose and Donna carry the Doctor into the TARDIS, where the Doctor begins to <a href="regeneration%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">regenerate</a>.

"The Stolen Earth" and "Journey's End" are the culmination of all four series of "Doctor Who" since its revival in 2005 and show runner <a href="Russell%20T%20Davies">Russell T Davies</a>' work in reviving the show. Davies stated the <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> for the fourth series comprised "an element from every episode—whether it's a person, a phrase, a question, a planet, or a mystery [that] builds up to the grand finale", and the finale "[had] been seeded for a long time, with small but vital references going all the way back to Series One". Several of these thematic motifs are used as major plot points: the significance of <a href="Colony%20collapse%20disorder">disappearance of bees</a>, the Medusa Cascade, and the Shadow Proclamation are explained in the episode. It is the first major crossover between "Doctor Who" and its spin-off series "<a href="Torchwood">Torchwood</a>" and "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>". Davies compared the crossover's conception to a typical child's imagination of a crossover between the "Doctor Who" and "<a href="Star%20Wars">Star Wars</a>" universes: 

The fourth series finale was first planned in early 2006. Its epic scale—including the threat of the destruction of reality and large number of guest stars—was required to compensate for "Doctor Who"'s reduced airtime in 2009 and the imminent departure of producers Davies, <a href="Julie%20Gardner">Julie Gardner</a>, and <a href="Phil%20Collinson">Phil Collinson</a> between mid-2008 and early 2010. The episode's story was defined in early 2007, when Davies disseminated his summary of the fourth series to the production team. In his brief, he described the finale—already titled "The Stolen Earth"—as:
Donna and Midshipman Alonzo Frame (<a href="Russell%20Tovey">Russell Tovey</a>)—from "<a href="The%20Runaway%20Bride%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The Runaway Bride</a>" and "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Voyage of the Damned</a>" respectively—were also planned to make cameos in "The Stolen Earth": Donna was planned to appear before Catherine Tate agreed to reprise the lead role for the entire fourth series; and Frame was present as part of the Shadow Proclamation in several drafts of the episode. Piper's appearance was almost cancelled when filming was originally scheduled during her honeymoon in January 2008. <a href="Freema%20Agyeman">Freema Agyeman</a> was similarly contracted to appear in the finale when she accepted the role of Martha Jones in 2006.

Major concepts of the finale were already developed in March 2007. Davies explained the Medusa Cascade—first mentioned in dialogue between the <a href="Master%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Master</a> and the Doctor in "<a href="Last%20of%20the%20Time%20Lords">Last of the Time Lords</a>"—to "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" and "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a>" journalist <a href="Benjamin%20Cook%20%28journalist%29">Benjamin Cook</a> as "just an area of space" near an inter-universal rift which allowed Rose to return for the fourth series. He sent Cook another email several hours later that explained Dalek Caan's role in the finale and Davros' resurrection from the Time War. The Doctor's regeneration was conceived in two separate parts in mid-2007: Davies outlined the concept of two Doctors in "Journey's End" in late April 2007; and using a regeneration to end the episode was originally conceived on .

Davies started writing "The Stolen Earth" on . He had spent the previous day writing Martha's appearance in New York City. He considered destroying the city but decided against it:
Several days before he started writing the episode, he received a call from Bernard Cribbins, who proposed a scene in which his character, Wilfred Mott, would fire a <a href="paintball">paintball</a> pellet at a Dalek's eyestalk. He proposed it as a reference to the <a href="Peter%20Cushing">Peter Cushing</a> "<a href="Dr.%20Who%20and%20the%20Daleks">Dr. Who</a>" films that he starred in during the mid-1960s, and thought it would provide comic relief in between heavy exposition. The Dalek's response—evaporating the paintball and replying "My vision is "not" impaired!"—was added after Cook reminded Davies it was "obligatory" to invert the recurring phrase spoken when a Dalek was blinded ("Vision impaired!"), and remove a weakness the Daleks had exhibited since their first appearance in the 1963–1964 serial "<a href="The%20Daleks">The Daleks</a>". Wilfred's reaction to Rose after she blew up the same Dalek—asking her if she wanted to swap weapons—was likewise added by Cribbins by way of an <a href="ad-lib">ad-lib</a> during filming.

Davies' first drafts of the Dalek invasion and the Shadow Proclamation were fundamentally different from their broadcast counterparts. Instead of hearing the Daleks' repeated cry of "Exterminate", Captain Jack and Sarah Jane reacted to the sight of Dalek saucers. One saucer would descend towards <a href="Whitehall">Whitehall</a>, destroy <a href="Big%20Ben">Big Ben</a> in transit, and assassinate the <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, Aubrey Fairchild. The Shadow Proclamation—defined in the script as an intergalactic police force that occupied a "huge installation, metal sci-fi towers ranged across a series of linked asteroids, hanging in space, like a <a href="Roger%20Dean%20%28artist%29">Roger Dean</a> painting"—originally featured "every creature [the revival of the show] ever had" and a cameo by <a href="Blon%20Fel-Fotch%20Pasameer-Day%20Slitheen">Blon Fel-Fotch Pasameer-Day "Margaret Blaine" Slitheen</a> (<a href="Annette%20Badland">Annette Badland</a>) as a Jingatheen (a <a href="Slitheen">Raxicoricofallapatorian</a> family) toddler:

The number of monsters and the Proclamation's bureaucratic nature would anger the Doctor and cause Alonzo Frame—now employed as a "Shadow Soldier"—to aid him in filling out paperwork. Frame would be killed by the Daleks later in the story.

A week after he had written the Shadow Proclamation scenes, Davies decided to rewrite the scenes heavily because of monetary and script constraints. Tovey's cameo was replaced with a scene centred on the "Chief Constable" because he was unavailable for filming, much to Davies' disappointment. The Dalek invasion was also rewritten to the version broadcast after he decided a personal assassination of the Prime Minister was uncharacteristically "diplomatic", and recycled the Prime Minister's name for "<a href="The%20Next%20Doctor">The Next Doctor</a>" He also expressed doubts about the Shadow Proclamation to Cook; he thought the Chief Constable was "terribly stripped down", but admitted the Shadow Proclamation was a vital element of the plot. He decided to correct the faults in the Chief Constable by renaming her the "Shadow Architect" (Kelly Hunter):

Davies kept the Shadow Proclamation scenes set before the introduction of the Shadow Architect until early February 2008. The scenes were linked by an argument between the Doctor and the Judoon: the Doctor would complain that Earth's disappearance should take priority, but the Judoon kept insisting the Doctor wait in a queue to report the disappearance. The Doctor would win the argument by overloading the Judoon's translator machines (because he could speak six million languages simultaneously) and order them to allow him to see the Shadow Architect immediately. Davies' submitted script was over the budget afforded for special effects, so he was required to cut the scene, even though Annette Badland had already recorded dialogue for her cameo. The rewritten—and eventually broadcast—scene had the TARDIS "land directly in the Shadow Architect's office" with four Judoon guards.

Davies wrote former Prime Minister <a href="Harriet%20Jones">Harriet Jones</a> (<a href="Penelope%20Wilton">Penelope Wilton</a>) into the script on —before Wilton was approached about reprising the role—because Gardner and Collinson wished for the character to have a satisfying and redemptive conclusion; in the <a href="d%C3%A9nouement">dénouement</a> of her previous appearance in "<a href="The%20Christmas%20Invasion">The Christmas Invasion</a>", the character faced a <a href="motion%20of%20no%20confidence">vote of no confidence</a> in Parliament after she ordered <a href="Torchwood%20Institute">Torchwood</a> to shoot down a fleeing Sycorax ship. Harriet Jones' <a href="story%20arc">story arc</a> thus formed a tripartite storyline which consisted of an introduction, animosity towards the Doctor, and redemption (albeit at the cost of her life). Davies was aware that Wilton was "very hard to book" and restricted her appearance to one day's filming in one location (Harriet's home) to make negotiations easier; had Wilton declined, Davies planned to replace her with either Donna, Mr Copper (<a href="Clive%20Swift">Clive Swift</a>) from "Voyage of the Damned", or Elton from "<a href="Love%20%26amp%3B%20Monsters">Love & Monsters</a>". Wilton accepted unconditionally because she "would do anything for ... Davies" and she wished to act in <a href="Phil%20Collinson">Phil Collinson</a>'s last filming block as producer; her first appearance in "<a href="Aliens%20of%20London">Aliens of London</a>" was filmed in the first production block of the <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%201%29">first series</a>. Collinson and Davies lamented the character's death: Collinson "[couldn't] bear the thought she's dead" and argued that she escaped death; and Davies generally stated in "Doctor Who Magazine" issue 397 that "when [significant characters a writer creates] have to die, it's a genuinely emotional time".

Davies' scriptwriting was affected by the development of a head cold and overrunning script constraints; he was annoyed that he had written "dialogue [he had] been dying to write" with a "faint heart" because he would have to cut it. Because he was behind schedule, he was forced to cancel plans to attend Piper's wedding and almost cancelled plans to celebrate the New Year with his boyfriend. These problems affected his first draft of the Doctor's conversation with his companions and encounter with Davros; he dismissed it as "lame shit" which would waste <a href="Television%20licensing%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">licence-payers'</a> money, and replaced it with a different version hours later. The conversation features all of the Doctor's companions simultaneously talking to the Doctor; Tate, Tennant, and director <a href="Graeme%20Harper">Graeme Harper</a> made the creative decision to have the Doctor ignore any mention of the Daleks because they thought the Doctor's joviality in the scene would be otherwise inappropriate. He eventually finished the script at 1am on <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a>. Cook reviewed the last pages of the script and suggested that the episode should air without a trailer; Davies agreed by noting that "[the BBC] never send out preview discs of the last episode" and that any advertisements for "Journey's End" could "just show lots of Daleks and a repeat of "I'm regenerating" [the Doctor's last line in the episode before the regeneration process starts]. The episode was officially submitted on : the preparation date for "The Stolen Earth" and "Journey's End".

Davies discussed the episode's climax in detail in the show's companion series "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Confidential">Doctor Who Confidential</a>". The climax—a Dalek ray shooting the Doctor and his consequent regeneration—was written by Davies as a pastiche of romance fiction. He compared the reunion between Rose and the Doctor to "the biggest romance [the viewer] has ever seen" and joked that seminal films such as "<a href="Gone%20with%20the%20Wind%20%28film%29">Gone with the Wind</a>" should have ended with a Dalek shooting the male lead, and intensified the scene's emotional impact through Piper's cameos throughout the fourth series. Tennant described the Doctor's wounding as a "moment of high emotion" and lamented that "[the Doctor] can't have a happy moment, especially with a cliffhanger needing to be written". The episode ended during the regeneration because Davies wanted to create the "biggest, most exciting cliffhanger in "Doctor Who"", and to differentiate the scene from previous regenerations, which were always completed at the end of serials. He considered its resolution—the regeneration process being halted by the Doctor, who siphoned the excess energy into his <a href="List%20of%20Doctor%20Who%20items%23Severed%20hand">severed hand</a> after his injuries were healed—legitimate because the hand was an important plot device in "Journey's End"'s climax. The production team realised the halted regeneration and creation of a new Doctor would create a debate amongst fans about whether one of the Doctor's twelve regenerations were used up. The production team originally declined to comment to avoid the debate; Davies later said that he believed that because the process wasn't completed, the Doctor did not use one of his regenerations. However, the 2013 Christmas special <a href="The%20Time%20of%20the%20Doctor">The Time of the Doctor</a>, which was the last regular story for the <a href="Eleventh%20Doctor">Eleventh Doctor</a>, confirmed that this regeneration did indeed count, as the Tenth Doctor was described as having "vanity issues at the time".

The finale contains nineteen principal cast members, sixteen of whom appear in "The Stolen Earth". As a consequence of the episode's crossover nature, the episode is the first appearance of <a href="Gareth%20David-Lloyd">Gareth David-Lloyd</a> as <a href="Ianto%20Jones">Ianto Jones</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Knight">Tommy Knight</a> as <a href="Luke%20Smith%20%28The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures%29">Luke Smith</a> in "Doctor Who". <a href="Eve%20Myles">Eve Myles</a>, who previously played Gwyneth in "<a href="The%20Unquiet%20Dead">The Unquiet Dead</a>", makes her first appearance as the "Torchwood" female lead <a href="Gwen%20Cooper">Gwen Cooper</a>. The episode features many returning characters: <a href="Billie%20Piper">Billie Piper</a>, <a href="Freema%20Agyeman">Freema Agyeman</a>, <a href="Adjoa%20Andoh">Adjoa Andoh</a>, <a href="John%20Barrowman">John Barrowman</a>, <a href="Nicholas%20Briggs">Nicholas Briggs</a>, <a href="Elisabeth%20Sladen">Elisabeth Sladen</a>, and Penelope Wilton reprise roles for "The Stolen Earth". Evolutionary biologist <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a> and comedian <a href="Paul%20O%27Grady">Paul O'Grady</a> make cameo appearances on Torchwood's television screen; cameos by celebrities such as <a href="Davina%20McCall">Davina McCall</a>, <a href="Derek%20Acorah">Derek Acorah</a>, and <a href="Ann%20Widdecombe">Ann Widdecombe</a> had been a part of each penultimate episode since the show's revival. O'Grady was given a cameo after Davies heard that he was a fan of the show; and Dawkins was added to the script by Davies when Cook suggested him to portray the "elderly professor" on a "<a href="Newsnight">Newsnight</a>"-style television programme discussing the new planets in the sky. Dawkins accepted because of his pre-existing association with "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>"; his wife <a href="Lalla%20Ward">Lalla Ward</a> portrayed the second incarnation of the Time Lady <a href="Romana%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Romana</a> between 1979 and 1981. Gary Milner was cast as the <a href="extra%20%28actor%29">extra</a> "Scared Man" after misreading the callsheet as "Sacred Man" and creating a "priest-like" portrayal of the character. Andrew Bullivant—who portrayed the Milkman in the episode's <a href="cold%20open">cold open</a>—was given a role in "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>" serial "<a href="The%20Temptation%20of%20Sarah%20Jane%20Smith">The Temptation of Sarah Jane Smith</a>" as a policeman because of his performance in "The Stolen Earth". <a href="Michael%20Brandon">Michael Brandon</a> later appeared in the audio play "<a href="Lurkers%20at%20Sunlight%27s%20Edge">Lurkers at Sunlight's Edge</a>". <a href="Kelly%20Hunter">Kelly Hunter</a> made a further appearance as the Shadow Architect in the opening episode of <a href="Doctor%20Who%20%28series%209%29">Series 9</a>, "<a href="The%20Magician%27s%20Apprentice%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">The Magician's Apprentice</a>".

"The Stolen Earth" is the first appearance of Davros since the 1988 serial "<a href="Remembrance%20of%20the%20Daleks">Remembrance of the Daleks</a>". Davies postponed Davros' return as he thought that "Davros would dominate the Daleks... like plain robots, instead of the scheming geniuses that they are", and used the previous series to establish the Daleks' individual intelligence. Davros was kept as a contingency plan for several occasions: the character would have appeared in "<a href="The%20Parting%20of%20the%20Ways">The Parting of the Ways</a>" if the <a href="Emperor%20Dalek">Emperor Dalek</a> prop was too expensive; and was "even a possibility" to reside in the titular prison in "<a href="The%20Satan%20Pit">The Satan Pit</a>". Davies wrote an origin story for Davros to clear up the character's convoluted backstory which was eventually cut because of time constraints.

Davies cast <a href="Julian%20Bleach">Julian Bleach</a> to portray Davros after his performances in his <a href="Laurence%20Olivier%20Awards">Olivier Award</a>-winning play "<a href="Shockheaded%20Peter%20%28musical%29">Shockheaded Peter</a>" and as the Ghostmaker in the "Torchwood" episode "<a href="From%20Out%20of%20the%20Rain">From Out of the Rain</a>". To keep the return of Davros secret, the character was referred to as "The Enemy" or "Dave [Ross]" among the crew and was kept anonymous on the shooting scripts as much as possible; however, the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" called the secret "one of the worst-kept ... in television history". <a href="David%20Tennant">David Tennant</a> liked Davros' "Hitlerian megalomaniac" attitude and the nostalgic feeling he created—Tennant's first memory of "Doctor Who" was Davros' debut in "Genesis of the Daleks"—and described himself as being "absolutely captivated by [the] extraordinary creature". To prepare for his role, Bleach reviewed "<a href="Genesis%20of%20the%20Daleks">Genesis of the Daleks</a>", one of his favourite serials, to remind himself of Davros' voice. Bleach described his interpretation of Davros as that of "[a] twisted <a href="grandiosity">megalomania</a>c, [a] <a href="mad%20scientist">mad scientist</a>, [and a] misguided genius" at the same time and described the character as a whole as "a cross between <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a> and <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a>" whose "nihilistic desires" made the character "extraordinary". Bleach would later use the German leader's <a href="Public%20speaking">oratorical</a> skills and his "dogmatic speeches" as a reference point.

Davies, prosthetics designer Neill Gorton, costume designer Louise Page, and concept artist Peter McKinstry then met to discuss the design of Davros for the episode. They agreed to keep the visual design of Davros faithful to that shown in his debut "<a href="Genesis%20of%20the%20Daleks">Genesis of the Daleks</a>"; The only major change was to replace the hand destroyed in "<a href="Revelation%20of%20the%20Daleks">Revelation of the Daleks</a>" with a weaponised robotic version. McKinstry aimed to make Davros "bigger and scarier" by updating the "flimsy" design of the classic series:

The team made two minor changes to the design: they removed Davros' microphone and completely redesigned Davros' headpiece. The team felt that the microphone was redundant because Davros did not "speak in a whisper and need something to make him more audible", and originally intended to leave Bleach's voice unaltered in post-production: the decision to treat the voice was not made until late May 2008; and Gorton thought the original headpiece "always seemed particularly weak" for "such a powerful character". After he was informed that the production designer for "Genesis of the Daleks" wanted the headpiece to resemble a <a href="Brace%20%28orthopaedic%29">medical brace</a>, Gorton redesigned it to appear to be "screwed directly into [Davros'] head".

Page and Gorton contemporaneously collaborated on Davros' upper body. Page designed the leather tunic—which Gorton thought was "a beautiful piece of costume ... which echoes the classic design"—and Gorton designed the ribcage. Davies explained the use of the leather tunic and the exposed ribcage in "Doctor Who Magazine" issue 401:

"The Stolen Earth" is the first appearance of the Daleks since the previous series' "<a href="Evolution%20of%20the%20Daleks">Evolution of the Daleks</a>"; consequently, the prop controllers experienced difficulty re-adapting to their roles. Davies's inclusion of the Daleks as part of the crossover was intended to create a "charged atmosphere" for the protagonists: Jack was killed by the Daleks; Rose and Martha were present at two of their apparent extinctions; and Sarah was present at their creation. The animatronic of the Dalek mutant had to be recreated for the episode, because the previous prop that was used in "<a href="Dalek%20%28Doctor%20Who%20episode%29">Dalek</a>" and "The Parting of the Ways" was irreversibly damaged by water when the latter was filmed. "The Stolen Earth" features two new variants of Daleks: the Supreme Dalek, coloured red as an allusion to the Peter Cushing film "<a href="Dr.%20Who%20and%20the%20Daleks">Dr. Who and the Daleks</a>"; and the partially destroyed Dalek Caan. Caan was described in the shooting script as: Voice actor <a href="Nicholas%20Briggs">Nicholas Briggs</a> adopted a different voice for each model: he adopted a grandiose voice for the Supreme Dalek to fit his perception of the character as egotistical; and he adopted a sing-song voice for Caan to reflect the character's insanity as a result of entering the Time War. Briggs justified his interpretation of Caan by explaining that "[Caan] can't tell when he's happy or sad, his emphasis is very strange and he finds things funny when things aren't funny", creating a <a href="oracle">soothsayer</a> personality with an "almost pure" mind. An expanded theory was published in Briggs' interview with "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a>" in July 2008:

Briggs' portrayal was well-received by the production team: Graeme Harper "loved Caan's giggling" and requested "more ... on every take"; and Davies described Caan as "the creepiest Dalek yet". The finale also introduced minor changes to the Daleks: the characteristic Dalek "plunger" was replaced with a gear mechanism for scenes that featured Davros' guard: the mechanism is used to control Dalek machinery aboard the Dalek flagship "Crucible" more efficiently; and the Dalek eyestalk exhibits a minuscule twitch in scenes, a characteristic added by Graeme Harper to make them appear cautious and "on-edge".

"The Stolen Earth" features the first external location shots of the Daleks since the revival of "Doctor Who" in 2005, and the greatest proportion of filming undertaken at night since the show's revival: apart from the pre-credits sequence set in <a href="Outer%20London">suburban London</a>, all of the scenes set on Earth were filmed at night.

The two-parter took approximately six weeks in 2008 to film; regular filming began on and ended on . The first scene shot for "The Stolen Earth"—a news report that starred <a href="Lachele%20Carl">Lachele Carl</a> as Trinity Wells—was filmed on in a news studio at <a href="BBC%20Cymru%20Wales">BBC Wales</a>' <a href="Broadcasting%20House%20%28Cardiff%29">Broadcasting House</a>. The first week of filming took place entirely at the show's <a href="Upper%20Boat%20studios">studios in Upper Boat</a>, <a href="Rhondda%20Cynon%20Taf">Rhondda Cynon Taf</a>; most of the scenes set in the Torchwood Hub and the TARDIS—including the regeneration scene—were filmed in the period.

The filming schedule of the second and third week alternated between "The Stolen Earth" and "Journey's End". Three days were allocated to filming for "The Stolen Earth": scenes in Donna's house were filmed on on Nant Fawr Road, <a href="Cyncoed">Cyncoed</a>, Cardiff; the "Crucible" Vault set in the Upper Boat Studios was used on ; and scenes at the Shadow Proclamation were filmed at the School of Optometry at <a href="Cardiff%20University">Cardiff University</a> on 8 March 2008.

Filming for the episode's outdoor scenes began in the afternoon of . The first outdoor scene filmed was the cold open, on West Mound Crescent in <a href="Tonteg">Tonteg</a>. Two scenes were filmed in <a href="Pontypridd">Pontypridd</a> on : exterior scenes of the Noble household took place on Hawthorn Road—rather than the usual location in Cyncoed—before relocating to Market Street in the town centre to film the scenes where Rose encounters members of the public in the middle of a riot. Tennant and Tate meanwhile filmed <a href="Doctor%20Who%20campfire%20trailer">the trailer for the fourth series</a> because they were not required on location.

The Doctor and Rose's reunion was filmed on in <a href="Penarth">Penarth</a> town centre, in front of two hundred people; consequently, the scene was leaked onto the Internet and reported in the next day's edition of "<a href="The%20Sun%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">The Sun</a>". Graeme Harper insisted that the scene appear "mystical" because the characters' reunion was "the most magical moment" in the entire episode and Ernie Vincze, the Director of Photography for the show, compared the scene's feeling to the 1980s science-fiction film "<a href="Blade%20Runner">Blade Runner</a>". Exterior filming for the week finished in Brook Street and the adjoining Plantagenet Street in <a href="Riverside%2C%20Cardiff">Riverside, Cardiff</a>, for scenes where Daleks kidnap humans for experimentation and Wilf's attack on a Dalek respectively. Scenes in the <a href="UNIT">UNIT</a> headquarters in <a href="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> were filmed on the evenings of and : the first night, depicting the Dalek invasion, was filmed in a traffic control centre on Junction 32 of the <a href="M4%20motorway">M4 motorway</a>, with the actual Dalek invasion of the building filmed in six minutes at 5:30am the following morning; and the second night, depicting Martha's escape from UNIT, was filmed in a warehouse in <a href="Nantgarw">Nantgarw</a> owned by the <a href="National%20Museum%20Wales">National Museum Wales</a>. Because of a traffic accident on the first night, the production team were prepared to postpone the shoot if needed.

Penelope Wilton reprised her role as Harriet Jones to film a scene on , in a cottage in <a href="Dinas%20Powys">Dinas Powys</a>. Filming was stalled because of difficulty transporting the Dalek props into the cottage: specifically, the raised patio doors made it difficult to balance and maneuver the props. The remainder of the fifth week was used to film Dalek-only scenes at Upper Boat Studios, when the Vault set was redressed as the "Crucible" command deck. Scenes that featured Martha and Sarah in their houses were filmed alternately during the sixth week—the former in the previously regular location of Lower Cwrt-Y-Vil Road in Penarth and the latter primarily at Upper Boat—ending on with scenes of Sarah and Luke in their attic. The last exterior scene filmed for the episode was recorded on in the regular "<a href="The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures">The Sarah Jane Adventures</a>" filming location of Clinton Road in Penarth, and consisted of external shots of Sarah's house and two Daleks accosting Sarah en route to meeting the Doctor. General filming for the episode—and the two-parter—closed with Dawkins' and O'Grady's cameos: Dawkins was filmed at Upper Boat after shooting finished in the attic set; and O'Grady was filmed on alongside an episode of "<a href="The%20Paul%20O%27Grady%20Show">The Paul O'Grady Show</a>" at <a href="The%20London%20Studios">The London Studios</a> on the <a href="South%20Bank">South Bank</a> of the River Thames.

The episode was given to post-production team <a href="The%20Mill%20%28post-production%29">The Mill</a> after filming concluded. The number of effects in the first draft was almost three times larger than broadcast; consequently, several scenes—most notably, all but one shot of the attack on the "Valiant"—were cut from the episode. The Mill created two notable effects for "The Stolen Earth": the invasion of New York City, using reconnaissance photos and establishing shots from the filming of "<a href="Daleks%20in%20Manhattan">Daleks in Manhattan</a>" to create a <a href="2.5D">2.5D</a> shot of the city; and the planetary array at the Medusa Cascade, using a fully three-dimensional model.

<a href="Murray%20Gold">Murray Gold</a> concurrently composed the score for the episode. In conjunction with new cues composed for the fourth series, Gold used some of his earlier work, such as Rose's and Harriet Jones' <a href="leitmotif">leitmotif</a>s, the <a href="Ood">Ood</a>'s "Song of Freedom" from "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Ood">Planet of the Ood</a>", and the appearance fanfare for <a href="Mr%20Smith%20%28The%20Sarah%20Jane%20Adventures%29">Mr Smith</a>, the latter being played "in <a href="diegesis">diegesis</a>". Gold discussed the new cues in the release of :
The episode was allocated a fifty-minute slot on BBC One and the only cuts to the episode were minor pieces of dialogue. <a href="Dubbing%20%28filmmaking%29">Post-synchronisation</a> of crowd dialogue took place on and the episode's final mix took place on : the same day the episode was officially announced by the BBC.

The title of the episode was the last of the fourth series to be revealed; in April 2008, when the other twelve episode titles were revealed, "The Stolen Earth"'s was withheld because "it [gave] away too much"; its title was only revealed two weeks before broadcast. Like the second series finale comprising "<a href="Army%20of%20Ghosts">Army of Ghosts</a>" and "<a href="Doomsday%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doomsday</a>", the final scene of "The Stolen Earth" was removed from preview DVDs sent to reviewers and a media blackout was imposed on any plot details from "Journey's End".

Overnight ratings estimated that "The Stolen Earth" was watched by viewers, approximately 38.3% of the total television audience. The final viewing figure was viewers, the second highest figure of the week beginning ; the highest was the <a href="UEFA%20Euro%202008%20Final">UEFA Euro 2008 Final</a>, watched by 8.84 million viewers. Prior to the episode's broadcast, only "<a href="Voyage%20of%20the%20Damned%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Voyage of the Damned</a>" had ranked as high; the record was subsequently broken by "Journey's End" a week later. Consequently, rival channel <a href="ITV1">ITV1</a> suffered its second worst average audience share in the channel's history: the daily average was 10.2% compared to <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>'s 26.9% average share. The episode received an <a href="Appreciation%20Index">Appreciation Index</a> score of 91 (considered excellent), the highest rating ever received by the series and one of the highest ratings ever for a <a href="analogue%20television%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">terrestrial television</a> programme. Including its viewership on the <a href="BBC%20iPlayer">BBC iPlayer</a> and the following repeats on <a href="BBC%20Three">BBC Three</a> and <a href="BBC%20One">BBC One</a>, "The Stolen Earth" was eventually viewed by 12.86 million viewers: over two million higher than the series average of 10.59 million.

The episode depicted "" as the Doctor's phone number; the number is reserved by <a href="Ofcom">Ofcom</a> for dramatic purposes. After transmission, approximately 2,500 viewers attempted to call the number and received a network message that explained the number was not in service. Ofcom consequently released a statement saying that the calls were free because the number did not exist.

The episode's airing—in particular, its shock regeneration—contributed to a public surge of interest, described by "<a href="Daily%20Mail">Daily Mail</a>" journalist Paul Revoir as ""Doctor Who" fever". The regeneration prompted a large amount of speculation to Tennant's replacement: actor <a href="Robert%20Carlyle">Robert Carlyle</a> was the bookmaker's favourite to replace Tennant; and actors <a href="James%20McAvoy">James McAvoy</a>, <a href="Jason%20Statham">Jason Statham</a>, <a href="Alan%20Davies">Alan Davies</a>, and <a href="James%20Nesbitt">James Nesbitt</a> were less popular predictions. In his article about the public reaction to the cliffhanger, Revoir offered five popular theories: a botched regeneration that resulted in two Doctors; a revelation that the whole series was dream sequence like the ninth season of "<a href="Dallas%20%281978%20TV%20series%29">Dallas</a>"; Tennant's successor being female; a normal regeneration; and a cover-up by the BBC to disguise the fact that "Journey's End" would be Tennant's last appearance; the first theory proved to be correct. The increase of public interest peaked in the two days prior to the transmission of "Journey's End": the day before transmission saw the <a href="Seventh%20Doctor">Seventh Doctor</a>'s actor <a href="Sylvester%20McCoy">Sylvester McCoy</a>, Collinson, Davies, and Agyeman appear on separate daytime television shows; and coverage of the series finale was the top story in <a href="BBC%20News%20Online">BBC News Online</a>'s entertainment section several hours before transmission. Davies attributed the amount of interest the episode created—which was greater than he expected—and the success of the new series to the measures made in keeping plot details secret and creating a "live experience":
The episode was well received by viewers, in particular, the show's fanbase. In "<a href="Doctor%20Who%20Magazine">Doctor Who Magazine</a>"s 2008 viewer poll, the episode won the awards for as "Best Story", "Best Guest Actor" for <a href="Julian%20Bleach">Julian Bleach</a>, "Best Monster" for the Daleks, "Best Music", and "Best Villain" for Davros; the latter was won with a <a href="supermajority">supermajority</a> of the votes cast. The episode was the best-received episode of the fourth series among members of the <a href="Gallifrey%20Base">Doctor Who Forum</a>, with an approval rating of 92.4%. In "Doctor Who Magazine"'s 2009 viewer poll "The Mighty 200", rating all of the "Doctor Who" stories transmitted at the time, the story was rated thirteenth of two hundred, with an approval rating of 84.62%—one hundredth of a percentage point less than the immediately preceding episode, "Turn Left"—and rated as the best story by under-18s and fans since the show's revival in 2005.

"<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>" published three reviews of the episode. Sam Wollaston gave the episode a positive review; he thought it was a "wonderful episode" that "would be hard to top". Wollaston joked in his review about <a href="Richard%20Dawkins">Richard Dawkins</a>'s cameo, and compared his anti-theological mannerisms to the Daleks. <a href="Gareth%20McLean">Gareth McLean</a> described the end of the episode as a "genuine, jaw-dropping, outta-nowhere cliffhanger". He commended the production team for successfully suppressing information about the regeneration in an industry often stifled by leaks. Stephen Brook of "The Guardian"s media blog "Organgrinder", thought the episode was "unbelievably good" and "genuinely scary and exciting". He theorised about the questionable regeneration: whether it was genuine and, if so, who would portray the <a href="Doctor%20%28Doctor%20Who%29%23Changing%20faces">next incarnation of the Doctor</a>; and which companion will die in "Journey's End".

"<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>'s" Thomas Sutcliffe gave the episode a negative review and expressed that the episode was "extermination without inspiration". Before the episode's transmission, he was excited about how Dawkins and O'Grady would appear, and was disappointed when they only appeared when Ianto was <a href="channel%20surfing">channel surfing</a>. Sutcliffe expressed disbelief at the idea that O'Grady would continue to film his talk show, and with a studio audience, in the midst of planetary disaster, but nevertheless praised the cameos. After the cameos, he "began to lose interest" because he did not like the continuity and crossover elements of the episode. He criticised the re-occurrence of clichéd lines "But... that's impossible!", "It can't be!", and "Exterminate!". He closed his review by requesting the producers to "change the record".

Mark Wright of "<a href="The%20Stage">The Stage</a>" posed the question: "How on Earth do you review that?". Wright put the episode as "the most bonkers, delicious, audacious, brilliant, silly, exciting and scary piece of Doctor Who seen in the 45-year history of [the] TV series", and described it as "Doctor Who at its most show stopping, entertaining and brilliant best." In his review, Wright explained his love of crossover fiction and commended Davies for the direction he took "Doctor Who" into becoming what Wright considered to be a "small television industry". Wright complimented the way the episode was keeping with tradition, specifically aspects such as; "Daleks trundling around spaceships having shouty conversations with each other"; "UNIT [being] as useless as ever at repelling alien marauders", and the visual appearance of Davros. He described Bleach's portrayal as a "halfway house between the original version as played by <a href="Michael%20Wisher">Michael Wisher</a> and the more exuberant...turn by <a href="Terry%20Molloy">Terry Molloy</a>". He also thought positively of the final scenes; he commented that "the most flint-hearted must have had a misty eye as Rose found her Time Lord again and they ran towards each other in candy box slow-mo" and he cheered when the "outpouring of romance was brought to an end, as it should be in Doctor Who, by a big Dalek gun".

Ben Rawson-Jones of <a href="Digital%20Spy">Digital Spy</a> gave the episode five stars out of five. In his review, he states that "'The Stolen Earth' does a fine job in weaving components from the current series, former companions, and Davros together." He wrote that he admires Graeme Harper's direction of the scene where Sarah and Jack receive the continuous "Exterminate!" transmission from the Daleks and stated that "Harper's work ... is worthy of the big screen in terms of its breathtaking visual elements." He complimented the casting of <a href="Michael%20Brandon">Michael Brandon</a> as General Sanchez, and expressed hope that Sanchez had survived the Dalek attack because he had the potential to be "the new <a href="Brigadier%20Lethbridge-Stewart">Brigadier</a> figure that UNIT so desperately needs". Rawson-Jones thought Briggs, as the voice of the Daleks, did a "superb job with Dalek Caan's crazy dialect, stemming from a very inventive and bold move by writer Russell T Davies to make this Dalek go doolally". He praised Bleach's performance as Davros, for his "controlled, sinister vocals" that "wonderfully evoke the brilliant but deranged mindset of the Dalek creator". Upon closing, he commended Davies for being "an expert at delivering jaw-dropping finales that give each season a sense of cohesion and up the stakes to almost unbearable levels", and thought that matching the episode's quality would be a "tough task".
Alan Stanley Blair of <a href="Airlock%20Alpha">Airlock Alpha</a> was positive in his review. In his opinion, the episode never failed to deliver and "acts as a tribute to everything Russell T Davies put in place when he resurrected the series in 2005." He described the storyline as "fast-moving, bursting [with] excitement" and said that it contained "everything you would expect to see from an adventure all companions and a new Dalek empire" and "acts as the ultimate climax to four years of storytelling and will leave you with goose bumps for the full 42 minutes." Blair was impressed about how "Torchwood" and "Doctor Who" crossed over when their original target demographics dictated it "should never have happened", and commended scenes that depicted Gwen's concern for her husband <a href="Rhys%20Williams%20%28Torchwood%29">Rhys</a>, Ianto watching "<a href="The%20Paul%20O%27Grady%20Show">The Paul O'Grady Show</a>", and Sarah's and Jack's emotional response to the Dalek transmission. Although his review was positive, he did criticise two parts of the episode: the concept of "time-lock[ing]" the Time War was questioned because the <a href="Time%20Lord">Time Lord</a>s were annihilated in the conflict; and he complained that the Doctor's phone number was out of service.

Dan Wainwright of "The Express & Star" in <a href="Wolverhampton">Wolverhampton</a>, expressed feelings of denial in response to the episode's ending. He asked: "Surely not even Russell T Davies, who seems obsessed with filling episodes with celebrity cameos and John Barrowman, wouldn’t be so maverick as to change his lead actor half way through a season finale?" In his review, Wainwright expressed feelings of amicability and hatred towards Davies for his role in reviving Doctor Who, particularly disliking Davies for romanticising the character, and conversely admiring Davies for making the series popular among children. Catherine Tuckewell, writing for <a href="Blogcritics">Blogcritics</a>, gave a positive review. She opened by saying "Russell T Davies has again extended the boundaries of most infuriating cliffhangers." She commended the cast for "top notch acting" that brought "a whole new level of emotion to the series", specifically Jack and Sarah's reaction to the Dalek warcry transmission, which "brought tears to her eyes". Tuckewell praised the production team for "the most beautiful [outer space shots] outside the Hubble telescope" and the direction which showed the Daleks "at their fearful best".

Simon Brew of science-fiction blog "Den of Geek" commented that "If the aim of a really well done Doctor Who cliffhanger is to leaving you screaming ["no"] at the screen and frantically checking the calendar for the next episode, then it’s fair to say that Russell T Davies has just managed to tick that box." His review both criticised and praised the episode: he summarised the episode as "bursting with a breathless ambition that papered over its occasional cracks"; but lamented that the plot detail felt "muddled" because of how many plot devices were compressed into the episode. Brew thought the ensemble of companions "separated the great actors from the good": he complimented Sladen's and Cribbins's portrayal of fear; and he criticised UNIT, Torchwood, and the Doctor for uncharacteristically admitting defeat. Brew's opinion of Davros and Caan was positive: he thought that "Julian Bleach nailed [Davros]" and the appearance of Davros was "very reverential" to the classic series and that Caan "[added] an interesting dynamic to the Dalek fight". He closed his review by expressing hope that "Journey's End" didn't end like "<a href="Last%20of%20the%20Time%20Lords">Last of the Time Lords</a>" and said: 

<a href="Charlie%20Jane%20Anders">Charlie Jane Anders</a> of the science fiction blog <a href="io9">io9</a> called Davies "the gay <a href="Michael%20Bay">Michael Bay</a>" and "wished for the first time that Davies would stay on to produce a fifth season" of "Doctor Who". She "loved all the silly plot devices and loopy plot twists" such as Project Indigo, the Osterhagen Key, the concept of using "every telephone in England" to call the Doctor, and the fact that Davros was unable to cultivate a Dalek army "without slicing his own torso up". Anders praised Bleach's portrayal of Davros for capturing "the character's mixture of curiosity, manipulativeness and mania better than anyone since [...] Michael Wisher". She also commended the "super-heroics" in the episode, such as Wilf's attack on a Dalek with a paintball gun, Gwen and Ianto's final scene, and the "glowing nobility" of Harriet Jones' sacrifice to help the Doctor: Closing her review, she expressed excitement for "Journey's End", saying the final scene left her with a "feeling like [she had] no clue how it could be resolved, even using crazy RTD logic".

Dave Golder of science-fiction magazine "<a href="SFX%20%28magazine%29">SFX</a>" gave the episode four stars out of five. He noted that after two experimental and "edgy" scripts, "The Stolen Earth" used Davies' regular style of "crowd pleasing script pyrotechnics". He positively reviewed the special effects in the episode, Bleach's acting, the pace of the episode, and the cliffhanger, but criticised the Shadow Proclamation for being "a severe disappointment after all the foreshadowing", and some character moments for being "dropped into the action like little 'emotion bombs'", such as Jack and Sarah's "melodramatic response" to the Dalek transmission. He closed his review by saying "there's no denying [the episode is] all huge fun, like a tipsy romp on a bouncy castle with all the people you’ve ever loved."

Travis Flickett of <a href="IGN">IGN</a> gave the episode 7.6/10 ("Enjoyable"). He opened his review by discussing the concept of "<a href="fan%20service">fan service</a>":
His review focused primarily upon the Daleks. He initially criticised their appearance because of overuse; he discussed their previous appearances in "Doctor Who" since 2005: a singular enemy in "<a href="Dalek%20%28Doctor%20Who%20episode%29">Dalek</a>"; a Dalek empire against Rose in "<a href="The%20Parting%20of%20the%20Ways">The Parting of the Ways</a>"; the Dalek <a href="Cult%20of%20Skaro">Cult of Skaro</a> against the Cybermen in "<a href="Doomsday%20%28Doctor%20Who%29">Doomsday</a>"; and their appearance in 1930s Manhattan in "<a href="Daleks%20in%20Manhattan">Daleks in Manhattan</a>" and "<a href="Evolution%20of%20the%20Daleks">Evolution of the Daleks</a>". He cited Davros and the "year-and-a-half" break as the reason their appearance "sort-of worked"; Davros' appearance "[upped] the stakes", but he criticised the character for "[doing] little to enhance the mythology" and Bleach for a "way over the top" performance. Flickett criticised Rose's isolation from the other companions, but noted that she could defend against the Daleks on her own. He closed his review positively; he said "Whatever the conclusion of this season, Davies run on this series is an enormous achievement."

Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse

The Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse, part of which is sometimes called the Battle of the Gifu, took place from 15 December 1942 to 23 January 1943 and was primarily an engagement between United States and <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Imperial Japanese</a> forces in the hills near the <a href="Matanikau%20River">Matanikau River</a> area on <a href="Guadalcanal">Guadalcanal</a> during the <a href="Guadalcanal%20Campaign">Guadalcanal Campaign</a>. The U.S. forces were under the overall command of <a href="Alexander%20Patch">Alexander Patch</a> and the Japanese forces were under the overall command of <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>.

In the battle, U.S. <a href="United%20States%20Army">soldiers</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marines</a>, assisted by native <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islanders</a>, attacked <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a> (IJA) forces defending well-fortified and entrenched positions on several hills and ridges. The most prominent hills were called Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse by the Americans. The U.S. was attempting to destroy the Japanese forces on Guadalcanal and the Japanese were trying to hold their defensive positions until reinforcements could arrive.

Both sides experienced extreme difficulties in fighting in the thick jungles and tropical environment that existed in the battle area. Many of the American troops were also involved in their first combat operations. The Japanese were mostly cut off from resupply and suffered greatly from malnourishment and lack of medical care. After some difficulty, the U.S. succeeded in taking Mount Austen, in the process reducing a strongly defended position called the Gifu, as well as the Galloping Horse and the Sea Horse. In the meantime, the Japanese decided to abandon Guadalcanal and withdrew to the west coast of the island. From that location most of the surviving Japanese troops were successfully <a href="Operation%20Ke">evacuated</a> during the first week of February 1943.

Eight months after the beginning of the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pacific War</a>, on 7 August 1942, <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> forces (primarily U.S.) landed on Guadalcanal, <a href="Tulagi">Tulagi</a>, and <a href="Florida%20Islands">Florida Islands</a> in the <a href="Solomon%20Islands">Solomon Islands</a>. The landings on the islands were meant to deny their use by the Japanese as <a href="Military%20base">bases</a> for threatening the <a href="materiel">supply</a> routes between the U.S. and Australia, and to secure the islands as starting points for a <a href="Military%20campaign">campaign</a> with the eventual goal of isolating the major Japanese base at <a href="Rabaul">Rabaul</a> while also supporting the Allied <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea campaign</a>. The landings initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign.

The Japanese were taken by surprise. By nightfall on 8 August, the 11,000 Allied troops—primarily from the <a href="1st%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">1st Marine Division</a> of the <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">United States Marine Corps</a> under the command of <a href="Lieutenant%20General">Lieutenant General</a> Alexander Vandegrift—<a href="Battle%20of%20Tulagi%20and%20Gavutu-Tanambogo">secured Tulagi</a> and nearby small islands as well as the Japanese airfield under construction at <a href="Lunga%20Point">Lunga Point</a> on Guadalcanal. The Allies later renamed the airfield <a href="Henderson%20Field%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Henderson Field</a>. Allied aircraft operating out of Henderson were called the "<a href="Cactus%20Air%20Force">Cactus Air Force</a>" (CAF) after the Allied code name for Guadalcanal. To protect the airfield, the U.S. Marines established a perimeter defense around Lunga Point. Additional reinforcements over the next two months later increased the number of U.S. troops at Lunga Point on Guadalcanal to more than 20,000.
In response to the Allied landings on Guadalcanal, the Japanese <a href="Imperial%20General%20Headquarters">Imperial General Headquarters</a> assigned the <a href="Imperial%20Japanese%20Army">Imperial Japanese Army</a>'s <a href="Seventeenth%20Army%20%28Japan%29">17th Army</a>—a <a href="corps">corps</a>-sized command based at Rabaul and under the command of Lieutenant General <a href="Harukichi%20Hyakutake">Harukichi Hyakutake</a>—with the task of retaking Guadalcanal. Units of the 17th Army began to arrive on Guadalcanal on 19 August to drive Allied forces from the island.

Because of the threat by CAF aircraft based at Henderson Field, the Japanese were unable to use large, slow transport ships to deliver troops and supplies to the island. Instead, the Japanese used warships based at Rabaul and the <a href="Shortland%20Islands">Shortland Islands</a> to carry their forces to Guadalcanal. The Japanese warships—mainly <a href="light%20cruiser">light cruiser</a>s or <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s from the <a href="IJN%208th%20Fleet">Eighth Fleet</a> under the command of <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Gunichi%20Mikawa">Gunichi Mikawa</a>—were usually able to make the round trip down "<a href="The%20Slot">The Slot</a>" to Guadalcanal and back in a single night, thereby minimizing their exposure to CAF air attack. Delivering the troops in this manner, however, prevented most of the soldiers' heavy equipment and supplies, such as heavy artillery, vehicles, and much food and ammunition, from being carried to Guadalcanal with them. These high-speed warship runs to Guadalcanal occurred throughout the campaign and were later called the "<a href="Tokyo%20Express">Tokyo Express</a>" by the Allies and "Rat Transportation" by the Japanese.

Using forces delivered to Guadalcanal in this manner, the Japanese tried three times to retake Henderson Field, but they were defeated each time. First, a reinforced battalion from the 28th Infantry Regiment was defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Tenaru">Battle of the Tenaru</a> on 21 August. Next, the augmented 35th Infantry Brigade was defeated in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Edson%27s%20Ridge">Battle of Edson's Ridge</a> on 12–14 September. Finally, the <a href="2nd%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">2nd Infantry Division</a> augmented by one regiment from the <a href="38th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Imperial%20Japanese%20Army%29">38th Infantry Division</a> was defeated with heavy losses in the <a href="Battle%20for%20Henderson%20Field">Battle for Henderson Field</a> on 23–26 October.
Throughout the campaign, the Japanese used Mount Austen (called Bear Height by the Japanese and Mount Mambulu by the local Solomon Islanders), located west of the <a href="Lunga%20River%20%28Guadalcanal%29">Lunga River</a> and about from Henderson Field, to observe the American defenses around Lunga Point. Emplaced artillery on Mount Austen delivered harassing fire on Henderson Field. The hill was also used as a defensive point to protect their positions around the upper Matanikau valley as well as to protect the Maruyama Road, which was a trail used by the Japanese to move men and supplies into the interior of the island. Mount Austen—with a summit of —was not a single peak, but a mixed ridgeline of rocky exposed and jungle-covered ridges and hilltops. After the defeat in the Battle for Henderson Field, the Army Section of Imperial General Headquarters directed Hyakutake to increase the numbers of troops and artillery emplaced on the ridgeline to help prepare for the next planned attack on the Americans. Therefore, Hyakutake directed some of the units that were retreating from the Henderson Field battle area to fortify Mount Austen and nearby hilltops. The forces deployed to Mount Austen included the 124th Infantry Regiment under Colonel <a href="Akinosuka%20Oka">Akinosuka Oka</a> and several artillery units. Later, surviving troops from the 230th Infantry Regiment—which had taken heavy losses during the <a href="Koli%20Point%20action">Koli Point action</a> and subsequent <a href="Carlson%27s%20patrol">retreat</a>—joined Oka's forces around Mount Austen.

On 5, 7, and 8 November, Tokyo Express missions landed most of the 38th Division's 228th Infantry Regiment and the 1st Battalion, 229th Infantry Regiment on Guadalcanal. On 10 November, Japanese destroyers landed Lieutenant General <a href="Tadayoshi%20Sano">Tadayoshi Sano</a>—commander of the 38th Infantry Division—plus his staff and 600 more troops from the 38th. Hyakutake used the newly arrived troops to help stop an American <a href="Matanikau%20Offensive">attack</a> west of the Matanikau from 8–11 November, then sent the 228th and 229th Regiment's units on 11 November to reinforce Oka's forces. Japanese <a href="Major%20General">Major General</a> <a href="Takeo%20It%C5%8D">Takeo Itō</a>—commander of the 38th Division's Infantry Group—later took command of the defenses around Mount Austen.

An attempt by the Japanese to deliver the rest of the 38th Division and its heavy equipment failed during the <a href="Naval%20Battle%20of%20Guadalcanal">Naval Battle of Guadalcanal</a> on 12–15 November. Only 2,000–3,000 of the remaining 7,000 troops from the division reached the island and most of their supplies, ammunition, and equipment were lost. Because of this failure, the Japanese canceled their next planned attempt to recapture Henderson Field.

As December began, the Japanese experienced <a href="Battle%20of%20Tassafaronga">considerable difficulty</a> in keeping their troops on Guadalcanal resupplied because of Allied air and naval attacks on the Japanese supply chain of ships and bases. The few supplies delivered to the island were not enough to sustain Japanese troops, who by 7 December 1942, were losing about 50 men each day from malnutrition, disease, and Allied ground or air attacks. The Japanese had delivered almost 30,000 army troops to Guadalcanal since the campaign began, but by December only about 20,000 of that number were still alive. Of those 20,000, about 12,000 remained more or less fit for combat duty. On 12 December, the Japanese Navy proposed that Guadalcanal be abandoned. Despite opposition from Japanese Army leaders, who still hoped that Guadalcanal could eventually be retaken from the Allies, Imperial General Headquarters, with approval from the <a href="Emperor%20of%20Japan">Emperor</a>, on 31 December, agreed to the evacuation of all Japanese forces from the island and establishment of a new line of defense for the Solomons on <a href="New%20Georgia">New Georgia</a>. The Japanese titled the evacuation effort of their forces from Guadalcanal "<a href="Operation%20Ke">Operation Ke</a>" (ケ号作戦) and planned to execute the operation beginning on 14 January 1943.
In the meantime, the U.S. continued to deliver additional troops to Guadalcanal. The three infantry regiments of the U.S. Army's <a href="Americal%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">Americal Division</a>, the <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">164th</a>, the <a href="182nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">182nd</a> and the <a href="132nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">132nd</a>, were delivered to Guadalcanal on 13 October 12 November, and 8 December, respectively. In addition, the U.S. Army's independent 147th Infantry Regiment plus the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">2nd Marine Division</a>'s <a href="8th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">8th Marine Regiment</a> landed on 4 November. The reinforcements also included additional artillery, construction, aviation, naval, and support units.

On 9 December, U.S. Army Major General <a href="Alexander%20Patch">Alexander Patch</a>—commanding general of the Americal Division—succeeded Vandegrift as commander of Allied forces on Guadalcanal and Tulagi. That same day, the <a href="5th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">5th Marine Regiment</a> departed the island, followed by the rest of the 1st Marine Division by the end of the month. Patch was ordered to eliminate all Japanese forces remaining on Guadalcanal. Patch told his superior—<a href="Millard%20Harmon">Millard Harmon</a>, who commanded all U.S. Army forces in the South Pacific—that he needed more troops to accomplish his mission. In response, Harmon ordered the <a href="25th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">25th Infantry Division</a>—which was in the process of relocating from Hawaii to the South Pacific area—to ship directly to Guadalcanal. The 25th's units would arrive at Guadalcanal in stages during the last two weeks of December and the first week of January 1943. In addition, the rest of the 2nd Marine Division's units—including the <a href="6th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th Marine Regiment</a>—were ordered to Guadalcanal during the same time period. By 7 January, American forces on Guadalcanal would total just over 50,000 men.

On 12 December 1942, a small group of Japanese soldiers from the 38th Field Engineer Regiment successfully infiltrated the American lines from the south, destroying a fighter aircraft and a fuel truck on Henderson Field before escaping back to friendly lines. Two days later, a U.S. Army patrol from the 132nd Infantry Regiment skirmished with a group of Japanese on the eastern slopes of Mount Austen. On 15 December, in yet another night infiltration raid onto Henderson Field, a Lieutenant Ono led four men equipped with <a href="picric%20acid">picric acid</a> blocks past American sentry positions destroying several <a href="Bell%20P-39%20Airacobra">P-39 Airacobra</a> <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighters</a>. Throughout the Guadalcanal campaign, Japanese forces would continue night infiltration tactics against U.S. forces, but causing few American casualties.

General Patch, however, was convinced that these events illustrated an unacceptable risk to Henderson Field by Japanese troops stationed on and around nearby Mount Austen. Thus, on 16 December, in preparation for a planned general offensive to try to destroy all Japanese forces remaining on Guadalcanal, Patch elected to first secure the Mount Austen area. He therefore ordered the 132nd Infantry Regiment to immediately seize the objective. While the 132nd Infantry Regiment had little modern combat experience aside from jungle skirmishes and patrols, it was proud of its combat history, having participated in both the Civil War and <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>, and its young reserve officers and NCOs considered themselves skilled in rifle and machinegun tactics and marksmanship.
The 132nd's commander—Colonel Leroy E. Nelson—directed his 3rd Battalion to lead the American assault on the first of several hills, followed by the regiment's 1st Battalion. Artillery support was provided by <a href="M101%20howitzer">105 mm howitzer</a>s from the U.S. Army's 246th Field Artillery Battalion and the <a href="M116%20howitzer">75 mm pack howitzer</a>s of the <a href="2nd%20Battalion%2010th%20Marines">2nd Battalion 10th Marines</a>.

The exposed hills making up the Mount Austen complex were arbitrarily numbered by the Americans for reference purposes (see map at right). On 17 December, Nelson's 3rd Battalion—commanded by <a href="Lieutenant%20Colonel">Lieutenant Colonel</a> William C. Wright—advanced south of Hill 35 and began to climb toward Mount Austen's summit near Hills 20 and 21. In order to achieve its timetable set by the division commander, the battalion was forced to leave behind many of its support weapons, such as heavy mortars and machine guns, and to take only limited quantities of ammunition and supplies, all of which had to be hand-carried along hacked-out paths through thick jungle. At 09:30 on 18 December, as Wright's lead elements approached, Japanese defenders pinned down the Americans with machine-gun and rifle fire. Exhausted and dehydrated by their trek through the thick jungle, Wright's troops—unable to deploy quickly out of column formation—made no headway against the Japanese defenses.

The next morning, after an artillery barrage and air strike from the CAF, Wright went forward with several artillery observers to investigate the terrain in front of his forces. Using concealed fire lanes, a Japanese machine-gun team killed Wright with a burst of fire at 09:30. Wright's second in command, Major Louis Franco, was unable to get forward and take command until late in the day, preventing the battalion from continuing the attack. At the same time, Japanese riflemen infiltrated the American positions and effectively harassed the command posts of both the 3rd and 1st Battalions as well as the column of heavily loaded American supply and engineer parties on the hacked-out jungle trail linking the battalions with the Lunga perimeter. Both U.S. battalions dug in for the night while artillery bombarded the Japanese positions.
Between 20 and 23 December, the Japanese apparently withdrew from the area, as aggressive U.S. Army patrols encountered no more enemy in the area of Hills 20 and 21 and further to the south. Nelson ordered the two battalions to move west to Hill 31 and then attack south towards Hill 27. On 24 December, the 3rd Battalion was halted on the slopes of Hill 31 by intense machine-gun fire from well-concealed positions.

Facing the Americans was the most strongly fortified Japanese position on Guadalcanal, nicknamed "the Gifu" (after <a href="Gifu%20Prefecture">Gifu Prefecture</a> in Japan) by the Japanese. The Gifu position sat between the summits of Mount Austen and Hills 27 and 31 and consisted of a line of 45–50 interconnected, mutually supporting, well-camouflaged pillboxes dug into the ground and forming a horseshoe shape with the open end to the west. Only about of each pillbox was above ground with walls and roofs, constructed from logs and dirt, up to thick. Each pillbox contained one to two machine-guns and several riflemen; some were sited underneath huge jungle trees. Each of these pillbox emplacements was sited to provide mutual support to the others. Numerous foxholes and trenches provided additional support and cover for additional riflemen and machine-gunners. Behind the pillboxes, the Japanese had sited 81 mm and long-range <a href="Type%2094%2090%20mm%20Infantry%20Mortar">90mm mortar</a>s. The Gifu was commanded by Major Takeyoshi Inagaki with around 800 men from the 2nd Battalion, 228th Regiment and the 2nd Battalion, 124th Infantry.

Between 25 and 29 December, the Japanese defenders prevented the Americans from making any headway in their attempt to overrun the Gifu position. While the U.S. 3rd Battalion—with artillery support—conducted frontal attacks against the position to pin the defenders, the U.S. 1st Battalion attempted to flank the Gifu on the east. However, as the Japanese defenses were fully integrated, the flanking attempt was unsuccessful. By 29 December, U.S. losses had reached 53 killed, 129 wounded, and 131 sick, though morale remained high. Assisting the Americans in this battle were Fijian <a href="commando">commando</a>s led by officers and <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s from the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Expeditionary%20Force">New Zealand Expeditionary Force</a>.
On 2 January, Nelson added his 2nd Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel George F. Ferry—to the offensive and sent them on a march around the Gifu toward Hill 27. The battalion reached the lower slopes of the hill by 16:00 without meeting serious resistance from the Japanese. This same day, Nelson—who was physically and mentally exhausted and may have been suffering from malaria—was replaced as commander of the 132nd by Lieutenant Colonel Alexander M. George. Sources are unclear whether he requested his own relief or was ordered to relinquish command.

The next day, elements of the 132nd's 2nd Battalion occupied the summit of Hill 27, surprised and killed a Japanese 75 mm artillery crew, and successfully repulsed, with help from heavy artillery fire, six Japanese counterattacks on their positions. By this time, the soldiers atop Hill 27 were running extremely short of ammunition and grenades, with Japanese forces returning 10 shots to each one fired by the Americans, and medical supplies were exhausted. The 2nd's efforts to improve its position were made more difficult by the hard coral underneath the hill's sod, which made the digging of foxholes difficult. The remainder of the 2nd Battalion, carrying ammunition, food, and medical supplies, reached Hill 27 and joined the battle, where they soon gained combat superiority over the attacking Japanese. At the same time, with the infusion of new leadership by Lieutenant Colonel George, the 1st and 3rd Battalions attacked and pushed a short way into the Gifu, killing 25 Japanese in the process, then closed the gaps between their units and consolidated their positions, while killing many of the Japanese defenders. One officer from the 2nd Battalion—who had brought his personal sniper rifle to the battle—witnessed the final disintegration of Japanese units attacking Hill 27 with a final flurry of suicidal frontal charges. The Japanese soldiers in the Gifu, who had apparently not been resupplied or replenished during the battle, consumed their last remaining food rations on 1 January.

Since the beginning of its offensive on Mount Austen, the 132nd had lost 115 killed and 272 wounded. The relatively high number of combat deaths were caused in part by wound infections in the tropical conditions and inability to evacuate men wounded in the early stages of the operation. Even after intervention by the 2nd Battalion, wounded men continued to die, unable to withstand the arduous and slippery portage back down improvised jungle trails on a stretcher carried by two men. These losses, plus the effects of tropical diseases, heat, and combat exhaustion, temporarily rendered the 132nd's 1st and 3rd Battalions incapable of further offensive action. Thus, on 4 January, the 1st and 3rd Battalions were ordered to dig in and hold positions surrounding the Gifu on the north, east, and south.

Reviewing the first Mount Austen offensive, former Marine officer and historian <a href="Samuel%20B.%20Griffith">Samuel B. Griffith</a> concluded, "As the thoroughly butchered Mount Austen operation dragged on into January, it became apparent that both Major General Patch and his assistant Division commander [Brigadier General <a href="Edmund%20Sebree">Edmund Sebree</a>] had much to unlearn, and perhaps even more to learn." However, while Patch's decision to attack Mount Austen was criticized, one participant noted the difficulties faced by the 132nd Regiment and its commanders, including the terrain, limited equipment (light mortars and machineguns with limited ammunition supply, no flamethrowers or pole charges), and the necessity of assaulting thoroughly integrated, prepared, and roofed-over Japanese defenses, which resisted direct hits by 75 mm and in some cases 105 mm shells.

For its part, once the 132nd was able to treat its wounded, morale remained high in the newly blooded regiment, which played a significant role in later combat operations on Guadalcanal. The 2nd Battalion, with just 27 killed, was immediately assigned to further offensive combat operations.

Losses among the Gifu defenders are unknown, but were estimated by one 2nd Battalion officer as of 9 January 1943 at 500 killed and wounded; most of the latter would later die of their wounds when combined with illness and starvation. A Japanese officer's recovered diary stated that the Japanese had suffered heavy casualties. Japanese prisoners captured in later operations referred to the combat at Hills 27 and 31 as "The Battle of the Mountain of Blood".

On 2 January, with the arrival of the U.S. Army's 25th Division and the rest of the U.S. Marine 2nd Division, all of the American units on Guadalcanal and Tulagi were together designated as the <a href="XIV%20Corps%20%28United%20States%29">XIV Corps</a> with Patch in command. Sebree took over as commander of the Americal Division. On 5 January, Patch issued his plan to begin operations to clear Guadalcanal of Japanese forces. The 2nd Marine Division was to push westward from the Matanikau River along the coast while the 25th Division was to finish clearing Mount Austen and to secure the hilltops and ridges located around the inland forks of the Matanikau. The Americal Division and the <a href="147th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">147th Infantry Regiment</a> would guard the Lunga perimeter.
The deep river ravines of the Matanikau's upper forks naturally divided the U.S. 25th Division's operations area into three distinct areas, with one main terrain feature dominating each area. East of the Matanikau was Mount Austen. In the wedge between the southeast and southwest forks of the Matanikau Hills 44 and 43 together formed a terrain feature that the Americans called the "Sea Horse", because of its shape when viewed from above. Between the Matanikau's southwest and northwest forks was a much larger hill mass labelled, also because of its shape, the "Galloping Horse".

Major General <a href="J.%20Lawton%20Collins">J. Lawton Collins</a>—commander of the 25th Division—assigned his <a href="35th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">35th Infantry Regiment</a> to clear the Gifu, secure the rest of Mount Austen, and to capture the Sea Horse. He ordered the <a href="27th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">27th Infantry Regiment</a> to seize the Galloping Horse from the north. The 35th and the 27th were then to link up on Hill 53 (the Galloping Horse's "Head") to finish clearing the nearby hills and ridges. Collins placed his <a href="161st%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">161st Infantry Regiment</a> in reserve. Ammunition and supplies for the attacking troops would be transported along rough jeep trails as far forward as possible and then carried the rest of the way by native Solomon Islanders.

Having observed the arrival of the American reinforcements to the island, the Japanese were expecting the offensive. Hyakutake ordered the units on the hilltops around the Matanikau and in the Gifu to hold in place in their prepared positions. The Japanese hoped that as the Americans surrounded and intermingled with the Japanese defensive pockets that the close quarters fighting would prevent the Americans from employing their superior firepower in artillery and close air support. At night, the Japanese planned to infiltrate the American rear areas and interdict their supply lines to prevent the American assault forces from receiving sufficient ammunition and provisions to continue their attacks. The Japanese hoped to delay the Americans long enough for more reinforcements to arrive from Rabaul or elsewhere.

Viewed from overhead with north upward, the Galloping Horse appeared upside down, with Hills 54 and 55 forming the horse's rear legs and Hill 57 forming the front legs. From east to west, Hills 50, 51, and 52 formed the horse's body with the high Hill 53 at the head. Colonel William A. McCulloch—commander of the 27th Regiment—ordered his 1st Battalion to attack Hill 57 and his 3rd Battalion to assault Hills 51 and 52 from Hill 54, which was already in American hands. Defending the Galloping Horse and the nearby fork of the Matanikau were 600 Japanese soldiers from the 3rd Battalion, 228th Infantry Regiment under Major Haruka (or Haruja) Nishiyama.

The American attack commenced at 05:50 on 10 January with a bombardment by six battalions of artillery and airstrikes by 24 CAF aircraft on suspected Japanese positions in the valley between Hill 57 and the jumping-off point for the 1st Battalion. Beginning their advance at 07:30, the 1st Battalion successfully gained the summit of Hill 57 by 11:40 against light resistance.

From Hill 54, the 3rd Battalion's attack route was in the open and dominated by the high ground of Hills 52 and 53. At 06:35, the battalion commenced its assault and occupied Hill 51 without resistance. Continuing its advance, the battalion was stopped by heavy Japanese machine-gun fire short of Hill 52's summit. After an airstrike by six CAF aircraft on Hill 52 and an artillery bombardment, the 3rd Battalion resumed their attack and successfully captured the summit by 16:25, destroying six machine-gun positions and killing about 30 Japanese on the hill.

At 09:00 on 11 January, the 3rd Battalion began its attack on Hill 53. The Japanese quickly stopped the American advance with machine-gun and mortar fire. The Americans—who had not received adequate replenishment in water—began to suffer extensive heat casualties. In one platoon, only 10 men remained conscious by the afternoon.

The next day, the 27th's 2nd Battalion took over the assault on Hill 53. Advancing up the hill, the Americans were stopped short of Hill 53's summit. During the night, Japanese infiltrators cut the telephone line between the 2nd Battalion and its regimental headquarters, affecting unit communications. On 13 January, the Americans renewed the attack but were again halted by heavy Japanese machine-gun and mortar fire.

A knoll on the south edge of the ridge (the "horse's neck") leading to Hill 53 was the fulcrum of the Japanese defenses. The knoll contained several machine-gun and mortar positions which had effectively held off the American attacks across the ridge. The 2nd Battalion's executive officer—Captain <a href="Charles%20W.%20Davis">Charles W. Davis</a>—volunteered to lead four other men against the knoll. Crawling on their bellies, Davis and his party crept to within of the enemy position. The Japanese defenders threw two grenades at them, but the grenades failed to explode. Davis and his men threw eight grenades at the Japanese, destroying several of their positions. Davis then stood up, and while shooting his rifle, then pistol with one hand, waved his men forward with the other as he advanced further onto the knoll. Davis and his men then killed or chased away the rest of the Japanese on the knoll. Silhouetted against the sky during the action, Davis was visible to the Americans all up and down the ridge. Inspired by his actions, plus replenished with water by a sudden thunderstorm, the American troops "came to life" and quickly assaulted and captured Hill 53 by noon. The Americans counted the bodies of 170 Japanese soldiers on and around the Galloping Horse. The Americans suffered fewer than 100 killed.

Between 15 and 22 January, the 161st Infantry Regiment hunted the remainder of Nishiyama's battalion in the nearby gorge of the southwest Matanikau fork. In total, 400 Japanese were killed defending the Galloping Horse and surrounding area. Two hundred Japanese survivors, including Nishiyama, escaped to friendly lines on 19 January.

In the last week of December 1942, Colonel <a href="Robert%20B.%20McClure">Robert B. McClure</a> – the commander of the U.S. 35th Infantry Regiment – was assigned to capture the Sea Horse and complete the reduction of the Gifu on Mount Austen. For this operation, the 3rd Battalion of the <a href="182nd%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">182nd Infantry Regiment</a>—commanded by Lt. Col. <a href="Roy%20F.%20Goggin">Roy F. Goggin</a>—and the 25th Division's Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop were attached to the 35th Infantry.

Colonel McClure—commanding the 35th Infantry—ordered the 35th's 2nd Battalion and the 25th's Reconnaissance Troop to relieve the 132nd Infantry Regiment at the Gifu, with orders to pressure that strong point and keep in touch with Goggin's 3rd Battalion, 182nd on the right. The 35th's own 3rd Battalion—commanded by Lt. Col. William J. Mullen, Jr.—was to advance southwest from Hill 27 (south of the Gifu on Mount Austen), and then swing north to seize Hills 43 and 44. Lt. Col. James B. Leer's 1st Battalion was to be initially in regimental reserve, following about a half-day's march behind Mullen's battalion. The 3rd Battalion, 182d Infantry, was assigned the task of protecting the 25th Division's artillery positions on the open ground north of Mount Austen and east of the Matanikau by advancing south from Hill 65 to block the river gorge and the ravine between Hills 31 and 42 against Japanese infiltration. Maintaining contact with the 27th and 35th Regiments, Goggin's battalion was to assault Sea Horse Ridge in concert with the other two regiments. By 30 December, Goggin's 3rd Battalion, 182nd was in action against Japanese forces atop Sea Horse Ridge.

Colonel McClure next assigned his 2nd Battalion to the assault on the Gifu and sent his 1st and 3rd Battalions on a long march through the jungle to attack the Sea Horse from the south. Defending the Sea Horse and nearby valleys were the Japanese 124th Regiment's 1st and 3rd Battalions, with Oka's command post located nearby. The Sea Horse consisted of two hills, Hill 43 on the south with Hill 44 adjoining to the north.
After taking a circuitous route through the jungle around Mount Austen, at 06:35 on 10 January, McClure's 3rd Battalion launched its attack on Hill 43. As the Americans closed on Hill 43 from the south, a group of Japanese soldiers near Oka's command post spotted the U.S. soldiers as they crossed a stream and attacked immediately, threatening the flank of the American column. Two American soldiers—<a href="William%20G.%20Fournier">William G. Fournier</a> and <a href="Lewis%20Hall">Lewis Hall</a>—successfully repelled the Japanese attack with a machine-gun but were killed in the process. Making progress against light resistance, the 3rd Battalion dug in for the night about short of Hill 43's summit.

The next day, the 1st Battalion of the 35th was added to the attack and the two units—with artillery support—drove through several Japanese machine-gun positions and took Hill 43 by early afternoon. Continuing on towards Hill 44 against light opposition, the Americans captured the rest of the Sea Horse by nightfall, cutting off Japanese forces in the Gifu. The native Solomon Islanders who had been man-packing supplies to the two American battalions during the attack were having difficulty delivering sufficient food and ammunition over the long trail between the Sea Horse and the Lunga perimeter. Thus, <a href="Boeing%20B-17%20Flying%20Fortress">B-17 Flying Fortress</a> <a href="heavy%20bomber">heavy bomber</a>s were now used to air drop supplies to the American troops around the Sea Horse.

On 12 January, the two American battalions of the 35th continued their attack to the west toward the Galloping Horse, but were stopped by a Japanese strongpoint on a narrow ridge about west of their point of departure. After trying to flank the position for two days, the Americans were able to smash the strongpoint with mortar and artillery fire, killing 13 Japanese defenders, and advanced to a ridge overlooking the southwest fork of the Matanikau by 15:00 on 15 January. That same day, Japanese survivors from the Sea Horse battle—including Oka and most of the 124th's headquarters staff section and the 1st Battalion—were able to slip past the American forces and reach friendly lines further west. The Americans counted 558 Japanese dead around the Sea Horse, mostly from the 124th's 3rd Battalion, and captured 17.

On 9 January, McClure's 2nd Battalion—commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Ernest Peters—replaced the three battalions from the 132nd Regiment and prepared to assault the Gifu. Over the next four days, the Americans tried to feel out the Japanese positions with patrols. At the same time, the Gifu defenders attempted to wear down the Americans with night infiltration attacks. By 13 January, the 2nd Battalion had lost 57 killed or wounded. The battle casualties plus malaria reduced the battalion to 75% of its effective strength by the next day. To assist the battalion, the 35th Regiment's anti-tank gun company personnel were attached to the battalion as infantry.
With the capture of the Sea Horse by the Americans, the Japanese in the Gifu were now isolated from the rest of the 17th Army. In a last message over his field phone before the line was cut, Inagaki refused an order from Oka to abandon his position and attempt to infiltrate back to friendly lines, instead vowing that his command would "fight to the last". Inagaki apparently refused the order because to do so would have meant leaving his sick and injured men behind.

An American attack on the Gifu by the entire 2nd Battalion on 15 January was completely repulsed by the Japanese. In response, McClure relieved Peters of command on 16 January and replaced him with Major <a href="Stanley%20R.%20Larsen">Stanley R. Larsen</a>. Larsen decided to completely surround the Gifu and try to reduce it with a massive artillery bombardment on 17 January.

In the meantime, the Americans used a loudspeaker to broadcast a surrender appeal in Japanese to the Gifu's defenders. Only five Japanese soldiers responded. One of the five reported that his company actually gathered to discuss the appeal, but decided not to surrender because they were too weak to carry their injured, non-ambulatory comrades with them to the American lines. Instead, they elected to perish together as a unit. One Japanese officer defending the Gifu wrote in his diary, "I heard the enemy talking in Japanese over a loud speaker. He is probably telling us to come out – what fools the enemy are. The Japanese Army will stick it out to the end. Position must be defended in all conditions with our lives."

At 14:30 on 17 January, twelve <a href="M114%20155%20mm%20howitzer">155 mm</a> and thirty-seven 105 mm guns opened fire on the Gifu. Over the next one and a half hours, the American artillery fired 1,700 shells into an area about square. Because of the lateness of the hour, the Americans were unable to follow the barrage with an immediate attack but instead had to wait until the next day, which allowed the Japanese time to recover. On 18 January, the Americans attacked into the weaker west side of the Gifu, making some headway and destroying several Japanese pillboxes over the next two days until heavy rain stopped the attack on 20 January. That night, 11 Japanese were killed trying to escape from the Gifu.
On 22 January, the Americans were able to move a <a href="Stuart%20tank">light tank</a> up their supply trail to Mount Austen. The tank proved to be the decisive factor in the battle. At 10:20, the tank—protected by 16–18 riflemen—blasted three Japanese pillboxes and penetrated into the Gifu pocket. Proceeding onward, the tank completely traversed the Gifu and destroyed five more pillboxes, breaching a gap wide in the Japanese line. The American infantry surged through the gap and took positions in the middle of the Gifu.

That night, around 02:30, apparently realizing that the battle was lost, Inagaki led his staff and most of the remaining survivors of his command—about 100 men—in a final charge on the Americans. In the charge, Inagaki and the remainder of his troops were killed almost to the last man. At sunrise on 23 January, the Americans secured the rest of the Gifu. Sixty-four men from the American 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry were killed during the assaults on the Gifu between 9 and 23 January, bringing the total number of Americans killed taking Mount Austen to 175. The Americans counted the bodies of 431 Japanese in the remains of the Gifu's fortifications and 87 elsewhere around Mount Austen. Total Japanese losses in the Sea Horse and both Mount Austen battles were probably between 1,100 and 1,500 men.

At the same time that the U.S. Army offensive was taking place in the hills around the upper Matanikau, the U.S. 2nd Marine Division—under the command of Brigadier General <a href="Alphonse%20DeCarre">Alphonse DeCarre</a>—was attacking along the north coast of Guadalcanal. Facing the Marines in the hills and ravines south of Point Cruz were the remains of the Japanese 2nd Infantry Division, commanded by Lieutenant General <a href="Masao%20Maruyama%20%28Japanese%20Army%20officer%29">Masao Maruyama</a>, plus the 1st Battalion, 228th Infantry Regiment from the 38th Infantry Division under Major Kikuo Hayakawa.
On 13 January, the <a href="2nd%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">2nd</a> and <a href="8th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">8th</a> Marine regiments began their offensive with the 8th Marines attacking along the coast and the 2nd Marines advancing further inland. The Japanese were pushed back in some places but held in others, with heavy fighting occurring at several locations in the hills and ravines near the coast. On 14 January, the 2nd Marines were relieved by the <a href="6th%20Marine%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">6th Marine Regiment</a> under the command of Colonel <a href="Gilder%20D.%20Jackson%20Jr.">Gilder D. Jackson</a>.

The Marines renewed the offensive on 15 January. The Japanese stymied the 8th Marines' advance along the coast. Inland, however, the 6th Marines were able to successfully advance about and threatened the flank of the Japanese forces emplaced in front of the 8th Marines. At 17:00, Maruyama ordered his troops to retreat to a pre-coordinated line about to the west.

Early on 16 January, as many of Maruyama's men attempted to comply with the order to retreat, the 6th Marines turned and drove to the coast, trapping most of Maruyama's 4th and 16th Regiments between themselves and the 8th Marines. By 14:00 on 17 January, the Marines had destroyed the Japanese forces trapped in the pocket, killing 643 and capturing two.

On 15 January, an IJA representative from Rabaul reached Guadalcanal on a Tokyo Express mission and informed Hyakutake of the decision to withdraw Japanese forces from the island. Grudgingly accepting the order, the 17th Army staff communicated the "Ke" evacuation plan to their forces on 18 January. The plan directed the 38th Division to disengage and withdraw towards Cape Esperance on the western end of Guadalcanal beginning on 20 January. The 38th's retirement would be covered by the 2nd Division and other units, which would then follow the 38th westward. Any troops unable to move were encouraged to kill themselves to "uphold the honor of the Imperial Army". From Cape Esperance the Japanese navy planned to evacuate the army forces over the last few days of January and first week of February with a projected completion date of the evacuation of 10 February.
The U.S. and its Allies mistook Japanese preparations for "Ke" as another reinforcement attempt. With this in mind, Patch ordered his forces to launch another offensive against the Japanese forces west of the Matanikau. On 21 January, the 27th and 161st Regiments pushed westward from the area of the Galloping Horse. The Americans—unaware that the 38th Division was withdrawing in preparation to evacuate the island—were surprised to encounter light resistance. Advancing more quickly through the inland hills and ridges than the Japanese had anticipated, by 22 January the Americans were in position to capture Kokumbona on the coast, headquarters of the 17th Army, and completely cut off the remainder of the 2nd Division.

Reacting quickly to the situation, the Japanese hurriedly evacuated Kokumbona and ordered the 2nd Division to retire westward immediately. The Americans captured Kokumbona on 23 January. Although some Japanese units were trapped between the American forces and destroyed, most of the 2nd Division's survivors escaped.

Over the next week, the Japanese rear-guard—assisted by difficult terrain—effectively delayed the American advance westward from Kokumbona. General Patch—still believing that a Japanese reinforcement effort was imminent—kept most of his forces back to guard Henderson Field, sending only one regiment at a time to continue the advance. Thus, the majority of the surviving Japanese army forces were able to gather at Cape Esperance by the end of January. On 1, 4, and 7 February, Japanese warships successfully evacuated 10,652 army troops from the island. On 9 February, the Americans discovered that the Japanese were gone and declared Guadalcanal secure.

In hindsight, some historians have faulted the Americans—especially Patch and Admiral <a href="William%20Halsey">William Halsey</a>, commander of Allied forces in the South Pacific—for not taking advantage of their ground, aerial, and naval superiority to prevent the successful Japanese evacuation of most of their surviving forces from Guadalcanal. Halsey had just been recently repulsed at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Rennell%20Island">Battle of Rennell Island</a>. Patch and Harmon's insistence on taking Mount Austen has been cited as one of the factors that delayed the American's main attack to the west, giving the 17th Army a chance to escape. Said <a href="Merrill%20B.%20Twining">Merrill B. Twining</a> of the Japanese forces deployed on and around Mount Austen, "Theoretically these Japanese did offer a threat to our major force advancing westward along the coast, but as a practical matter these isolated groups were composed of sick and starving men unable to do anything more than die in place. Under the circumstances disclosed by subsequent events, it is obvious that Mt. Austen was just part of the scenery and of no significant import to either of the antagonists."

Nevertheless, the larger successful campaign to recapture Guadalcanal from the Japanese was an important strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies. Building on their success at Guadalcanal and elsewhere, the Allies continued their campaign against Japan, ultimately culminating in Japan's defeat and the end of World War II.
