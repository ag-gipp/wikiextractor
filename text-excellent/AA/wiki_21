William H. Seward

William Henry Seward (May 16, 1801 – October 10, 1872) was <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Secretary of State</a> from 1861 to 1869, and earlier served as <a href="List%20of%20Governors%20of%20New%20York">Governor of New York</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Senate">United States Senator</a>. A determined opponent of the spread of slavery in the years leading up to the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, he was a dominant figure in the <a href="History%20of%20the%20United%20States%20Republican%20Party">Republican Party in its formative years</a>, and was praised for his work on behalf of the Union as Secretary of State during the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>.

Seward was born in <a href="Florida%2C%20Orange%20County%2C%20New%20York">Florida, Orange County, New York</a>, where his father was a farmer and owned slaves. He was educated as a lawyer and moved to the <a href="Central%20New%20York">Central New York</a> town of <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20York">Auburn</a>. Seward was elected to the <a href="New%20York%20State%20Senate">New York State Senate</a> in 1830 as an <a href="Anti-Masonic%20Party">Anti-Mason</a>. Four years later, he became the gubernatorial nominee of the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a>. Though he was not successful in that race, Seward was elected governor in 1838 and won a second two-year term in 1840. During this period, he signed several laws that advanced the rights and opportunities for black residents, as well as guaranteeing fugitive slaves jury trials in the state. The legislation protected abolitionists, and he used his position to intervene in cases of freed black people who were enslaved in the South.

After many years of practicing law in Auburn, he was finally elected by the state legislature to the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> in 1849. Seward's strong stances and provocative words against slavery brought him hatred in the South. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1855, and soon joined the nascent <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a>, becoming one of its leading figures. As the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">1860 presidential election</a> approached, he was regarded as the leading candidate for the Republican nomination. Several factors, including attitudes to his vocal opposition to slavery, his support for immigrants and Catholics, and his association with editor and <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a> <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a>, worked against him and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> secured the presidential nomination. Although devastated by his loss, he campaigned for Lincoln, who was elected and appointed him Secretary of State.

Seward did his best to stop the southern states from seceding; once that failed, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to the Union cause. His firm stance against foreign intervention in the Civil War helped deter the United Kingdom and France from entering the conflict and possibly gaining the independence of the <a href="Confederate%20States">Confederate States</a>. He was one of the targets of the 1865 <a href="Assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination plot</a> that killed Lincoln, and was seriously wounded by conspirator <a href="Lewis%20Powell%20%28conspirator%29">Lewis Powell</a>. Seward remained loyally at his post through the presidency of <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, during which he negotiated the <a href="Alaska%20Purchase">Alaska Purchase</a> in 1867 and supported Johnson during his <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">impeachment</a>. His contemporary <a href="Carl%20Schurz">Carl Schurz</a> described Seward as "one of those spirits who sometimes will go ahead of public opinion instead of tamely following its footprints."

Seward was born in on May 16, 1801, in the small community of <a href="Florida%2C%20Orange%20County%2C%20New%20York">Florida, New York</a>, in <a href="Orange%20County%2C%20New%20York">Orange County</a>. He was the fourth son of <a href="Samuel%20S.%20Seward">Samuel Sweezy Seward</a> and his wife Mary (Jennings) Seward. Samuel Seward was a wealthy landowner and slaveholder in New York State; slavery was not fully abolished in the state until 1827. Florida was located some north of New York City, west of the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, and was a small rural village of perhaps a dozen homes. Young Seward attended school there, and also in the nearby <a href="county%20seat">county seat</a> of <a href="Goshen%2C%20New%20York">Goshen</a>. He was a bright student who enjoyed his studies. In later years, one of the former family slaves would relate that instead of running away from school to go home, Seward would run away from home to go to school.

At the age of 15, Henry—he was known by his middle name as a boy—was sent to <a href="Union%20College">Union College</a> in <a href="Schenectady%2C%20New%20York">Schenectady, New York</a>. Admitted to the <a href="Sophomore%20year">sophomore</a> class, Seward was an outstanding student and was elected to <a href="Phi%20Beta%20Kappa">Phi Beta Kappa</a>. Seward's fellow students included <a href="Richard%20M.%20Blatchford%20%28attorney%29">Richard M. Blatchford</a>, who became a lifelong legal and political associate. Samuel Seward kept his son short on cash, and in December 1818—during the middle of Henry's final year at Union—the two quarreled about money. The younger Seward returned to Schenectady, but soon left school in company with a fellow student, Alvah Wilson. The two took a ship from New York to Georgia, where Wilson had been offered a job as rector, or principal, of a new academy in rural <a href="Putnam%20County%2C%20Georgia">Putnam County</a>. En route, Wilson took a job at another school, leaving Seward to continue on to <a href="Eatonton%2C%20Georgia">Eatonton</a> in Putnam County. The trustees interviewed the 17-year-old Seward, and found his qualifications acceptable.

Seward enjoyed his time in Georgia, where he was accepted as an adult for the first time in his life. He was treated hospitably, but also witnessed the ill-treatment of slaves. Seward was persuaded to return to New York by his family, and did so in June 1819. As it was too late for him to graduate with his class, he studied law at an attorney's office in Goshen before returning to Union College, securing his degree with highest honors in June 1820.

After graduation, Seward spent much of the following two years studying law in Goshen and New York City with attorneys <a href="John%20Duer">John Duer</a>, <a href="John%20Anthon">John Anthon</a> and <a href="Ogden%20Hoffman">Ogden Hoffman</a>. He passed the <a href="bar%20examination">bar examination</a> in late 1822. He could have practiced in Goshen, but he disliked the town and sought a practice in growing <a href="Western%20New%20York">Western New York</a>. Seward decided upon <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20York">Auburn</a> in <a href="Cayuga%20County%2C%20New%20York">Cayuga County</a>, which was about west of Albany and northwest of Goshen. He joined the practice of retired judge <a href="Elijah%20Miller">Elijah Miller</a>, whose daughter <a href="Frances%20Adeline%20Seward">Frances Adeline Miller</a> was a classmate of his sister Cornelia at <a href="Emma%20Willard">Emma Willard</a>'s <a href="Emma%20Willard%20School">Troy Female Seminary</a>. Seward married Frances Miller on October 20, 1824.

In 1824, Seward was journeying with his wife to <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20New%20York">Niagara Falls</a> when one of the wheels on his carriage was damaged while they passed through <a href="Rochester%2C%20New%20York">Rochester</a>. Among those who came to their aid was local newspaper publisher <a href="Thurlow%20Weed">Thurlow Weed</a>. Seward and Weed would become closer in the years ahead as they found they shared a belief that government policies should promote infrastructure improvements, such as roads and canals. Weed, deemed by some as one of the earliest <a href="political%20boss">political boss</a>es, would become a major ally of Seward. Despite the benefits to Seward's career from Weed's support, perceptions that Seward was too much controlled by Weed became a factor in the former's defeat for the Republican nomination for president in 1860.

Almost from the time he settled in Auburn, Seward involved himself in politics. At that time, the political system was in flux as new parties evolved. In New York State, there were generally two factions, which went by varying names, but were characterized by the fact that <a href="Martin%20Van%20Buren">Martin Van Buren</a> led one element, and the other opposed him. Van Buren, over a quarter century, held a series of senior posts, generally in the federal government. His allies were dubbed the <a href="Albany%20Regency">Albany Regency</a>, as they governed for Van Buren while he was away.

Seward originally supported the Regency, but by 1824 had broken from it, concluding it was corrupt. He became part of the <a href="Anti-Masonry">Anti-Masonic Party</a>, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of <a href="William%20Morgan%20%28anti-Mason%29">William Morgan</a>, a <a href="Free%20mason">Mason</a> in <a href="Upstate%20New%20York">Upstate New York</a>; he was most likely killed by fellow Masons for publishing a book revealing the order's secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a> was General <a href="Andrew%20Jackson">Andrew Jackson</a>, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson, and to <a href="Jacksonian%20Democracy">his policies</a> once he was <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">elected president in 1828</a>.

Governor <a href="DeWitt%20Clinton">DeWitt Clinton</a> had nominated Seward as Cayuga County <a href="New%20York%20Surrogate%27s%20Court">Surrogate</a> in late 1827 or early 1828, but as Seward was unwilling to support Jackson, he was not confirmed by the state Senate. During the 1828 campaign, Seward made speeches in support of President Adams's re-election. Seward was nominated for the federal House of Representatives by the Anti-Masons, but withdrew, deeming the fight hopeless. In 1829, Seward was offered the local nomination for <a href="New%20York%20State%20Assembly">New York State Assembly</a>, but again felt there were no prospects of winning. In 1830, with Weed's aid, he gained the Anti-Masonic nomination for state senator for the local district. Seward had appeared in court throughout the district, and had spoken in favor of government support for infrastructure improvements, a position popular there. Weed had moved his operations to Albany, where his newspaper, the "<a href="Albany%20Evening%20Journal">Albany Evening Journal</a>", advocated for Seward, who was elected by about 2,000 votes.

Seward was sworn in as state senator in January 1831. He left Frances and their children in Auburn, and wrote to her of his experiences. These included meeting former vice president <a href="Aaron%20Burr">Aaron Burr</a>, who had returned to practicing law in New York following a self-imposed exile in Europe after his duel with <a href="Alexander%20Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a> and treason trial. The Regency (or the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrats</a>, as the national party led by Jackson and supported by Van Buren was becoming known) controlled the Senate. Seward and his party allied with dissident Democrats and others to pass some legislation, including penal reform measures, for which Seward would become known.

During his term as state senator, Seward traveled extensively, going to visit other anti-Jackson leaders, including former president Adams. He also accompanied his father Samuel Seward on a trip to Europe, where they met the political men of the day. Seward hoped that the Anti-Masons would nominate Supreme Court Justice <a href="John%20McLean">John McLean</a> for president against Jackson's re-election bid <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201832">in 1832</a>, but the nomination fell to former <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Attorney General</a> <a href="William%20Wirt%20%28Attorney%20General%29">William Wirt</a>. Kentucky Senator <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a>, an opponent of Jackson, was a Mason, and thus unacceptable as party standard-bearer. In the aftermath of Jackson's easy victory, many of those who opposed him believed a united front necessary to defeat the Democrats, and the <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whig Party</a> gradually came into being. The Whigs believed in legislative action to develop the country, and opposed Jackson's unilateral actions as president, which they deemed imperial. Many Anti-Masons, including Seward and Weed, readily joined the new party.

In preparation for the 1834 election, New York's Whigs met in <a href="Utica%2C%20New%20York">Utica</a> to determine a gubernatorial candidate. Democratic Governor <a href="William%20Marcy">William Marcy</a> was heavily favored to be re-elected, and few prominent Whigs were anxious to run a campaign which would most likely be lost. Seward's wife and father wanted him to retire from politics to increase the income from his law practice, and Weed urged him to seek re-election to the state Senate. Nevertheless, the reluctance of others to run caused Seward to emerge as a major candidate. Weed procured Seward's triumph at the Utica convention. The election turned on national issues, most importantly President Jackson's policies. These were then popular, and in a strong year for Democrats, Seward was defeated by some 11,000 votes—Weed wrote that the Whigs were overwhelmed by illegally cast ballots.

Defeated for governor and with his term in the state Senate having expired, Seward returned to Auburn and the practice of law at the start of 1835. That year, Seward and his wife undertook a lengthy trip, going as far south as Virginia. Although they were hospitably received by southerners, the Sewards saw scenes of slavery which confirmed them as its opponents. The following year, Seward accepted a position as agent for the new owners of the <a href="Holland%20Land%20Company">Holland Land Company</a>, which owned huge tracts of land in Western New York, upon which many settlers were purchasing real estate on installment. The new owners were viewed as less forgiving landlords than the old, and when there was unrest, they hired Seward, popular in Western New York, in hopes of adjusting the matter. He was successful, and when the <a href="Panic%20of%201837">Panic of 1837</a> began, persuaded the owners to avoid foreclosures where possible. He also, in 1838, arranged the purchase of the company's holdings by a consortium that included himself.

Van Buren had been elected president in 1836; even with his duties, Seward had found time to campaign against him. The economic crisis came soon after the inauguration, and threatened the Regency's control of New York politics. Seward had not run for governor in 1836, but with the Democrats unpopular, saw a path to victory in 1838 (the term was then two years). Other prominent Whigs also sought the nomination. Weed persuaded delegates to the convention that Seward had run ahead of other Whig candidates in 1834; Seward was nominated on the fourth ballot. Seward's opponent was again Marcy, and the economy the principal issue. The Whigs argued that the Democrats were responsible for the recession. As it was thought improper for candidates for major office to campaign in person, Seward left most of that to Weed. Seward was elected by a margin of about 10,000 votes out of 400,000 cast. The victory was the most significant for the Whig Party to that point, and put the Regency permanently out of power in New York State.

William Seward was sworn in as Governor of New York on January 1, 1839, and inaugurated in front of a crowd of jubilant Whigs. In that era, the annual message by the New York governor was published and discussed to the extent of that of a president. Seward biographer Walter Stahr wrote that his address "brimmed with his youth, energy, ambition, and optimism." Seward took note of America's great unexploited resources, and stated that immigration should be encouraged in order to take advantage of them. He urged that citizenship and religious liberty be granted to those who came to New York's shores. At the time, New York City's public schools were run by Protestants, and used Protestant texts, including the <a href="King%20James%20Bible">King James Bible</a>. Seward believed the current system was a barrier to literacy for immigrants' children, and proposed legislation to change it. Education, he stated, "banishes the distinctions, old as time, of rich and poor, master and slave. It banishes ignorance and lays axe to the root of crime." Seward's stance was popular among immigrants, but was disliked by <a href="Nativism%20%28politics%29%23United%20States">nativists</a>; their opposition would eventually help defeat his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1860.

Although the Assembly had a Whig majority at the start of Seward's first term as governor, the party had only 13 legislators out of 32 in the state Senate. The Democrats refused to co-operate with Governor Seward except on the most urgent matters, and he initially found himself unable to advance much of his agenda. Accordingly, the 1839 legislative elections were crucial to Seward's legislative hopes, and to advancing the nominations of many Whigs to state office whose posts required Senate confirmation. Both Seward and President Van Buren gave several speeches across New York State that summer. Henry Clay, one of the hopefuls for the Whig nomination for president, spent part of the summer in Upstate New York, and the two men met by chance on a ferry. Seward refused to formally visit Clay at his vacation home in <a href="Saratoga%20Springs%2C%20New%20York">Saratoga Springs</a> in the interests of neutrality, beginning a difficult relationship between the two men. After the 1839 election, the Whigs had 19 seats, allowing the party full control of state government.

Following the election, there was unrest near Albany among tenant farmers on <a href="Manor%20of%20Rensselaerswyck">the land owned by</a> Dutch-descended <a href="patroon">patroon</a>s of the <a href="van%20Rensselaer%20family">van Rensselaer family</a>. These tenancies allowed the landlords privileges such as enlisting the unpaid labor of tenants, and any breach could result in termination of tenure without compensation for improvements. When sheriff's deputies in <a href="Albany%20County%2C%20New%20York">Albany County</a> were obstructed from serving eviction writs, Seward was asked to call out the militia. After an all-night cabinet meeting, he did so, though quietly assuring the tenants that he would intervene with the legislature. This mollified the settlers, though Seward proved unable to get the legislature to pass reforming laws. This question of tenants' rights was not settled until after Seward had left office.

In September 1839, a ship sailing from <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> to New York City was discovered to have an escaped slave on board. The slave was returned to his owner pursuant to the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Clause">Fugitive Slave Clause</a> of the Constitution, but Virginia also demanded that three free black sailors, said to have concealed the fugitive aboard ship, be surrendered to its custody. This Seward would not do, and the <a href="Virginia%20General%20Assembly">Virginia General Assembly</a> passed legislation inhibiting trade with New York. With Seward's encouragement, the New York legislature passed acts in 1840 protecting the rights of African Americans against Southern slave-catchers. One guaranteed alleged fugitive slaves the right of a jury trial in New York to establish whether they were slaves, and another pledged the aid of the state to recover free blacks kidnapped into slavery.

Seward and Van Buren were both up for re-election in 1840. Seward did not attend the December <a href="1839%20Whig%20National%20Convention">1839 Whig National Convention</a> in <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a>, but Weed did on his behalf. They were determined to support General <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> for president, but when Weed concluded Scott could not win, he threw New York's support to the eventual winner, General <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison">William Henry Harrison</a>. This action outraged supporters of Senator Clay. These grievances would not be quickly forgotten—one supporter of the Kentuckian wrote in 1847 that he was intent on seeing the "punishment of Seward & Co. for defrauding the country of Mr. Clay in 1840."

Seward was renominated for a second term by the Whig convention against Democrat William Brock, a former state legislator. Seward did not campaign in person, but ran affairs with Weed behind the scenes and made his views known to voters through a Fourth of July speech and lengthy letters, declining invitations to speak, printed in the papers. In one, Seward expounds upon the importance of the <a href="log%20cabin%20campaign">log cabin</a>—a structure evoking the common man and a theme that the Whigs used heavily in <a href="William%20Henry%20Harrison%20presidential%20campaign%2C%201840">Harrison's campaign</a>—where Seward had always found a far warmer welcome than in the marble palaces of the well-to-do (evoking Van Buren). Both Harrison and Seward were elected. Although Seward would serve another almost thirty years in public life, his name would never again pass before the voters.

In his second term, Seward was involved with the trial of <a href="Alexander%20McLeod">Alexander McLeod</a>, who had boasted of involvement in the 1837 <a href="Caroline%20Affair">"Caroline" Affair</a>, in which Canadians came across the <a href="Niagara%20River">Niagara River</a> and sank the "Caroline", a steamboat being used to supply <a href="William%20Lyon%20Mackenzie">William Lyon Mackenzie</a>'s fighters during the <a href="Upper%20Canada%20Rebellion">Upper Canada Rebellion</a>. McLeod was arrested, but the British Foreign Minister, <a href="Lord%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, demanded his release. McLeod, who was part of the Canadian colonial militia, could not be held responsible for actions taken under orders. Although the <a href="Presidency%20of%20Martin%20Van%20Buren">Van Buren administration</a> had agreed with Seward that McLeod should be tried under state law, its successor did not, and urged that charges against McLeod be dropped. A series of testy letters were exchanged between Governor Seward and Harrison's Secretary of State <a href="Daniel%20Webster">Daniel Webster</a>, and also between the governor and the new president <a href="John%20Tyler">John Tyler</a>, who succeeded on Harrison's death after a month in office. McLeod was tried and acquitted in late 1841. Stahr pointed out that Seward got his way in having McLeod tried in state court, and the diplomatic experience served him well as Secretary of State.

Seward continued his support of African Americans, signing legislation in 1841 to repeal a "nine-month law" that allowed slaveholders to bring their slaves into the state for a period of nine months before they were considered free. After this, slaves brought to the state were immediately considered freed. Seward also signed legislation to establish public education for all children, leaving it up to local jurisdictions as to how that would be supplied (some had segregated schools).

As governor, Seward incurred considerable personal debt not only because he had to live beyond his salary to maintain the lifestyle expected of the office, but also because he could not pay down his obligation from the land company purchase. At the time he left office, he owed $200,000. Returning to Auburn, he absorbed himself in a profitable law practice. He did not abandon politics, and received former president Adams at the Seward family home in 1843.

According to his biographer, John M. Taylor, Seward picked a good time to absent himself from electoral politics, as the Whig Party was in turmoil. President Tyler, a former Democrat, and Senator Clay each claimed leadership of the Whig Party and, as the two men differed over such issues as whether to re-establish the <a href="Second%20Bank%20of%20the%20United%20States">Bank of the United States</a>, party support was divided. The <a href="abolitionism">abolitionist</a> movement attracted those who did not want to be part of a party led by slavery-supporting southerners. In <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844</a>, Seward was asked to run for president by members of the <a href="Liberty%20Party%20%28United%20States%2C%201840%29">Liberty Party</a>; he declined and reluctantly supported the Whig nominee, Clay. The Kentuckian was defeated by Democrat <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a>. The major event of Polk's administration was the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>; Seward did not support this, feeling that the price in blood was not worth the increase in territory, especially as southerners were promoting this acquisition to expand territory for slavery.

In 1846, Seward became the center of controversy in Auburn when he defended, in separate cases, two felons accused of murder. Henry Wyatt, a white man, was charged with fatally stabbing a fellow inmate in prison; William Freeman, an African American, was accused of breaking into a house after his release and stabbing four people to death. In both cases the defendants were likely mentally ill and had been abused while in prison. Seward, having long been an advocate of prison reform and better treatment for the insane, sought to prevent each man from being executed by using the relatively new defense of insanity. Seward gained a <a href="hung%20jury">hung jury</a> in Wyatt's first trial, though he was subsequently convicted in a retrial and executed despite Seward's efforts to secure clemency. Freeman was convicted, though Seward gained a reversal on appeal. There was no second Freeman trial, as officials were convinced of his insanity. Freeman died in prison in late 1846. In the Freeman case, invoking mental illness and racial issues, Seward argued, "he is still your brother, and mine, in form and color accepted and approved by his Father, and yours, and mine, and bears equally with us the proudest inheritance of our race—the image of our Maker. Hold him then to be a Man."

Although they were locally contentious, the trials boosted Seward's image across the North. He gained further publicity in association with Ohioan <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a> when handling the unsuccessful appeal in the United States Supreme Court of <a href="John%20Van%20Zandt">John Van Zandt</a>, an anti-slavery advocate sued by a slaveowner for assisting African Americans in escaping on the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. Chase was impressed with Seward, writing that the former New York governor "was one of the very first public men in our country. Who but himself would have done what he did for the poor wretch Freeman?"

The main Whig contenders in 1848 were Clay again, and two war hero generals with little political experience, <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a> and <a href="Zachary%20Taylor">Zachary Taylor</a>. Seward supported the nominee, General Taylor. The former governor was less enthusiastic about the vice-presidential candidate, <a href="New%20York%20Comptroller">New York Comptroller</a> <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>, a rival of his from Buffalo. Nevertheless, he campaigned widely for the Whigs against the Democratic presidential candidate, former Michigan senator <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a>. The two major parties did not make slavery an issue in the campaign. The <a href="Free%20Soil%20Party">Free Soil Party</a>, mostly Liberty Party members and some Northern Democrats, nominated former president Van Buren. The Taylor/Fillmore ticket was elected, and the split in the New York Democratic Party allowed the Whigs to capture the legislature.

State legislatures elected U.S. Senators until the ratification of the <a href="Seventeenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment</a> in 1913. In 1849 one of New York's seats was up for election, and a Whig would likely be elected to replace <a href="John%20Adams%20Dix">John Adams Dix</a>. Seward, with Weed's counsel, decided to seek the seat. When legislators convened in January 1849, he was spoken of as the favorite. Some opposed him as too extreme on slavery issues, and intimated that he would not support the slaveholding <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">President-elect</a> Taylor, a Louisianan. Weed and Seward worked to dispel these concerns, and when the vote for the Senate seat took place, the former governor received five times the vote of the nearest other candidate, gaining easy <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20New%20York%2C%201849">election on the first ballot</a>.

William Seward was sworn in as senator from New York on March 5, 1849, during the brief special session called to confirm President Taylor's cabinet nominees. Seward was seen as having influence over Taylor: taking advantage of an acquaintance with Taylor's brother. Seward met with the former general several times before Inauguration Day (March 4), and was friendly with Cabinet officers. Taylor hoped to gain the admission of California to the Union, and Seward worked to advance his agenda in the Senate.

The regular session of Congress that began in December 1849 was dominated by the issue of slavery. Senator Clay advanced a series of resolutions, which became known as the <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a>, giving victories to both North and South. Seward opposed the pro-slavery elements of the Compromise, and in a speech on the Senate floor on March 11, 1850, invoked a "higher law than the Constitution." The speech was widely reprinted, and made Seward the leading anti-slavery advocate in the Senate. President Taylor took a stance sympathetic to the North, but his death in July 1850 caused the accession of the pro-Compromise Fillmore and ended Seward's influence over patronage. The Compromise passed, and many Seward adherents in federal office in New York were replaced by Fillmore appointees.
Although Clay had hoped the Compromise would be a final settlement on the matter of slavery that could unite the nation, it divided his Whig Party, especially when the <a href="1852%20Whig%20National%20Convention">1852 Whig National Convention</a> endorsed it to the anger of liberal northerners like Seward. The major candidates for the presidential nomination were President Fillmore, Senator Daniel Webster, and General Scott. Seward supported Scott, who he hoped like Harrison could unite enough voters behind a military hero to win the election. Scott gained the nomination, and Seward campaigned for him. With the Whigs unable to reconcile over slavery, whereas the Democrats could unite behind the Compromise, the Whigs won only four states, and former New Hampshire senator <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201852">was elected president</a>. Other events, such as the 1852 publication of "<a href="Uncle%20Tom%27s%20Cabin">Uncle Tom's Cabin</a>" and Northern anger over the enforcement of the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Act</a> (an element of the Compromise), widened the divide between North and South.

Seward's wife Frances was deeply committed to the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> movement. In the 1850s, the Seward family opened their Auburn home as a safehouse to fugitive slaves on the <a href="Underground%20Railroad">Underground Railroad</a>. Seward's frequent travel and political work suggest that it was Frances who played the more active role in Auburn abolitionist activities. In the excitement following the rescue and safe transport of fugitive slave William "Jerry" Henry in Syracuse on October 1, 1851, Frances wrote to her husband, "two fugitives have gone to Canada—one of them our acquaintance John." Another time she wrote, "A man by the name of William Johnson will apply to you for assistance to purchase the freedom of his daughter. You will see that I have given him something by his book. I told him I thought you would give him more."

In January 1854, Democratic Illinois Senator <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> introduced his <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Bill</a>. This would permit <a href="territories%20of%20the%20United%20States">territories</a> to choose whether to join the Union as free or slave states, and effectively repeal the <a href="Missouri%20Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> forbidding slavery in new states north of 36° 30′ North latitude. Seward was determined to defeat what he called "this infamous Nebraska Bill," and worked to ensure the final version of the bill would be unpalatable to enough senators, North and South, to defeat it. Seward spoke against the bill both on initial consideration in the Senate and when the bill returned after reconciliation with the House. The bill passed into law, but northerners felt they had found a standard around which they could rally. Those in the South defended the new law, arguing that they should have an equal stake through slavery in the territories their blood and money had helped secure.

The political turmoil engendered by the North–South divide split both major parties and led to the founding of new ones. The American Party (better known as the <a href="Know%20Nothing%20Party">Know Nothings</a>) contained many nativists, and pursued an anti-immigrant agenda. The Know Nothings did not publicly discuss party deliberations (thus, they knew nothing). They disliked Seward, and an uncertain number of Know Nothings sought the Whig nomination to legislative seats. Some made clear their stance by pledging to vote against Seward's re-election, but others did not. Although the Whigs won a majority in both houses of the state legislature, the extent of their support for Seward as US senator was unclear. When <a href="United%20States%20Senate%20election%20in%20New%20York%2C%201855">the election</a> was held by the legislature in February 1855, Seward won a narrow majority in each house. The opposition was scattered, and a Know Nothing party organ denounced two dozen legislators as "traitors."

The <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> had been founded in 1854, in reaction to the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Its anti-slavery stance was attractive to Seward, but he needed the Whig structure in New York to get re-elected. In September 1855, the New York Whig and Republican parties held simultaneous conventions that quickly merged into one. Seward was the most prominent figure to join the new party, and was spoken of as a possible presidential candidate in 1856. Weed, however, did not feel that the new party was strong enough on a national level to secure the presidency, and advised Seward to wait until 1860. When Seward's name was mentioned at the <a href="1856%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1856 Republican National Convention</a>, a huge ovation broke out. In <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">the 1856 presidential election</a>, the Democratic candidate, former Pennsylvania senator <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>, defeated the Republican, former California senator <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a>, and the Know Nothing candidate, former president Fillmore.

The 1856 campaign played out against the backdrop of "<a href="Bleeding%20Kansas">Bleeding Kansas</a>," the violent efforts of pro- and anti-slavery forces to control the government in <a href="Kansas%20Territory">Kansas Territory</a> and determine whether it would be admitted as a slave or free state. This violence spilled over into the Senate chamber itself after Republican Massachusetts Senator <a href="Charles%20Sumner">Charles Sumner</a> delivered an incendiary speech against slavery, making personal comments against South Carolina Senator <a href="Andrew%20P.%20Butler">Andrew P. Butler</a>. Sumner had read a draft of the speech to Seward, who had advised him to omit the personal references. Two days after the speech, Butler's nephew, Congressman <a href="Preston%20Brooks">Preston Brooks</a> entered the chamber and beat Sumner with a cane, injuring him severely. Although some southerners feared the propaganda value of the incident in the North, most lionized Brooks as a hero. Many northerners were outraged, though some, including Seward, felt that Sumner's words against Butler had unnecessarily provoked the attack. Some Southern newspapers felt that the Sumner precedent might usefully be applied to Seward; the "Petersburg Intelligencer", a Virginia periodical, suggested that "it will be very well to give Seward a double dose at least every other day."

In a message to Congress in December 1857, President Buchanan advocated the admission of Kansas as a slave state under the <a href="Lecompton%20Constitution">Lecompton Constitution</a>, passed under dubious circumstances. This split the Democrats: the administration wanted Kansas admitted; Senator Douglas demanded a fair ratification vote. The Senate debated the matter through much of early 1858, though few Republicans spoke at first, content to watch the Democrats tear their party to shreds over the issue of slavery. The issue was complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling the previous year in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>" that neither Congress nor a local government could ban slavery in the territories.

In a speech on March 3 in the Senate, Seward "delighted Republican ears and utterly appalled administration Democrats, especially the Southerners." Discussing "Dred Scott", Seward accused Buchanan and Chief Justice <a href="Roger%20B.%20Taney">Roger B. Taney</a> of conspiring to gain the result, and threatened to reform the courts to eliminate Southern power. Taney later told a friend that if Seward had been elected in 1860, he would have refused to administer the oath of office. Buchanan reportedly denied the senator access to the White House. Seward predicted slavery was doomed:
Southerners saw this as a threat, by the man deemed the likely Republican nominee in 1860, to force change on the South whether it liked it or not. Statehood for Kansas failed for the time being, but Seward's words were repeatedly cited by Southern senators as the secession crisis grew. Nevertheless, Seward remained on excellent personal terms with individual southerners such as Mississippi's <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a>. His dinner parties, where those from both sides of the sectional divide mixed and mingled, were a Washington legend.

With an eye to a presidential bid in 1860, Seward tried to appear a statesman who could be trusted by both North and South. Seward did not believe the federal government could mandate emancipation but that it would develop by action of the slave states as the nation urbanized and slavery became uneconomical, as it had in New York. Southerners still believed that he was threatening the forced end of slavery. While campaigning for Republicans in the 1858 midterm elections, Seward gave a speech at Rochester that proved divisive and quotable, alleging that the U.S. had two "antagonistic system [that] are continually coming into closer contact, and collision results. … It is an irrepressible conflict between opposing and enduring forces, and it means that the United States must and will, sooner or later, become entirely either a slave-holding nation, or entirely a free-labor nation." White southerners saw the "irrepressible conflict" speech as a declaration of war, and Seward's vehemence ultimately damaged his chances of gaining the presidential nomination.

In 1859, Seward was advised by his political supporters that he would be better off avoiding additional controversial statements, and left the country for an eight-month tour of Europe and the Middle East. Seward spent two months in London, meeting with the Prime Minister, <a href="Lord%20Palmerston">Lord Palmerston</a>, and was presented at Court to <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Seward returned to Washington in January 1860 to find controversy: that some southerners blamed him for his rhetoric, which they believed had inspired <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a> to try to start a slave insurrection. Brown was captured and executed; nevertheless, Mississippi representatives <a href="Reuben%20Davis%20%28representative%29">Reuben Davis</a> and <a href="Otho%20Singleton">Otho Singleton</a> each stated that if Seward or another <a href="Radical%20Republican">Radical Republican</a> was elected, he would meet with the resistance of a united South. To rebut such allegations, and to set forth his views in the hope of receiving the nomination, Seward made a major speech in the Senate on February 29, 1860, which most praised, though white southerners were offended, and some abolitionists also objected because the senator, in his speech, said that Brown was justly punished. The <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> ordered 250,000 copies in pamphlet form, and eventually twice that many were printed.

Weed sometimes expressed certainty that Seward would be nominated; at other times he expressed gloom at the thought of the convention fight. He had some reason for doubt, as word from Weed's agents across the country was mixed. Many in the Midwest did not want the issue of slavery to dominate the campaign, and with Seward as nominee, it inevitably would. The Know Nothing Party was still alive in the Northeast, and was hostile to Seward for his pro-immigrant stances, creating doubts as to whether Seward could win Pennsylvania and New Jersey, where there were many nativists, in the general election. These states were crucial to a Republican nominee faced with a <a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>. Conservative factions in the evolving Republican Party opposed Seward.

There were no <a href="primary%20election">primaries</a> in 1860, no way to be certain how many delegates a candidate might receive. Nevertheless, going into the <a href="1860%20Republican%20National%20Convention">1860 Republican National Convention</a> in May in Chicago, Seward was seen as the overwhelming favorite. Others spoken of for the nomination included Ohio Governor <a href="Salmon%20P.%20Chase">Salmon P. Chase</a>, former Missouri congressman <a href="Edward%20Bates">Edward Bates</a>, and former Illinois congressman <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>.

Seward stayed in Auburn during the convention; Weed was present on his behalf and worked to shore up Seward's support. He was amply supplied with money: business owners had eagerly given, expecting Seward to be the next president. Weed's reputation was not entirely positive; he was believed corrupt by some, and his association both helped and hurt Seward.
Enemies such as publisher and former Seward ally <a href="Horace%20Greeley">Horace Greeley</a> cast doubts as to Seward's electability in the battleground states of Illinois, Indiana, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Lincoln had worked hard to gain a reputation as a moderate in the party and hoped to be seen as a consensus second choice, who might be successful in those critical states, of which the Republicans had to win three to secure the election. Lincoln's men, led by his friend <a href="David%20Davis%20%28Supreme%20Court%20justice%29">David Davis</a>, were active on his behalf. As Lincoln had not been seen as a major candidate, his supporters had been able to influence the decision to hold the convention in his home state, and surrounded the New York delegation, pro-Seward, with Lincoln loyalists. They eventually were successful in gaining the support of the delegations from the other battleground states, boosting delegates' perceptions of Lincoln's electability. Although Lincoln and Seward shared many views, Lincoln, out of office since 1849, had not excited opposition as Seward had in the South and among Know Nothings. Lincoln's views on nativism, which he opposed, were not public.

On the first ballot, Seward had 173½ votes to Lincoln's 102, with 233 needed to nominate. Pennsylvania shifted its vote to Lincoln on the second ballot, and Seward's lead was cut to 184½ to 181. On the third, Lincoln had 231½ to Seward's 180 after the roll call, but Ohio changed four votes from Chase to Lincoln, giving the Illinoian the nomination and starting a small stampede; the nomination was eventually made unanimous. When word reached Seward by telegraph, by the accounts of witnesses, he calmly remarked that Lincoln had some of the attributes needed to be president, and would certainly be elected.

Despite his public nonchalance, Seward was devastated by his convention loss, as were many of his supporters. The New Yorker was the best-known and most popular Republican, and his defeat shocked many in the North, who felt that Lincoln had been nominated through chicanery. Although Seward sent a letter stating Weed was not to blame, Seward's political manager took the defeat hard. Seward was initially inclined to retire from public life, but received many letters from supporters: distrustful of Lincoln, they urged Seward to remain involved in politics. On his way to Washington to return to Senate duties, he stopped in Albany to confer with Weed, who had gone to Lincoln's home in <a href="Springfield%2C%20Illinois">Springfield, Illinois</a> to meet with the candidate, and had been very impressed at Lincoln's political understanding. At the Capitol, Seward received sympathy even from sectional foes such as Jefferson Davis.

Lincoln faced three major opponents. A split in the Democratic Party had led northerners to nominate Senator Douglas, while southerners chose Vice President <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge">John C. Breckinridge</a>. The <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Union Party</a>, a new party consisting mostly of former Southern Whigs, selected former Tennessee senator <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>. As Lincoln would not even be on the ballot in ten southern states, he needed to win almost every northern state to take the presidency. Douglas was said to be strong in Illinois and Indiana, and if he took those, the election might be thrown into the House of Representatives. Seward was urged to undertake a campaign tour of the Midwest in support of Lincoln and did so for five weeks in September and October, attracting huge crowds. He journeyed by rail and boat as far north as <a href="Saint%20Paul%2C%20Minnesota">Saint Paul, Minnesota</a>, into the <a href="Border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border state</a> of Missouri at St. Louis, and even to Kansas Territory, though it had no electoral votes to cast in the election. When the train passed through Springfield, Seward and Lincoln were introduced, with Lincoln appearing "embarrassed" and Seward "constrained." In his oratory, Seward spoke of the U.S. as a "tower of freedom," a Union that might even include Canada, Latin America, and <a href="Russian%20America">Russian America</a>.

New York was key to the election; a Lincoln loss there would deadlock the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>. Soon after his return from his Midwest tour, Seward embarked on another, speaking to large crowds across the state of New York. At Weed's urging he went to New York City and gave a patriotic speech before a large crowd on November 3, only three days before the election. On Election Day, Lincoln carried most Northern states, while Breckinridge took the Deep South, Bell three border states, and Douglas won Missouri—the only state Seward campaigned in that Lincoln did not win. Lincoln was elected.

Lincoln's election had been anticipated in Southern states, and South Carolina and other <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a> states began to call conventions for the purpose of secession. In the North, there was dissent over whether to offer concessions to the South to preserve the Union, and if conciliation failed, whether to allow the South to depart in peace. Seward favored compromise. He had hoped to remain at home until the New Year, but with the deepening crisis left for Washington in time for the new session of Congress in early December.

The usual tradition was for the leading figure of the winning party to be offered the position of Secretary of State, the most senior Cabinet post. Seward was that person and around December 12, the vice president-elect, Maine Senator <a href="Hannibal%20Hamlin">Hannibal Hamlin</a>, offered Seward the position on Lincoln's behalf. At Weed's advice, Seward was slow to formally accept, doing so on December 28, 1860, though well before Inauguration Day, March 4, 1861. Lincoln remained in Illinois until mid-February, and he and Seward communicated by letter.

As states in the Deep South prepared to secede in late 1860, Seward met with important figures from both sides of the sectional divide. Seward introduced a proposed constitutional amendment preventing federal interference with slavery. This was done at Lincoln's private request; the president-elect hoped that the amendment, and a change to the Fugitive Slave Act to allow those captured a jury trial, would satisfy both sides. Congressmen introduced many such proposals, and Seward was appointed to a committee of 13 senators to consider them. Lincoln was willing to guarantee the security of slavery in the states that currently had it, but he rejected any proposal that would allow slavery to expand. It was increasingly clear that the deep South was committed to secession; the Republican hope was to provide compromises to keep the border slave states in the Union. Seward voted against the <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden Compromise</a> on December 28, but quietly continued to seek a compromise that would keep the border states in the Union.

Seward gave a major speech on January 12, 1861. By then, he was known to be Lincoln's choice as Secretary of State, and with Lincoln staying silent, it was widely expected that he would propound the new administration's plan to save the Union. Accordingly, he spoke to a crowded Senate, where even Jefferson Davis attended despite Mississippi's secession, and to packed galleries. He urged the preservation of the Union, and supported an amendment such as the one he had introduced, or a constitutional convention, once passions had cooled. He hinted that <a href="New%20Mexico%20Territory">New Mexico Territory</a> might be a slave state, and urged the construction of two transcontinental railroads, one northern, one southern. He suggested the passage of legislation to bar interstate invasions such as that by John Brown. Although Seward's speech was widely applauded, it gained a mixed reaction in the border states to which he had tried to appeal. <a href="Radical%20Republican">Radical Republican</a>s were not willing to make concessions to the South, and were angered by the speech. Pennsylvania Congressman <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a>, a radical, warned that if Lincoln like Seward ignored the Republican platform and tried to purchase peace through concessions, he would retire, as too old to bear the years of warfare in the Republican Party that would result.

Lincoln applauded Seward's speech, which he read in Springfield, but refused to approve any compromise that could lead to a further expansion of slavery. Once Lincoln left Springfield on February 11, he gave speeches, stating in Indianapolis that it would not be coercing a state if the federal government insisted on retaining or retaking property that belonged to it. This came as the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a> still held <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a>; the president-elect's words upset moderate southerners. Virginia Congressman <a href="Sherrard%20Clemens">Sherrard Clemens</a> wrote, "Mr. Lincoln, by his speech in the North, has done vast harm. If he will not be guided by Mr. Seward but puts himself in the hands of Mr. Chase and the ultra [that is, Radical] Republicans, nothing can save the cause of the Union in the South."

Lincoln arrived in Washington, without announcement and incognito, early on the morning of February 23, 1861. Seward had been advised by General Winfield Scott that there was <a href="Baltimore%20Plot">a plot to assassinate Lincoln in Baltimore</a> when he passed through the city. Senator Seward sent his son <a href="Frederick%20W.%20Seward">Frederick</a> to warn Lincoln in Philadelphia, and the president-elect decided to travel alone but for well-armed bodyguards. Lincoln travelled without incident, and came to regret his decision as he was widely mocked for it. Later that morning, Seward accompanied Lincoln to the White House, where he introduced the Illinoisan to President Buchanan.

Seward and Lincoln differed over two issues in the days before the inauguration: the composition of Lincoln's cabinet, and his inaugural address. Given a draft of the address, Seward softened it to make it less confrontational toward the South; Lincoln accepted many of the changes, though he gave it, according to Seward biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen, "a simplicity and a poetic quality lacking in Seward's draft." The differences regarding the Cabinet revolved around the inclusion of Salmon Chase, a radical. Lincoln wanted all elements of the party, as well as representation from outside it; Seward opposed Chase, as well as former Democrats such as <a href="Gideon%20Welles">Gideon Welles</a> and <a href="Montgomery%20Blair">Montgomery Blair</a>. Seward did not get his way, and gave Lincoln a letter declining the post of Secretary of State. Lincoln felt, as he told his <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">private secretary</a>, <a href="John%20Nicolay">John Nicolay</a>, that he could not "afford to let Seward take the first trick." No reply or acknowledgement was made by Lincoln until after the <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">inaugural ceremonies</a> were over on March 4, when he asked Seward to remain. Seward did and was both nominated and confirmed by the Senate, with minimal debate, on March 5, 1861.

Lincoln faced the question of what to do about <a href="Fort%20Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> in Charleston harbor, held by the Army against the will of South Carolinians, who had blockaded it. The fort's commander, Major <a href="Robert%20Anderson%20%28Civil%20War%29">Robert Anderson</a>, had sent word that he would run out of supplies. Seward, backed by most of the Cabinet, recommended to Lincoln that an attempt to resupply Sumter would be provocative to the <a href="border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a>, that Lincoln hoped to keep from seceding. Seward hinted to the commissioners that had come to Washington on behalf of the Confederacy that Sumter would be surrendered. Lincoln was loath to give up Sumter, feeling it would only encourage the South in its insurgency.

With the Sumter issue unresolved, Seward sent Lincoln a memorandum on April 1, proposing various courses of action, including possibly declaring war on France and Spain if certain conditions were not met, and reinforcing the forts along the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. In any event, vigorous policies were needed and the president must either establish them himself or allow a Cabinet member to, with Seward making it clear he was willing to do it. Lincoln drafted a reply indicating that whatever policy was adopted, "I must do it," though he never sent it, but met with Seward instead, and what passed between them is not known. Seward's biographers make the point that the note was sent to a Lincoln who had not yet proved himself in office.

Lincoln decided on expeditions to try to relieve Sumter and Florida's <a href="Fort%20Pickens">Fort Pickens</a>. Meanwhile, Seward was assuring Justice <a href="John%20Archibald%20Campbell">John Archibald Campbell</a>, the intermediary with the Confederate commissioners that had come to Washington in an attempt to secure recognition, that no hostile action would be taken. Lincoln sent a notification to South Carolina's governor of the expedition, and on April 12, Charleston's batteries began firing on Sumter, beginning the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a>.

When the war started Seward turned his attention to making sure that foreign powers did not interfere in the conflict. When in April 1861, the Confederacy announced that it would authorize <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s, Seward sent word to the American representatives abroad that the U.S. would become party to the <a href="Paris%20Declaration%20Respecting%20Maritime%20Law">Paris Declaration Respecting Maritime Law</a> of 1856, outlawing such vessels, but Britain required that, if the U.S. were to become a party, the ratification would not require action to be taken against Confederate vessels.

The Palmerston government considered recognizing the Confederacy as an independent nation. Seward was willing to wage war against Britain if it did, and drafted a strong letter for the American Minister in London, <a href="Charles%20Francis%20Adams%2C%20Sr.">Charles Francis Adams</a>, to read to the Foreign Secretary, <a href="John%20Russell%2C%201st%20Earl%20Russell">Lord Russell</a>. Seward submitted it to Lincoln, who, realizing that the Union was in no position to battle both the South and Britain, toned it down considerably, and made it merely a memorandum for Adams's guidance.

In May 1861, Britain and France declared the South to be <a href="belligerent">belligerent</a>s by international law, and their ships were entitled to the same rights as U.S.-flagged vessels to remain 24 hours in neutral ports. Nevertheless, Seward was pleased that both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not be overly sensitive to what wording they used to describe their policies.

In November 1861, the , commanded by Union Captain <a href="Charles%20Wilkes">Charles Wilkes</a>, intercepted the British mail ship <a href="RMS%20Trent">RMS "Trent"</a> and <a href="Trent%20affair">removed two Confederate diplomats</a>, <a href="James%20Murray%20Mason">James Mason</a> and <a href="John%20Slidell">John Slidell</a>. They were held in Boston amid jubilation in the North and outrage in Britain. The British minister in Washington, <a href="Richard%20Lyons%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Lyons">Lord Lyons</a>, demanded their release, as the U.S. had no right to stop a British-flagged ship traveling between neutral ports. The British drew up war plans to attack New York and sent reinforcements to Canada. Seward worked to defuse the situation. He persuaded Lyons to postpone delivering an ultimatum, and told Lincoln that the prisoners would have to be released. Lincoln did let them go, reluctantly, on technical grounds. Relations between the U.S. and Britain soon improved; in April 1862, Seward and Lyons signed a treaty they had negotiated allowing each nation to inspect the other's ships for contraband slaves. In November 1862, with America's image in Britain improved by the issuance of the preliminary <a href="Emancipation%20Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, the British cabinet decided against recognition of the Confederacy as a nation.

Confederate agents in Britain had arranged for the construction of Confederate ships, most notably the <a href="CSS%20Alabama">CSS "Alabama"</a>, which ravaged Union shipping after her construction in 1862. With <a href="Scorpion-class%20ironclad">two more such vessels</a> under construction the following year, supposedly for French interests, Seward pressed Palmerston not to allow them to leave port, and, nearly complete, they were seized by British officials in October 1863.

From the start of the war until early 1862, when responsibility was passed to the War Department, Seward was in charge of determining who should be detained without charges or trial. Approximately 800 men and a few women, believed to be Southern sympathizers or spies, were detained, usually at the initiation of local officials. Once Seward was informed, he would often order that the prisoner be transferred to federal authorities. Seward was reported to have boasted to Lord Lyons that "I can touch a bell on my right hand, and order the arrest of a citizen ... and no power on earth, except that of the President, can release them. Can the Queen of England do so much?"

In September 1861, Maryland legislators planned to vote to leave the Union. Seward took action against them: his son <a href="Frederick%20W.%20Seward">Frederick</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Assistant%20Secretary%20of%20State">United States Assistant Secretary of State</a>, reported to his father that the Union men had gone unmolested and the disloyal legislators were in prison. On evidence provided by detective <a href="Allen%20Pinkerton">Allen Pinkerton</a>, Seward in 1862 ordered the arrest of <a href="Rose%20Greenhow">Rose Greenhow</a>, a Washington socialite with Confederate sympathies. Greenhow had sent a stream of reports south, and continued even after being placed on house arrest. From Washington's <a href="Old%20Capitol%20Prison">Old Capitol Prison</a>, the "Rebel Rose" provided newspaper interviews until she was allowed to cross into Confederate territory.

When Seward received allegations that former president Pierce was involved in a plot against the Union, he asked Pierce for an explanation. Pierce indignantly denied it. The matter proved to be a hoax, and the administration was embarrassed. On February 14, 1862, Lincoln ordered that responsibility for detentions be transferred to the War Department, ending Seward's part in them.

Seward had mixed feelings about the man who had blocked him from the presidency. One story is that when Seward was told that to deny <a href="Carl%20Schurz">Carl Schurz</a> an office would disappoint him, Seward angrily stated, "Disappointment! You speak of me of disappointment! To me, who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the presidency, and who had to stand aside and see it given to a little Illinois lawyer!" Despite his initial reservations about Lincoln's abilities, he came to admire Lincoln as the president grew more confident in his job. Seward wrote to his wife in June 1861, "Executive skill and vigor are rare qualities. The President is the best of us, but he needs constant and assiduous cooperation." According to Goodwin, "Seward would become his most faithful ally in the cabinet ... Seward's mortification at not having received his party's nomination never fully abated, but he no longer felt compelled to belittle Lincoln to ease his pain." Lincoln, a one-term congressman, was inexperienced in Washington ways, and relied on Seward's advice on protocol and social etiquette.

The two men built a close personal and professional relationship. Lincoln fell into the habit of entrusting Seward with tasks not within the remit of the State Department, for example asking him to examine a treaty with the <a href="Delaware%20Indians">Delaware Indians</a>. Lincoln would come to Seward's house and the two lawyers would relax before the fire, chatting. Seward began to feature in the president's humorous stories. For example, Lincoln would tell of Seward remonstrating with the president, whom he found polishing his boots, "In Washington, we do not blacken our own boots," with Lincoln's response, "Indeed, then whose boots "do" you blacken, Mr. Secretary?"
Other cabinet members became resentful of Seward, who seemed to be always present when they discussed their departments' concerns with Lincoln, yet they were never allowed to be there when the two men discussed foreign affairs. Seward announced when cabinet meetings would be; his colleagues eventually persuaded Lincoln to set a regular date and time for those sessions. Seward's position on the Emancipation Proclamation when Lincoln read it to his cabinet in July 1862 is uncertain; Secretary of War <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a> wrote at the time that Seward opposed it in principle, feeling the slaves should simply be freed as Union armies advanced. Two later accounts indicate that Seward felt the time was not yet to issue it, and Lincoln did wait until after the bloody stalemate at <a href="Battle%20of%20Antietam">Antietam</a> that ended Confederate General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>'s incursion into the North to issue it. In the interim, Seward cautiously investigated how foreign powers might react to such a proclamation, and learned it would make them less likely to interfere in the conflict.

Seward was not close to Lincoln's wife <a href="Mary%20Todd%20Lincoln">Mary</a>, who by some accounts had opposed his appointment as Secretary of State. Mary Lincoln developed such a dislike for Seward that she instructed her coachman to avoid passing by the Seward residence. The Secretary of State enjoyed the company of the younger Lincoln boys, <a href="Willie%20Lincoln">Willie</a> and <a href="Tad%20Lincoln">Tad</a>, presenting them with two cats from his assortment of pets.

Seward accompanied Lincoln to <a href="Gettysburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a>, in November 1863, where Lincoln was to deliver a short speech, that would become famous as the <a href="Gettysburg%20Address">Gettysburg Address</a>. The night before the speech, Lincoln met with Seward. There is no surviving evidence that Seward authored any changes: he stated after the address, when asked if had had any hand in it, that only Lincoln could have made that speech. Seward also proposed to Lincoln that he proclaim a day of national thanksgiving, and drafted a proclamation to that effect. Although post-harvest thanksgiving celebrations had long been held, this first formalized <a href="Thanksgiving%20Day">Thanksgiving Day</a> as a national observance.

It was far from certain that Lincoln would even be nominated in 1864, let alone re-elected, as the tide of war, though generally favoring the North, washed back and forth. Lincoln sought nomination by the <a href="National%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">National Union Party</a>, composed of Republicans and <a href="War%20Democrats">War Democrats</a>. No one proved willing to oppose Lincoln, who was nominated. Seward was by then unpopular among many Republicans and opponents sought to prompt his replacement by making Lincoln's running mate former New York Democratic senator <a href="Daniel%20S.%20Dickinson">Daniel S. Dickinson</a>; under the political customs of the time, one state could not hold two positions as prestigious as vice president and Secretary of State. Administration forces turned back Dickinson's bid, nominating instead Military Governor of Tennessee <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>, with whom Seward had served in the Senate. Lincoln was re-elected in November; Seward sat with Lincoln and the assistant <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">presidential secretary</a>, <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a>, as the returns came in.
In January 1865, <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Preston Blair</a>, father of former Lincoln <a href="Postmaster%20General%20of%20the%20United%20States">Postmaster General</a> <a href="Montgomery%20Blair">Montgomery Blair</a>, went, with Lincoln's knowledge, to the Confederate capital of Richmond to propose to Davis that North and South unite to expel the French from their domination of Mexico. Davis appointed commissioners (Vice President <a href="Alexander%20Stephens">Alexander Stephens</a>, former U.S. Supreme Court justice Campbell, and former Confederate Secretary of State <a href="Robert%20M.%20T.%20Hunter">Robert M. T. Hunter</a>) to negotiate. They met with Lincoln and Seward at the <a href="Hampton%20Roads%20Conference">Hampton Roads Conference</a> the following month. Lincoln would settle for nothing short of a cession of resistance to the federal government and an end to slavery; the Confederates would not even concede that they and the Union were one nation. There was much friendly talk, as most of them had served together in Washington, but no agreement. After the conference broke up, Seward sent a bucket of champagne to the Confederates, conveyed by a black oarsman in a rowboat, and called to the southerners, "keep the champagne, but return the Negro."

<a href="John%20Wilkes%20Booth">John Wilkes Booth</a> had originally planned to kidnap Lincoln, and recruited conspirators, including <a href="Lewis%20Powell%20%28conspirator%29">Lewis Powell</a>. Having found no opportunity to abduct the president, on April 14, 1865, Booth assigned Powell to assassinate Seward, with <a href="George%20Atzerodt">George Atzerodt</a> to kill Vice President Johnson and himself to kill Lincoln, which would slay the three senior members of the Executive Branch. Accordingly, another member of the conspiracy, <a href="David%20Herold">David Herold</a>, led Powell to the Seward home on horseback and was responsible for holding Powell's horse while he committed the attack. Seward had been hurt in an accident some days before, and Powell gained entry to the home on the excuse he was delivering medicine to the injured man, but was stopped at the top of the stairs by Frederick Seward, who insisted Powell give him the medicine. Powell instead attempted to fire on Frederick, and beat him over the head with the barrel of his gun when it misfired. Powell burst through the door, threw Fanny Seward (the secretary's daughter) to one side, and jumped on the bed, and stabbed William Seward in the face and neck five times. A soldier assigned to guard and nurse the secretary, Private <a href="George%20F.%20Robinson">George F. Robinson</a>, jumped on Powell, forcing him from the bed. Powell fled, stabbing a messenger, Emerick Hansell, as he went, to find that Herold, panicked by the screams from the house, had left with both horses. Seward was at first thought dead, but revived enough to instruct Robinson to send for the police and lock the house until they arrived.
Almost simultaneously with the attack on Seward, Booth had mortally wounded Lincoln at <a href="Ford%27s%20Theatre">Ford's Theatre</a>. Atzerodt, however, decided not to go through with the attack on Johnson. When Secretary of War <a href="Edwin%20Stanton">Edwin Stanton</a> and Navy Secretary <a href="Gideon%20Welles">Gideon Welles</a> hurried to Seward's home to find out what had happened, they found blood everywhere.

All five men injured that night at the Seward home survived. Powell was captured the next day at the boarding house of <a href="Mary%20Surratt">Mary Surratt</a>, and was executed on July 7, 1865, along with Herold, Atzerodt, and Mrs. Surratt, convicted as conspirators in the Lincoln assassination. Their deaths occurred only weeks after that of Seward's wife Frances, who never recovered from the shock of the assassination attempt.

In the first months of the new Johnson administration, Seward did not work much with the president. Seward was at first recovering from his injuries, and Johnson was ill for a time in the summer of 1865. Seward was likely in accord with Johnson's relatively gentle terms for the South's re-entry to the Union, and with his pardon of all Confederates but those of high rank. <a href="Radical%20Republicans">Radical Republicans</a> such as Stanton and Pennsylvania Representative <a href="Thaddeus%20Stevens">Thaddeus Stevens</a> proposed that the freed slaves be given the vote, but Seward was content to leave that to the states (few Northern states gave African-Americans the ballot), believing the priority should be reconciling the power-holding white populations of the North and South to each other.

Unlike Lincoln, who had a close rapport with Seward, Johnson kept his own counsel, and generally did not take advantage of Seward's political advice as Congress prepared to meet in December 1865. Johnson had issued proclamations allowing for the southern states to reform their state governments and hold elections; they mostly elected men who had served as prewar or wartime leaders. Seward advised Johnson to state, in his first <a href="State%20of%20the%20Union">annual message to Congress</a>, that southern states meet three conditions for readmission to the Union: repeal of secession, repudiation of the war debt incurred by the rebel governments, and ratification of the <a href="Thirteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Thirteenth Amendment</a>. Johnson, hoping to appeal to both Republicans and Democrats, did not take the suggestion. Congress did not seat southerners, but appointed a joint committee of both houses to make recommendations on the issue. Johnson opposed the committee; Seward was prepared to wait and see.

In early 1866, Congress and president battled over the extension of the authorization of the <a href="Freedmen%27s%20Bureau">Freedmen's Bureau</a>. Both sides agreed that the bureau should end after the states were re-admitted, the question was whether that would be soon. With Seward's support, Johnson vetoed the bill. Republicans in Congress were angry with both men, and tried but failed to override Johnson's veto. Johnson vetoed the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201866">Civil Rights Bill</a>, which was to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Seward advised a conciliatory veto message; Johnson ignored him, telling Congress it had no right to pass bills affecting the South until it seated the region's congressmen. This time Congress overrode his veto, gaining the necessary two-thirds majority of each house, the first time this had been done on a major piece of legislation in American history.
Johnson hoped the public would elect congressmen who agreed with him in the 1866 midterm elections, and embarked on a trip, dubbed the <a href="Swing%20Around%20the%20Circle">Swing Around the Circle</a> that summer, giving speeches in a number of cities. Seward was among the officials who went with him. The trip was a disaster for Johnson; he made a number of ill-considered statements about his opponents that were criticized in the press. The Radical Republicans were strengthened by the results of the elections. The Republican anger against Johnson extended to his Secretary of State—Maine Senator <a href="William%20P.%20Fessenden">William P. Fessenden</a> said of Johnson, "he began by meaning well, but I fear that Seward's evil counsels have carried him beyond the reach of salvation."

In February 1867, both houses of Congress passed the <a href="Tenure%20of%20Office%20Act%20%281867%29">Tenure of Office Bill</a>, purporting to restrict Johnson in the removal of presidential appointees. Johnson suspended, then fired Stanton, over Reconstruction policy differences, leading to <a href="Impeachment%20of%20Andrew%20Johnson">the president's impeachment</a> for allegedly violating the Tenure of Office Act. Seward recommended that Johnson hire the renowned attorney, <a href="William%20M.%20Evarts">William M. Evarts</a>, and, with Weed, raised funds for the president's successful defense.

Mexico was strife-torn in the early 1860s, as it often had been in the fifty years since independence. France, Spain, and the United Kingdom joined together to intervene in 1861 on the pretext of protecting their nationals, and to secure repayment of debt. Spain and the British soon withdrew, but <a href="French%20intervention%20in%20Mexico">France remained</a>. Distracted by civil war, Seward could do little to enforce the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a>, and in 1864, French emperor <a href="Napoleon%20III%20of%20France">Napoleon III</a> set his cousin, Archduke <a href="Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico">Maximilian</a> of Austria on the <a href="Second%20Mexican%20Empire">Mexican throne</a>, with French military support. When this became an issue in the U.S., Seward used strident language publicly, but was privately conciliatory toward the French.

The Confederates had been supportive of France's actions. Upon returning to work after the assassination attempt, Seward warned France that the U.S. still wanted the French gone from Mexico. Napoleon feared that the large, battle-tested American army would be used against his troops. Seward remained conciliatory, and in January 1866, Napoleon agreed to withdraw his troops after a twelve- to eighteen-month period, during which time Maximilian could consolidate his position against the insurgency led by <a href="Benito%20Ju%C3%A1rez">Benito Juárez</a>.

In late 1866, Napoleon tried to postpone the French departure, but the Americans had large numbers of troops on the north bank of the <a href="Rio%20Grande">Rio Grande</a> and Seward held firm. Napoleon suggested a new Mexican government that would exclude both Maximilian and Juárez; the Americans had recognized Juárez as the legitimate president and were not willing to consider this. In the meantime, Juárez, with the help of American military aid, was advancing through northeast Mexico. The French withdrew in early 1867, leaving Maximilian, who was soon captured by Juárez's troops. Although both the U.S. and France urged Juárez against it, the deposed emperor was executed by firing squad on June 19, 1867.

Although in speeches Seward had predicted all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the <a href="Gadsden%20Purchase">Gadsden Purchase</a> obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because the land to be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this was no longer an issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of <a href="Greenland">Greenland</a> and <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. The Union Navy had been hampered due to the lack of overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.

Believing, along with Lincoln, that the U.S. needed a naval base in the Caribbean, in January 1865, Seward offered to purchase the <a href="Danish%20West%20Indies">Danish West Indies</a> (today the <a href="United%20States%20Virgin%20Islands">United States Virgin Islands</a>). Late that year, Seward sailed for the Caribbean on a naval vessel. Among the ports of call was <a href="St.%20Thomas%2C%20U.S.%20Virgin%20Islands">St. Thomas</a> in the Danish West Indies, where Seward admired the large, easily defended harbor. Another stop was in the Dominican Republic, where he opened talks to obtain <a href="Saman%C3%A1%20Bay">Samaná Bay</a>. When Congress reconvened in December 1866, Seward caused a sensation by entering the chamber of the House of Representatives and sitting down with the administration's enemy, Congressman Stevens, persuading him to support an appropriation for more money to expedite the purchase of Samaná, and sent his son Frederick to the Dominican Republic to negotiate a treaty. Both attempts fell through; the Senate, in the dying days of the Johnson administration, failed to ratify a treaty for the purchase of the Danish possessions, while negotiations with the Dominican Republic were not successful.

Seward had been interested in whaling as a senator; his interest in <a href="Russian%20America">Russian America</a> was a byproduct of this. In his speech prior to the 1860 convention, he predicted the territory would become part of the U.S., and when he learned in 1864 that it might be for sale, he pressed the Russians (then a U.S. ally) for negotiations. Russian minister Baron <a href="Eduard%20de%20Stoeckl">Eduard de Stoeckl</a> returned home on leave in 1866. Fearing that the territory might be overrun by American settlers and due to lack of resources, he urged his government to sell it. He also feared that the territory would be lost to the United Kingdom (especially when it controlled the colony of Canada and based troops there next to Alaska) if his country was ever to go to war with them, motivated by the loss of certain territories from the 1853–56 <a href="Crimean%20War">Crimean War</a>. Stoeckl was given the authority to make the sale and when he returned in March 1867, negotiated with the Secretary of State. Seward initially offered $5 million; the two men settled on $7 million and on March 15, Seward presented a draft treaty to the Cabinet. Stoeckl's superiors raised several concerns; to induce him to waive them, the final purchase price was increased to $7.2 million. The treaty was signed in the early morning of March 30, 1867, and ratified by the Senate on April 10. Stevens sent the secretary a note of congratulations, predicting that the <a href="Alaska%20Purchase">Alaska Purchase</a> would be seen as one of Seward's greatest accomplishments.

Seward hoped that Johnson would be nominated at the <a href="1868%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1868 Democratic National Convention</a>, but the delegates chose former New York Governor <a href="Horatio%20Seymour">Horatio Seymour</a>. The Republicans chose General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, who had a hostile relationship with Johnson. Seward gave a major speech on the eve of <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201868">the election</a>, endorsing Grant, who was easily elected. Seward met twice with Grant after the election, leading to speculation that he was seeking to remain as secretary for a third presidential term. However, the <a href="President-elect%20of%20the%20United%20States">president-elect</a> had no interest in retaining Seward, and the secretary resigned himself to retirement. Grant refused to have anything to do with Johnson, even declining to ride to <a href="First%20inauguration%20of%20Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">his inauguration</a> in the same carriage as the outgoing president, as was customary. Despite Seward's attempts to persuade him to attend Grant's swearing-in, Johnson and his Cabinet spent the morning of March 4, 1869, at the White House dealing with last-minute business, then left once the time for Grant to be sworn in had passed. Seward returned to Auburn.

Restless in Auburn, Seward embarked on a trip across North America by the new transcontinental railroad. In <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City">Salt Lake City</a>, <a href="Utah%20Territory">Utah Territory</a>, he met with Mormon leader <a href="Brigham%20Young">Brigham Young</a>, who had worked as a carpenter on Seward's house (then belonging to Judge Miller) as a young man. On reaching the Pacific Coast, the Seward party sailed on steamer "<a href="USCS%20Active">Active</a>" north to visit <a href="Sitka%2C%20Alaska">Sitka</a>, <a href="Department%20of%20Alaska">Department of Alaska</a>, part of the vast wilderness Seward had acquired for the U.S. After spending time in Oregon and California, the party went to Mexico, where he was given a hero's welcome. After a visit to Cuba, he returned to the U.S., concluding in March 1870 his trip of nine months.

In August 1870, Seward embarked on another trip, this time westbound around the world. With him was <a href="Olive%20Risley%20Seward">Olive Risley</a>, daughter of a Treasury Department official, to whom he became close in his final year in Washington. They visited Japan, then China, where they walked on the <a href="Great%20Wall%20of%20China">Great Wall</a>. During the trip, they decided that Seward would adopt Olive, and he did so, thus putting an end to gossip and the fears of his sons that Seward would remarry late in life. They spent three months in India, then journeyed through the Middle East and Europe, not returning to Auburn until October 1871.

Back in <a href="Auburn%2C%20New%20York">Auburn</a>, Seward began his memoirs, but only reached his thirties before putting it aside to write of his travels. In these months he was steadily growing weaker. On October 10, 1872, he worked at his desk in the morning as usual, then complained of trouble breathing. Seward grew worse during the day, as his family gathered around him. Asked if he had any final words, he said, "Love one another." Seward died that afternoon. His funeral a few days later was preceded by the people of Auburn and nearby filing past his open casket for four hours. Thurlow Weed was there for the burial of his friend, and <a href="Harriet%20Tubman">Harriet Tubman</a>, a former slave whom the Sewards had aided, sent flowers. President Grant sent his regrets he could not be there.

William Seward rests with his wife Frances and daughter Fanny (1844–1866), in Fort Hill Cemetery in Auburn. They had three surviving sons: Augustus Henry Seward (1826–1876), <a href="William%20H.%20Seward%20Jr.">William H. Seward Jr.</a> (1839–1920) (both of whom had served as Union officers before successful business careers) and <a href="Frederick%20W.%20Seward">Frederick W. Seward</a> (1830–1915) (who served under his father in the State Department), and one daughter.

Seward's reputation, controversial in life, remained so in death, dividing his contemporaries. Former Navy Secretary Gideon Welles argued that not only did Seward lack principles, Gideon was unable to understand how Seward had fooled Lincoln into thinking that he did, gaining entry to the Cabinet thereby. Charles Francis Adams, minister in London during Seward's tenure as secretary, deemed him "more of a politician than a statesman," but <a href="Charles%20Anderson%20Dana">Charles Anderson Dana</a>, former Assistant Secretary of War, disagreed, writing that Seward had "the most cultivated and comprehensive intellect in the administration" and "what is very rare in a lawyer, a politician, or a statesman—imagination."

Scholars of history have generally praised Seward for his work as Secretary of State; in 1973, Ernest N. Paolino deemed him, "the one outstanding Secretary of State after <a href="John%20Quincy%20Adams">John Quincy Adams</a>." Seward has been given high marks by historians both for his achievements in office, and for his foresight in anticipating the future needs of the U.S. According to his biographer Van Deusen, "his foreign policy built for the future. He wished to prepare America for the great era which lay ahead. So he sought bases, naval stations and, peacefully, additional territory."

Seward's biographers suggested that there are two faces to Seward. One, "John Quincy Adams Seward," dreamed big dreams and tried to convey them in speeches, working to achieve education for all, a fair deal for immigrants, an end to slavery, and an expanded America. The other, "Thurlow Weed Seward," cut backroom deals over cigars and a bottle, and was a pragmatist who often settled for half a loaf when the whole was not achievable. Daniel S. Crofts, in Seward's entry in "<a href="American%20National%20Biography">American National Biography</a>" argued, "Each Seward was, of course, a caricature, and both tendencies, at once symbiotic and contradictory, existed in tandem."

The praise Seward has received extends to his work during the Civil War. Stahr wrote that Seward "skillfully managed the nation's foreign affairs, avoiding the foreign intervention that would have ensured that the Confederacy would become a separate nation." Nevertheless, historians, focusing on the battlefields of the Civil War, have given him relatively little attention. Seward has a dozen biographers, while thousands of books focus on Lincoln. According to Crofts, "Seward and Lincoln were the two most important leaders spawned by the intersection of antebellum idealism and partisan politics. Lincoln, of course, will always overshadow Seward. Before 1860, however, Seward eclipsed Lincoln."

Lincoln's assassination helped to seal his greatness, and according to Seward biographer John M. Taylor, to relegate "his associates ... to the status of bit players." Dozens of biographies extolling Lincoln as the quintessential American were written in the decades after the president's death, placing Lincoln on a pedestal of public esteem Seward could not climb. Seward realized this even in life; by one account, when asked to show his scars from the attempt on his life, Seward regretted he had not been martyred along with Lincoln, "I think I deserved the reward of dying there."

Despite his being an ardent supporter of American expansionism during his time in the Cabinet, only Alaska was added to U.S. territory during Seward's service as Secretary of State. (It should be remembered that the purchase of Alaska from Russia was not inevitable; the land had the same latitude as Siberia and was very difficult to farm, while neither gold nor oil nor any other important mineral was discovered there until years after Seward's death.) Nevertheless, his influence extended to later American acquisitions. One of his friends, <a href="Hamilton%20Fish">Hamilton Fish</a>, in 1875 signed the trade reciprocity treaty with the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Hawaii">Kingdom of Hawaii</a> that eventually led to American annexation of the islands. William Everts, another Seward friend, in 1877 signed a treaty of friendship with the <a href="Samoan%20Islands">Samoan Islands</a>, laying the groundwork for another American acquisition. A young friend and protege of Seward, Lincoln's assistant <a href="Secretary%20to%20the%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">private secretary</a>, <a href="John%20Hay">John Hay</a>, served as a successor of Seward from 1898 to 1905, during which time the U.S. acquired <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, <a href="American%20Samoa">American Samoa</a>, the Philippines, and the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>.

Stahr believes that Seward's influence is still felt today:

Pedro II of Brazil

<a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> Pedro II (English: Peter" "II; 2 December 1825 – 5 December 1891), nicknamed "the Magnanimous", was the second and last monarch of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>, reigning for over 58 years. He was born in Rio de Janeiro, the seventh child of Emperor Dom <a href="Pedro%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20of%20Brazil">Pedro I of Brazil</a> and Empress Dona <a href="Maria%20Leopoldina%20of%20Austria">Maria Leopoldina</a> and thus a member of the Brazilian branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza">House of Braganza</a>. His father's abrupt abdication and departure to Europe in 1831 left the five year-old as Emperor and led to a grim and lonely childhood and adolescence, obliged to spend his time studying in preparation for rule. He knew only brief moments of happiness and encountered few friends of his age. His experiences with court intrigues and political disputes during this period greatly affected his later character; he grew into a man with a strong sense of duty and devotion toward his country and his people, yet increasingly resentful of his role as monarch.

Pedro II inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, but he turned Brazil into an emerging power in the international arena. The nation grew to be distinguished from its Hispanic neighbors on account of its political stability, zealously guarded freedom of speech, respect for civil rights, vibrant economic growth, and form of government—a functional <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">representative parliamentary monarchy</a>. Brazil was also victorious in the <a href="Platine%20War">Platine War</a>, the <a href="Uruguayan%20War">Uruguayan War</a>, and the <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a>, as well as prevailing in several other international disputes and domestic tensions. Pedro II steadfastly pushed through the abolition of slavery despite opposition from powerful political and economic interests. A savant in his own right, the Emperor established a reputation as a vigorous sponsor of learning, culture, and the sciences, and he won the respect and admiration of people such as <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>, <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a>, and <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a>, and was a friend to <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, and <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>, among others.

There was no desire for a change in the form of government among most Brazilians, but the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d'état that had almost no support outside a clique of military leaders who desired a form of republic headed by a dictator. Pedro II had become weary of emperorship and despaired over the monarchy's future prospects, despite its overwhelming popular support. He did not allow his ouster to be opposed and did not support any attempt to restore the monarchy. He spent the last two years of his life in exile in Europe, living alone on very little money.

The reign of Pedro II thus came to an unusual end—he was overthrown while highly regarded by the people and at the pinnacle of his popularity, and some of his accomplishments were soon brought to naught as Brazil slipped into a long period of weak governments, dictatorships, and constitutional and economic crises. The men who had exiled him soon began to see in him a model for the Brazilian republic. A few decades after his death, his reputation was restored and his remains were returned to Brazil with celebrations nationwide. Historians have regarded the Emperor in an extremely positive light and several have ranked him as the greatest Brazilian.

Pedro was born at 02:30 on 2 December 1825 in the <a href="Pa%C3%A7o%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Crist%C3%B3v%C3%A3o">Palace of São Cristóvão</a>, in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Brazil</a>. Named after <a href="Peter%20of%20Alcantara">St. Peter of Alcantara</a>, his name in full was Pedro de Alcântara João Carlos Leopoldo Salvador Bibiano Francisco Xavier de Paula Leocádio Miguel Gabriel Rafael Gonzaga. Through his father, Emperor <a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> <a href="Pedro%20I%20of%20Brazil">Pedro I</a>, he was a member of the Brazilian branch of the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza">House of Braganza</a> (Portuguese: "Bragança") and was referred to using the honorific "Dom" (<a href="Lord">Lord</a>) from birth. He was the grandson of Portuguese King Dom <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20VI%20of%20Portugal">João VI</a> and nephew of Dom <a href="Miguel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Miguel I</a>. His mother was the Archduchess <a href="Maria%20Leopoldina%20of%20Austria">Maria Leopoldina of Austria</a>, daughter of <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Franz II</a>, the last <a href="Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>. Through his mother, Pedro was a nephew of <a href="Napoleon%20I">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> and first cousin of Emperors <a href="Napoleon%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20France">Napoleon II of France</a>, <a href="Franz%20Joseph%20I%20of%20Austria">Franz Joseph I</a> of <a href="Austria-Hungary">Austria-Hungary</a> and <a href="Don%20%28honorific%29">Don</a> <a href="Maximilian%20I%20of%20Mexico">Maximiliano I</a> of <a href="Second%20Mexican%20Empire">Mexico</a>.

The only legitimate male child of Pedro I to survive infancy, he was officially recognized as heir apparent to the Brazilian throne with the title Prince Imperial on 6 August 1826. Empress Maria Leopoldina died on 11 December 1826, a few days after a stillbirth, when Pedro was a year old. Two and a half years later, his father married <a href="Am%C3%A9lie%20of%20Leuchtenberg">Amélie of Leuchtenberg</a>. Prince Pedro developed an affectionate relationship with her, whom he came to regard as his mother. Pedro I's desire to restore his daughter <a href="Maria%20II%20of%20Portugal">Maria II</a> to her Portuguese throne, which had been usurped by his brother Miguel I, as well as his declining political position at home led to his abrupt abdication on 7 April 1831. He and Amélie immediately departed for Europe, leaving behind the Prince Imperial, who became Emperor Dom Pedro II.

Upon leaving the country, Emperor Pedro I selected three people to take charge of his son and remaining daughters. The first was <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bonif%C3%A1cio%20de%20Andrada">José Bonifácio de Andrada</a>, his friend and an influential leader during <a href="Independence%20of%20Brazil">Brazilian independence</a>, who was named guardian. The second was Mariana de Verna, who had held the post of "aia" (<a href="governess">governess</a>) since the birth of Pedro II. As a child, the then-Prince Imperial called her ""Dadama"", as he could not pronounce the word "dama" (<a href="Lady">Lady</a>) correctly. He regarded her as his surrogate mother, and would continue to call her by her nickname well into adulthood out of affection. The third person was Rafael, an <a href="Afro-Brazilian">Afro-Brazilian</a> veteran of the <a href="Cisplatine%20War">Cisplatine War</a>. He was an employee in the Palace of São Cristóvão whom Pedro I deeply trusted and asked to look after his son—a charge that he carried out for the rest of his life.

Bonifácio was dismissed from his position in December 1833 and replaced by another guardian. Pedro II spent his days studying, with only two hours set aside for amusements. Intelligent, he was able to acquire knowledge with great ease. However, the hours of study were strenuous and the preparation for his role as monarch was demanding. He had few friends of his age and limited contact with his sisters. All that coupled with the sudden loss of his parents gave Pedro II an unhappy and lonely upbringing. The environment in which he was raised turned him into a shy and needy person who saw books as a refuge and retreat from the real world.

The possibility of lowering the young Emperor's age of majority, instead of waiting until he turned 18, had been floated since 1835. His elevation to the throne had led to a troublesome period of endless crises. The <a href="Regency%20%28government%29">regency</a> created to <a href="Minority%20reign">rule on his behalf</a> was plagued from the start by disputes between political factions and rebellions across the nation. Those politicians who had risen to power during the 1830s had by now also become familiar with the pitfalls of rule. According to historian Roderick J. Barman, by 1840 "they had lost all faith in their ability to rule the country on their own. They accepted Pedro II as an authority figure whose presence was indispensable for the country's survival." When asked by politicians if he would like to assume full powers, Pedro II shyly accepted. On the following day, 23 July 1840, the General Assembly (the Brazilian <a href="Parliament">Parliament</a>) formally declared the 14-year-old Pedro II of age. He was later <a href="Coronation%20of%20the%20Emperor%20of%20Brazil">acclaimed, crowned and consecrated</a> on 18 July 1841.

Removal of the factious regency brought stability to the government. Pedro II was seen nationwide as a legitimate source of authority, whose position placed him above partisanship and petty disputes. He was, however, still no more than a boy, and a shy, insecure and immature one. His nature resulted from his broken childhood, when he experienced abandonment, intrigue and betrayal. Behind the scenes, a group of high-ranking palace servants and notable politicians led by <a href="Aureliano%20Coutinho%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Sepetiba">Aureliano Coutinho</a> (later Viscount of Sepetiba) became known as the "Courtier Faction" as they established influence over the young Emperor. Some were very close to him, such as Mariana de Verna and Steward <a href="Paulo%20Barbosa%20da%20Silva">Paulo Barbosa da Silva</a>. Pedro II was deftly used by the Courtiers against their actual or suspected foes.

The Brazilian government secured the hand of Princess <a href="Teresa%20Cristina%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Teresa Cristina</a> of the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Kingdom of the Two Sicilies</a>. She and Pedro II were <a href="Proxy%20marriage">married by proxy</a> in <a href="Naples">Naples</a> on 30 May 1843. Upon seeing her in person, the Emperor was noticeably disappointed. Teresa Cristina was short, a bit overweight and though not ugly, neither was she pretty. He did little to hide his disillusionment. One observer stated that he turned his back to Teresa Cristina, another depicted him as being so shocked that he needed to sit, and it is possible that both occurred. That evening, Pedro II wept and complained to Mariana de Verna, "They have deceived me, "Dadama"!" It took several hours to convince him that duty demanded that he proceed. The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy and the conferral of the nuptial blessing, occurred on the following day, 4 September.

In late 1845 and early 1846 the Emperor made a tour of Brazil's southern provinces, traveling through <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo">São Paulo</a> (of which <a href="Paran%C3%A1%20%28state%29">Paraná</a> was a part at this time), <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a> and <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>. He was buoyed by the warm and enthusiastic responses he received. By then Pedro II had matured physically and mentally. He grew into a man who, at tall with blue eyes and blond hair, was seen as handsome. With growth, his weaknesses faded and his strengths of character came to the fore. He became self-assured and learned to be not only impartial and diligent, but also courteous, patient and personable. Barman said that he kept "his emotions under iron discipline. He was never rude and never lost his temper. He was exceptionally discreet in words and cautious in action." Most importantly, this period saw the end of the Courtier Faction. Pedro II began to fully exercise authority and successfully engineered the end of the courtiers' influence by removing them from his inner circle while avoiding any public disruption.

Pedro II was faced by three crises between 1848 and 1852. The first test came in confronting the trade in illegally imported slaves. This had been banned in 1826 as part of a treaty with <a href="United%20Kingdom">Great Britain</a>. Trafficking continued unabated, however, and the British government's passage of the <a href="Aberdeen%20Act">Aberdeen Act</a> of 1845 authorized British warships to board Brazilian shipping and seize any found involved in the slave trade. While Brazil grappled with this problem, the <a href="Praieira%20revolt">Praieira revolt</a> erupted on 6 November 1848. This was a conflict between local political factions within <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> province; it was suppressed by March 1849. The <a href="Eus%C3%A9bio%20de%20Queir%C3%B3s%20Law">Eusébio de Queirós Law</a> was <a href="Promulgation">promulgated</a> on 4 September 1850 which gave the Brazilian government broad authority to combat the illegal slave trade. With this new tool, Brazil moved to eliminate importation of slaves. By 1852 this first crisis was over, and Britain accepted that the trade had been suppressed.

The third crisis entailed a conflict with the <a href="Argentine%20Confederation">Argentine Confederation</a> regarding ascendancy over territories adjacent to the <a href="R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">Río de la Plata</a> and free navigation of that waterway. Since the 1830s, Argentine dictator <a href="Juan%20Manuel%20de%20Rosas">Juan Manuel de Rosas</a> had supported rebellions within <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> and Brazil. It was only in 1850 that Brazil was able to address the threat posed by Rosas. An alliance was forged between Brazil, Uruguay and disaffected Argentines, leading to the <a href="Platine%20War">Platine War</a> and the subsequent overthrow of the Argentine ruler in February 1852. Barman said that a "considerable portion of the credit must be ... assigned to the Emperor, whose cool head, tenacity of purpose, and sense of what was feasible proved indispensable."

The Empire's successful navigation of these crises considerably enhanced the nation's stability and prestige, and Brazil emerged as a hemispheric power. Internationally, Europeans began to regard the country as embodying familiar liberal ideals, such as freedom of the press and constitutional respect for civil liberties. Its representative parliamentary monarchy also stood in stark contrast to the mix of dictatorships and instability endemic in the other nations of South America during this period.

At the beginning of the 1850s, Brazil enjoyed internal stability and economic prosperity. Under the prime ministry of <a href="Hon%C3%B3rio%20Hermeto%20Carneiro%20Le%C3%A3o%2C%20Marquis%20of%20Paran%C3%A1">Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão</a> (then-Viscount and later Marquis of Paraná) the Emperor advanced his own ambitious program: the "conciliação" (conciliation) and "melhoramentos" (material developments). Pedro II's reforms aimed to promote less political partisanship, and forward infrastructure and economic development. The nation was being interconnected through <a href="railroad">railroad</a>, electric <a href="telegraph">telegraph</a> and <a href="steamship">steamship</a> lines, uniting it into a single entity. The general opinion, both at home and abroad, was that these accomplishments had been possible due to Brazil's "governance as a <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a> and the character of Pedro II".

Pedro II was neither a British-style <a href="figurehead">figurehead</a> nor an autocrat in the manner of <a href="List%20of%20Russian%20rulers">Russian czars</a>. The Emperor exercised power through cooperation with elected politicians, economic interests, and popular support. The active presence of Pedro II on the political scene was an important part of the government's structure, which also included the cabinet, the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20Brazil">Chamber of Deputies</a> and the <a href="Senate%20of%20Brazil">Senate</a> (the latter two formed the General Assembly). He used his participation in directing the course of government as a means of influence. His direction became indispensable, although it never devolved into "one-man rule." In his handling of the political parties, he "needed to maintain a reputation for impartiality, work in accord with the popular mood, and avoid any flagrant imposition of his will on the political scene."

The Emperor's more notable political successes were achieved primarily because of the non-confrontational and cooperative manner with which he approached both issues and the partisan figures with whom he had to deal. He was remarkably tolerant, seldom taking offense at criticism, opposition or even incompetence. He did not have the constitutional authority to force acceptance of his initiatives without support, and his collaborative approach towards governing kept the nation progressing and enabled the political system to successfully function. The Emperor respected the prerogatives of the legislature, even when they resisted, delayed, or thwarted his goals and appointments. Most politicians appreciated and supported his role. Many had lived through the regency period, when the lack of an emperor who could stand above petty and special interests led to years of strife between political factions. Their experiences in public life had created a conviction that Pedro II was "indispensable to Brazil's continued peace and prosperity."

The marriage between Pedro II and Teresa Cristina started off badly. With maturity, patience and their first child, <a href="Afonso%2C%20Prince%20Imperial%20of%20Brazil">Afonso</a>, their relationship improved. Later Teresa Cristina gave birth to more children: <a href="Isabel%2C%20Princess%20Imperial%20of%20Brazil">Isabel</a>, in 1846; <a href="Princess%20Leopoldina%20of%20Brazil">Leopoldina</a>, in 1847; and lastly, <a href="Pedro%2C%20Prince%20Imperial%20of%20Brazil">Pedro</a>, in 1848. However, both boys died when very young, which devastated the Emperor. Beyond suffering as a father, his view of the Empire's future changed completely. Despite his affection for his daughters, he did not believe that Princess Isabel, although his heir, would have any chance of prospering on the throne. He felt his successor needed to be male for the monarchy to be viable. He increasingly saw the imperial system as being tied so inextricably to himself, that it would not survive him. Isabel and her sister received a remarkable education, although they were given no preparation for governing the nation. Pedro II excluded Isabel from participation in government business and decisions.

Sometime around 1850, Pedro II began having discreet affairs with other women. The most famous and enduring of these relationships involved <a href="Lu%C3%ADsa%20de%20Barros%2C%20Countess%20of%20Barral">Luísa Margarida Portugal de Barros, Countess of Barral</a>, with whom he formed a romantic and intimate, though not adulterous, friendship after she was appointed governess to the emperor's daughters in November 1856. Throughout his life, the Emperor held onto a hope of finding a soulmate, something he felt cheated of due to the necessity of a <a href="marriage%20of%20state">marriage of state</a> to a woman for whom he never felt passion. This is but one instance illustrating his dual identity: one who assiduously carried out his duty in the role of emperor which destiny had assigned to him and another who considered the imperial office an unrewarding burden and who was happier in the worlds of literature and science.

Pedro II was hard-working and his routine was demanding. He usually woke up at 07:00 and did not sleep before 02:00 in the morning. His entire day was devoted to the affairs of state and the meager free time available was spent reading and studying. The Emperor went about his daily routine dressed in a simple black tail coat, trousers, and cravat. For special occasions he would wear court dress, and he only appeared in full regalia with <a href="Imperial%20Regalia%20of%20Brazil">crown, mantle and scepter</a> twice each year at the opening and closing of the General Assembly. Pedro II held politicians and government officials to the strict standards which he exemplified. The Emperor adopted a strict policy for the selection of civil servants based on morality and merit. To set the standard, he lived simply, once having said: "I also understand that useless expenditure is the same as stealing from the Nation." <a href="Ballroom%20dance">Balls</a> and assemblies of the Court ceased after 1852. He also refused to request or allow the amount of his <a href="civil%20list">civil list</a> of Rs 800:000$000 per year (U.S. $405,000 or £90,000 in 1840) to be raised from the declaration of his majority until his dethronement almost fifty years later.

"I was born to devote myself to culture and sciences," the Emperor remarked in his private journal during 1862. He had always been eager to learn and found in books a refuge from the demands of his position. Subjects which interested Pedro II were wide-ranging, including <a href="anthropology">anthropology</a>, <a href="history">history</a>, <a href="geography">geography</a>, <a href="geology">geology</a>, <a href="medicine">medicine</a>, <a href="law">law</a>, <a href="religious%20studies">religious studies</a>, <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a>, <a href="painting">painting</a>, <a href="sculpture">sculpture</a>, <a href="theater">theater</a>, <a href="music">music</a>, <a href="chemistry">chemistry</a>, <a href="physics">physics</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, <a href="poetry">poetry</a> and <a href="technology">technology</a>, among others. By the end of his reign, there were three libraries in São Cristóvão palace containing more than 60,000 books. A passion for <a href="linguistics">linguistics</a> prompted him throughout his life to study new languages, and he was able to speak and write not only <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a> but also <a href="Latin">Latin</a>, <a href="French%20language">French</a>, <a href="German%20language">German</a>, <a href="English%20language">English</a>, <a href="Italian%20language">Italian</a>, <a href="Spanish%20language">Spanish</a>, <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a>, <a href="Arabic%20language">Arabic</a>, <a href="Hebrew%20language">Hebrew</a>, <a href="Sanskrit">Sanskrit</a>, <a href="Chinese%20language">Chinese</a>, <a href="Occitan%20language">Occitan</a> and <a href="Tupi%20language">Tupi</a>. He became the first Brazilian photographer when he acquired a <a href="daguerreotype">daguerreotype</a> camera in March 1840. He set up one laboratory in São Cristóvão devoted to photography and another to chemistry and physics. He also had an astronomical observatory constructed.

The Emperor considered education to be of national importance and was himself a concrete example of the value of learning. He remarked: "Were I not an Emperor, I would like to be a teacher. I do not know of a task more noble than to direct young minds and prepare the men of tomorrow." His reign saw the creation of the <a href="Brazilian%20Historic%20and%20Geographic%20Institute">Brazilian Historic and Geographic Institute</a> to promote research and preservation in the historical, geographical, cultural and social sciences. The Imperial Academy of Music and National Opera and the <a href="Col%C3%A9gio%20Pedro%20II%20%28Rio%20de%20Janeiro%29">Pedro II School</a> were also founded, the latter serving as a model for schools throughout Brazil. The <a href="Escola%20Nacional%20de%20Belas%20Artes">Imperial Academy of the Fine Arts</a>, established by his father, received further strengthening and support. Using his civil list income, Pedro II provided scholarships for Brazilian students to study at universities, art schools and conservatories of music in Europe. He also financed the creation of the <a href="Institute%20Pasteur">Institute Pasteur</a>, helped underwrite the construction of Wagner's <a href="Bayreuth%20Festspielhaus">Bayreuth Festspielhaus</a>, as well as subscribing to similar projects. His efforts were recognized both at home and abroad. <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a> said of him: "The Emperor does so much for science, that every scientific man is bound to show him the utmost respect".

Pedro II became a member of the <a href="Royal%20Society">Royal Society</a>, the <a href="Russian%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">Russian Academy of Sciences</a>, <a href="The%20Royal%20Academies%20for%20Science%20and%20the%20Arts%20of%20Belgium">The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium</a> and the <a href="American%20Geographical%20Society">American Geographical Society</a>. In 1875, he was elected to the <a href="French%20Academy%20of%20Sciences">French Academy of Sciences</a>, an honor previously granted to only two other heads of state: <a href="Peter%20I%20of%20Russia">Peter the Great</a> and <a href="Napoleon%20I">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>. He exchanged letters with scientists, philosophers, musicians and other intellectuals. Many of his correspondents became his friends, including <a href="Richard%20Wagner">Richard Wagner</a>, <a href="Louis%20Pasteur">Louis Pasteur</a>, <a href="Louis%20Agassiz">Louis Agassiz</a>, <a href="John%20Greenleaf%20Whittier">John Greenleaf Whittier</a>, <a href="Michel%20Eug%C3%A8ne%20Chevreul">Michel Eugène Chevreul</a>, <a href="Alexander%20Graham%20Bell">Alexander Graham Bell</a>, <a href="Henry%20Wadsworth%20Longfellow">Henry Wadsworth Longfellow</a>, <a href="Arthur%20de%20Gobineau">Arthur de Gobineau</a>, <a href="Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20Mistral">Frédéric Mistral</a>, <a href="Alessandro%20Manzoni">Alessandro Manzoni</a>, Alexandre Herculano, <a href="Camilo%20Castelo%20Branco">Camilo Castelo Branco</a> and <a href="James%20Cooley%20Fletcher">James Cooley Fletcher</a>. His erudition amazed <a href="Friedrich%20Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> when the two met. <a href="Victor%20Hugo">Victor Hugo</a> told the Emperor: "Sire, you are a great citizen, you are the grandson of <a href="Marcus%20Aurelius">Marcus Aurelius</a>," and <a href="Alexandre%20Herculano">Alexandre Herculano</a> called him a "Prince whom the general opinion holds as the foremost of his era because of his gifted mind, and due to the constant application of that gift to the sciences and culture."

At the end of 1859, Pedro II departed on a trip to provinces north of the capital, visiting <a href="Esp%C3%ADrito%20Santo">Espírito Santo</a>, <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a>, <a href="Sergipe">Sergipe</a>, <a href="Alagoas">Alagoas</a>, <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> and <a href="Para%C3%ADba">Paraíba</a>. He returned in February 1860 after four months. The trip was a huge success, with the Emperor welcomed everywhere with warmth and joy. The first half of the 1860s saw peace and prosperity in Brazil. <a href="Civil%20liberty">Civil liberties</a> were maintained. <a href="Freedom%20of%20speech">Freedom of speech</a> had existed since Brazil's independence and was strongly defended by Pedro II. He found newspapers from the capital and from the provinces an ideal way to keep track of public opinion and the nation's overall situation. Another means of monitoring the Empire was through direct contacts with his subjects. One opportunity for this was during regular Tuesday and Saturday public audiences, where anyone of any social class, including slaves, could gain admittance and present their petitions and stories. Visits to schools, colleges, prisons, exhibitions, factories, barracks and other public appearances presented further opportunities to gather first-hand information.

This tranquility disappeared when the British consul in Rio de Janeiro, <a href="William%20Dougal%20Christie">William Dougal Christie</a>, nearly sparked a war between his nation and Brazil. Christie sent an <a href="ultimatum">ultimatum</a> containing abusive demands arising out of two minor incidents at the end of 1861 and beginning of 1862. The first was the sinking of a commercial <a href="barque">barque</a> on the coast of Rio Grande do Sul after which its goods were pillaged by local inhabitants. The second was the arrest of drunken British officers who were causing a disturbance in the streets of Rio.

The Brazilian government refused to yield, and Christie <a href="Gunboat%20diplomacy">issued orders for British warships</a> to capture Brazilian merchant vessels as indemnity. Brazil prepared for what was seen as an imminent conflict. Pedro II was the main reason for Brazil's resistance; he rejected any suggestion of yielding. This response came as a surprise to Christie, who changed his tenor and proposed a peaceful settlement through international arbitration. The Brazilian government presented its demands and, upon seeing the British government's position weaken, severed diplomatic ties with Britain in June 1863.

As war with the British Empire threatened, Brazil had to turn its attention to its southern frontiers. Another civil war had begun in <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a> as its political parties turned against each other. The internal conflict led to the murder of Brazilians and looting of their property in Uruguay. Brazil's government decided to intervene, fearful of giving any impression of weakness in the face of conflict with the British. A Brazilian army invaded Uruguay in December 1864, beginning the brief <a href="Uruguayan%20War">Uruguayan War</a>, which ended in February 1865. Meanwhile, the dictator of Paraguay, <a href="Francisco%20Solano%20L%C3%B3pez">Francisco Solano López</a> took advantage of the situation to establish his country as a regional power. The <a href="Paraguayan%20army">Paraguayan army</a> invaded the Brazilian province of <a href="Mato%20Grosso">Mato Grosso</a> (the area known after 1977 as the state of <a href="Mato%20Grosso%20do%20Sul">Mato Grosso do Sul</a>), triggering the <a href="Paraguayan%20War">Paraguayan War</a>. Four months later, Paraguayan troops invaded <a href="Argentina">Argentine</a> territory as a prelude to an attack on <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>.

Aware of the anarchy in Rio Grande do Sul and the incapacity and incompetence of its military chiefs to resist the Paraguayan army, Pedro II decided to go to the front in person. Upon receiving objections from the cabinet, the General Assembly and the <a href="Privy%20council">Council of State</a>, Pedro II pronounced: "If they can prevent me from going as an Emperor, they cannot prevent me from abdicating and going as a Fatherland Volunteer"—an allusion to those Brazilians who volunteered to go to war and became known throughout the nation as the "Fatherland Volunteers". The monarch himself was popularly called the "Number-one volunteer". Given permission to leave, Pedro II disembarked in Rio Grande do Sul in July and proceeded from there by land. He travelled overland by horse and wagon, sleeping at night in a campaign tent. In September, Pedro II arrived in <a href="Uruguaiana">Uruguaiana</a>, a Brazilian town occupied by a besieged Paraguayan army.

The Emperor rode within rifle-shot of Uruguaiana, but the Paraguayans did not attack him. To avoid further bloodshed, he offered terms of surrender to the Paraguayan commander, who accepted. Pedro II's coordination of the military operations and his personal example played a decisive role in successfully repulsing the Paraguayan invasion of Brazilian territory. Before returning to Rio de Janeiro, he received the British diplomatic envoy <a href="Edward%20Thornton%20%28diplomat%29">Edward Thornton</a>, who apologized on behalf of <a href="Queen%20Victoria">Queen Victoria</a> and the British Government for the crisis between the empires. The Emperor regarded this diplomatic victory over the most powerful nation of the world as sufficient and renewed friendly relations.

Against all expectations, the war continued for five years. During this period, Pedro II's time and energy were devoted to the war effort. He tirelessly worked to raise and equip troops to reinforce the front lines and to push forward the fitting of new warships for the navy. The rape of women, widespread violence against civilians, ransacking and destruction of properties that had occurred during Paraguay's invasion of Brazilian territory had made a deep impression on him. He warned the Countess of Barral in November 1866 that "the war should be concluded as honor demands, cost what it cost." "Difficulties, setbacks, and <a href="war-weariness">war-weariness</a> had no effect on his quiet resolve", said Barman. Mounting casualties did not distract him from advancing what he saw as Brazil's righteous cause, and he stood prepared to personally sacrifice his own throne to gain an honorable outcome. Writing in his journal a few years previously Pedro II remarked: "What sort of fear could I have? That they take the government from me? Many better kings than I have lost it, and to me it is no more than the weight of a cross which it is my duty to carry."

At the same time, Pedro II worked to prevent quarrels between the national political parties from impairing the military response. The Emperor prevailed over a <a href="1868%20Brazilian%20political%20crisis">serious political crisis in July 1868</a> resulting from a quarrel between the cabinet and <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Alves%20de%20Lima%20e%20Silva%2C%20Duke%20of%20Caxias">Luís Alves de Lima e Silva</a> (then-Marques and later Duke of Caxias), the commander-in-chief of the Brazilian forces in Paraguay. Caxias was also a politician and was a member of the opposing party to the ministry. The Emperor sided with him, leading to the cabinet's resignation. As Pedro II maneuvered to bring about a victorious outcome in the conflict with Paraguay, he threw his support behind the political parties and factions that seemed to be most useful in the effort. The reputation of the monarchy was harmed and its trusted position as an impartial mediator was severely impacted in the long term. He was unconcerned for his personal position, and regardless of the impact upon the imperial system, he determined to put the national interest ahead of any potential harm caused by such expediencies.

His refusal to accept anything short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome. His tenacity was well-paid with the news that López had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. Pedro II turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an <a href="equestrian%20statue">equestrian statue</a> of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.

In the 1870s progress was made in both social and political spheres, and all segments of society benefited from the reforms and shared in the increasing prosperity. Brazil's international reputation for political stability and investment potential greatly improved. The Empire was seen as a modern and progressive nation unequalled, with the exception of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, in the <a href="Americas">Americas</a>. The economy began growing rapidly and immigration flourished. Railroad, shipping and other modernization projects were adopted. With "slavery destined for extinction and other reforms projected, the prospects for 'moral and material advances' seemed vast."

In 1870, few Brazilians opposed slavery and even fewer openly condemned it. Pedro II, who did not own slaves, was one of the few who did oppose slavery. Its abolition was a delicate subject. Slaves were used by everyone, from the richest to the poorest. Pedro II wanted to end the practice gradually to soften the impact to the national economy. With no constitutional authority to directly intervene to abolish slavery, the Emperor would need to use all his skills to convince, influence and gather support among politicians to achieve his goal. His first open move occurred back in 1850, when he threatened to abdicate unless the General Assembly declared the <a href="Atlantic%20slave%20trade">Atlantic slave trade</a> illegal.

Having dealt with the overseas supply of new slaves, Pedro II turned his attention in the early 1860s to removing the remaining source: enslavement of children born to slaves. Legislation was drafted at his initiative, but the conflict with Paraguay delayed discussion of the proposal in the General Assembly. Pedro II openly asked for the gradual eradication of slavery in the <a href="Speech%20from%20the%20Throne">Speech from the Throne</a> of 1867. He was heavily criticized, and his move was condemned as "national suicide." Critics argued "that abolition was his personal desire and not that of the nation." He consciously ignored the growing political damage to his image and to the monarchy in consequence of his support for abolition. Eventually, a bill pushed through by Prime Minister <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Paranhos%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Rio%20Branco">José Paranhos, Viscount of Rio Branco</a>, was enacted as the <a href="Law%20of%20Free%20Birth">Law of Free Birth</a> on 28 September 1871, under which all children born to slave women after that date were considered free-born.

On 25 May 1871 Pedro II and his wife traveled to Europe. He had long desired to vacation abroad. When news arrived that his younger daughter, the 23-year-old Leopoldina, had died in Vienna of <a href="typhoid%20fever">typhoid fever</a> on 7 February, he finally had a pressing reason to venture outside the Empire. Upon arriving in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>, he immediately went to the <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20Ancient%20Art">"Janelas Verdes" palace</a>, where he met with his stepmother <a href="Am%C3%A9lie%20of%20Leuchtenberg">Amélie of Leuchtenberg</a>. The two had not seen each other in forty years, and the meeting was emotional. Pedro II remarked in his journal: "I cried from happiness and also from sorrow seeing my Mother so affectionate toward me but so aged and so sick."

The Emperor proceeded to visit Spain, Great Britain, Belgium, Germany, Austria, Italy, Egypt, Greece, Switzerland and France. In <a href="Coburg">Coburg</a> he visited his daughter's tomb. He found this to be "a time of release and freedom". He traveled under the assumed name "Dom Pedro de Alcântara", insisting upon being treated informally and staying only in hotels. He spent his days sightseeing and conversing with scientists and other intellectuals with whom he shared interests. The European sojourn proved to be a success, and his demeanor and curiosity won respectful notices in the nations which he visited. The prestige of both Brazil and Pedro II were further enhanced during the tour when news came from Brazil that the Law of Free Birth, abolishing the last source of enslavement, had been ratified. The imperial party returned to Brazil in triumph on 31 March 1872.

Soon after returning to Brazil, Pedro II was faced with an unexpected crisis. The Brazilian clergy had long been understaffed, undisciplined and poorly educated, leading to a great loss of respect for the Catholic Church. The imperial government had embarked upon a program of reform to address these deficiencies. As Catholicism was the state religion, the government exercised a great deal of control over Church affairs, paying clerical salaries, appointing parish priests, nominating bishops, ratifying <a href="papal%20bull">papal bull</a>s and overseeing seminaries. In pursuing reform, the government selected bishops who satisfied its criteria for education, support for reform and moral fitness. However, as more capable men began to fill the clerical ranks, resentment of government control over the Church increased.

The bishops of <a href="Olinda">Olinda</a> and <a href="Bel%C3%A9m">Belém</a> (in the provinces of Pernambuco and <a href="Par%C3%A1">Pará</a>, respectively) were two of the new generation of educated, zealous Brazilian clerics. They had been influenced by the <a href="Ultramontanism">Ultramontanism</a> which spread among Catholics in this period. In 1872 they ordered <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasons</a> expelled from <a href="Sodality%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">lay brotherhoods</a>. While European Masonry often tended towards <a href="atheism">atheism</a> and <a href="anti-clericalism">anti-clericalism</a>, things were much different in Brazil where membership in Masonic orders was common—although Pedro II himself was not a Freemason. The government headed by the Viscount of Rio Branco tried on two separate occasions to persuade the bishops to repeal, but they refused. This led to their trial and conviction by the <a href="Superior%20Court%20of%20Justice%20%28Brazil%29">Superior Court of Justice</a>. In 1874 they were sentenced four years at hard labor, although the Emperor commuted this to imprisonment only.

Pedro II played a decisive role by unequivocally backing the government's actions. He was a conscientious adherent of Catholicism, which he viewed as advancing important civilizing and civic values. While he avoided anything that could be considered unorthodox, he felt free to think and behave independently. The Emperor accepted new ideas, such as <a href="Charles%20Darwin">Charles Darwin</a>'s theory of <a href="evolution">evolution</a>, of which he remarked that "the laws that he [Darwin] has discovered glorify the Creator". He was moderate in his religious beliefs, but could not accept disrespect to civil law and government authority. As he told his son-in-law: "[The government] has to ensure that the constitution is obeyed. In these proceedings there is no desire to protect masonry; but rather the goal of upholding the rights of the civilian power." The crisis was resolved in September 1875 after the Emperor grudgingly agreed to grant full amnesty to the bishops and the <a href="Holy%20See">Holy See</a> annulled the interdicts.

Once again the Emperor traveled abroad, this time going to the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. He was accompanied by his faithful servant Rafael, who had raised him from childhood. Pedro II arrived in New York City on 15 April 1876, and set out from there to travel throughout the country; going as far as <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> in the west, <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> in the south, <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, and north to <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, Canada. The trip was "an unalloyed triumph", Pedro II making a deep impression on the American people with his simplicity and kindness. He then crossed the Atlantic, where he visited <a href="Denmark">Denmark</a>, <a href="Sweden">Sweden</a>, <a href="Finland">Finland</a>, <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>, Greece, the <a href="Holy%20Land%23Christianity">Holy Land</a>, Egypt, Italy, Austria, Germany, France, Britain, <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a> and Portugal. He returned to Brazil on 22 September 1877.

Pedro II's trips abroad made a deep psychological impact. While traveling, he was largely freed of the restrictions imposed by his office. Under the pseudonym "Pedro de Alcântara", he enjoyed moving about as an ordinary person, even taking a train journey solely with his wife. Only while touring abroad could the Emperor shake off the formal existence and demands of the life he knew in Brazil. It became more difficult to reacclimate to his routine as head of state upon returning. Upon his sons' early deaths, the Emperor's faith in the monarchy's future had evaporated. His trips abroad now made him resentful of the burden destiny had placed upon his shoulders when only a child of five. If he previously had no interest in securing the throne for the next generation, he now had no desire to keep it going during his own lifetime.

During the 1880s, Brazil continued to prosper and social diversity increased markedly, including the first organized push for <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a>. On the other hand, letters written by Pedro II reveal a man grown world-weary with age and having an increasingly alienated and pessimistic outlook. He remained respectful of his duty and was meticulous in performing the tasks demanded of the imperial office, albeit often without enthusiasm. Because of his increasing "indifference towards the fate of the regime" and his lack of action in support of the imperial system once it was challenged, historians have attributed the "prime, perhaps sole, responsibility" for the dissolution of the monarchy to the Emperor himself.

After their experience of the perils and obstacles of government, the political figures who had arisen during the 1830s saw the Emperor as providing a fundamental source of authority essential for governing and for national survival. These elder statesmen began to die off or retire from government until, by the 1880s, they had almost entirely been replaced by a newer generation of politicians who had no experience of the early years of Pedro II's reign. They had only known a stable administration and prosperity and saw no reason to uphold and defend the imperial office as a unifying force beneficial to the nation. To them Pedro II was merely an old and increasingly sick man who had steadily eroded his position by taking an active role in politics for decades. Before he had been above criticism, but now his every action and inaction prompted meticulous scrutiny and open criticism. Many young politicians had become apathetic toward the monarchic regime and, when the time came, they would do nothing to defend it. Pedro II's achievements went unremembered and unconsidered by the ruling elites. By his very success, the Emperor had made his position seem unnecessary.

The lack of an heir who could feasibly provide a new direction for the nation also diminished the long-term prospects of the Brazilian monarchy. The Emperor loved his daughter Isabel, but he considered the idea of a female successor as antithetical to the role required of Brazil's ruler. He viewed the death of his two sons as being a sign that the Empire was destined to be supplanted. Resistance to accepting a female ruler was also shared by the political establishment. Even though the Constitution allowed female succession to the throne, Brazil was still very traditional, and only a male successor was thought capable as head of state.

By June 1887, the Emperor's health had considerably worsened and his personal doctors suggested going to Europe for medical treatment. While in <a href="Milan">Milan</a> he passed two weeks between life and death, even being <a href="Anointing%20of%20the%20Sick%20%28Catholic%20Church%29">anointed</a>. While on a bed recovering, on 22 May 1888 he received news that <a href="Lei%20%C3%81urea">slavery had been abolished</a> in Brazil. With a weak voice and tears in his eyes, he said, "Great people! Great people!" Pedro II returned to Brazil and disembarked in Rio de Janeiro in August 1888. The "whole country welcomed him with an enthusiasm never seen before. From the capital, from the provinces, from everywhere, arrived proofs of affection and veneration." With the devotion expressed by Brazilians upon the return of the Emperor and the Empress from Europe, the <a href="monarchy">monarchy</a> seemed to enjoy unshakable support and to be at the height of its popularity.

The nation enjoyed great international prestige during the final years of the Empire, and it had become an <a href="Emerging%20Powers">emerging power</a> within the international arena. Predictions of economic and labor disruption caused by the abolition of slavery failed to materialize and the 1888 coffee harvest was successful. The end of slavery had resulted in an explicit shift of support to <a href="republicanism">republicanism</a> by rich and powerful coffee farmers who held great political, economic and social power in the country. <a href="Republicanism">Republicanism</a> was an elitist creed which never flourished in Brazil, with little support in the provinces. The combination of republican ideas and the dissemination of <a href="Positivism">Positivism</a> among the army's lower and medium officer ranks led to indiscipline among the corps and became a serious threat to the monarchy. They dreamed of a dictatorial republic, which they believed would be superior to the monarchy.

Although there was no desire in Brazil among the majority of the population to change the <a href="form%20of%20government">form of government</a>, the civilian republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. They launched a <a href="coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">coup d'état</a>, arrested Prime Minister <a href="Afonso%20Celso%2C%20Viscount%20of%20Ouro%20Preto">Afonso Celso, Viscount of Ouro Preto</a> and instituted the republic on 15 November 1889. The few people who witnessed what occurred did not realize that it was a rebellion. Historian Lídia Besouchet noted that "[r]arely has a revolution been so minor." During the ordeal Pedro II showed no emotion, as if unconcerned about the outcome. He dismissed all suggestions for quelling the rebellion that politicians and military leaders put forward. When he heard the news of his deposition he simply commented: "If it is so, it will be my retirement. I have worked too hard and I am tired. I will go rest then." He and his family were sent into exile in Europe on 17 November.

Teresa Cristina died three weeks after their arrival in Europe, and Isabel and her family moved to another place while Pedro settled first in <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a> and later in Paris. Pedro's last couple of years were lonely and melancholic, as he lived in modest hotels without money and writing in his journal of dreams in which he was allowed to return to Brazil. He never supported a restoration of the monarchy, once stating that he had no desire "to return to the position which I occupied, especially not by means of conspiracy of any sort." One day he caught an infection that progressed quickly into <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. Pedro rapidly declined and died at 00:35 on 5 December 1891 surrounded by his family. His last words were "May God grant me these last wishes—peace and prosperity for Brazil". While the body was being prepared, a sealed package in the room was found, and next to it a message written by the Emperor himself: "It is soil from my country, I wish it to be placed in my coffin in case I die away from my fatherland."

Isabel wished to hold a discreet and private burial ceremony, but she eventually agreed to the French government's request for a <a href="state%20funeral">state funeral</a>. On 9 December, thousands of mourners attended the ceremony at <a href="La%20Madeleine%2C%20Paris">La Madeleine</a>. Aside from Pedro's family, these included: <a href="Francis%20II%20of%20the%20Two%20Sicilies">Francesco II</a>, former king of the Two Sicilies; <a href="Isabella%20II%20of%20Spain">Isabel II</a>, former queen of Spain; <a href="Philippe%2C%20comte%20de%20Paris">Philippe, comte de Paris</a>; and other members of European royalty. Also present were General <a href="Joseph%20Brug%C3%A8re">Joseph Brugère</a>, representing President <a href="Marie%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Sadi%20Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a>; the presidents of the <a href="Senate%20of%20France">Senate</a> and the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20of%20France">Chamber of Deputies</a> as well as their members; diplomats; and other representatives of the French government. Nearly all members of the <a href="Institut%20de%20France">Institut de France</a> were in attendance. Other governments from the Americas and Europe sent representatives, as did <a href="Ottoman%20Empire">Ottoman Turkey</a>, <a href="Qing%20Dynasty">China</a>, <a href="Empire%20of%20Japan">Japan</a> and <a href="Persia%20under%20Qajar%20dynasty">Persia</a>. Following the services, the coffin was taken in procession to the railway station to begin its trip to Portugal. Around 300,000 people lined the route under incessant rain and cold. The journey continued on to the <a href="Monastery%20of%20S%C3%A3o%20Vicente%20de%20Fora">Church of São Vicente de Fora</a> near <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, where the body of Pedro was interred in the <a href="Royal%20Pantheon%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Braganza">Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza</a> on 12 December.

The Brazilian republican government, "fearful of a backlash resulting from the death of the Emperor", banned any official reaction. Nevertheless, the Brazilians were far from indifferent to Pedro's demise, and "repercussions in Brazil were also immense, despite the government's effort to suppress. There were demonstrations of sorrow throughout the country: shuttered business activity, flags displayed at half-staff, black armbands on clothes, death knells, religious ceremonies." Masses were held in memory of Pedro throughout Brazil, and he and the monarchy were praised in the eulogies that followed.

After his fall, Brazilians remained attached to the former Emperor, who was still a popular and highly praised figure. This view was even stronger among those <a href="Afro-Brazilian">of African descent</a>, who equated the monarchy with freedom because of his and his daughter Isabel's part in the abolition of slavery. The continued support for the deposed monarch is largely credited to a generally held and unextinguished belief that he was a truly "wise, benevolent, austere and honest ruler", said historian Ricardo Salles. The positive view of Pedro II, and nostalgia for his reign, only grew as the nation quickly fell into a series of economic and political crises which Brazilians attributed to the Emperor's overthrow.

Strong feelings of guilt manifested among republicans, and these became increasingly evident upon the Emperor's death in exile. They praised Pedro II, who was seen as a model of <a href="Res%20publica">republican ideals</a>, and the imperial era, which they believed should be regarded as an example to be followed by the young republic. In Brazil, the news of the Emperor's death "aroused a genuine sense of regret among those who, without sympathy for a restoration, acknowledged both the merits and the achievements of their deceased ruler." His remains, as well as those of his wife, were returned to Brazil in 1921 in time for the centenary of the Brazilian independence. The government granted Pedro II dignities befitting a head of state. A national holiday was declared and the return of the Emperor as a national hero was celebrated throughout the country. Thousands attended the main ceremony in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> where, according to historian Pedro Calmon, the "elderly people cried. Many knelt down. All clapped hands. There was no distinction between republicans and monarchists. They were all Brazilians." This homage marked the reconciliation of Republican Brazil with its monarchical past.

Historians have expressed high regard for Pedro II and his reign. The scholarly literature dealing with him is vast and, with the exception of the period immediately after his ouster, overwhelmingly positive, and even laudatory. He has been regarded by several historians in Brazil as the greatest Brazilian. In a manner similar to methods which were used by republicans, historians point to the Emperor's virtues as an example to be followed, although none go so far as to advocate a restoration of the monarchy. Historian Richard Graham noted that "[m]ost twentieth-century historians, moreover, have looked back on the period [of Pedro II's reign] nostalgically, using their descriptions of the Empire to criticize—sometimes subtly, sometimes not—Brazil's subsequent republican or dictatorial regimes."


The Emperor's full style and title were "His Imperial Majesty Dom Pedro II, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Defender of Brazil".

Pedro I of Brazil

<a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a> Pedro I (English: Peter I; 12 October 1798 – 24 September 1834), nicknamed "the Liberator", was the <a href="List%20of%20monarchs%20of%20Brazil">founder and first</a> ruler of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a>. As King Dom Pedro IV, he <a href="List%20of%20Portuguese%20monarchs%23House%20of%20Braganza%20%281640%E2%80%931910%29">reigned briefly</a> over <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Portugal">Portugal</a>, where he also became known as "the Liberator" as well as "the Soldier King". Born in <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, Pedro I was the fourth child of King Dom <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BVI%20of%20Portugal">João VI</a> of Portugal and Queen <a href="Carlota%20Joaquina%20of%20Spain">Carlota Joaquina</a>, and thus a member of the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza">House of Braganza</a>. When their country was invaded by French troops in 1807, he and his family fled to Portugal's largest and wealthiest colony, Brazil.

The outbreak of the <a href="Liberal%20Revolution%20of%201820">Liberal Revolution of 1820</a> in Lisbon compelled Pedro I's father to return to Portugal in April 1821, leaving him to rule Brazil as regent. He had to deal with threats from revolutionaries and insubordination by Portuguese troops, all of which he subdued. The Portuguese government's threat to revoke the political autonomy that Brazil had enjoyed since 1808 was met with widespread discontent in Brazil. Pedro I chose the Brazilian side and declared <a href="Independence%20of%20Brazil">Brazil's independence</a> from Portugal on 7 September 1822. On 12 October, he was acclaimed Brazilian emperor and by March 1824 had defeated all armies loyal to Portugal. A few months later, Pedro I crushed the short-lived <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Equator">Confederation of the Equator</a>, a failed secession attempt by provincial rebels in Brazil's <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">northeast</a>.

A secessionist rebellion in the southern province of <a href="Cisplatina">Cisplatina</a> in early 1825, and the subsequent attempt by the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">United Provinces of the Río de la Plata</a> to annex it, led the Empire into the <a href="Cisplatine%20War">Cisplatine War</a>. In March 1826, Pedro I briefly became king of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, Dona <a href="Maria%20II%20of%20Portugal">Maria II</a>. The situation worsened in 1828 when the war in the south resulted in Brazil's loss of Cisplatina. During the same year in Lisbon, Maria II's throne was usurped by Prince Dom <a href="Miguel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Miguel</a>, Pedro I's younger brother. The Emperor's concurrent and scandalous sexual affair with a female courtier tarnished his reputation. Other difficulties arose in the Brazilian parliament, where a struggle over whether the government would be chosen by the monarch or by the legislature dominated political debates from 1826 to 1831. Unable to deal with problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, on 7 April 1831 Pedro I abdicated in favor of his son Dom <a href="Pedro%20II%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II</a>, and sailed for Europe.

Pedro I invaded Portugal at the head of an army in July 1832. Faced at first with what seemed a national civil war, he soon became involved in a wider conflict that enveloped the <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a> in a struggle between proponents of <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a> and those seeking a return to <a href="Absolute%20monarchy">absolutism</a>. Pedro I died of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> on 24 September 1834, just a few months after he and the liberals had emerged victorious. He was hailed by both contemporaries and posterity as a key figure who helped spread the liberal ideals that allowed Brazil and Portugal to move from Absolutist regimes to representative forms of government.

Pedro was born at 08:00 on 12 October 1798 in the <a href="Queluz%20National%20Palace">Queluz Royal Palace</a> near <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, <a href="Portugal">Portugal</a>. He was named after St. <a href="Peter%20of%20Alcantara">Peter of Alcantara</a>, and his full name was Pedro de Alcântara Francisco António João Carlos Xavier de Paula Miguel Rafael Joaquim José Gonzaga Pascoal Cipriano Serafim. He was referred to using the honorific "<a href="Dom%20%28title%29">Dom</a>" (<a href="Lord">Lord</a>) from birth.

Through his father, Prince Dom João (later King Dom <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20VI%20of%20Portugal">João VI</a>), Pedro was a member of the <a href="House%20of%20Braganza">House of Braganza</a> (Portuguese: "Bragança") and a grandson of King Dom <a href="Peter%20III%20of%20Portugal">Pedro III</a> and Queen Dona (Lady) <a href="Maria%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BI%20of%20Portugal">Maria I of Portugal</a>, who were uncle and niece as well as husband and wife. His mother, Doña <a href="Carlota%20Joaquina%20of%20Spain">Carlota Joaquina</a>, was the daughter of King <a href="Don%20%28honorific%29">Don</a> <a href="Charles%20IV%20of%20Spain">Carlos IV</a> of Spain. Pedro's parents had an unhappy marriage. Carlota Joaquina was an ambitious woman, who always sought to advance Spain's interests, even to the detriment of Portugal's. Reputedly unfaithful to her husband, she went as far as to plot his overthrow in league with dissatisfied Portuguese nobles.

As the second eldest son (though the fourth child), Pedro became his father's heir apparent and <a href="Prince%20of%20Beira">Prince of Beira</a> upon the death of his elder brother <a href="Francisco%20Ant%C3%B3nio%2C%20Prince%20of%20Beira">Francisco António</a> in 1801. Prince Dom João had been acting as regent on behalf of his mother, Queen Maria I, after she was declared incurably insane in 1792. By 1802, Pedro's parents were estranged; João lived in the <a href="Mafra%20National%20Palace">Mafra National Palace</a> and Carlota Joaquina in <a href="Ramalh%C3%A3o%20Palace">Ramalhão Palace</a>. Pedro and his siblings resided in the Queluz Palace with their grandmother Maria I, far from their parents, whom they saw only during state occasions at Queluz.

In late November 1807, when Pedro was nine, <a href="Transfer%20of%20the%20Portuguese%20Court%20to%20Brazil">the royal family escaped from Portugal</a> as an invading French army sent by <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> approached Lisbon. Pedro and his family arrived in <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>, capital of <a href="Colonial%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, then Portugal's largest and wealthiest colony, in March 1808. During the voyage, Pedro read <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" and conversed with the ship's crew, picking up <a href="navigation">navigation</a>al skills. In Brazil, after a brief stay in the <a href="Pa%C3%A7o%20Imperial">City Palace</a>, Pedro settled with his younger brother <a href="Miguel%20I%20of%20Portugal">Miguel</a> and their father in the <a href="Pa%C3%A7o%20de%20S%C3%A3o%20Crist%C3%B3v%C3%A3o">Palace of São Cristóvão</a> (Saint Christopher). Although never on intimate terms with his father, Pedro loved him and resented the constant humiliation his father suffered at the hands of Carlota Joaquina due to her extramarital affairs. As an adult, Pedro would openly call his mother, for whom he held only feelings of contempt, a "bitch". The early experiences of betrayal, coldness and neglect had a great impact on the formation of Pedro's character.

A modicum of stability during his childhood was provided by his "aia" (governess), Maria Genoveva do Rêgo e Matos, whom he loved as a mother, and by his "aio" (supervisor) friar António de Arrábida, who became his mentor. Both were in charge of Pedro's upbringing and attempted to furnish him with a suitable education. His instruction encompassed a broad array of subjects that included mathematics, <a href="political%20economy">political economy</a>, logic, history and geography. He learned to speak and write not only in <a href="Portuguese%20language">Portuguese</a>, but also <a href="Latin">Latin</a> and <a href="French%20language">French</a>. He could translate from <a href="English%20language">English</a> and understood <a href="German%20language">German</a>. Even later on, as an emperor, Pedro would devote at least two hours of each day to study and reading.

Despite the breadth of Pedro's instruction, his education proved lacking. Historian Otávio Tarquínio de Sousa said that Pedro "was without a shadow of doubt intelligent, quick-witted, [and] perspicacious." However, historian Roderick J. Barman relates that he was by nature "too ebullient, too erratic, and too emotional". He remained impulsive and never learned to exercise self-control or to assess the consequences of his decisions and adapt his outlook to changes in situations. His father never allowed anyone to discipline him. While Pedro's schedule dictated two hours of study each day, he sometimes circumvented the routine by dismissing his instructors in favor of activities that he found more interesting.

The prince found fulfillment in activities that required physical skills, rather than in the classroom. At his father's <a href="Santa%20Cruz%20Estate">Santa Cruz farm</a>, Pedro <a href="Horse%20training">trained unbroken horses</a>, and became a fine horseman and an excellent <a href="farrier">farrier</a>. He and his brother Miguel enjoyed mounted hunts over unfamiliar ground, through forests, and even at night or in inclement weather. He displayed a talent for drawing and handicrafts, applying himself to wood carving and furniture making. In addition, he had a taste for music, and under the guidance of <a href="Marcos%20Portugal">Marcos Portugal</a> the prince became an able composer. He had a good singing voice, and was proficient with several musical instruments (including <a href="piano">piano</a>, <a href="flute">flute</a> and <a href="guitar">guitar</a>), playing popular songs and dances. Pedro was a simple man, both in habits and in dealing with others. Except on solemn occasions when he donned court dress, his daily attire consisted of white cotton trousers, striped cotton jacket and a broad-brimmed straw hat, or a frock coat and a top hat in more formal situations. He would frequently take time to engage in conversation with people on the street, noting their concerns.

Pedro's character was marked by an energetic drive that bordered on hyperactivity. He was impetuous with a tendency to be domineering and short-tempered. Easily bored or distracted, in his personal life he entertained himself with dalliances with women in addition to his hunting and equestrian activities. His restless spirit compelled him to search for adventure, and, sometimes in disguise as a traveler, he frequented taverns in Rio de Janeiro's disreputable districts. He rarely drank alcohol, but was an incorrigible womanizer. His earliest known lasting affair was with a French dancer called Noémi Thierry, who had a stillborn child by him. Pedro's father, who had ascended the throne as João VI, sent Thierry away to avoid jeopardizing the prince's betrothal to Archduchess <a href="Maria%20Leopoldina%20of%20Austria">Maria Leopoldina</a>, daughter of Emperor Franz I of Austria (formerly <a href="Francis%20II%2C%20Holy%20Roman%20Emperor">Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor</a>).

On 13 May 1817, Pedro was <a href="proxy%20marriage">married by proxy</a> to Maria Leopoldina. When she arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 5 November, she immediately fell in love with Pedro, who was far more charming and attractive than she had been led to expect. After "years under a tropical sun, his complexion was still light, his cheeks rosy." The 19-year-old prince was handsome and a little above average in height, with bright dark eyes and dark brown hair. "His good appearance", said historian <a href="Neill%20W.%20Macaulay%2C%20Jr.">Neill Macaulay</a>, "owed much to his bearing, proud and erect even at an awkward age, and his grooming, which was impeccable. Habitually neat and clean, he had taken to the Brazilian custom of bathing often." The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy, occurred the following day. Seven children resulted from this marriage: Maria (later Queen Dona <a href="Maria%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Portugal">Maria II of Portugal</a>), <a href="Miguel%2C%20Prince%20of%20Beira">Miguel</a>, <a href="Jo%C3%A3o%20Carlos%2C%20Prince%20of%20Beira">João</a>, <a href="Princess%20Janu%C3%A1ria%20of%20Brazil">Januária</a>, <a href="Princess%20Paula%20of%20Brazil">Paula</a>, <a href="Princess%20Francisca%20of%20Brazil">Francisca</a> and Pedro (later Emperor Dom <a href="Pedro%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BII%20of%20Brazil">Pedro II of Brazil</a>).

On 17 October 1820, news arrived that the military garrisons in Portugal had mutinied, leading to what became known as the <a href="Liberal%20Revolution%20of%201820">Liberal Revolution of 1820</a>. The military formed a provisional government, supplanting the regency appointed by João VI, and summoned the "Cortes"—the centuries-old Portuguese parliament, this time democratically elected with the aim of creating a national Constitution. Pedro was surprised when his father not only asked for his advice, but also decided to send him to Portugal to rule as regent on his behalf and to placate the revolutionaries. The prince was never educated to rule and had previously been allowed no participation in state affairs. The role that was his by birthright was instead filled by his elder sister Dona <a href="Teresa%2C%20Princess%20of%20Beira">Maria Teresa</a>: João VI had relied on her for advice, and it was she who had been given membership in the <a href="privy%20council">Council of State</a>.

Pedro was regarded with suspicion by his father and by the king's close advisers, all of whom clung to the principles of <a href="absolute%20monarchy">absolute monarchy</a>. By contrast, the prince was a well-known, staunch supporter of <a href="liberalism">liberalism</a> and of constitutional representative monarchy. He had read the works of <a href="Voltaire">Voltaire</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20Constant">Benjamin Constant</a>, <a href="Gaetano%20Filangieri">Gaetano Filangieri</a> and <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>. Even his wife Maria Leopoldina remarked, "My husband, God help us, loves the new ideas." João VI postponed Pedro's departure for as long as possible, fearing that once he was in Portugal, he would be acclaimed king by the revolutionaries.

On 26 February 1821, Portuguese troops stationed in Rio de Janeiro mutinied. Neither João VI nor his government made any move against the mutinous units. Pedro decided to act on his own and rode to meet the rebels. He negotiated with them and convinced his father to accept their demands, which included naming a new cabinet and making an oath of obedience to the forthcoming Portuguese Constitution. On 21 April, the parish electors of Rio de Janeiro met at the Merchants' Exchange to elect their representatives to the "Cortes". A small group of agitators seized the meeting and formed a revolutionary government. Again, João VI and his ministers remained passive, and the monarch was about to accept the revolutionaries' demands when Pedro took the initiative and sent army troops to re-establish order. Under pressure from the "Cortes", João VI and his family departed for Portugal on 26 April, leaving behind Pedro and Maria Leopoldina. Two days before he embarked, the King warned his son: "Pedro, if Brazil breaks away, let it rather do so for you, who will respect me, than for one of those adventurers."

At the outset of his regency, Pedro promulgated decrees that guaranteed personal and property rights. He also reduced government expenditure and taxes. Even the revolutionaries arrested in the Merchants' Exchange incident were set free. On 5 June 1821, army troops under Portuguese lieutenant general <a href="Jorge%20Avilez%2C%201st%20Count%20of%20Avilez">Jorge Avilez</a> (later Count of Avilez) mutinied, demanding that Pedro should take an oath to uphold the Portuguese Constitution after it was enacted. The prince rode out alone to intervene with the mutineers. He calmly and resourcefully negotiated, winning the respect of the troops and succeeding in reducing the impact of their more unacceptable demands. The mutiny was a thinly veiled military coup d'état that sought to turn Pedro into a mere figurehead and transfer power to Avilez. The prince accepted the unsatisfactory outcome, but he also warned that it was the last time he would yield under pressure.

The continuing crisis reached a point of no return when the "Cortes" dissolved the central government in Rio de Janeiro and ordered Pedro's return. This was perceived by Brazilians as an attempt to subordinate their country again to Portugal—Brazil had not been a colony since 1815 and had the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20of%20Portugal%2C%20Brazil%20and%20the%20Algarves">status of a kingdom</a>. On 9 January 1822, Pedro was presented with a petition containing 8,000 signatures that begged him not to leave. He replied, "Since it is for the good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell the people that I am staying." Avilez again mutinied and tried to force Pedro's return to Portugal. This time the prince fought back, rallying the Brazilian troops (which had not joined the Portuguese in previous mutinies), militia units and armed civilians. Outnumbered, Avilez surrendered and was expelled from Brazil along with his troops.

During the next few months, Pedro attempted to maintain a semblance of unity with Portugal, but the final rupture was impending. Aided by an able minister, <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bonif%C3%A1cio%20de%20Andrada">José Bonifácio de Andrada</a>, he searched for support outside Rio de Janeiro. The prince traveled to <a href="Minas%20Gerais">Minas Gerais</a> in April and on to <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Paulo%20%28state%29">São Paulo</a> in August. He was welcomed warmly in both Brazilian provinces, and the visits reinforced his authority. While returning from São Paulo, he received news sent on 7 September that the "Cortes" would not accept <a href="self-governance">self-governance</a> in Brazil and would punish all who disobeyed its orders. "Never one to eschew the most dramatic action on the immediate impulse", said Barman about the prince, he "required no more time for decision than the reading of the letters demanded." Pedro mounted his bay mare and, in front of his entourage and his Guard of Honor, said: "Friends, the Portuguese "Cortes" wished to enslave and persecute us. As of today our bonds are ended. By my blood, by my honor, by my God, I swear to bring about the independence of Brazil. Brazilians, let our watchword from this day forth be 'Independence or Death!

The prince was acclaimed Emperor Dom Pedro I on his 24th birthday, which coincided with the inauguration of the <a href="Empire%20of%20Brazil">Empire of Brazil</a> on 12 October. He was <a href="coronations%20in%20the%20Americas%23Brazil">crowned</a> on 1 December in what is today known as the <a href="Old%20Cathedral%20of%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro</a>. His ascendancy did not immediately extend throughout Brazil's territories. He had to force the submission of several provinces in the <a href="North%20Region%2C%20Brazil">northern</a>, <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">northeastern</a> and <a href="South%20Region%2C%20Brazil">southern</a> regions, and the last Portuguese holdout units only surrendered in early 1824. Meanwhile, Pedro I's relationship with Bonifácio deteriorated. The situation came to a head when Pedro I, on the grounds of inappropriate conduct, dismissed Bonifácio. Bonifácio had used his position to harass, prosecute, arrest and even exile his political enemies. For months Bonifácio's enemies had worked to win over the Emperor. While Pedro I was still Prince Regent, they had given him the title "Perpetual Defender of Brazil" on 13 May 1822. They also inducted him into Freemasonry on 2 August and later made him grand master on 7 October, replacing Bonifácio in that position.

The crisis between the monarch and his former minister was felt immediately within the <a href="Constituent%20assembly">Constituent and Legislative General Assembly</a>, which had been elected for the purpose of drafting a Constitution. A member of the Constituent Assembly, Bonifácio resorted to demagoguery, alleging the existence of a major Portuguese conspiracy against Brazilian interests—insinuating that Pedro I, who had been born in Portugal, was implicated. The Emperor became outraged by the invective directed at the loyalty of citizens who were of Portuguese birth and the hints that he was himself conflicted in his allegiance to Brazil. On 12 November 1823, Pedro I ordered the <a href="Dissolution%20of%20parliament">dissolution</a> of the Constituent Assembly and called for new elections. On the following day, he placed a newly established native <a href="Privy%20council">Council of State</a> in charge of composing a constitutional draft. Copies of the draft were sent to all town councils, and the vast majority voted in favor of its instant adoption as the Constitution of the Empire.

As a result of the highly centralized State created by the Constitution, rebellious elements in <a href="Cear%C3%A1">Ceará</a>, <a href="Para%C3%ADba">Paraíba</a> and <a href="Pernambuco">Pernambuco</a> attempted to secede from Brazil and unite in what became known as the <a href="Confederation%20of%20the%20Equator">Confederation of the Equator</a>. Pedro I unsuccessfully sought to avoid bloodshed by offering to placate the rebels. Angry, he said: "What did the insults from Pernambuco require? Surely a punishment, and such a punishment that it will serve as an example for the future." The rebels were never able to secure control over their provinces, and were easily suppressed. By late 1824, the rebellion was over. Sixteen rebels were tried and executed, while all others were pardoned by the Emperor.

After long negotiations, Portugal <a href="Treaty%20of%20Rio%20de%20Janeiro%20%281825%29">signed a treaty</a> with Brazil on 29 August 1825 in which it recognized Brazilian independence. Except for the recognition of independence, the treaty provisions were at Brazil's expense, including a demand for reparations to be paid to Portugal, with no other requirements of Portugal. Compensation was to be paid to all Portuguese citizens residing in Brazil for the losses they had experienced, such as properties which had been confiscated. João VI was also given the right to style himself emperor of Brazil. More humiliating was that the treaty implied that independence had been granted as a beneficent act of João VI, rather than having been compelled by the Brazilians through force of arms. Even worse, Great Britain was rewarded for its role in advancing the negotiations by the signing of a separate treaty in which its favorable commercial rights were renewed and by the signing of a convention in which Brazil agreed to abolish slave trade with Africa within four years. Both accords were severely harmful to Brazilian economic interests.

A few months later, the Emperor received word that his father had died on 10 March 1826, and that he had succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Dom Pedro IV. Aware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations, he hastily abdicated the crown of Portugal on 2 May in favor of his eldest daughter, who became Queen Dona Maria II. His abdication was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and Maria II was to marry his brother Miguel. Regardless of the abdication, Pedro I continued to act as an absentee king of Portugal and interceded in its diplomatic matters, as well as in internal affairs, such as making appointments. He found it difficult, at the very least, to keep his position as Brazilian emperor separate from his obligations to protect his daughter's interests in Portugal.

Miguel feigned compliance with Pedro I's plans. As soon as he was declared regent in early 1828, and backed by Carlota Joaquina, he abrogated the Constitution and, supported by those Portuguese in favor of absolutism, was acclaimed King Dom Miguel I. As painful as was his beloved brother's betrayal, Pedro I also endured the defection of his surviving sisters, <a href="Teresa%2C%20Princess%20of%20Beira">Maria Teresa</a>, <a href="Infanta%20Maria%20Francisca%20of%20Portugal">Maria Francisca</a>, <a href="Infanta%20Isabel%20Maria%20of%20Portugal">Isabel Maria</a> and <a href="Infanta%20Maria%20da%20Assun%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20of%20Portugal">Maria da Assunção</a>, to Miguel I's faction. Only his youngest sister, <a href="Infanta%20Ana%20de%20Jesus%20Maria%20of%20Portugal">Ana de Jesus</a>, remained faithful to him, and she later traveled to Rio de Janeiro to be close to him. Consumed by hatred and beginning to believe rumors that Miguel I had murdered their father, Pedro I turned his focus on Portugal and tried in vain to garner international support for Maria II's rights.

Backed by the <a href="United%20Provinces%20of%20the%20R%C3%ADo%20de%20la%20Plata">United Provinces of the Río de la Plata</a> (present-day <a href="Argentina">Argentina</a>), a small band declared Brazil's southernmost province of <a href="Cisplatina">Cisplatina</a> to be independent in April 1825. The Brazilian government at first perceived the secession attempt as a minor uprising. It took months before a greater threat posed by the involvement of the United Provinces, which expected to annex Cisplatina, caused serious concern. In retaliation, the Empire declared war in December, triggering the <a href="Cisplatine%20War">Cisplatine War</a>. The Emperor traveled to <a href="Bahia">Bahia</a> province (located in <a href="Northeast%20Region%2C%20Brazil">northeastern Brazil</a>) in February 1826, taking along his wife and daughter Maria. The Emperor was warmly welcomed by the inhabitants of Bahia. The trip was planned to generate support for the war-effort.

The imperial entourage included <a href="Domitila%20de%20Castro%2C%20Marchioness%20of%20Santos">Domitila de Castro</a> (then-Viscountess and later Marchioness of Santos), who had been Pedro I's <a href="Royal%20mistress">mistress</a> since their first meeting in 1822. Although he had never been faithful to Maria Leopoldina, he had previously been careful to conceal his sexual escapades with other women. However, his infatuation for his new lover "had become both blatant and limitless", while his wife endured slights and became the object of gossip. Pedro I was increasingly rude and mean toward Maria Leopoldina, left her short of funds, prohibited her from leaving the palace and forced her to endure Domitila's presence as her <a href="lady-in-waiting">lady-in-waiting</a>. In the meantime, his lover took advantage by advancing her interests, as well as those of her family and friends. Those seeking favors or to promote projects increasingly sought her help, bypassing the normal, legal channels.

On 24 November 1826, Pedro I sailed from Rio de Janeiro to <a href="S%C3%A3o%20Jos%C3%A9%2C%20Santa%20Catarina">São José</a> in the province of <a href="Santa%20Catarina%20%28state%29">Santa Catarina</a>. From there he rode to <a href="Porto%20Alegre">Porto Alegre</a>, capital of the province of <a href="Rio%20Grande%20do%20Sul">Rio Grande do Sul</a>, where the main army was stationed. Upon his arrival on 7 December, the Emperor found the military conditions to be much worse than previous reports had led him to expect. He "reacted with his customary energy: he passed a flurry of orders, fired reputed grafters and incompetents, fraternized with the troops, and generally shook up military and civilian administration." He was already on his way back to Rio de Janeiro when he was told that Maria Leopoldina had died following a miscarriage. Unfounded rumors soon spread that purported that she had died after being physically assaulted by Pedro I. Meanwhile, the war continued on with no conclusion in sight. Pedro I relinquished Cisplatina in August 1828, and the province became the independent nation of <a href="Uruguay">Uruguay</a>.

After his wife's death, Pedro I realized how miserably he had treated her, and his relationship with Domitila began to crumble. Maria Leopoldina, unlike his mistress, was popular, honest and loved him without expecting anything in return. The Emperor greatly missed her, and even his obsession with Domitila failed to overcome his sense of loss and regret. One day Domitila found him weeping on the floor and embracing a portrait of his deceased wife, whose sad-looking ghost Pedro I claimed to have seen. Later on, the Emperor left the bed he shared with Domitila and shouted: "Get off of me! I know I live an unworthy life of a sovereign. The thought of the Empress does not leave me." He did not forget his children, orphaned of their mother, and was observed on more than one occasion holding his son, the young Pedro, in his arms and saying: "Poor boy, you are the most unhappy prince in the world."

At the insistence of Pedro I, Domitila departed from Rio de Janeiro on 27 June 1828. He had resolved to marry again and to become a better person. He even tried to persuade his father-in-law of his sincerity, by claiming in a letter "that all my wickedness is over, that I shall not again fall into those errors into which I have fallen, which I regret and have asked God for forgiveness". Franz I was less than convinced. The Austrian emperor, deeply offended by the conduct his daughter endured, withdrew his support for Brazilian concerns and frustrated Pedro I's Portuguese interests. Because of Pedro I's bad reputation in Europe, owing to his past behavior, princesses from several nations declined his proposals of marriage one after another. His pride thus wounded, he allowed his mistress to return, which she did on 29 April 1829 after having been away nearly a year.

However, once he learned that a betrothal had finally been arranged, the Emperor ended his relationship to Domitila. She returned to her native province of São Paulo on 27 August, where she remained. Days earlier, on 2 August, the Emperor had been married by proxy to <a href="Am%C3%A9lie%20of%20Leuchtenberg">Amélie of Leuchtenberg</a>. He was stunned by her beauty after meeting her in person. The vows previously made by proxy were ratified in a Nuptial Mass on 17 October. Amélie was kind and loving to his children and provided a much needed sense of normality to both his family and the general public. After Domitila's banishment from court, the vow the Emperor made to alter his behavior proved to be sincere. He had no more affairs and remained faithful to his spouse. In an attempt to mitigate and move beyond other past misdeeds, he made peace with José Bonifácio, his former minister and mentor.

Since the days of the Constituent Assembly in 1823, and with renewed vigor in 1826 with the opening of the General Assembly (the Brazilian parliament), there had been an ideological struggle over the balance of powers wielded by the emperor and legislature in governance. On one side were those who shared Pedro I's views, politicians who believed that the monarch should be free to choose ministers, national policies and the direction of government. In opposition were those, then known as the Liberal Party, who believed that cabinets should have the power to set the government's course and should consist of deputies drawn from the majority party who were accountable to the parliament. Strictly speaking, both the party that supported Pedro I's government and the Liberal Party advocated <a href="Liberalism">Liberalism</a>, and thus <a href="constitutional%20monarchy">constitutional monarchy</a>.

Regardless of Pedro I's failures as a ruler, he respected the Constitution: he did not tamper with elections or countenance vote rigging, refuse to <a href="Countersign%20%28legal%29">sign</a> acts ratified by the government, or impose any restrictions on freedom of speech. Although within his prerogative, he did not <a href="Dissolution%20of%20parliament">dissolve</a> the Chamber of Deputies and call for new elections when it disagreed with his aims or postpone seating the legislature. Liberal newspapers and pamphlets seized on Pedro I's Portuguese birth in support of both valid accusations (e.g., that much of his energy was directed toward affairs concerning Portugal) and false charges (e.g., that he was involved in plots to suppress the Constitution and to reunite Brazil and Portugal). To the Liberals, the Emperor's Portuguese-born friends who were part of the Imperial court, including <a href="Francisco%20Gomes%20da%20Silva">Francisco Gomes da Silva</a> who was nicknamed "the Buffoon", were part of these conspiracies and formed a "<a href="Shadow%20government%20%28conspiracy%29">secret cabinet</a>". None of these figures exhibited interest in such issues, and whatever interests they may have shared, there was no palace cabal plotting to abrogate the Constitution or to bring Brazil back under Portugal's control.

Another source of criticism by the Liberals involved Pedro I's abolitionist views. The Emperor had indeed conceived a gradual process for eliminating slavery. However, the constitutional power to enact legislation was in the hands of the Assembly, which was dominated by slave-owning landholders who could thus thwart any attempt at abolition. The Emperor opted to try persuasion by moral example, setting up his estate at Santa Cruz as a model by granting land to his freed slaves there. Pedro I also professed other advanced ideas. When he declared his intention to remain in Brazil on 9 January 1822 and the populace sought to accord him the honor of unhitching the horses and pulling his carriage themselves, the then-Prince Regent refused. His reply was a simultaneous denunciation of the <a href="divine%20right%20of%20kings">divine right of kings</a>, of nobility's supposedly superior blood and of racism: "It grieves me to see my fellow humans giving a man tributes appropriate for the divinity, I know that my blood is the same color as that of the Negroes."

The Emperor's efforts to appease the Liberal Party resulted in very important changes. He supported an 1827 law that established <a href="Individual%20ministerial%20responsibility">ministerial responsibility</a>. On 19 March 1831, he named a cabinet formed by politicians drawn from the opposition, allowing a greater role for the parliament in the government. Lastly, he offered positions in Europe to Francisco Gomes and another Portuguese-born friend to extinguish rumors of a "secret cabinet". To his dismay, his palliative measures did not stop the continuous attacks from the Liberal side upon his government and his foreign birth. Frustrated by their intransigence, he became unwilling to deal with his deteriorating political situation.

Meanwhile, Portuguese exiles campaigned to convince him to give up on Brazil and instead devote his energies to the fight for his daughter's claim to Portugal's crown. According to Roderick J. Barman, "[in] an emergency the Emperor's abilities shone forth—he became cool in nerve, resourceful and steadfast in action. Life as a constitutional monarch, full of tedium, caution, and conciliation, ran against the essence of his character." On the other hand, the historian remarked, he "found in his daughter's case everything that appealed most to his character. By going to Portugal he could champion the oppressed, display his chivalry and self-denial, uphold constitutional rule, and enjoy the freedom of action he craved."

The idea of abdicating and returning to Portugal took root in his mind, and, beginning in early 1829, he talked about it frequently. An opportunity soon appeared to act upon the notion. Radicals within the Liberal Party rallied street gangs to harass the Portuguese community in Rio de Janeiro. On 11 March 1831, in what became known as the ""noite das garrafadas"" (night of the broken bottles), the Portuguese retaliated and turmoil gripped the streets of the national capital. On 5 April, Pedro I fired the Liberal cabinet, which had only been in power since 19 March, for its incompetence in restoring order. A large crowd, incited by the radicals, gathered in Rio de Janeiro downtown on the afternoon of 6 April and demanded the immediate restoration of the fallen cabinet. The Emperor's reply was: "I will do everything for the people and nothing [compelled] by the people." Sometime after nightfall, army troops, including his guard, deserted him and joined the protests. Only then did he realize how isolated and detached from Brazilian affairs he had become, and to everyone's surprise, he abdicated at approximately 03:00 on 7 April. Upon delivering the abdication document to a messenger, he said: "Here you have my act of abdication, I'm returning to Europe and leaving a country that I loved very much, and still love."

At dawn on the morning of 7 April, Pedro, his wife, and others, including his daughter Maria II and his sister Ana de Jesus, were taken on board the British warship <a href="HMS%20Warspite%20%281807%29">HMS "Warspite"</a>. The vessel remained at anchor off Rio de Janeiro, and, on 13 April, the former emperor transferred to and departed for Europe aboard <a href="HMS%20Volage%20%281825%29">HMS "Volage"</a>. He arrived in <a href="Cherbourg-Octeville">Cherbourg-Octeville</a>, France, on 10 June. During the next few months, he shuttled between France and Great Britain. He was warmly welcomed by, but received no actual support from, either government. Finding himself in an awkward situation because he held no official status in either the Brazilian Imperial House or in the Portuguese Royal House, Pedro assumed the title of <a href="Duke%20of%20Braganza">Duke of Braganza</a> on 15 June, a position that once had been his as heir to Portugal's crown. Although the title should have belonged to Maria II's heir, which he certainly was not, his claim was met with general recognition. On 1 December, his only daughter by Amélie, <a href="Princess%20Maria%20Am%C3%A9lia%20of%20Brazil">Maria Amélia</a>, was born in Paris.

He did not forget his children left in Brazil. He wrote poignant letters to each of them, conveying how greatly he missed them and repeatedly asking them to seriously attend to their educations. Shortly before his abdication, Pedro had told his son and successor: "I intend that my brother Miguel and I will be the last badly educated of the Braganza family". <a href="Charles%20Napier%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Charles Napier</a>, a naval commander who fought under Pedro's banner in the 1830s, remarked that "his good qualities were his own; his bad owing to want of education; and no man was more sensible of that defect than himself." His letters to Pedro II were often couched in language beyond the boy's reading level, and historians have assumed such passages were chiefly intended as advice that the young monarch might eventually consult upon reaching adulthood.

While in Paris, the Duke of Braganza met and befriended <a href="Gilbert%20du%20Motier%2C%20marquis%20de%20Lafayette">Gilbert du Motier, Marquis of Lafayette</a>, a veteran of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a> who became one of his staunchest supporters. Pedro bade farewell to his family, Lafayette and around two hundred well-wishers on 25 January 1832. He knelt before Maria II and said: "My lady, here is a Portuguese general who will uphold your rights and restore your crown." In tears, his daughter embraced him. Pedro sailed to the Atlantic archipelago of the <a href="Azores">Azores</a>, the only Portuguese territory that had remained loyal to his daughter. After a few months of final preparations he embarked for mainland Portugal, entering the city of <a href="Porto">Porto</a> unopposed on 9 July. He came at the head of a small army composed of Portuguese liberals, such as <a href="Almeida%20Garrett">Almeida Garrett</a> and <a href="Alexandre%20Herculano">Alexandre Herculano</a>, as well as foreign mercenaries and volunteers such as Lafayette's grandson, Adrien Jules de Lasteyrie.

Severely outnumbered, Pedro's army of liberals was <a href="siege%20of%20Porto">besieged in Porto</a> for more than a year. There, in early 1833, he received news from Brazil of his daughter <a href="Princess%20Paula%20of%20Brazil">Paula</a>'s impending death. Months later, in September, he met with <a href="Ant%C3%B4nio%20Carlos%20de%20Andrada">Antônio Carlos de Andrada</a>, a brother of Bonifácio who had come from Brazil. As a representative of the Restorationist Party, Antônio Carlos asked the Duke of Braganza to return to Brazil and rule his former empire as regent during his son's minority. Pedro realized that the Restorationists wanted to use him as a tool to facilitate their own rise to power, and frustrated Antônio Carlos by making almost impossible demands, to ascertain whether the Brazilian people, and not merely a faction, truly wanted him back. He insisted that any request to return as regent be constitutionally valid. The people's will would have to be conveyed through their local representatives and his appointment approved by the General Assembly. Only then, and "upon the presentation of a petition to him in Portugal by an official delegation of the Brazilian parliament" would he consider accepting.

During the war, the Duke of Braganza mounted cannons, dug trenches, tended the wounded, ate among the rank and file and fought under heavy fire as men next to him were shot or blown to pieces. His cause was nearly lost until he took the risky step of dividing his forces and sending a portion to launch an <a href="amphibious%20attack">amphibious attack</a> on southern Portugal. The <a href="Algarve">Algarve</a> region fell to the expedition, which then marched north straight for Lisbon, which capitulated on 24 July. Pedro proceeded to subdue the remainder of the country, but just when the conflict looked to be winding down to a conclusion, his Spanish uncle Don <a href="Infante%20Carlos%2C%20Count%20of%20Molina">Carlos</a>, who was attempting to seize the crown of his niece Doña <a href="Isabella%20II%20of%20Spain">Isabel II</a>, intervened. In this wider conflict that engulfed the entire <a href="Iberian%20Peninsula">Iberian Peninsula</a>, the <a href="First%20Carlist%20War">First Carlist War</a>, the Duke of Braganza allied with liberal Spanish armies loyal to Isabel II and defeated both Miguel I and Carlos. A <a href="Concession%20of%20Evoramonte">peace accord was reached</a> on 26 May 1834.

Except for bouts of <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a> that manifested in <a href="Epileptic%20seizure">seizures</a> every few years, Pedro had always enjoyed robust health. The war, however, undermined his constitution and by 1834 he was dying of <a href="tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a>. He was confined to his bed in Queluz Royal Palace from 10 September. Pedro dictated an open letter to the Brazilians, in which he begged that a gradual abolition of slavery be adopted. He warned them: "Slavery is an evil, and an attack against the rights and dignity of the human species, but its consequences are less harmful to those who suffer in captivity than to the Nation whose laws allow slavery. It is a cancer that devours its morality." After a long and painful illness, Pedro died at 14:30 on 24 September 1834. As he had requested, his heart was placed in Porto's Lapa Church and his body was interred in the <a href="Royal%20Pantheon%20of%20the%20House%20of%20Braganza">Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza</a>. The news of his death arrived in Rio de Janeiro on 20 November, but his children were informed only after 2 December. Bonifácio, who had been removed from his position as their guardian, wrote to Pedro II and his sisters: "Dom Pedro did not die. Only ordinary men die, not heroes."

Upon the death of Pedro I, the then-powerful Restorationist Party vanished overnight. A fair assessment of the former monarch became possible once the threat of his return to power was removed. <a href="Evaristo%20da%20Veiga">Evaristo da Veiga</a>, one of his worst critics as well as a leader in the Liberal Party, left a statement which, according to historian Otávio Tarquínio de Sousa, became the prevailing view thereafter: "the former emperor of Brazil was not a prince of ordinary measure ... and Providence has made him a powerful instrument of liberation, both in Brazil and in Portugal. If we [Brazilians] exist as a body in a free Nation, if our land was not ripped apart into small enemy republics, where only anarchy and military spirit predominated, we owe much to the resolution he took in remaining among us, in making the first shout for our Independence." He continued: "Portugal, if it was freed from the darkest and demeaning tyranny ... if it enjoys the benefits brought by representative government to learned peoples, it owes it to D[om]. Pedro de Alcântara, whose fatigues, sufferings and sacrifices for the Portuguese cause has earned him in high degree the tribute of national gratitude."

John Armitage, who lived in Brazil during the latter half of Pedro I's reign, remarked that "even the errors of the Monarch have been attended with great benefit through their influence on the affairs of the mother country. Had he governed with more wisdom it would have been well for the land of his adoption, yet, perhaps, unfortunate for humanity." Armitage added that like "the <a href="Napoleon">late Emperor of the French</a>, he was also a child of destiny, or rather, an instrument in the hands of an all-seeing and beneficent Providence for the furtherance of great and inscrutable ends. In the old as in the new world he was henceforth fated to become the instrument of further revolutions, and ere the close of his brilliant but ephemeral career in the land of his fathers, to atone amply for the errors and follies of his former life, by his chivalrous and heroic devotion in the cause of civil and religious freedom."

In 1972, on the 150th anniversary of Brazilian independence, Pedro I's remains (though not his heart) were brought to Brazil—as he had requested in his will—accompanied by much fanfare and with honors due to a head of state. His remains were reinterred in the <a href="Monument%20to%20the%20Independence%20of%20Brazil">Monument to the Independence of Brazil</a>, along with those of Maria Leopoldina and Amélie, in the city of São Paulo. Years later, <a href="Neill%20W.%20Macaulay%2C%20Jr.">Neill Macaulay</a> said that "[c]riticism of Dom Pedro was freely expressed and often vehement; it prompted him to abdicate two thrones. His tolerance of public criticism and his willingness to relinquish power set Dom Pedro apart from his absolutist predecessors and from the rulers of today's coercive states, whose lifetime tenure is as secure as that of the kings of old." Macaulay affirmed that "[s]uccessful liberal leaders like Dom Pedro may be honored with an occasional stone or bronze monument, but their portraits, four stories high, do not shape public buildings; their pictures are not borne in parades of hundreds of thousands of uniformed marchers; no '-isms' attach to their names."

Epaminondas

Epaminondas (; , "Epameinondas"; d. 362 BC) was a <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Theban</a> <a href="General%20officer">general</a> and statesman of the 4th century BC who transformed the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">Ancient Greek</a> <a href="polis">city-state</a> of <a href="Thebes%2C%20Greece">Thebes</a>, leading it out of <a href="Sparta">Sparta</a>n subjugation into a pre-eminent position in Greek politics. In the process he broke Spartan military power with his victory at <a href="Battle%20of%20Leuctra">Leuctra</a> and liberated the <a href="Messenia">Messenia</a>n <a href="helots">helots</a>, a group of <a href="Peloponnesia">Peloponnesia</a>n Greeks who had been enslaved under Spartan rule for some 230 years after being defeated in the Messenian War ending in 600 BC. Epaminondas reshaped the political map of Greece, fragmented old alliances, created new ones, and supervised the construction of entire cities. He was also militarily influential and invented and implemented several major battlefield tactics.

<a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> called him "the first man of Greece", and <a href="Montaigne">Montaigne</a> judged him one of the three "worthiest and most excellent men" that had ever lived, but Epaminondas has fallen into relative obscurity in modern times. The changes Epaminondas wrought on the Greek political order did not long outlive him, as the cycle of shifting hegemonies and alliances continued unabated. A mere twenty-seven years after his death, a recalcitrant Thebes was obliterated by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>. Thus Epaminondas—who had been praised in his time as an idealist and liberator—is today largely remembered for a decade (371 BC to 362 BC) of campaigning that sapped the strength of the great <a href="city-state">city-state</a>s and paved the way for the <a href="Macedon">Macedon</a>ian conquest.

The life of Epaminondas is very poorly attested in the ancient sources, especially compared to some of his near contemporaries (e.g. <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II of Macedon</a>, <a href="Pelopidas">Pelopidas</a>). One principal reason for this is the <a href="Lost%20works">loss</a> of Plutarch's biography of him. Epaminondas was one of approximately 50 ancient figures given an extensive biography by <a href="Plutarch">Plutarch</a> in his "<a href="Parallel%20Lives">Parallel Lives</a>", in which he is paired with the Roman statesman <a href="Scipio%20Africanus">Scipio Africanus</a>; however, both these ""Lives"" are now lost. Plutarch was writing over 400 years after Epaminondas's death and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements.

Some episodes of Epaminondas's life can be found in Plutarch's ""Lives"" of Pelopidas and <a href="Agesilaus%20II">Agesilaus II</a>, who were contemporaries. There is also a surviving (and possibly abridged) biography of Epaminondas by the Roman author <a href="Cornelius%20Nepos">Cornelius Nepos</a> from the first century BC which, in the absence of Plutarch's, becomes a major source for Epaminondas's life.

The period of Greek history from 411–362 BC is primarily attested by the historian <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, who evidently saw his work as continuation of <a href="Thucydides">Thucydides</a>'s "<a href="History%20of%20the%20Peloponnesian%20War">History of the Peloponnesian War</a>". <a href="Xenophon">Xenophon</a>, who idolized Sparta and its king, Agesilaus, avoids mentioning Epaminondas wherever possible and does not even note his presence at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Leuctra">Battle of Leuctra</a>. Epaminondas's role in the conflicts of the 4th century is also described by <a href="Diodorus%20Siculus">Diodorus Siculus</a>, in his "<a href="Bibliotheca%20historica">Bibliotheca historica</a>". Diodorus was writing in the 1st century BC, and is also very much a secondary source, though useful for corroborating details found elsewhere.

Epaminondas was born into the Theban aristocracy in the late 5th century BC; estimates for the year of his birth vary widely. Cornelius Nepos claims that his father, Polymnis, had been left impoverished by his ancestors. He was educated in his childhood by <a href="Lysis%20of%20Tarentum">Lysis of Tarentum</a>, one of the last major <a href="Pythagoreans">Pythagorean</a> philosophers. Epaminondas excelled as a student, and was devoted to Lysis. Nepos also tells us that the young Epaminondas worked hard to increase his physical prowess, and specifically his agility, since "he thought that strength suited the purposes of wrestlers, but that agility conduced to excellence in war." He also trained in running and wrestling, but most of all, he undertook "martial exercises" (presumably training with weapons).

Epaminondas began serving as a soldier after adolescence; Plutarch refers to an incident involving Epaminondas that occurred during a battle at <a href="Mantinea">Mantinea</a>. Though not explicitly stated, this was probably the Spartan attack on Mantinea in 385 BC, as described by Xenophon; Plutarch tells us that Epaminondas was there as part of a Theban force aiding the Spartans, so this battle fits the description. Epaminondas was certainly not old enough to have served at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mantinea%20%28418%20BC%29">First Battle of Mantinea</a> which was in 418 BC.

It was at this battle, regardless of exactly when and where this occurred, that a defining moment of Epaminondas's early life would happen. Epaminondas saved the life of his fellow Theban <a href="Pelopidas">Pelopidas</a>; Pelopidas, after receiving seven wounds in front, sank down upon a great heap of friends and enemies who lay dead together; but Epaminondas, although he thought him lifeless, stood forth to defend his body and his arms, and fought desperately, single-handed against many, determined to die rather than leave Pelopidas lying there. And now he too was in a sorry plight, having been wounded in the breast with a spear and in the arm with a sword, when <a href="Agesipolis%20I">Agesipolis</a> the Spartan king came to his aid from the other wing, and when all hope was lost, saved them both. Plutarch says that this incident firmly cemented their friendship, and Pelopidas would be Epaminondas's partner in politics for the next twenty years.

Epaminondas was considered the greatest warrior-statesmen of ancient Thebes by many, including the Roman historian Diodorus Siculus. Diodorus does not have anything to say about the sexual orientation of Epaminondas or the <a href="Sacred%20Band%20of%20Thebes">Sacred Band</a>, nor does he say anything about the following account, again from Plutarch (Amatorius 17). According to Plutarch's dramatic dialogue, Epaminondas had two male lovers: Asopichus and Caphisodorus; the latter died with him at Mantineia in battle. They were buried together, something usually reserved for a husband and wife in Greek society.

Epaminondas lived at a particularly turbulent point in Greek history. Following the end of the <a href="Peloponnesian%20War">Peloponnesian War</a> in 404 BC, Sparta had embarked upon an aggressively <a href="unilateral">unilateral</a>ist policy towards the rest of Greece and quickly alienated many of its former allies. Thebes, meanwhile, had greatly increased its own power during the war and sought to gain control of the other cities of <a href="Boeotia">Boeotia</a> (the region of ancient Greece northwest of Attica). This policy, along with other disputes, brought Thebes into conflict with Sparta. By 395 BC, Thebes, alongside <a href="Athens">Athens</a>, <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>, and <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, found itself arrayed against Sparta (a former ally) in the <a href="Corinthian%20War">Corinthian War</a>. That war, which dragged on inconclusively for eight years, saw several bloody Theban defeats at Spartan hands. By the time of its conclusion, Thebes had been forced to check its expansionist ambitions and return to its old alliance with Sparta.

In 382 BC, however, the Spartan commander <a href="Phoebidas">Phoebidas</a> committed an act that would ultimately turn Thebes against Sparta for good and pave the way for Epaminondas's rise to power. Passing through Boeotia on campaign, Phoebidas took advantage of civil strife within Thebes to secure entrance to the city for his troops. Once inside, he seized the <a href="Cadmeia">Cadmeia</a> (the Theban <a href="acropolis">acropolis</a>), and forced the anti-Spartan party to flee the city. Epaminondas, although associated with that faction, was allowed to remain; since "his philosophy made him to be looked down upon as a recluse, and his poverty as impotent". The Spartans installed a puppet government in Thebes, and garrisoned the Cadmeia to ensure the behaviour of the Thebans.

In the years following the Spartan takeover, the exiled Thebans regrouped in Athens and, at the instigation of Pelopidas, prepared to liberate their city. Meanwhile, in Thebes, Epaminondas began preparing the young men of the city to fight the Spartans. In the winter of 379 BC, a small group of the exiles, led by Pelopidas, infiltrated the city. They then assassinated the leaders of the pro-Spartan government, and supported by Epaminondas and <a href="Gorgidas">Gorgidas</a>, who led a group of young men, and a force of Athenian <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a>s, they surrounded the Spartans on the Cadmeia. The following day, Epaminondas and Gorgidas brought Pelopidas and his men before the Theban assembly and exhorted the Thebans to fight for their freedom; the assembly responded by acclaiming Pelopidas and his men as liberators. The Cadmeia was surrounded, and the Spartans attacked; Pelopidas realised that they must be expelled before an army came from Sparta to relieve them. The Spartan garrison eventually surrendered on the condition that they were allowed to march away unharmed. The narrow margin of the conspirators' success is demonstrated by the fact that the Spartan garrison met a Spartan force on the way to rescue them as they marched back to Sparta. Plutarch portrays the Theban coup as an immensely significant event: ...the subsequent change in the political situation made this exploit the more glorious. For the war which broke down the pretensions of Sparta and put an end to her supremacy by land and sea, began from that night, in which people, not by surprising any fort or castle or citadel, but by coming into a private house with eleven others, loosed and broke in pieces, if the truth may be expressed in a metaphor, the fetters of the Lacedaemonian supremacy, which were thought indissoluble and not to be broken.

When news of the uprising at Thebes reached Sparta, an army under <a href="Cleombrotus%20I">Cleombrotus I</a> had been dispatched to subdue the city, but turned back without engaging the Thebans. Another army under <a href="Agesilaus%20II">Agesilaus II</a> was then dispatched to attack the Thebans. However, the Thebans refused to meet the Spartan army in battle, instead building a trench and stockade outside Thebes, which they occupied, preventing the Spartans advancing on the city. The Spartans ravaged the countryside but eventually departed, leaving Thebes independent. This victory so heartened the Thebans that they undertook operations against other neighboring cities as well. In short order the Thebans were able to reconstitute their old Boeotian confederacy in a new, democratic form. The cities of Boeotia united as a federation with an executive body composed of seven generals, or <a href="Boeotarch">Boeotarch</a>s, elected from seven districts throughout Boeotia. This political fusion was so successful that henceforth the names "Theban" and "Boeotian" were used interchangeably in a nod to the newfound solidarity of the region.

Seeking to crush the Thebans, the Spartans would invade Boeotia three times over the next few years (378, 377, ? possibly Leuctra). At first the Thebans feared facing the Spartans head on, but the conflict gave them much practice and training, and they "had their spirits roused and their bodies thoroughly inured to hardships, and gained experience and courage from their constant struggles". Although Sparta remained the dominant land power in Greece, the Boeotians had demonstrated that they, too, were a martial threat and a politically cohesive power. At the same time, Pelopidas, an advocate of an aggressive policy against Sparta, had established himself as a major political leader in Thebes.

Epaminondas's role in the years to 371 BC is difficult to piece together. Certainly, he served with the Theban armies in the defence of Boeotia in the 370s, and, by 371 BC, he had become a Boeotarch. It seems safe to assume, given their close friendship, and their close collaboration after 371 BC, that Epaminondas and Pelopidas also collaborated closely on Theban policy in the period 378–371 BC.

The years following the Theban coup had seen desultory fighting between Sparta and Thebes, with Athens also drawn into the conflict. A feeble attempt at a common peace had been made in 375 BC, but desultory fighting between Athens and Sparta had resumed by 373 BC (at the latest). By 371 BC, Athens and Sparta were again war-weary, and in 371 BC a conference was held at Sparta to discuss another attempt at a common peace.

Epaminondas was serving as a Boeotarch for 371 BC, and led the Boeotian delegation to the peace conference. Peace terms were agreed at the outset of the conference, and the Thebans presumably signed the treaty in their own name alone. However, on the following day, Epaminondas caused a drastic break with Sparta when he insisted on signing not for the Thebans alone, but for all the Boeotians. Agesilaus refused to allow the change of the Theban envoys' signature, insisting that the cities of Boeotia should be independent; Epaminondas countered that if this were to be the case, the cities of <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a> should be as well. Irate, Agesilaus struck the Thebans from the document. The delegation returned to Thebes, and both sides mobilized for war.

Immediately following the failure of the peace talks, orders were sent out from Sparta to the Spartan king Cleombrotus, who was at the head of an army in <a href="Phocis">Phocis</a>, commanding him to march directly to Boeotia. Skirting north to avoid mountain passes where the Boeotians were prepared to ambush him, Cleombrotus entered Boeotian territory from an unexpected direction and quickly seized a fort and captured 10 or 12 <a href="trireme">trireme</a>s. Then marching towards Thebes, he camped at <a href="Leuctra">Leuctra</a>, in the territory of <a href="Thespiae">Thespiae</a>. Here, the Boeotian army came to meet him. The Spartan army contained some 10,000 <a href="hoplite">hoplite</a>s, 700 of whom were the elite warriors known as <a href="Spartiate">Spartiate</a>s. The Boeotians opposite them numbered about 6,000, but were bolstered by a cavalry superior to that of the Peloponnesians.

Epaminondas was given charge of the Boeotian army, with the other six Boeotarchs in an advisory capacity. Pelopidas, meanwhile, was captain of the <a href="Sacred%20Band%20of%20Thebes">Sacred Band</a>, the elite Theban troops. Before the battle, there was evidently much debate amongst the Boeotarchs about whether to fight or not. As a consistent advocate of an aggressive policy, Epaminondas wished to fight, and supported by Pelopidas, he managed to swing the vote in favour of battle. During the course of the battle, Epaminondas was to display a grasp of tactics hitherto unseen in Greek warfare.

The <a href="phalanx%20formation">phalanx formation</a> used by Greek armies had a distinct tendency to veer to the right during battle, "because fear makes each man do his best to shelter his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on the right". Traditionally, a phalanx therefore lined up for battle with the elite troops on the right flank to counter this tendency. Thus, in the Spartan phalanx at Leuctra, Cleombrotus and the elite '<a href="Spartiate">Spartiate</a>s' were on the right, while the less experienced Peloponnesian allies were on the left. However, needing to counter the Spartans' numerical advantage, Epaminondas implemented two tactical innovations. Firstly, he took the best troops in the army, and arranged them 50 ranks deep (as opposed to the normal 8–12 ranks) on the "left" wing, opposite Cleombrotus and the Spartans, with Pelopidas and the Sacred Band on the extreme left flank. Secondly, recognizing, that he could not have matched the width of the Peloponnesian phalanx (even before the deepening the left flank), he abandoned all attempts to do so. Instead, placing the weaker troops on the right flank, he "instructed them to avoid battle and withdraw gradually during the enemy's attack". The tactic of the deep phalanx had been anticipated by <a href="Pagondas">Pagondas</a>, another Theban general, who used a 25 man deep formation at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Delium">Battle of Delium</a>. However, the reversing of the position of the elite troops, and an oblique line of attack were innovations; it seems that Epaminondas was therefore responsible for the military tactic of refusing one's flank.

The fighting at Leuctra opened with a clash between the cavalry, in which the Thebans were victorious over the inferior Spartan cavalry, driving them back into the ranks of the infantry, and thereby disrupting the phalanx. The battle then became general, with the strengthened Theban left flank marching to attack at double speed, while the right flank retreated. After intense fighting, the Spartan right flank began to give way under the impetus of the mass of Thebans, and Cleombrotus was killed. Although the Spartans held on for long enough to rescue the body of the king, their line was soon broken by the sheer force of the Theban assault. The Peloponnesian allies on the left wing, seeing the Spartans put to flight, also broke and ran, and the entire army retreated in disarray. One thousand Peloponnesians were killed, while the Boeotians lost only 300 men. Most importantly, since it constituted a significant proportion of the entire Spartan manpower, 400 of the 700 Spartiates present were killed, a loss that posed a serious threat to Sparta's future war-making abilities. When, after the battle, the Spartans asked if they and the Peloponnesians could collect the dead, Epaminondas suspected that the Spartans would try to cover-up the scale of their losses. He therefore allowed the Peloponnesians to remove their dead first, so that those remaining would be shown to be Spartiates, and emphasise the scale of the Theban victory.

The victory at Leuctra shook the foundations of the <a href="Spartan%20hegemony">Spartan dominance</a> of Greece to the core. Since the number of <a href="Spartiates">Spartiates</a> was always relatively small, Sparta had relied on her allies in order to field substantial armies. However, with the defeat at Leuctra, the Peloponnesian allies were less inclined to bow to Spartan demands. Furthermore, with the loss of men at Leuctra and other battles, the Spartans were not in a strong position to reassert their dominance over their erstwhile allies.

In the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans considered following up their victory by taking their vengeance on Sparta; they also invited Athens to join them in doing so. However, their Thessalian allies under <a href="Jason%20of%20Pherae">Jason of Pherae</a> dissuaded them from shattering what remained of the Spartan army. Instead, Epaminondas occupied himself with consolidating the Boeotian confederacy, compelling the previously Spartan-aligned polis of <a href="Orchomenus%20%28Boeotia%29">Orchomenus</a> to join the league.

The following year the Thebans invaded the Peloponnesus, aiming to break Spartan power for good. It is not clear exactly when the Thebans started to think not just of ending the Spartan hegemony, but of replacing it with <a href="Theban%20hegemony">one of their own</a>, but it is clear that eventually this became their aim. Hans Beck asserts that, unlike Sparta in the Peloponnesian League and Athens in the <a href="Delian%20League">Delian League</a>, Thebes made no effort either to create an empire or to bind its allies in any sort of permanent and stable organization. Indeed, after Leuctra Thebes devoted its attention to diplomatic efforts in Central Greece rather than schemes of domination further afield. By late 370 Thebes' network of alliances in central Greece made her secure in the area—as she had not been before Leuctra—and offered scope for further expansion of Theban influence.

When, in the immediate aftermath of Leuctra, the Thebans had sent a herald to Athens with news of their victory, the messenger was met with stony silence. The Athenians then decided to take advantage of the Spartan discomfiture, holding a conference in Athens, in which the peace terms proposed earlier in 371 BC were ratified by all cities (except <a href="Elis">Elis</a>); and this time, the treaty explicitly made the Peloponnesian cities, formerly under Spartan dominance, independent. Taking advantage of this, the <a href="Mantinea">Mantinea</a>ns decided to unify their settlements into a single city, and to fortify it; a decision which greatly angered Agesilaus. Furthermore, <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a>, supported by Mantinea, instigated the formation of an <a href="Arcadia">Arcadia</a>n alliance. This led to the Spartans declaring war on Mantinea, whereupon the majority of Arcadian cities grouped together to oppose the Spartans (thus forming the confederation that the Spartans were trying to prevent), and requested assistance from the Thebans. The Theban force arrived late in 370 BC, and it was led by Epaminondas and Pelopidas, both at this time Boeotarchs. As they journeyed into Arcadia, the Thebans were joined by armed contingents from many of Sparta's former allies, swelling their forces to some 50–70,000 men. In Arcadia Epaminondas encouraged the Arcadians to form their proposed league, and to build the new city of <a href="Megalopolis%2C%20Greece">Megalopolis</a> (as a center of power opposed to Sparta).

Epaminondas, supported by Pelopidas and the Arcadians, then persuaded the other Boeotarchs to invade <a href="Laconia">Laconia</a> itself. Moving south, they crossed the <a href="Evrotas%20River">Evrotas River</a>, the frontier of Sparta, which no hostile army had breached in memory. The Spartans, unwilling to engage the massive army in battle, simply defended their city, which the Thebans did not attempt to capture. The Thebans and their allies ravaged Laconia, down to the port of <a href="Gythium">Gythium</a>, freeing some of the Lacedaemonian <a href="perioeci">perioeci</a> from their allegiance to Sparta. Epaminondas briefly returned to Arcadia, before marching south again, this time to <a href="Messenia">Messenia</a>, a region which the Spartans had conquered some 200 years before. Epaminondas freed the helots of Messenia, and rebuilt the ancient city of <a href="Messene">Messene</a> on Mount <a href="Ithome">Ithome</a>, with fortifications that were among the strongest in Greece. He then issued a call to Messenian exiles all over Greece to return and rebuild their homeland. The loss of Messenia was particularly damaging to the Spartans, since the territory comprised one-third of Sparta's territory and contained half of their <a href="helots">helot</a> population. The helots' labor allowed the Spartans to become a "full-time" army.

Epaminondas' campaign of 370/369 has been described as an example of "the grand strategy of indirect approach", which was aimed at severing "the economic roots of her [Sparta's] military supremacy." In mere months, Epaminondas had created two new enemy states that opposed Sparta, shaken the foundations of Sparta's economy, and all but devastated Sparta's prestige. This accomplished, he led his army back home, victorious.

In order to accomplish all that he wished in the Peloponnesus, Epaminondas had persuaded his fellow Boeotarchs to remain in the field for several months after their term of office had expired. Upon his return home, Epaminondas was therefore greeted not with a hero's welcome but with a trial arranged by his political enemies. According to Cornelius Nepos, in his defense Epaminondas merely requested that, if he be executed, the inscription regarding the verdict read: Epaminondas was punished by the Thebans with death, because he obliged them to overthrow the Lacedaemonians at Leuctra, whom, before he was general, none of the Boeotians durst look upon in the field, and because he not only, by one battle, rescued Thebes from destruction, but also secured liberty for all Greece, and brought the power of both people to such a condition, that the Thebans attacked Sparta, and the Lacedaemonians were content if they could save their lives; nor did he cease to prosecute the war, till, after settling Messene, he shut up Sparta with a close siege. The jury broke into laughter, the charges were dropped, and Epaminondas was re-elected as Boeotarch for the next year.

In 369 BC the Argives, Eleans and the Arcadians, eager to continue their war against Sparta, recalled the Thebans to their support. Epaminondas, at the height of his prestige, again commanded an allied invasion force. Arriving at the Isthmus of Corinth, the Thebans found it heavily guarded by the Spartans and Athenians (along with the <a href="Corinth">Corinth</a>ians, <a href="Megara">Megara</a>ns and <a href="Pellene">Pellenians</a>). Epaminondas decided to attack the weakest spot, guarded by the Lacedaemonians; in a dawn attack he forced his way through the Spartan position, and joined his Peloponnesian allies. The Thebans thus won an easy victory and crossed the Isthmus. Diodorus stresses that this was "a feat no whit inferior to his former mighty deeds".

However, the rest of the expedition achieved little: Sicyon and Pellene became allied to Thebes, and the countryside of <a href="Troezen">Troezen</a> and <a href="Epidaurus">Epidaurus</a> was ravaged, but the cities could not be taken. After an abortive attack on Corinth and the arrival of a task force sent by <a href="Dionysius%20I%20of%20Syracuse">Dionysius of Syracuse</a> to aid Sparta, the Thebans decided to march home.

When Epaminondas returned to Thebes, he continued to be dogged by his political enemies who prosecuted him for the second time. They actually succeeded in excluding him from the office of Boeotarch for the year 368 BC. This was the only time from the Battle of Leuctra until his death that he did not serve as Boeotarch. In 368, the Theban army marched into Thessaly to rescue Pelopidas and Ismenias, who had been imprisoned by <a href="Alexander%20of%20Pherae">Alexander of Pherae</a> while serving as ambassadors. The Theban force not only failed to overcome Alexander and his allies, but got into serious difficulties, when it tried to withdraw; Epaminondas, serving as a private soldier, succeeded in extricating it. In early 367, Epaminondas led a second Theban expedition to free Pelopidas, and Ismenias. He finally outmanoeuvred the Thessalians, and secured the release of the two Theban ambassadors without a fight.

In the spring of 367 BC, Epaminondas again invaded the Peloponnesus. This time an Argive army captured part of the Isthmus on Epaminondas's request, allowing the Theban army to enter the Peloponnesus unhindered. On this occasion, Epaminondas marched to <a href="Achaea%20%28ancient%20region%29">Achaea</a>, seeking to secure their allegiance to Thebes. No army dared to challenge him in the field, and the Achaean oligarchies therefore acquiesced to the request that they be allied to Thebes. Epaminondas' acceptance of the Achaean oligarchies roused protests by both the Arcadians and his political rivals, and his settlement was thus shortly reversed: democracies were set up, and the oligarchs exiled. These democratic governments were short-lived, since the pro-Spartan aristocrats from all the cities banded together and attacked each city in turn, re-establishing the oligarchies. According to G.L. Cawkwell, "the sequel perhaps showed the good sense of Epaminondas. When these exiles recovered the cities, they 'no longer took a middle course'." In the light of their treatment by Thebes, they abandoned their previously neutral stance, and thereafter "fought zealously in support of the Lacedaemonians".

In 366/365 BC an attempt was made to make a common peace, with the Persian King <a href="Artaxerxes%20II">Artaxerxes II</a> as arbiter and guarantor. Thebes organized a conference to have the terms of the peace accepted, but their diplomatic initiative failed: the negotiations could not resolve the hostility between Thebes and other states that resented its influence (such as the Arcadian leader Lycomedes who challenged the right of the Thebans to hold the congress in Thebes); the peace was never fully accepted, and fighting soon resumed.

Throughout the decade after the Battle of Leuctra, numerous former allies of Thebes defected to the Spartan alliance or even to alliances with other hostile states. By the middle of the next decade, even some Arcadians (whose league Epaminondas had helped establish in 369 BC) had turned against them. At the same time, however, Epaminondas managed through a series of diplomatic efforts to dismantle the Peloponnesian league: the remaining members of the league finally abandoned Sparta (in 365 Corinth, <a href="Epidaurus">Epidaurus</a>, and <a href="Phlius">Phlius</a> made peace with Thebes and Argos), and Messenia remained independent and firmly loyal to Thebes.

Boeotian armies campaigned across Greece as opponents rose up on all sides; Epaminondas even led his state in a challenge to Athens at sea. The Theban demos voted him a fleet of a hundred triremes to win over <a href="Rhodes">Rhodes</a>, <a href="Chios">Chios</a>, and <a href="Byzantium">Byzantium</a>. The fleet finally sailed in 364, but modern scholars believe that Epaminondas achieved no lasting gains for Thebes on this voyage. In that same year, Pelopidas was killed while campaigning against <a href="Alexander%20of%20Pherae">Alexander of Pherae</a> in Thessaly. His loss deprived Epaminondas of his greatest Theban political ally.

In the face of this increasing opposition to Theban dominance, Epaminondas launched his final expedition into the Peloponnese in 362 BC. The immediate goal of the expedition was to subdue Mantinea, which had been opposing Theban influence in the region. Epaminondas brought an army drawn from Boeotia, Thessaly and Euboea. He was joined by <a href="Tegea">Tegea</a>, which was the center of local opposition to Mantinea, Argos, Messenia, and some of the Arcadians. Mantinea, on the other hand, had requested assistance from Sparta, Athens, Achaea and the rest of Arcadia, so that almost all of Greece was represented on one side or the other.

This time the mere presence of the Theban army was not enough to cow the opposition. Since time was passing and the Mantinean alliance showed no signs of capsizing, Epaminondas decided that he would have to break the stalemate. Hearing that a large Lacedaemonian force was marching to Mantinea, and that Sparta was practically undefended, he planned an audacious night-time march on Sparta itself. However, the Spartan king <a href="Archidamus%20III">Archidamus</a> was alerted to this move by an informant, probably a Cretan runner, and Epaminondas arrived to find the city well-defended. Although he did attack the city, he seems to have drawn off relatively quickly on discovering that he had not, after all, surprised the Spartans. Furthermore, the Lacedaemonian and Mantinean troops which had been stationed at Mantinea had marched to Sparta during the course of the day, and dissuaded Epaminondas from attacking again. Now hoping that his adversaries had left Mantinea defenseless in their haste to protect Sparta, Epaminondas counter marched his troops back to his base at Tegea, and then dispatched his cavalry to Mantinea. However, a clash outside the walls of Mantinea with Athenian cavalry foiled this strategy as well. Realising that the time allotted for the campaign was drawing to a close, and reasoning that if he departed without defeating the enemies of Tegea, Theban influence in the Peloponnesus would be destroyed, he decided to stake everything on a pitched battle.

What followed on the plain in front of Mantinea was the largest hoplite battle in Greek history. Epaminondas had the larger army, 30,000 strong infantry and 3,000 cavalry, whilst his opponents numbered 20,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry. Xenophon says that, having decided to fight, Epaminondas arranged the army into battle order, and then marched it in a column "parallel" to the Mantinean lines, so that it appeared that the army was marching elsewhere, and would not fight that day. Having reached a certain point in the march, he then had the army down arms, so it appeared they getting ready to camp. Xenophon suggests that "by so doing he caused among most of the enemy a relaxation of their mental readiness for fighting, and likewise a relaxation of their readiness as regards their array for battle". The whole column, which had been marching right-to-left past the front of the Mantinean army then 'right-faced', so that they were now in a battle line, facing the Mantineans. Epaminondas, who had been at the head of the column (now the left wing), brought some companies of infantry from the extreme right wing, behind the battle line, to reinforce the left wing. By this, he recreated the strengthened left-wing that Thebes had fielded at Leuctra (this time probably made up by all the Boeotians, and not just the Thebans as at Leuctra). On the wings he placed strong forces of cavalry strengthened by light-infantry.

Epaminondas then gave the order to advance, catching the enemy off guard, and causing a furious scramble in the Mantinean camp to prepare for battle. The battle unfolded as Epaminondas had planned. The cavalry forces on the wings drove back the Athenian and Mantinean cavalry opposite them. Diodorus says that the Athenian cavalry on the Mantinean right wing, although not inferior in quality, could not withstand the missiles from the light-troops that Epaminondas had placed among the Theban cavalry. Meanwhile, the Theban infantry advanced. Xenophon evocatively describes Epaminondas's thinking: "[he] led forward his army prow on, like a trireme, believing that if he could strike and cut through anywhere, he would destroy the entire army of his adversaries." As at Leuctra, the weakened right wing was ordered to hold back and avoid fighting. In the clash of infantry, the issue briefly hung in the balance, but then the Theban left-wing broke through the Spartan line, and the entire enemy phalanx was put to flight. However, at the height of the battle, Epaminondas was mortally wounded by a Spartan, and died shortly thereafter. Following his death, the Thebes and allies made no effort to pursue the fleeing enemy; a testament to Epaminondas's centrality to the war effort.

Xenophon, who ends his history with the battle of Mantinea, says of the battle's results: When these things had taken place, the opposite of what all men believed would happen was brought to pass. For since well-nigh all the people of Greece had come together and formed themselves in opposing lines, there was no one who did not suppose that if a battle were fought, those who proved victorious would be the rulers and those who were defeated would be their subjects; but the deity so ordered it that both parties set up a trophy as though victorious and neither tried to hinder those who set them up, that both gave back the dead under a truce as though victorious, and both received back their dead under a truce as though defeated, and that while each party claimed to be victorious, neither was found to be any better off, as regards either additional territory, or city, or sway, than before the battle took place; but there was even more confusion and disorder in Greece after the battle than before.

While pressing forward with the troops at Mantinea, Epaminondas was hit in the chest by a spear (or, in some accounts, a sword or large knife). Cornelius Nepos suggests the Spartans were deliberately aiming at Epaminondas in the hope of killing him, and thereby demoralizing the Thebans. The enemy who struck the killing blow was variously identified as <a href="Anticrates%20%28Spartan%29">Anticrates</a>, Machaerion, or <a href="Gryllus%2C%20son%20of%20Xenophon">Gryllus, son of Xenophon</a>.

The spear broke, leaving the iron point in his body, and Epaminondas collapsed. The Thebans around him fought desperately to stop the Spartans taking possession of his body. When he was carried back to camp still living, he asked which side was victorious. When he was told that the Boeotians had won, he <a href="last%20words">said</a> "It is time to die." Diodorus suggests that one of his friends exclaimed "You die childless, Epaminondas" and then burst into tears. To this Epaminondas is supposed to have replied "No, by Zeus, on the contrary I leave behind two daughters, Leuctra and Mantinea, my victories." Cornelius Nepos, whose story is otherwise similar has the <a href="last%20words">last words</a> of Epaminondas as "I have lived long enough; for I die unconquered." When the spear point was withdrawn, Epaminondas quickly expired. In accordance with Greek custom, he was buried on the battlefield.

In matters of character, Epaminondas was above reproach in the eyes of the ancient historians who recorded his deeds. Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a <a href="Achaemenid%20Dynasty">Persia</a>n ambassador who came to him with a <a href="bribe">bribe</a>. These aspects of his character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.

Epaminondas never married and as such was subject to criticism from countrymen who believed he was duty-bound to provide the country with the benefit of sons as great as himself. In response, Epaminondas said that his victory at Leuctra was a daughter destined to live forever. He is known, however, to have had several <a href="Pederasty%20in%20Ancient%20Greece">young male lovers</a>, a standard pedagogic practice in ancient Greece, and one that Thebes in particular was famous for; Plutarch records that the Theban lawgivers instituted the practice "to temper the manners and characters of the youth." An anecdote told by Cornelius Nepos indicates that Epaminondas was intimate with a young man by the name of Micythus. Plutarch also mentions two of his beloveds ("<a href="eromenos">eromenoi</a>"): Asopichus, who fought together with him at the battle of Leuctra, where he greatly distinguished himself; and Caphisodorus, who fell with Epaminondas at Mantineia and was buried by his side.

Extant biographies of Epaminondas universally describe him as one of the most talented generals ever produced by the Greek city-states. Even Xenophon, who fails to note his presence at Leuctra, says of his Mantinean campaign: "Now I for my part could not say that his campaign proved fortunate; yet of all possible deeds of forethought and daring the man seems to me to have left not one undone." Diodorus is effusive in his praise for Epaminondas's military record: "For it seems to me that he surpassed his contemporaries...in skill and experience in the art of war. For among the generation of Epaminondas were famous men: <a href="Pelopidas">Pelopidas</a> the Theban, <a href="Timotheus%20%28general%29">Timotheus</a> and <a href="Conon">Conon</a>, also <a href="Chabrias">Chabrias</a> and <a href="Iphicrates">Iphicrates</a>...<a href="Agesilaus">Agesilaus</a> the Spartan, who belonged to a slightly older generation. Still earlier than these, in the times of the Medes and Persians, there were <a href="Solon">Solon</a>, <a href="Themistocles">Themistocles</a>, <a href="Miltiades">Miltiades</a>, and <a href="Cimon">Cimon</a>, <a href="Myronides">Myronides</a>, and <a href="Pericles">Pericles</a> and certain others in Athens, and in Sicily <a href="Gelo">Gelo</a>n, son of Deinomenes, and still others. All the same, if you should compare the qualities of these with the generalship and reputation of Epaminondas, you would find the qualities possessed by Epaminondas far superior".

As a tactician, Epaminondas stands above every other general in Greek history, except kings <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip II</a> and <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, although modern historians have questioned his larger strategic vision. According to Richard A. Gabriel, his tactics "marked the beginning of the end of traditional Greek methods of war". His innovative strategy at Leuctra allowed him to defeat the vaunted Spartan phalanx with a smaller force, and his decision to refuse his right flank was the first recorded instance of such a tactic. Many of the tactical innovations that Epaminondas implemented would also be used by <a href="Philip%20II%20of%20Macedon">Philip of Macedon</a>, who in his youth spent time as a hostage in Thebes and may have learned directly from Epaminondas himself.

In some ways Epaminondas dramatically altered the face of Greece during the 10 years in which he was the central figure of Greek politics. By the time of his death, Sparta had been humbled, Messenia freed, and the Peloponnese completely reorganized. In another respect, however, he left behind a Greece no different than that which he had found; the bitter divides and animosities that had poisoned international relations in Greece for over a century remained as deep as or deeper than they had been before Leuctra. The brutal internecine warfare that had characterized the years from 432 BC onwards continued unabated until all the states involved were subjugated by Macedon.

At Mantinea, Thebes had faced down the combined forces of the greatest states of Greece, but the victory brought it no spoils. With Epaminondas removed from the scene, the Thebans returned to their more traditional defensive policy, and within a few years, Athens had replaced them at the pinnacle of the Greek political system. No Greek state ever again reduced Boeotia to the subjection it had known during the <a href="Spartan%20hegemony">Spartan hegemony</a>, but Theban influence faded quickly in the rest of Greece. Finally, at <a href="Battle%20of%20Chaeronea%20%28338%20BC%29">Chaeronea</a> in 338 BC, the combined forces of Thebes and Athens, driven into each other's arms for a desperate last stand against Philip of Macedon, were crushingly defeated, and Theban independence was put to an end. Three years later, heartened by a false rumor that <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a> had been assassinated, the Thebans revolted; Alexander squashed the revolt, then destroyed the city, slaughtering or enslaving all its citizens. A mere 27 years after the death of the man who had made it preeminent throughout Greece, Thebes was wiped from the face of the Earth, its 1,000-year history ended in the space of a few days.

Epaminondas, therefore, is remembered both as a liberator and a destroyer. He was celebrated throughout the ancient Greek and Roman worlds as one of the greatest men of history. <a href="Cicero">Cicero</a> eulogized him as "the first man, in my judgement, of Greece," and Pausanias records an honorary poem from his tomb:

By my counsels was Sparta shorn of her glory,
And holy Messene received at last her children.
By the arms of Thebes was <a href="w%3AMegalopolis%2C%20Greece">Megalopolis</a> encircled with walls,
And all Greece won independence and freedom.

Epaminondas's actions were certainly welcomed by the Messenians and others whom he assisted in his campaigns against the Spartans. Those same Spartans, however, had been at the center of resistance to the Persian invasions of the 5th century BC, and their absence was sorely felt at Chaeronea; the endless warfare in which Epaminondas played a central role weakened the cities of Greece until they could no longer hold their own against their neighbors to the north. As Epaminondas campaigned to secure freedom for the Boeotians and others throughout Greece, he brought closer the day when all of Greece would be subjugated by an invader. <a href="Victor%20Davis%20Hanson">Victor Davis Hanson</a> has suggested that Epaminondas may have planned for a united Greece composed of regional democratic federations, but even if this assertion is correct, no such plan was ever implemented. <a href="Simon%20Hornblower">Simon Hornblower</a> asserts that Thebes' great legacy to fourth century and Hellenistic Greece was federalism, "a kind of alternative to imperialism, a way of achieving unity without force", which "embodies a representative principle".

For all his noble qualities, Epaminondas was unable to transcend the Greek city-state system, with its endemic rivalry and warfare, and thus left Greece more war-ravaged but no less divided than he found it. Hornblower asserts that "it is a sign of Epaminondas' political failure, even before the battle of Mantinea, that his Peloponnesian allies fought to reject Sparta rather than because of the positive attractions of Thebes". On the other hand, Cawkwell concludes that "Epaminondas must be judged not in relation to these inevitable limitations of Boeotian power. To have established the power of Boeotia and ended the Spartan domination of the Peloponnese was the most and the best that a Boeotian could have done."

Æthelbald of Mercia

Æthelbald (also spelled Ethelbald or Aethelbald; died 757) was the <a href="King%20of%20Mercia">King of Mercia</a>, in what is now the <a href="English%20Midlands">English Midlands</a> from 716 until he was killed in 757. Æthelbald was the son of Alweo and thus a grandson of King <a href="Eowa">Eowa</a>. Æthelbald came to the throne after the death of his cousin, King <a href="Ceolred">Ceolred</a>, who had driven him into exile. During his long reign, <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a> became the dominant kingdom of the <a href="Anglo-Saxons">Anglo-Saxons</a>, and recovered the position of pre-eminence it had enjoyed during the strong reigns of Mercian kings <a href="Penda">Penda</a> and <a href="Wulfhere">Wulfhere</a> between about 628 and 675.

When Æthelbald came to the throne, both <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a> were ruled by stronger kings, but within fifteen years the contemporary chronicler <a href="Bede">Bede</a> describes Æthelbald as ruling all England south of the river <a href="Humber">Humber</a>. The "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>" does not list Æthelbald as a <a href="bretwalda">bretwalda</a>, or "Ruler of Britain", though this may be due to the West Saxon origin of the "Chronicle".

<a href="Saint%20Boniface">St. Boniface</a> wrote to Æthelbald in about 745, reproving him for various dissolute and irreligious acts. The subsequent 747 <a href="Councils%20of%20Clovesho%23The%20Council%20of%20747">council of Clovesho</a> and a charter Æthelbald issued at <a href="Gumley">Gumley</a> in 749—which freed the church from some of its obligations—may have been responses to Boniface's letter. Æthelbald was killed in 757 by his bodyguards. He was succeeded briefly by <a href="Beornred">Beornred</a>, of whom little is known, but within a year, <a href="Offa">Offa</a>, the grandson of Æthelbald's cousin Eanwulf, had seized the throne, possibly after a brief <a href="civil%20war">civil war</a>. Under Offa, Mercia entered its most prosperous and influential period.

Æthelbald came of the Mercian royal line, although his father, Alweo, was never king. Alweo's father was <a href="Eowa">Eowa</a>, who may have shared the throne for some time with his brother, <a href="Penda">Penda</a>. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" does not mention Eowa; though it does date Penda's reign as the thirty years from 626 to 656, when Penda was killed at the <a href="battle%20of%20the%20Winwaed">battle of the Winwaed</a>. Two later sources also name Eowa as king: the "<a href="Historia%20Brittonum">Historia Brittonum</a>" and the "<a href="Annales%20Cambriae">Annales Cambriae</a>". The "Annales Cambriae" is the source for Eowa's death in 644 at the <a href="battle%20of%20Maserfield">battle of Maserfield</a>, where Penda defeated <a href="Oswald%20of%20Northumbria">Oswald of Northumbria</a>. Details on Penda's reign are scarce, and it is a matter for speculation whether Eowa was an underking, owing allegiance to Penda, or if instead Eowa and Penda had divided Mercia between them. If they did divide the kingdom, it is likely that Eowa ruled northern Mercia, as Penda's son Peada was established later as the king of southern Mercia by the Northumbrian <a href="Oswiu%20of%20Northumbria">Oswiu</a>, who defeated the Mercians and killed Penda in 656. It is possible that Eowa fought against Penda at Maserfield.

During Æthelbald's youth, Penda's dynasty ruled Mercia; <a href="Ceolred">Ceolred</a>, a grandson of Penda and therefore a second cousin of Æthelbald, was king of Mercia from 709 to 716. An early source, Felix's "Life of Saint Guthlac", reveals that it was Ceolred who drove Æthelbald into exile. <a href="Saint%20Guthlac">Guthlac</a> was a Mercian nobleman who abandoned a career of violence to become first a monk at <a href="Repton">Repton</a>, and later a hermit living in a <a href="tumulus">barrow</a> at <a href="Crowland">Crowland</a>, in the East Anglian fens. During Æthelbald's exile he and his men also took refuge in the Fens in the area, and visited Guthlac. Guthlac was sympathetic to Æthelbald's cause, perhaps because of Ceolred's oppression of the monasteries. Other visitors of Guthlac's included Bishop Haedde of <a href="Lichfield">Lichfield</a>, an influential Mercian, and it may be that Guthlac's support was politically useful to Æthelbald in gaining the throne. After Guthlac's death, Æthelbald had a dream in which Guthlac prophesied greatness for him, and Æthelbald later rewarded Guthlac with a shrine when he had become king.

When Ceolred died of a fit at a banquet, Æthelbald returned to Mercia and became ruler. It is possible that a king named Ceolwald, perhaps a brother of Ceolred, reigned for a short while between Ceolred and Æthelbald. Æthelbald's accession ended Penda's line of descent; Æthelbald's reign was followed, after a brief interval, by that of Offa, another descendant of Eowa.

Other than his father, Alweo, little of Æthelbald's immediate family is known, although in the witness list of two charters a leading <a href="ealdorman">ealdorman</a> named <a href="Heardberht">Heardberht</a> is recorded as his brother.

Æthelbald's reign marked a resurgence of Mercian power, which would last until the end of the eighth century. With the exception of the short reign of <a href="Beornrad%20of%20Mercia">Beornrad</a>, who succeeded Æthelbald for less than a year, Mercia was ruled for eighty years by two of the most powerful Anglo-Saxon kings, Æthelbald and <a href="Offa">Offa</a>. These long reigns were unusual at this early date; during the same period eleven kings reigned in <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a>, many of whom died violent deaths.

By 731, Æthelbald had all the English south of the Humber under his overlordship. There is little direct evidence of the relationship between Æthelbald and the kings who were dependent on him. Generally, a king subject to an overlord such as Æthelbald would still be regarded as a king, but would have his independence curtailed in some respects. <a href="Charter">Charter</a>s are an important source of evidence for this relationship; these were documents which granted land to followers or to churchmen, and were witnessed by the kings who had power to grant the land. A charter granting land in the territory of one of the subject kings might record the names of the king as well as the overlord on the witness list appended to the grant; such a witness list can be seen on the <a href="Ismere%20Diploma">Ismere Diploma</a>, for example. The titles given to the kings on these charters could also be revealing: a king might be described as a "subregulus", or underking.

Enough information survives to suggest the progress of Æthelbald's influence over two of the southern kingdoms, <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> and <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Kent">Kent</a>. At the start of Æthelbald's reign, both Kent and Wessex were ruled by strong kings; <a href="Wihtred">Wihtred</a> and <a href="Ine%20of%20Wessex">Ine</a>, respectively. Wihtred of Kent died in 725, and Ine of Wessex, one of the most formidable rulers of his day, abdicated in 726 to go on a pilgrimage to Rome. According to the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle", Ine's successor, <a href="Aethelheard%20of%20Wessex">Aethelheard</a>, fought that year with an <a href="ealdorman">ealdorman</a> named Oswald, whom the "Chronicle" provides with a genealogy showing descent from <a href="Ceawlin">Ceawlin</a>, an early king of Wessex. Aethelheard ultimately succeeded in this struggle for the throne, and there are subsequent indications that he ruled subject to Mercian authority. Hence it may be that Æthelbald helped establish both Aethelheard and his brother, Cuthred, who succeeded Aethelheard in 739. There is also evidence of South Saxon territory breaking away from West Saxon dominance in the early 720s, and this may indicate Æthelbald's increasing influence in the area, though it could have been Kentish, rather than Mercian, influence that was weakening West Saxon control.

As for Kent, there is evidence from Kentish <a href="Chartulary">charters</a> that shows that Æthelbald was a patron of Kentish churches. There is no charter evidence showing Æthelbald's consent to Kentish land grants, and charters of <a href="Aethelberht%20of%20Kent">Aethelberht</a> and <a href="Eadbert%20I%20of%20Kent">Eadberht</a>, both kings of Kent, survive in which they grant land without Æthelbald's consent. It may be that charters showing Æthelbald's overlordship simply do not survive, but the result is that there is no direct evidence of the extent of Æthelbald's influence in Kent.

Less is known about events in Essex, but it was at about this time that London became attached to the kingdom of Mercia rather than that of Essex. Three of Æthelbald's predecessors—<a href="%C3%86thelred%20of%20Mercia">Æthelred</a>, <a href="Coenred%20of%20Mercia">Coenred</a>, and Ceolred—had each confirmed an East Saxon charter granting Twickenham to Waldhere, the <a href="bishop%20of%20London">bishop of London</a>. From Kentish charters it is known that Æthelbald was in control of London, and from Æthelbald's time on, the transition to Mercian control appears to be complete; an early charter of Offa's, granting land near Harrow, does not even include the king of Essex on the witness list. For the South Saxons, there is very little charter evidence, but as with Kent, what there is does not show any requirement for Æthelbald's consent to land grants. The lack of evidence should not obscure the fact that Bede, who was after all a contemporary chronicler, summarized the situation of England in 731 by listing the bishops in office in southern England, and adding that "all these provinces, together with the others south of the river Humber and their kings, are subject to Æthelbald, King of the Mercians."

There is evidence that Æthelbald had to go to war to maintain his overlordship. In 733 Æthelbald undertook an expedition against Wessex and captured the royal <a href="manorialism">manor</a> of <a href="Somerton%2C%20Somerset">Somerton</a>. The "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle" also tells how when <a href="Cuthred%20of%20Wessex">Cuthred</a> succeeded Aethelheard to the throne of Wessex, in 740, he "boldly made war against Aethelbald, king of Mercia". Three years later, Cuthred and Æthelbald are described as fighting against the Welsh. This could have been an obligation placed on Cuthred by Mercia; earlier kings had similarly assisted <a href="Penda">Penda</a> and <a href="Wulfhere">Wulfhere</a>, two strong seventh-century Mercian rulers. In 752, Æthelbald and Cuthred are again on opposite sides of the conflict, and according to one version of the manuscript, Cuthred "put him [Æthelbald] to flight" at <a href="Battle%20Edge">Burford</a>. Æthelbald seems to have reasserted his authority over the West Saxons by the time of his death, since a later West Saxon king, <a href="Cynewulf%20of%20Wessex">Cynewulf</a>, is recorded as witnessing a charter of Æthelbald at the very beginning of his reign, in 757.

In 740, a war between the Picts and the Northumbrians is reported. Æthelbald, who might have been allied with <a href="%C3%93engus%20I%20of%20the%20Picts">Óengus</a>, the king of the Picts, took advantage of <a href="Eadberht%20of%20Northumbria">Eadberht</a>'s absence from Northumbria to ravage his lands, and perhaps burn <a href="York">York</a>.

Earlier in Bede's "<a href="Ecclesiastical%20History%20of%20the%20English%20People">Ecclesiastical History of the English People</a>" chronicle, he lists seven kings who governed the southern provinces of the English, with reigns dating from the late fifth to the late seventh century. Subsequently, the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle"—another important source for the period—describes these seven as or , a title translated as "Britain-ruler" or "Wide-ruler". The "Chronicle" adds just one king to the list: <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">Egbert of Wessex</a>, who reigned in the ninth century. The resulting list of eight omits several strong Mercian kings. It is possible that the chronicler was merely adding Egbert's name to Bede's original list of seven, rather than claiming that no other kings achieved similar powers in England. The chronicler was almost certainly a West Saxon, and since neither Æthelbald nor Offa were kings of Wessex it is possible the chronicler does not mention them out of regional pride. The meaning of the term "bretwalda", and the nature of the power that these eight kings wielded, has had much academic scrutiny. One suggested interpretation is that since Bede was writing during Æthelbald's reign, the original seven he listed were essentially those kings who could be seen as prototypes of Æthelbald in their domination of England south of the Humber.

Further evidence of Æthelbald's power, or at least his titles, is provided by an important charter of 736, the <a href="Ismere%20Diploma">Ismere Diploma</a>, which survives in a contemporary (and possibly original) copy. It starts by describing Æthelbald as "king not only of the Mercians but also of all the provinces which are called by the general name South English"; in the witness list he is further named "Rex Britanniae", "King of Britain". One historian described this title as "a phrase which can only be interpreted as a Latin rendering of the English title "; but it may be that at that time these titles would not have been acknowledged much beyond <a href="Worcester">Worcester</a>, where this and other documents from the 730s that use similar titles were written.

In 745–746, the leading Anglo-Saxon missionary in Germany, <a href="Saint%20Boniface">Boniface</a>, along with seven other bishops, sent Æthelbald a scorching letter reproaching him for many sins—stealing ecclesiastical revenue, violating church privileges, imposing forced labour on the clergy, and fornicating with nuns. The letter implored Æthelbald to take a wife and abandon the sin of lust:

We therefore, beloved son, beseech Your Grace by Christ the son of God and by His coming and by His kingdom, that if it is true that you are continuing in this vice you will amend your life by penitence, purify yourself, and bear in mind how vile a thing it is through lust to change the image of God created in you into the image and likeness of a vicious demon. Remember that you were made king and ruler over many not by your own merits but by the abounding grace of God, and now you are making yourself by your own lust the slave of an evil spirit.

Boniface first sent the letter to <a href="Ecgbert%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20York">Ecgberht</a>, the archbishop of York, asking him to correct any inaccuracies and reinforce whatever was right; and he requested Herefrith, a priest whom Æthelbald had listened to in the past, to read and explain it to the king in person. Though Boniface's letter praises Æthelbald's faith and alms-giving, its criticisms have strongly coloured subsequent opinion of Æthelbald. A claim made in a ninth-century list of donations from the abbey of Gloucester that Æthelbald had "stabbed—or smitten" to death the kinsman of a Mercian abbess has also contributed negatively to his reputation.

Æthelbald may have influenced the appointment of successive archbishops of Canterbury in <a href="Tatwin">Tatwin</a>e, <a href="Nothelm">Nothelm</a>, and <a href="Cuthbert%2C%20Archbishop%20of%20Canterbury">Cuthbert</a>, the last probably the former bishop of Hereford; and despite Boniface's strong criticisms, there is evidence of Æthelbald's positive interest in church affairs. A subsequent letter of Boniface's to Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, provided a good deal of information about Frankish <a href="synod">synod</a>s, especially one held in 747, the decrees of which Boniface included in the letter. Boniface does not explicitly suggest to Cuthbert that he, too, should hold a synod, but it seems clear that this was Boniface's intent. A council was, in fact, subsequently held at Clovesho (the location of which is now lost); Æthelbald attended and perhaps presided. The council was concerned with the relationship between the church and the secular world, and it condemned many excesses on the part of the clergy. The council limited relations between monks and laymen and ruled that secular activities were impermissible for monks: secular business and secular songs were both forbidden, especially "ludicrous songs".

Two years after this, in 749, at the synod of <a href="Gumley">Gumley</a>, Æthelbald issued a charter that freed <a href="ecclesiastical">ecclesiastical</a> lands from all obligations except the requirement to build forts and bridges—obligations which lay upon everyone, as part of the "<a href="trinoda%20necessitas">trinoda necessitas</a>". This charter was witnessed only by Mercian bishops, and it is possible it had no effect outside Mercia, but it is also possible that it was essentially part of a reform programme inspired by Boniface and instigated at Clovesho.

In 757, Æthelbald was killed at <a href="Seckington">Seckington</a>, <a href="Warwickshire">Warwickshire</a>, near the royal seat of <a href="Tamworth%2C%20Staffordshire">Tamworth</a>. According to a later continuation of <a href="Bede">Bede</a>'s "Ecclesiastical History", he was "treacherously murdered at night by his own bodyguards", though the reason is unrecorded. He was succeeded, briefly, by <a href="Beornrad%20of%20Mercia">Beornrad</a>. Æthelbald was buried at <a href="Repton">Repton</a>, in a crypt which still can be seen; a contemporary is reported to have seen a vision of him in hell, reinforcing the impression of a king not universally well-regarded. The monastery church on the site at that time was probably constructed by Æthelbald to house the royal mausoleum; other burials there include that of <a href="Wigstan">Wigstan</a>.

A fragment of a cross shaft from Repton includes on one face a carved image of a mounted man which, it has been suggested, may be a memorial to Æthelbald. The figure is of a man wearing mail armour and brandishing a sword and shield, with a <a href="diadem">diadem</a> bound around his head. If this is Æthelbald, it would make it the earliest large-scale pictorial representation of an English monarch.

According to a story recorded by the 16th-century antiquarian <a href="John%20Leland%20%28antiquary%29">John Leland</a>, and derived by him from a now lost book in the possession of the <a href="Earls%20of%20Rutland">Earls of Rutland</a> at <a href="Belvoir%20Castle">Belvoir Castle</a>, there was once a King Alfred III of Mercia, who reigned in the 730s. Though no Mercian king was ever named Alfred, let alone three, if this story has any historical basis (which Leland himself rejected) it must presumably relate to Æthelbald. The legend states that Alfred III had occasion to visit a certain William de Albanac, alleged ancestor of the Earls of Rutland, at his castle near <a href="Grantham">Grantham</a>, and took a fancy to William's three comely daughters. It was the king's intention to take one as his mistress, but William threatened to kill whichever he chose rather than have her dishonoured in this way, whereupon Alfred "answerid that he meant to take one of them to wife, and chose Etheldrede that had fat bottoks, and of her he had Alurede that wan first all the Saxons the monarchy of England." A painting of this supposed incident was commissioned in 1778 by the <a href="Charles%20Manners%2C%204th%20Duke%20of%20Rutland">Duke of Rutland</a>, but was destroyed in a fire in 1816.

Demetrius III Eucaerus

Demetrius III Theos Philopator Soter Philometor Euergetes Callinicus (, surnamed Eucaerus; between 125 and 109 BC – after 87 BC) was a <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid</a> monarch who reigned as the <a href="List%20of%20Syrian%20monarchs">King of Syria</a> between 96 and 87 BC. He was a son of <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> and, most likely, his Egyptian wife <a href="Tryphaena">Tryphaena</a>. Demetrius III's early life was spent in a period of civil war between his father and his uncle <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a>, which ended with the assassination of Antiochus VIII in 96 BC. After the death of their father, Demetrius III took control of <a href="Damascus">Damascus</a> while his brother <a href="Seleucus%20VI%20Epiphanes">Seleucus VI</a> prepared for war against Antiochus IX, who occupied the Syrian capital <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>.

The civil war dragged on; Seleucus VI eliminated his uncle, whose heir <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a> counterattacked and drove Seleucus VI to his death. Then the twins <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a> and <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a>, brothers of Demetrius III, attempted to avenge Seleucus VI; it ended with the death of Antiochus XI and the interference of Demetrius III on the side of Philip I in a war against Antiochus X that probably lasted until 88 BC. In 89 BC, Demetrius III invaded <a href="Judea">Judaea</a> and crushed the forces of its king, <a href="Alexander%20Jannaeus">Alexander Jannaeus</a>; his near victory was cut short by the death of Antiochus X. Demetrius III rushed to Antioch before Philip I could take advantage of the power vacuum and strengthen his position relative to Demetrius III.

By 87 BC, Demetrius III had most of Syria under his authority. He attempted to appease the public by promoting the importance of the local <a href="Ancient%20Semitic-speaking%20peoples">Semitic</a> gods, and he might have given Damascus the dynastic name Demetrias. By late 87 BC, Demetrius III attacked Philip I in the city of <a href="Aleppo">Beroea</a>, where Philip I's allies called on the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a> for help. The allied forces routed Demetrius III and besieged him in his camp; he was forced to surrender and spent the rest of his life in exile in Parthia. Philip I took Antioch, while <a href="Antiochus%20XII%20Dionysus">Antiochus XII</a>, another brother of Demetrius III, took Damascus.

The <a href="Seleucid%20Empire">Seleucid Empire</a>, based in Syria, disintegrated in the second century BC as a result of dynastic feuds and <a href="Ptolemaic%20Kingdom">Egyptian</a> interference. A long civil war caused Syria to fragment as pretenders from the royal family fought for the throne. This lasted until about 123 BC, when <a href="Antiochus%20VIII%20Grypus">Antiochus VIII</a> provided a degree of stability which lasted for a decade. To maintain a degree of peace, Egypt and Syria attempted dynastic marriages, which helped Egypt destabilise Syria by supporting one candidate to the throne over another. In 125 BC, the Egyptian princess <a href="Tryphaena">Tryphaena</a> was married to Antiochus VIII. Five sons were born to the couple: <a href="Seleucus%20VI%20Epiphanes">Seleucus VI</a>, the twins <a href="Antiochus%20XI%20Epiphanes">Antiochus XI</a> and <a href="Philip%20I%20Philadelphus">Philip I</a>, Demetrius III and <a href="Antiochus%20XII%20Dionysus">Antiochus XII</a>.

In 113 BC, Antiochus VIII's half-brother <a href="Antiochus%20IX%20Cyzicenus">Antiochus IX</a> declared himself king; the siblings fought relentlessly for a decade and a half. Antiochus IX killed Tryphaena in 109 BC. Antiochus VIII was assassinated in 96 BC; this date is deduced from the statement of the first century historian <a href="Josephus">Josephus</a>, who wrote that Antiochus VIII, who assumed the throne in 125 BC, ruled for twenty-nine years, and is corroborated by the third century historian <a href="Porphyry%20%28philosopher%29">Porphyry</a>, who gave the <a href="Seleucid%20era">Seleucid year (SE)</a> 216 (97/96 BC) for Antiochus VIII's death. Following the death of his brother, Antiochus IX took the Syrian capital, <a href="Antioch">Antioch</a>, while Seleucus VI, established in <a href="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>, prepared for war against his uncle. In modern literature, Seleucus VI is considered the eldest son, and Demetrius III is considered younger than Antiochus XI and Philip I. However, almost nothing is known about the early life of Demetrius III, who might have been the eldest son himself, having been born anytime between 125 BC and 109 BC. According to Josephus, before assuming the throne, Demetrius III lived in the city of <a href="Knidos">Knidos</a>.

Antiochus IX did not take Damascus following the death of his brother; he was probably focused on the threat of Seleucus VI and could not spare the resources for an occupation of Damascus. This eased Demetrius III's elevation to the throne; he took Damascus in 96 BC. The earliest coins struck in the name of Demetrius were produced in Damascus in 216 SE (97/96 BC); only one Damascene <a href="Coining%20%28mint%29%23Ancient%20coin%20dies">obverse die</a> is known from 216 SE (97/96 BC), indicating that Demetrius's reign started late that year, giving him little time to produce more dies. The only ancient works of literature dealing with Demetrius III's career are those of Josephus and the <a href="Nahum%20Commentary">Pesher Nahum</a>, a sectarian commentary on the <a href="Book%20of%20Nahum">Book of Nahum</a>. Historian Kay Ehling noted that Josephus's account is a condensed summary and that the actual course of events surrounding Demetrius III's seizure of power needs to be reconstructed. Thus, interpreting the numismatic evidence is instrumental for the problematic chronological reconstruction of Demetrius III's reign.

Demetrius ( ) is a Greek name that means "belonging to <a href="Demeter">Demeter</a>", the Greek goddess of fertility. Seleucid kings were mostly named Seleucus and Antiochus; "Demetrius" was used by the <a href="Antigonid%20dynasty">Antigonid dynasty</a> of <a href="Macedonia%20%28ancient%20kingdom%29">Macedonia</a> as a royal name, and its use by the Seleucids, who had Antigonid descent, probably signified that they were heirs of the latter. <a href="Hellenistic%20period">Hellenistic</a> kings did not use <a href="regnal%20number">regnal number</a>s, which is a modern practise; instead, they used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs. Demetrius III's most used epithets are Theos (divine), Philopator (father loving) and Soter (saviour); the aforementioned epithets appear together on all of his Damascene and Antiochene coins. In Cilicia, two epithets were used in conjunction: Philometor (mother-loving) and Euergetes (benefactor). The coins from <a href="Seleucia%20Pieria">Seleucia Pieria</a> bear three epithets together: the ones appearing on the coins of Cilicia, combined with the epithet Callinicus (nobly victorious). Theos Philopator Soter served to emphasise Demetrius III's descent from the line of his grandfather <a href="Demetrius%20II%20Nicator">Demetrius II</a> who bore the epithet Theos; Soter was an epithet of Demetrius III's great-grandfather <a href="Demetrius%20I%20Soter">Demetrius I</a>, while Philopator represented his devotion to his deceased father Antiochus VIII. With Philometor, Demetrius III probably sought to emphasise his <a href="Ptolemaic%20dynasty">Ptolemaic</a> royal Egyptian descent through his mother Tryphaena.

Eucaerus is a popular nickname used by the majority of modern historians to denote Demetrius III, but it is a mistranscription of the nickname given by Josephus in his works "<a href="The%20Jewish%20War">The Jewish War</a>" and "<a href="Antiquities%20of%20the%20Jews">Antiquities of the Jews</a>". The earliest Greek manuscripts of Josephus's works contain the nickname Akairos in three places. Eucaerus appeared as a later development, and is attested in the Latin versions of the manuscripts. It was probably a copyist, thinking that Akairos was a mistake and trying to correct it, that led to the appearance of Eucaerus. Eucaerus translates to "well-timed", while Akairos means "the untimely one". Josephus did not explain the origin of Akairos. Such popular nicknames are never found on coins, but are handed down only through ancient literature; neither Eucaerus or Akairos was used by Demetrius III on his coinage. Josephus is the only source for the nickname; in the view of historians David Levenson and <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Martin">Thomas Martin</a>, Eucaerus should not be used to refer to Demetrius; instead, Akairos, or one of his official epithets should be used.

According to Josephus, Tryphaena's brother <a href="Ptolemy%20IX%20Lathyros">Ptolemy IX</a> of Egypt installed Demetrius III in Damascus following the death of Antiochus XI Epiphanes in 93 BC; this statement cannot be correct as the date given by Josephus contradicts the numismatic evidence from Damascus. Despite the chronological error, several arguments justify the theory of a collaboration between Ptolemy IX and Demetrius III; according to Ehling, the assumption of the epithet Philometor (mother loving) was meant to highlight Demetrius III's relation to his uncle Ptolemy IX. Two main reconstructions of Demetrius III's rise to power exist:


Demetrius III seems to have been content with leaving the struggle against Antiochus IX and his heirs to his many brothers; he took advantage of the chaos in the north to consolidate his authority in Damascus. Drawing his legitimacy from his father, he appeared on his coinage with an exaggerated hawked nose in the likeness of Antiochus VIII. Coins from a city named Demetrias, bearing on their reverse a portrait of the <a href="Tyche">Tyche</a> of Damascus, are evidence that Demetrius III might have refounded Damascus and given it the dynastic name Demetrias. Damascene coins mention the city as "holy"; it must have been a privilege bestowed upon it by Demetrius III who possibly also conferred the right of <a href="Asylum%20%28antiquity%29">asylum</a> on his capital.

Seleucid kings mostly depicted Greek gods on their coinage, but Demetrius III ruled a contracted realm, where the local cults gained more importance as the Seleucids no longer ruled a heterogeneous kingdom. Local cults came under royal patronage as Seleucid kings attempted to gain the support of their non-Greek subjects. On his royal silver coins from Damascus, the supreme <a href="Ancient%20Semitic-speaking%20peoples">Semitic</a> goddess <a href="Atargatis">Atargatis</a> appeared on the reverse, while municipal coins continued to use the portraits of traditional Greek deities. The radiate crown, a sign of divinity, was employed by Demetrius III on some of his coins; this can be an indication that he ritually married Atargatis. Marrying the supreme goddess indicated that the king considered himself the manifestation of Syria's supreme god and Atargatis' partner, <a href="Hadad">Hadad</a>. The practise was started at an unknown date by <a href="Antiochus%20IV%20Epiphanes">Antiochus IV</a> (died 164 BC), the first king to employ the radiate crown, who chose <a href="Manbij">Hierapolis-Bambyce</a>, Atargatis's most important sanctuary, to ritually marry <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a>, the manifestation of Atargatis in Syria.

As was typical for a Seleucid king, Demetrius III aimed to acquire as much territory as possible and sought to expand his domains in Syria. The city of <a href="Umm%20Qais">Gadara</a> was conquered by Alexander Jannaeus in 100 BC, but the city freed itself and reverted to the Seleucids after the defeat of the <a href="Judea">Judaean</a> king at the hands of the <a href="Nabataean%20Kingdom">Nabataeans</a>, an event that happened in 93 BC at the latest. Gadara was of great strategic importance for Demetrius III as a major military hub for operations in the south; controlling it was vital to the war effort against the Judaeans.

In 95 BC, Seleucus VI entered Antioch after defeating and killing Antiochus IX, whose son <a href="Antiochus%20X%20Eusebes">Antiochus X</a> fled to <a href="Arwad">Aradus</a> and declared himself king. In 94 BC, Seleucus VI was driven out of the capital by Antiochus X; the former escaped to the Cilician city of <a href="Mopsuestia">Mopsuestia</a> where he perished during a local uprising. Antiochus XI and Philip I avenged Seleucus VI, and Antiochus XI drove Antiochus X out of the capital in 93 BC. Antiochus X was able to regain the city and kill Antiochus XI the same year. In the spring of 93 BC, Demetrius III marched in support of his brother Philip I; Demetrius III might have marched north earlier to support Antiochus XI in his final battle.

According to Josephus, Demetrius III and Philip I waged a fierce war against Antiochus X; the language of Josephus indicates that Antiochus X was in a defensive position rather than planning massive campaigns against his cousins. In 220 SE (93/92 BC), no coins were produced for Demetrius III in Damascus; this could mean that he lost control over the city. It is possible that either the Judaeans or the Nabataeans took advantage of Demetrius III's departure to help his brother and occupied the city; the King regained Damascus in 221 SE (92/91 BC). Antiochus X's date of death is unknown; traditional scholarship, with no evidence, gives the year 92 BC, then has Demetrius taking control of Antioch and ruling it for five years until his downfall in 87 BC. Those traditional dates are hard to justify; using a methodology based on estimating the annual die usage average rate (the Esty formula), Hoover proposed the year 224 SE (89/88 BC) for the end of Antiochus X's reign. It is estimated that only one to three dies were used by Demetrius III for his Antiochene coins, a number too small to justify a five-year-long reign in Antioch; no literary sources specify the year 92 BC as the date of Demetrius III's occupation of Antioch, and none of his Antiochene coins bear a date.

Following the defeat of Alexander Jannaeus at the hands of the Nabataeans, Judaea was caught in a civil war between the king and a religious group called the <a href="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>. According to Josephus, Alexander Jannaeus' opponents persuaded Demetrius III to invade Judaea as it would be conquered easily owing to the civil war. Josephus gave two accounts regarding the numerical strength of Demetrius III; in "Antiquities of the Jews", the Syrian king had 3,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry. In the Jewish War, Demetrius III commanded 3,000 cavalry and 14,000 infantry. The latter number is more logical; the number given in "Antiquities of the Jews" could be an error by a copyist.

The date of the campaign is unclear in Josephus's account. 88 BC is traditionally considered the date of Demetrius III's Judaean campaign, but numismatic evidence shows that coin production increased massively in Damascus in 222 SE (91/90 BC) and 223 SE (90/89 BC). This increase indicates that Demetrius was securing the necessary funds for his campaign, making 89 BC more likely as the date of the invasion. The political situation in Syria in 89 BC helped Demetrius III initiate his invasion of Judaea; Antiochus X was in Antioch while Damascus was firmly in the hands of Demetrius III and there is no indication of a war with his brother Philip I.

The motives of Demetrius III are not specified in Josephus's account; the historian gives the impression that Demetrius III helped the Pharisees free of charge, which is hard to accept. The Syrian king's help must have been conditioned on political concessions by the Jewish rebels. Evidence for Demetrius III's motives is provided by the Pesher Nahum, which reads: "[Interpreted, this concerns Deme]trius king of Greece who sought, on the counsel of <a href="The%20Seekers%20after%20Smooth%20Things">those who seek smooth things</a>, to enter Jerusalem"; the academic consensus identifies "Demetrius king of Greece" with Demetrius III. The motive leading Demetrius III to attack Judaea might not have had anything to do with the call of the Pharisees. If Alexander Jannaeus took advantage of Demetrius's absence in 93 BC to wrest control of Damascus, then the invasion was probably in retribution against Judaea. It is also possible that Demetrius wanted to take advantage of Judaea's human resources in the struggle against his rivals to the Syrian throne. Finally, the Syrian kings, including Demetrius III's father, never fully accepted the independence of Judaea and entertained plans to reconquer it; the campaign of Demetrius III can be seen in this context.

Demetrius III was the first Seleucid king to set foot in Judaea since <a href="Antiochus%20VII%20Sidetes">Antiochus VII</a> (died 129 BC); according to Josephus, the Syrian king came with his army to the vicinity of <a href="Shechem">Shechem</a> (near <a href="Nablus">Nablus</a>), which he chose as the site for his camp. Alexander Jannaeus marched to meet his enemy; Demetrius III tried to persuade Alexander Jannaeus's mercenaries to defect as they were Greeks like him, but the troops did not answer his call. Following this failed attempt, the two kings engaged in battle; Demetrius III lost many troops but decimated Alexander Jannaeus's mercenaries and gained victory. The Judaean king fled to the nearby mountains and according to Josephus, when the 6,000 Judaean rebels in Demetrius III's ranks saw this, they felt pity for their king and deserted Demetrius to join Alexander Jannaeus. At this point, Demetrius III withdrew back to Syria.

The account of Josephus indicates that Demetrius III ended his Judaean campaign because his Jewish allies deserted him, but this is hard to accept; Josephus probably inflated the numbers of Judaeans in the Syrian army, and Demetrius III still had enough soldiers to wage wars in Syria after he departed Judaea. It is more likely that events in Syria forced Demetrius III to conclude his invasion of Judaea. Probably in 88 BC, Antiochus X died while fighting the <a href="Parthian%20Empire">Parthians</a>, and this must have forced Demetrius III to rush north and fill the power vacuum before Philip I. Demetrius III may have feared that his brother would turn on him and try to take Damascus for himself; if it was not for the death of Antiochus X, Demetrius III would probably have conquered Judaea.

According to Josephus, following the conclusion of his Judaean campaign, Demetrius III marched on Philip I. During this conflict, which is datable to 225 SE (88/87 BC), soldiers from Antioch were mentioned for the first time in the ranks of Demetrius III, indicating that he took control of the Syrian capital in this year. No bronze coinage was minted in the name of Demetrius III in Antioch as the city began issuing its own civic bronze coins in 221 SE (92/91 BC); Demetrius III issued silver coins in the Syrian capital as silver coinage remained a royal prerogative. Most of the kingdom came under the authority of Demetrius III; his coins were minted in Antioch, Damascus, Seleucia Pieria and Tarsus.

According to Josephus, Demetrius III attacked his brother in <a href="Aleppo">Beroea</a> with an army of 10,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalry. Philip I's ally, Straton, the tyrant of the city, called on Aziz, an Arab <a href="phylarch">phylarch</a> (tribal leader), and the <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>n governor Mithridates Sinaces for help; the allies' archery drove Demetrius III to take cover in his camp, where he was besieged and eventually surrendered after thirst took its toll on his men.

The year of Demetrius III's defeat is most likely 87 BC; the date of Demetrius III's last coin from Damascus is 225 SE (88/87 BC). According to Josephus, Demetrius III was captured and sent to Parthia, where he was treated by the Parthian king with "great honour" until he died of illness. Josephus wrote that the Parthian king was named Mithradates, likely . Demetrius III was probably childless; in Damascus, he was succeeded by Antiochus XII, whose first coin was minted in 226 SE (87/86 BC), indicating an immediate succession. Philip I released any captive who was a citizen of Antioch, a step that must have eased his entry into Antioch, which took place soon after the capture of Demetrius III.

Other than the song "<a href="Lucky%20%28Radiohead%20song%29">Lucky</a>", which was recorded in 1995, Radiohead recorded the album in <a href="Oxfordshire">Oxfordshire</a> and <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> between 1996 and early 1997, mostly in the historic mansion <a href="St%20Catherine%27s%20Court">St Catherine's Court</a>. The band distanced themselves from the <a href="guitar">guitar</a>-centred, lyrically introspective style of their previous album, "<a href="The%20Bends">The Bends</a>". "OK Computer"s abstract lyrics, densely layered sound and eclectic range of influences laid the groundwork for Radiohead's later, more <a href="experimental%20rock">experimental</a> work.

Despite lowered sales estimates by EMI, who deemed the record uncommercial and difficult to market, "OK Computer" reached number one on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Albums Chart</a> and debuted at number 21 on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a>, Radiohead's highest album entry on the US charts at the time. Five songs—"<a href="Paranoid%20Android">Paranoid Android</a>", "<a href="Karma%20Police">Karma Police</a>", "<a href="Lucky%20%28Radiohead%20song%29">Lucky</a>", "<a href="No%20Surprises">No Surprises</a>", and "<a href="Airbag%20%28song%29">Airbag</a>"—were released as <a href="Promotional%20recording%23Promo%20single">promotional singles</a>. The album expanded Radiohead's international popularity and has sold at least 7.8 million units worldwide. A remastered version with additional tracks, "<a href="OK%20Computer%20OKNOTOK%201997%202017">OKNOTOK 1997 2017</a>", was released on 22 June 2017 to commemorate the album's twentieth anniversary.

"OK Computer" received widespread critical acclaim and has been cited by listeners, critics and musicians as one of the greatest albums of all time. It was nominated for the <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Grammy Award for Album of the Year</a> and won <a href="Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Best Alternative Music Album</a> at the <a href="40th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">40th Annual Grammy Awards</a> in 1998. The album initiated a stylistic shift in British rock away from the then-ubiquitous <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a> genre toward melancholic, atmospheric alternative rock that became more prevalent in the next decade. The album depicts a world fraught with rampant <a href="consumerism">consumerism</a>, <a href="social%20alienation">social alienation</a>, emotional isolation and political malaise; in this capacity, "OK Computer" is often interpreted as having prescient insight into the mood of 21st-century life. In 2014, it was included by the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a> in the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a> as "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

In 1995, Radiohead toured in support of their second album "<a href="The%20Bends">The Bends</a>". Midway through the tour, <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a> commissioned the band to contribute a song to "<a href="The%20Help%20Album">The Help Album</a>", a <a href="charity%20record">charity compilation</a> organised by <a href="War%20Child%20%28charity%29">War Child</a>; the album was to be recorded over the course of a single day, 4 September 1995, and rush-released that week. Radiohead recorded "Lucky" in five hours with <a href="audio%20engineer">engineer</a> <a href="Nigel%20Godrich">Nigel Godrich</a>, who had assisted producer <a href="John%20Leckie">John Leckie</a> with "The Bends" and produced several Radiohead <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-sides</a>. Godrich said of the "Help Album" session: "Those things are the most inspiring, when you do stuff really fast and there's nothing to lose. We left feeling fairly euphoric. So after establishing a bit of a rapport work-wise, I was sort of hoping I would be involved with the next album." To promote "The Help Album", "Lucky" featured as the lead track on the "<a href="The%20Help%20Album%23The%20Help%20EP">Help EP</a>", which charted at number 51 after <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a> chose not to play it. This disappointed Radiohead singer <a href="Thom%20Yorke">Thom Yorke</a>, but he later said "Lucky" shaped the nascent sound and mood of their upcoming record: "'Lucky' was indicative of what we wanted to do. It was like the first mark on the wall."

Radiohead found touring stressful and took a break in January 1996. They sought to distance their new material from the introspective style of "The Bends". Drummer <a href="Philip%20Selway">Philip Selway</a> said: "There was an awful lot of soul-searching [on "The Bends"]. To do that again on another album would be excruciatingly boring." Yorke said at the time: "We could really fall back on just doing another miserable, morbid and negative record lyrically, but I don't really want to, at all. And I'm deliberately just writing down all the positive things that I hear or see. I'm not able to put them into music yet and I don't want to just force it."

The critical and commercial success of "The Bends" gave Radiohead the confidence to self-produce their third album. Their label <a href="Parlophone">Parlophone</a> gave them a £100,000 budget for recording equipment. Guitarist <a href="Jonny%20Greenwood">Jonny Greenwood</a> said "the only concept that we had for this album was that we wanted to record it away from the city and that we wanted to record it ourselves." According to guitarist <a href="Ed%20O%27Brien">Ed O'Brien</a>: "Everyone said, You'll sell six or seven million if you bring out "The Bends Pt 2", and we're like, 'We'll kick against that and do the opposite'." A number of producers, including major figures such as <a href="Scott%20Litt">Scott Litt</a>, were suggested, but the band were encouraged by their sessions with Godrich. They consulted him for advice on what equipment to use, and prepared for the sessions by buying their own equipment, including a <a href="Reverberation%23Plate%20reverberators">plate reverberator</a> purchased from songwriter <a href="Jona%20Lewie">Jona Lewie</a>. Although Godrich had sought to focus his work on <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">electronic dance music</a>, he outgrew his role as advisor and became the album's co-producer.

In July 1996, Radiohead started rehearsing and recording "OK Computer" in their Canned Applause studio, a converted shed near <a href="Didcot">Didcot</a>, Oxfordshire. Even without the deadline that contributed to the stress of "The Bends", the band had difficulties, which Selway blamed on their choice to self-produce: "We're jumping from song to song, and when we started to run out of ideas, we'd move on to a new song ... The stupid thing was that we were nearly finished when we'd move on, because so much work had gone into them." The members worked with nearly equal roles in the production and formation of the music, though Yorke was still firmly "the loudest voice" according to O'Brien. Selway said "we give each other an awful lot of space to develop our parts, but at the same time we are all very critical about what the other person is doing." Godrich's role as co-producer was part collaborator, part managerial outsider. He said that Radiohead "need to have another person outside their unit, especially when they're all playing together, to say when the take goes well ... I take up slack when people aren't taking responsibility—the term producing a record means taking responsibility for the record ... It's my job to ensure that they get the ideas across." Godrich has produced every Radiohead album since, and has been characterised as Radiohead's "sixth member", an allusion to <a href="George%20Martin">George Martin</a>'s nickname as the "<a href="fifth%20Beatle">fifth Beatle</a>".

Radiohead decided that Canned Applause was an unsatisfactory recording location, which Yorke attributed to its proximity to the band members' homes, and Jonny Greenwood attributed to its lack of dining and bathroom facilities. The group had nearly completed four songs: "Electioneering", "<a href="No%20Surprises">No Surprises</a>", "Subterranean Homesick Alien" and "The Tourist". At their label's request, they took a break from recording to embark on a 13-date American tour in 1996, opening for <a href="Alanis%20Morissette">Alanis Morissette</a>, and performed early versions of several new songs. One song, "<a href="Paranoid%20Android">Paranoid Android</a>", evolved from a fourteen-minute version with long organ solos into something closer to the six-minute version on the album.

During the tour, filmmaker <a href="Baz%20Luhrmann">Baz Luhrmann</a> commissioned Radiohead to write a song for his upcoming film "<a href="Romeo%20%2B%20Juliet">Romeo + Juliet</a>" and gave them the final 30 minutes of the film. Yorke said: "When we saw the scene in which <a href="Claire%20Danes">Claire Danes</a> holds the <a href="M1911%20pistol">Colt .45</a> against her head, we started working on the song immediately." Soon afterwards, the band wrote and recorded "Exit Music (For a Film)"; the track plays over the film's end credits but was excluded from the <a href="Romeo%20%2B%20Juliet%20%28soundtrack%29">soundtrack album</a> at the band's request. The song helped shape the direction of the rest of the album; Yorke said it "was the first performance we'd ever recorded where every note of it made my head spin—something I was proud of, something I could turn up really, really loud and not wince at any moment."

Radiohead resumed recording in September 1996 at <a href="St%20Catherine%27s%20Court">St Catherine's Court</a>, a historic mansion near <a href="Bath%2C%20Somerset">Bath</a> owned by actress <a href="Jane%20Seymour%20%28actress%29">Jane Seymour</a>. The mansion was unoccupied but sometimes used for corporate functions. The change of setting marked an important transition in the recording process. Greenwood, comparing the mansion to previous studio settings, said it "was less like a laboratory experiment, which is what being in a studio is usually like, and more about a group of people making their first record together."

The band made extensive use of the different rooms and acoustics in the house. The vocals on "Exit Music (For a Film)" feature natural <a href="reverberation">reverberation</a> achieved by recording on a stone staircase, and "Let Down" was recorded in a ballroom at 3 a.m. Isolation allowed the band to work at a different pace, with more flexible and spontaneous working hours. O'Brien said that "the biggest pressure was actually completing [the recording]. We weren't given any deadlines and we had complete freedom to do what we wanted. We were delaying it because we were a bit frightened of actually finishing stuff." Yorke was satisfied with the quality of the recordings made at the location, and enjoyed working without <a href="Stem%20mixing%20and%20mastering">audio separation</a>, meaning that instruments were not <a href="overdubbing">overdubbed</a> separately. O'Brien was similarly pleased with the recordings, estimating that 80 per cent of the album was recorded live, and said: "I hate doing overdubs, because it just doesn't feel natural. ... Something special happens when you're playing live; a lot of it is just looking at one another and knowing there are four other people making it happen." Many of Yorke's vocals were first takes; he felt that if he made other attempts he would "start to think about it and it would sound really lame."

Radiohead returned to Canned Applause in October for rehearsals, and completed most of "OK Computer" in further sessions at St. Catherine's Court. By Christmas, they had narrowed the track listing to 14 songs. The <a href="string%20section">string</a> parts were recorded at <a href="Abbey%20Road%20Studios">Abbey Road Studios</a> in London in January 1997. The album was <a href="audio%20mixing%20%28recorded%20music%29">mixed</a> over the next two months at various studios around the city, then <a href="audio%20mastering">mastered</a> by Chris Blair at Abbey Road. Godrich preferred a quick and "hands-off" approach to mixing, and said: "I feel like I get too into it. I start fiddling with things and I fuck it up ... I generally take about half a day to do a mix. If it's any longer than that, you lose it. The hardest thing is trying to stay fresh, to stay objective."

Yorke said that the starting point for the record was the "incredibly dense and terrifying sound" of "<a href="Bitches%20Brew">Bitches Brew</a>", the 1970 <a href="avant-garde%20jazz">avant-garde</a> <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a> album by <a href="Miles%20Davis">Miles Davis</a>. He described the sound of "Bitches Brew" to "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>": "It was building something up and watching it fall apart, that's the beauty of it. It was at the core of what we were trying to do with "OK Computer"." Yorke identified "I'll Wear It Proudly" by <a href="Elvis%20Costello">Elvis Costello</a>, "<a href="Fall%20on%20Me">Fall on Me</a>" by <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>, "<a href="Dress%20%28PJ%20Harvey%20song%29">Dress</a>" by <a href="PJ%20Harvey">PJ Harvey</a> and "<a href="A%20Day%20in%20the%20Life">A Day in the Life</a>" by the <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatles</a> as particularly influential on his songwriting. Radiohead drew further inspiration from the recording style of <a href="film%20soundtrack">film soundtrack</a> composer <a href="Ennio%20Morricone">Ennio Morricone</a> and the <a href="krautrock">krautrock</a> band <a href="Can%20%28band%29">Can</a>, musicians Yorke described as "abusing the recording process". Jonny Greenwood described "OK Computer" as a product of being "in love with all these brilliant records ... trying to recreate them, and missing."

According to Yorke, Radiohead hoped to achieve an "atmosphere that's perhaps a bit shocking when you first hear it, but only as shocking as the atmosphere on the <a href="the%20Beach%20Boys">Beach Boys</a>' "<a href="Pet%20Sounds">Pet Sounds</a>"." They expanded their instrumentation to include <a href="electric%20piano">electric piano</a>, <a href="Mellotron">Mellotron</a>, cello and other strings, <a href="glockenspiel">glockenspiel</a> and electronic effects. Jonny Greenwood summarised the exploratory approach as "when we've got what we suspect to be an amazing song, but nobody knows what they're gonna play on it." "Spin" characterised "OK Computer" as sounding like "a DIY electronica album made with guitars".

Critics suggested a stylistic debt to 1970s <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a>, an influence that Radiohead have disavowed. According to Andy Greene in "Rolling Stone", Radiohead "were collectively hostile to seventies progressive rock ... but that didn't stop them from reinventing prog from scratch on "OK Computer", particularly on the six-and-a-half-minute 'Paranoid Android'." Writing in 2017, "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>"s <a href="Kelefa%20Sanneh">Kelefa Sanneh</a> said "OK Computer" "was profoundly prog: grand and dystopian, with a lead single that was more than six minutes long."

The album's lyrics, written by Yorke, are more abstract compared to his personal, emotional lyrics for "The Bends". Critic <a href="Alex%20Ross%20%28music%20critic%29">Alex Ross</a> said the lyrics "seemed a mixture of overheard conversations, <a href="technobabble">techno-speak</a>, and fragments of a harsh diary" with "images of <a href="riot%20control">riot police</a> at political rallies, anguished lives in tidy suburbs, <a href="yuppie">yuppie</a>s freaking out, sympathetic aliens gliding overhead." Recurring themes include transport, technology, insanity, death, modern British life, <a href="globalisation">globalisation</a> and <a href="anti-capitalism">anti-capitalism</a>. Yorke said: "On this album, the outside world became all there was ... I'm just taking <a href="instant%20camera">Polaroids</a> of things around me moving too fast." He told "Q": "It was like there's a secret camera in a room and it's watching the character who walks in—a different character for each song. The camera's not quite me. It's neutral, emotionless. But not emotionless at all. In fact, the very opposite." Yorke also drew inspiration from books, including <a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>'s political writing, <a href="Eric%20Hobsbawm">Eric Hobsbawm</a>'s "<a href="The%20Age%20of%20Extremes">The Age of Extremes</a>", <a href="Will%20Hutton">Will Hutton</a>'s "The State We're In", <a href="Jonathan%20Coe">Jonathan Coe</a>'s "<a href="What%20a%20Carve%20Up%21%20%28novel%29">What a Carve Up!</a>" and <a href="Philip%20K.%20Dick">Philip K. Dick</a>'s "<a href="VALIS">VALIS</a>".

The songs of "OK Computer" do not have a coherent narrative, and the album's lyrics are generally considered abstract or oblique. Nonetheless, many musical critics, journalists, and scholars consider the album to be a <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a> or <a href="song%20cycle">song cycle</a>, or have analyzed it as a concept album, noting its strong thematic cohesion, aesthetic unity, and the structural logic of the song sequencing. Although the songs share common themes, Radiohead have said they do not consider "OK Computer" a concept album and did not intend to link the songs through a narrative or unifying concept while it was being written. Jonny Greenwood said: "I think one album title and one computer voice do not make a concept album. That's a bit of a red herring." However, the band intended the album to be heard as a whole, and spent two weeks ordering the track list. O'Brien said: "The context of each song is really important ... It's not a concept album but there is a continuity there."

The opening track, "<a href="Airbag%20%28song%29">Airbag</a>", is underpinned by a beat built from a seconds-long recording of Selway's drumming. The band sampled the drum track with a digital <a href="sampler%20%28musical%20instrument%29">sampler</a> and edited it with a <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computer, inspired by the music of <a href="DJ%20Shadow">DJ Shadow</a>, but admitted to making approximations in emulating Shadow's style due to their programming inexperience. The bassline stops and starts unexpectedly, achieving an effect similar to 1970s <a href="dub%20music">dub</a>. The song's references to automobile accidents and <a href="reincarnation">reincarnation</a> were inspired by a magazine article titled "An Airbag Saved My Life" and "<a href="The%20Tibetan%20Book%20of%20the%20Dead">The Tibetan Book of the Dead</a>". Yorke wrote "Airbag" about the illusion of safety offered by modern transit, and "the idea that whenever you go out on the road you could be killed." The BBC wrote of the influence of <a href="J.%20G.%20Ballard">J. G. Ballard</a>, especially his 1973 novel "<a href="Crash%20%28J.%20G.%20Ballard%20novel%29">Crash</a>" on the song's lyrical content. Music journalist <a href="Tim%20Footman">Tim Footman</a> notes the song's technical innovations and lyrical concerns demonstrate the "key paradox" of the album: "the musicians and producer are delighting in the sonic possibilities of modern technology; the singer, meanwhile, is railing against its social, moral, and psychological impact. ... It's a contradiction mirrored in the culture clash of the music, with the 'real' guitars negotiating an uneasy stand-off with the hacked-up, processed drums."

Split into four sections with an overall running time of 6:23, "<a href="Paranoid%20Android">Paranoid Android</a>" is among the band's longest songs. The unconventional structure was inspired by the Beatles' "<a href="Happiness%20Is%20a%20Warm%20Gun">Happiness Is a Warm Gun</a>" and <a href="Queen%20%28band%29">Queen</a>'s "<a href="Bohemian%20Rhapsody">Bohemian Rhapsody</a>", which also eschew a traditional verse-chorus-verse structure. Its musical style was also inspired by the music of the <a href="Pixies">Pixies</a>. The song was written by Yorke after an unpleasant night at a Los Angeles bar, where he saw a woman react violently after someone spilled a drink on her. Its title and lyrics are a reference to <a href="Marvin%20the%20Paranoid%20Android">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> from <a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a>'s "<a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>" series.

The use of electric keyboards in "Subterranean Homesick Alien" is an example of the band's attempts to emulate the atmosphere of "Bitches Brew". Its title references the <a href="Bob%20Dylan">Bob Dylan</a> song "<a href="Subterranean%20Homesick%20Blues">Subterranean Homesick Blues</a>", and the lyrics describe an isolated narrator who fantasises about being <a href="abduction%20phenomenon">abducted</a> by <a href="extraterrestrial%20life">extraterrestrials</a>. The narrator speculates that, upon returning to Earth, his friends would not believe his story and he would remain a misfit. The lyrics were inspired by an assignment from Yorke's time at <a href="Abingdon%20School">Abingdon School</a> to write a piece of "<a href="Martian%20poetry">Martian poetry</a>", a British literary movement that humorously recontextualises mundane aspects of human life from an alien perspective.

<a href="William%20Shakespeare">William Shakespeare</a>'s "<a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a>" inspired the lyrics for "Exit Music (For a Film)". Initially Yorke wanted to work lines from the play into the song, but the final draft of the lyrics became a broad summary of the narrative. He said: "I saw <a href="Romeo%20and%20Juliet%20%281968%20film%29">the Zeffirelli version</a> when I was 13 and I cried my eyes out, because I couldn't understand why, the morning after they shagged, they didn't just run away. It's a song for two people who should run away before all the bad stuff starts." Yorke compared the opening of the song, which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar, to <a href="Johnny%20Cash">Johnny Cash</a>'s "<a href="At%20Folsom%20Prison">At Folsom Prison</a>". <a href="Mellotron">Mellotron</a> choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track. The song climaxes with the entrance of drums and distorted bass run through a <a href="distortion%20%28music%29">fuzz pedal</a>. The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of <a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a> group <a href="Portishead%20%28band%29">Portishead</a>, but in a style that bass player <a href="Colin%20Greenwood">Colin Greenwood</a> called more "stilted and leaden and mechanical". The song concludes by fading back to Yorke's voice, acoustic guitar and Mellotron.

"Let Down" contains multilayered <a href="arpeggio">arpeggiated</a> guitars and electric piano. Jonny Greenwood plays his guitar part in a different <a href="time%20signature">time signature</a> to the other instruments. O'Brien said the song was influenced by <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a>, a producer and songwriter best known for his reverberating "<a href="Wall%20of%20Sound">Wall of Sound</a>" recording techniques. The song's lyrics are, Yorke said, "about that feeling that you get when you're in transit but you're not in control of it—you just go past thousands of places and thousands of people and you're completely removed from it." 

Of the line "Don't get sentimental / It always ends up drivel", Yorke said: "Sentimentality is being emotional for the sake of it. We're bombarded with sentiment, people emoting. That's the Let Down. Feeling every emotion is fake. Or rather every emotion is on the same plane whether it's a car advert or a pop song." Yorke felt that scepticism of emotion was characteristic of <a href="Generation%20X">Generation X</a> and said that it informed not just "Let Down" but the band's approach to the whole album.

"Karma Police" has two main verses that alternates with a subdued break, followed by a different ending section. The verses centre around acoustic guitar and piano, with a chord progression indebted to the Beatles' "<a href="Sexy%20Sadie">Sexy Sadie</a>". Starting at 2:34, the song transitions into an orchestrated section with the repeated line "For a minute there, I lost myself". It ends with guitarist <a href="Ed%20O%27Brien">Ed O'Brien</a> generating <a href="audio%20feedback">feedback</a> using a <a href="delay%20%28audio%20effect%29">delay</a> effect. The title and lyrics to "Karma Police" originate from an <a href="in-joke">in-joke</a> during "The Bends" tour; Jonny Greenwood said "whenever someone was behaving in a particularly shitty way, we'd say 'The <a href="karma">karma</a> police will catch up with him sooner or later.'"

"Fitter Happier" is a short <a href="musique%20concr%C3%A8te">musique concrète</a> track that consists of sampled musical and background sound and spoken-word lyrics recited by a <a href="speech%20synthesis">synthesised voice</a> from the Macintosh <a href="SimpleText">SimpleText</a> application. The voice belongs to "Fred", a synthesised voice included with <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers. Yorke wrote the lyrics "in ten minutes" after a period of <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a> while the rest of the band were playing. He described the words as a checklist of slogans for the 1990s, and he considered the lyrics "the most upsetting thing I've ever written", and said it was "liberating" to give the words to a neutral-sounding computer voice. Among the samples in the background is an audio loop from the 1975 film "<a href="Three%20Days%20of%20the%20Condor">Three Days of the Condor</a>". The band considered using "Fitter Happier" as the album's opening track, but decided the effect was off-putting.

Steve Lowe called the song "penetrating surgery on pseudo-meaningful corporations' lifestyles" with "a repugnance for prevailing yuppified social values". Among the loosely connected imagery of the lyrics, Footman identified the song's subject as "the materially comfortable, morally empty embodiment of modern, Western humanity, half-salaryman, half-<a href="The%20Stepford%20Wives">Stepford Wife</a>, destined for the metaphorical farrowing crate, propped up on <a href="Fluoxetine">Prozac</a>, <a href="Sildenafil">Viagra</a> and anything else his insurance plan can cover." Sam Steele called the lyrics "a stream of received imagery: scraps of media information, interspersed with lifestyle ad slogans and private prayers for a healthier existence. It is the hum of a world buzzing with words, one of the messages seeming to be that we live in such a synthetic universe we have grown unable to detect reality from artifice."

"Electioneering", featuring a <a href="cowbell%20%28instrument%29">cowbell</a> and a distorted guitar solo, is the album's most rock-oriented track and one of the heaviest songs Radiohead has recorded. It has been compared to Radiohead's earlier style on "Pablo Honey". The cynical "Electioneering" is the album's most directly political song, with lyrics inspired by the <a href="Poll%20Tax%20Riots">Poll Tax Riots</a>. The song was also inspired by Chomsky's "", a book analysing contemporary mass media under the <a href="propaganda%20model">propaganda model</a>. Yorke likened its lyrics, which focus on political and artistic compromise, to "a preacher ranting in front of a bank of microphones." Regarding its oblique political references, Yorke said, "What can you say about the <a href="International%20Monetary%20Fund">IMF</a>, or politicians? Or people selling arms to African countries, employing slave labour or whatever. What can you say? You just write down '<a href="Cattle%20prod">Cattle prod</a>s and the IMF' and people who know, know." O'Brien said the song was about the promotional cycle of touring: "After a while you feel like a politician who has to kiss babies and shake hands all day long."

"Climbing Up the Walls" – described by "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" as "monumental chaos" – is layered with a string section, ambient noise and repetitive, metallic percussion. The string section, composed by Jonny Greenwood and written for 16 instruments, was inspired by <a href="20th-century%20classical%20music">modern classical</a> composer <a href="Krzysztof%20Penderecki">Krzysztof Penderecki</a>'s "<a href="Threnody%20to%20the%20Victims%20of%20Hiroshima">Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima</a>". Greenwood said, "I got very excited at the prospect of doing string parts that didn't sound like '<a href="Eleanor%20Rigby">Eleanor Rigby</a>', which is what all string parts have sounded like for the past 30 years." "<a href="Select%20%28magazine%29">Select</a>" described Yorke's distraught vocals and the <a href="atonality">atonal</a> strings as "Thom's voice dissolving into a fearful, blood-clotted scream as Jonny whips the sound of a million dying elephants into a crescendo." For the lyrics, Yorke drew from his time as an orderly in a mental hospital during the <a href="Care%20in%20the%20Community">Care in the Community</a> policy of <a href="deinstitutionalisation">deinstitutionalizing</a> mental health patients, and a "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" article about serial killers. He said:

"No Surprises", recorded in a single take, is arranged with electric guitar (inspired by the Beach Boys' "<a href="Wouldn%27t%20It%20Be%20Nice">Wouldn't It Be Nice</a>"), acoustic guitar, glockenspiel and vocal harmonies. The band strove to replicate the mood of <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>'s 1968 recording of "<a href="What%20a%20Wonderful%20World">What a Wonderful World</a>" and the soul music of <a href="Marvin%20Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a>. Hoping to achieve a slower tempo than could be played well on their instruments, Godrich had the band record the song at a faster tempo, then slowed the playback for Yorke to <a href="overdubbing">overdub</a> his vocals onto, creating an "ethereal" effect. Yorke identified the subject of the song as "someone who's trying hard to keep it together but can't". The lyrics seem to portray a suicide or an unfulfilling life, and dissatisfaction with contemporary social and political order. Some lines refer to rural or suburban imagery. One of the key metaphors in the song is the opening line, "a heart that's full up like a <a href="landfill">landfill</a>"; according to Yorke, the song is a "fucked-up nursery rhyme" that "stems from my unhealthy obsession of what to do with plastic boxes and plastic bottles ... All this stuff is getting buried, the debris of our lives. It doesn't rot, it just stays there. That's how we deal, that's how I deal with stuff, I bury it." The song's gentle mood contrasts sharply with its harsh lyrics; Steele said, "even when the subject is suicide ... O'Brien's guitar is as soothing as balm on a red-raw psyche, the song rendered like a bittersweet child's prayer."

"<a href="Lucky%20%28Radiohead%20song%29">Lucky</a>" was inspired by the <a href="Bosnian%20War">Bosnian War</a>. Sam Taylor said it was "the one track on ["The Help Album"] to capture the sombre terror of the conflict", and that its serious subject matter and dark tone made the band "too 'real' to be allowed on the Britpop gravy train". The lyrics were pared down from many pages of notes, and were originally more politically explicit. The lyrics depict a man surviving an aeroplane crash and are drawn from Yorke's anxiety about transportation. The musical centerpiece of "Lucky" is its three-piece guitar arrangement, which grew out of the high-pitched chiming sound played by O'Brien in the song's introduction, achieved by strumming above the <a href="nut%20%28string%20instrument%29">guitar nut</a>. Critics have compared its lead guitar to <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> and, more broadly, <a href="arena%20rock">arena rock</a>.

The album ends with "The Tourist", which Jonny Greenwood wrote as an unusually staid piece where something "doesn't have to happen ... every three seconds." He said, "'The Tourist' doesn't sound like Radiohead at all. It has become a song with space." The lyrics, written by Yorke, were inspired by his experience of watching American tourists in France frantically trying to see as many tourist attractions as possible. He said it was chosen as the closing track because "a lot of the album was about background noise and everything moving too fast and not being able to keep up. It was really obvious to have 'Tourist' as the last song. That song was written to me from me, saying, 'Idiot, slow down.' Because at that point, I "needed" to. So that was the only resolution there could be: to slow down." The "unexpectedly bluesy waltz" draws to a close as the guitars drop out, leaving only drums and bass, and concludes with the sound of a small bell.

The title "OK Computer" is taken from the 1978 <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28radio%20series%29">"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" radio series</a>, in which the character <a href="Zaphod%20Beeblebrox">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a> speaks the phrase "Okay, computer, I want full manual control now." The members of Radiohead listened to the series on the bus during their 1996 tour and Yorke made a note of the phrase. "OK Computer" became a working title for the B-side "Palo Alto", which had been considered for inclusion on the album. The title stuck with the band; according to Jonny Greenwood, it "started attaching itself and creating all these weird resonances with what we were trying to do".

Yorke said the title "refers to embracing the future, it refers to being terrified of the future, of our future, of everyone else's. It's to do with standing in a room where all these appliances are going off and all these machines and computers and so on ... and the sound it makes." He described the title as "a really resigned, terrified phrase", to him similar to the <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> advertisement "<a href="I%27d%20Like%20to%20Teach%20the%20World%20to%20Sing%20%28In%20Perfect%20Harmony%29">I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing</a>". "<a href="Wired%20%28magazine%29">Wired</a>" writer Leander Kahney suggests that it is an homage to Macintosh computers, as the Mac's <a href="speech%20recognition">speech recognition</a> software responds to the command "OK computer" as an alternative to clicking the "OK" button. Other titles considered were "Ones and Zeroes"—a reference to the <a href="binary%20numeral%20system">binary numeral system</a>—and "Your Home May Be at Risk If You Do Not Keep Up Payments".

The "OK Computer" artwork is a computer-generated collage of images and text created by <a href="Stanley%20Donwood">Stanley Donwood</a> and Yorke, the latter credited under the pseudonym "The White Chocolate Farm". Yorke commissioned Donwood to work on a visual diary alongside the recording sessions. Yorke explained, "If I'm shown some kind of visual representation of the music, only then do I feel confident. Up until that point, I'm a bit of a whirlwind." The blue-and-white palette was, according to Donwood, the result of "trying to make something the colour of bleached bone". The image of two stick figures shaking hands appears in the booklet and on the compact disc itself. Yorke explained the image as emblematic of exploitation: "Someone's being sold something they don't really want, and someone's being friendly because they're trying to sell something. That's what it means to me." Explaining the artwork's themes, Yorke said, "It's quite sad, and quite funny as well. All the artwork and so on ... It was all the things that I hadn't said in the songs."

Visual motifs in the artwork include motorways, aeroplanes, families with children, corporate logos and cityscapes. The photograph of a motorway on the cover was likely taken in <a href="Hartford%2C%20Connecticut">Hartford, Connecticut</a>, where Radiohead performed in 1996. The words "Lost Child" feature prominently on the cover, and the booklet artwork contains phrases in the <a href="constructed%20language">constructed language</a> <a href="Esperanto">Esperanto</a> and health-related instructions in both English and Greek. "<a href="Uncut%20%28magazine%29">Uncut</a>" critic David Cavanagh said the use of <a href="non%20sequitur%20%28literary%20device%29">non-sequiturs</a> created an effect "akin to being lifestyle-coached by a lunatic." White scribbles, Donwood's method of correcting mistakes rather than using the computer function <a href="undo">undo</a>, are present everywhere in the collages. The <a href="liner%20notes">liner notes</a> contain the full lyrics, rendered with atypical syntax, alternate spelling and small annotations. The lyrics are also arranged and spaced in shapes that resemble hidden images. In keeping with the band's then-emerging <a href="anti-corporate%20activism">anti-corporate</a> stance, the production credits contain the ironic copyright notice "Lyrics reproduced by kind permission even though we wrote them."

According to Selway, Radiohead's American label <a href="Capitol%20Records">Capitol</a> saw the album as "'commercial suicide'. They weren't really into it. At that point, we got the fear. How is this going to be received?" Yorke said "when we first gave it to Capitol, they were taken aback. I don't really know why it's so important now, but I'm excited about it." Capitol lowered its sales forecast from two million to half a million. In O'Brien's view, only <a href="Parlophone">Parlophone</a>, the band's British label, remained optimistic while global distributors dramatically reduced their sales estimates. Label representatives were reportedly disappointed with the lack of marketable singles, especially the absence of anything resembling Radiohead's hit "<a href="Creep%20%28Radiohead%20song%29">Creep</a>". ""OK Computer" isn't the album we're going to rule the world with," Colin Greenwood predicted at the time. "It's not as hitting-everything-loudly-whilst-waggling-the-tongue-in-and-out, like "The Bends". There's less of the <a href="Van%20Halen">Van Halen</a> factor."

Parlophone launched an unorthodox advertising campaign, taking full-page advertisements in high-profile British newspapers and <a href="London%20Underground">tube stations</a> with lyrics for "Fitter Happier" in large black letters against white backgrounds. The same lyrics, and artwork adapted from the album, were repurposed for shirt designs. Yorke said they chose the "Fitter Happier" lyrics to link what a critic called "a coherent set of concerns" between the album artwork and its promotional material.

Other unconventional merchandise included a <a href="floppy%20disk">floppy disk</a> containing Radiohead <a href="screensaver">screensaver</a>s and an <a href="FM%20broadcasting">FM</a> radio in the shape of a <a href="desktop%20computer">desktop computer</a>. In America, Capitol sent 1,000 cassette players to prominent members of the press and music industry, each with a copy of the album permanently glued inside. Capitol president Gary Gersh said, "Our job is just to take them as a left-of-centre band and bring the centre to them. That's our focus, and we won't let up until they're the biggest band in the world."

Radiohead chose "<a href="Paranoid%20Android">Paranoid Android</a>" as the lead single, despite its unusually long running time and lack of a catchy chorus. Colin Greenwood said the song was "hardly the radio-friendly, breakthrough, buzz bin unit shifter [radio stations] can have been expecting," but that Capitol supported the choice. The song premiered on the Radio 1 programme "The Evening Session" in April 1997 and was released as a single in May 1997. On the strength of frequent radio play on Radio 1 and rotation of the song's <a href="music%20video">music video</a> on MTV, "Paranoid Android" reached number three in the UK, giving Radiohead their highest chart position.

Radiohead embarked on a world tour in promotion of "OK Computer," the "Against Demons" tour, commencing at the album launch in <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> on 22 May 1997. The tour took the band across the UK and Ireland, continental Europe, North America, Japan and Australasia, concluding on 18 April 1998 in New York. It also saw Radiohead's first headline <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival">Glastonbury Festival</a> performance; despite technical problems that almost caused Yorke to abandon the stage, the performance was acclaimed and cemented Radiohead as a major live act. The tour was taxing for the band, particularly Yorke, who said: "That tour was a year too long. I was the first person to tire of it, then six months later everyone in the band was saying it. Then six months after that, nobody was talking any more."

"OK Computer" was released in Japan on 21 May, in the UK on 16 June, in Canada on 17 June and in the US on 1 July. It was released on CD, double-LP vinyl record, <a href="Compact%20Cassette">cassette</a> and <a href="MiniDisc">MiniDisc</a>. It debuted at number one in the UK with sales of 136,000 copies in its first week. It held the number-one spot for two weeks and stayed in the top ten for several weeks afterward; ultimately, it became the country's eighth-best selling record of the year.

"<a href="Karma%20Police">Karma Police</a>" was released in August 1997 and "<a href="No%20Surprises">No Surprises</a>" in January 1998. Both singles charted in the UK top ten, and "Karma Police" peaked at number 14 on the "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" <a href="Alternative%20Songs">Modern Rock Tracks</a> chart. "Lucky" was released as a single in France, but did not chart. "Let Down", considered for release as the lead single, charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart at number 29. The band planned to produce a video for every song on the album, but the project was abandoned due to financial and time constraints. Also considered, but scrapped, were plans for <a href="trip%20hop">trip hop</a> group <a href="Massive%20Attack">Massive Attack</a> to <a href="remix">remix</a> the album. "<a href="Meeting%20People%20Is%20Easy">Meeting People Is Easy</a>", <a href="Grant%20Gee">Grant Gee</a>'s <a href="rockumentary">rockumentary</a> following the band on their "OK Computer" world tour, premiered in November 1998.

By February 1998, "OK Computer" had sold at least half a million copies in the UK and 2million worldwide. By September 2000, "Billboard" reported that the album had sold 4.5million copies worldwide. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" reported that by June 2001 it had sold 1.4 million copies in the US, and in April 2006 the <a href="International%20Federation%20of%20the%20Phonographic%20Industry">IFPI</a> announced the album had sold 3 million copies across Europe. It has been <a href="Music%20recording%20sales%20certification">certified</a> triple platinum in the UK and double platinum in the US, in addition to certifications in other markets. By May 2016, <a href="Nielsen%20SoundScan">Nielsen SoundScan</a> figures showed "OK Computer" had sold 2.5million digital album units in the US, plus an additional 900,000 sales measured in <a href="album-equivalent%20unit">album-equivalent unit</a>s. Twenty years to the week after its initial release, the <a href="Official%20Charts%20Company">Official Charts Company</a> had recorded total UK sales of 1.5million, including album-equivalent units. Tallying American and European sales, "OK Computer" has sold at least 6.9 million copies worldwide (or 7.8 million with album-equivalent units).

"OK Computer" received critical acclaim. Critics in the British and American press generally agreed that the album was a landmark and would have far-reaching impact and importance, and that its experimentalism made it a challenging listen. According to <a href="Tim%20Footman">Tim Footman</a>, "Not since 1967, with the release of "<a href="Sgt.%20Pepper%27s%20Lonely%20Hearts%20Club%20Band">Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</a>", had so many major critics agreed immediately, not only on an album's merits, but on its long-term significance, and its ability to encapsulate a particular point in history." In the English press, the album garnered favourable reviews in "<a href="NME">NME</a>", "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>", "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", and "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>". <a href="Nick%20Kent">Nick Kent</a> wrote in "<a href="Mojo%20%28magazine%29">Mojo</a>" that "Others may end up selling more, but in 20 years time I'm betting "OK Computer" will be seen as the key record of 1997, the one to take rock forward instead of artfully revamping images and song-structures from an earlier era." John Harris in "<a href="Select%20%28magazine%29">Select</a>" wrote: "Every word sounds achingly sincere, every note spewed from the heart, and yet it roots itself firmly in a world of steel, glass, <a href="random-access%20memory">random-access memory</a> and prickly-skinned paranoia."

The album was well received by critics in North America. "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>", "Spin", "<a href="Pittsburgh%20Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a>", "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" and the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28Arlington%20Heights%29">Daily Herald</a>" published positive reviews. In "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", <a href="Alex%20Ross%20%28music%20critic%29">Alex Ross</a> praised its progressiveness, and contrasted Radiohead's risk-taking with the musically conservative "dadrock" of their contemporaries <a href="Oasis%20%28band%29">Oasis</a>. Ross wrote that "Throughout the album, contrasts of mood and style are extreme ... This band has pulled off one of the great art-pop balancing acts in the history of rock."

Reviews for "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>", the "<a href="Chicago%20Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a>", and "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>" were mixed or contained qualified praise. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> from "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" said Radiohead immersed Yorke's vocals in "enough electronic marginal distinction to feed a coal town for a month" and to compensate for how soulless the songs are, resulting in "arid" <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a>. In an otherwise positive review, Andy Gill wrote for "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>:" "For all its ambition and determination to break new ground, "OK Computer" is not, finally, as impressive as "The Bends", which covered much the same sort of emotional knots, but with better tunes. It is easy to be impressed by, but ultimately hard to love, an album that luxuriates so readily in its own despondency."

"OK Computer" was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award">Grammy Award</a>s as <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Album%20of%20the%20Year">Album of the Year</a> and <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Alternative%20Music%20Album">Best Alternative Music Album</a> at the <a href="40th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">40th Annual Grammy Awards</a> in 1998, winning the latter. It was also nominated for Best British Album at the <a href="1998%20Brit%20Awards">1998 Brit Awards</a>. The album was shortlisted for the 1997 <a href="Mercury%20Prize">Mercury Prize</a>, a prestigious award recognising the best British or Irish album of the year. The day before the winner was announced, oddsmakers had given "OK Computer" the best chance to win among ten nominees, but it lost to "<a href="New%20Forms">New Forms</a>" by <a href="Roni%20Size">Roni Size</a>/<a href="Reprazent">Reprazent</a>.

The album appeared in many 1997 critics' lists and listener polls for best album of the year. It topped the year-end polls of "Mojo", "<a href="Vox%20%28magazine%29">Vox</a>", "Entertainment Weekly", "<a href="Hot%20Press">Hot Press</a>", "<a href="Muziekkrant%20OOR">Muziekkrant OOR</a>", "<a href="HUMO">HUMO</a>", "<a href="Eye%20Weekly">Eye Weekly</a>" and "<a href="Inpress">Inpress</a>", and tied for first place with <a href="Daft%20Punk">Daft Punk</a>'s "<a href="Homework%20%28Daft%20Punk%20album%29">Homework</a>" in "<a href="The%20Face%20%28magazine%29">The Face</a>". The album came second in "NME", "Melody Maker", "Rolling Stone", "<a href="Village%20Voice">Village Voice</a>", "<a href="Spin%20%28magazine%29">Spin</a>" and "Uncut". "Q" and "<a href="Les%20Inrockuptibles">Les Inrockuptibles</a>" both listed the album in their unranked year-end polls.

Praise for the album overwhelmed the band; Greenwood felt the praise had been exaggerated because "The Bends" had been "under-reviewed possibly and under-received." They rejected links to <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> and <a href="art%20rock">art rock</a>, despite frequent comparisons made to Pink Floyd's 1973 album "<a href="The%20Dark%20Side%20of%20the%20Moon">The Dark Side of the Moon</a>". Yorke responded: "We write pop songs ... there was no intention of it being 'art'. It's a reflection of all the disparate things we were listening to when we recorded it." He was nevertheless pleased that listeners identified the album's influences: "What really blew my head off was the fact that people got all the things, all the textures and the sounds and the atmospheres we were trying to create."

"OK Computer" has appeared frequently in professional lists of greatest albums. A number of publications, including "NME", "Melody Maker", "<a href="Alternative%20Press%20%28music%20magazine%29">Alternative Press</a>", "Spin", "Pitchfork", "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", "<a href="Metro%20Weekly">Metro Weekly</a>" and "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>" placed "OK Computer" prominently in lists of best albums of the 1990s or of all time. In 2003, the album was ranked number 162 on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>" magazine's list of <a href="The%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>. Retrospective reviews from <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a>, "<a href="The%20A.V.%20Club">The A.V. Club</a>" and "Slant" have received the album favourably; likewise, "Rolling Stone" gave the album five stars in the 2004 edition of "<a href="The%20Rolling%20Stone%20Album%20Guide">The Rolling Stone Album Guide</a>", with critic <a href="Rob%20Sheffield">Rob Sheffield</a> saying "Radiohead was claiming the high ground abandoned by <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, <a href="Pearl%20Jam">Pearl Jam</a>, <a href="U2">U2</a>, <a href="R.E.M.">R.E.M.</a>, everybody; and fans around the world loved them for trying too hard at a time when nobody else was even bothering." "Most would rate "OK Computer" the apogee of <a href="postmodern%20music">pomo</a> texture", Christgau said in retrospect. According to <a href="Acclaimed%20Music">Acclaimed Music</a>, a site which uses statistics to numerically represent reception among critics, "OK Computer" is the 8th most celebrated album of all time. It also ranks as the number 1 album of all time on database and community site <a href="Rate%20Your%20Music">Rate Your Music</a>. In 2015, the United States <a href="National%20Recording%20Preservation%20Board">National Recording Preservation Board</a> selected the album for preservation in the <a href="National%20Recording%20Registry">National Recording Registry</a> of the <a href="Library%20of%20Congress">Library of Congress</a>, which designates it as a sound recording that has had significant cultural, historical, or aesthetic impact in American life.

The album has been cited by some as undeserving of its acclaim. In a poll surveying thousands conducted by <a href="BBC%20Radio%206%20Music">BBC Radio 6 Music</a>, "OK Computer" was named the sixth most overrated album "in the world". David H. Green of "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" called the album "self-indulgent whingeing" and maintains that the positive critical consensus toward "OK Computer" is an indication of "a 20th-century delusion that rock is the bastion of serious commentary on popular music" to the detriment of electronic and <a href="electronic%20dance%20music">dance music</a>. The album was selected as an entry in "Sacred Cows", an "NME" column questioning the critical status of "revered albums", in which Henry Yates said "there's no defiance, gallows humour or chink of light beneath the curtain, just a sense of meek, resigned despondency," and criticised the record as "the moment when Radiohead stopped being 'good' [compared to "The Bends"] and started being 'important'." In a "Spin" article on the "myth" that "Radiohead Can Do No Wrong", Chris Norris argues that the acclaim for "OK Computer" inflated expectations for subsequent Radiohead releases. In Christgau's opinion, "the reason the readers of the British magazine "Q" absurdly voted "OK Computer" the greatest album of the 20th century is that it integrated what was briefly called electronica into rock." Having deemed it "self-regarding" and overrated, he later warmed to the record a little bit, specifically three or four songs, while finding the music in general to be indicative of Radiohead's cerebral sensibility and "rife with discrete pleasures and surprises."

"OK Computer" was recorded in the lead up to the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201997">1997 general election</a> and released a month after the victory of <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a>'s <a href="New%20Labour">New Labour</a> government. The album was perceived by critics as an expression of dissent and scepticism toward the new government and a reaction against the national mood of optimism. Dorian Lynskey wrote, "On May 1, 1997, Labour supporters toasted their landslide victory to the sound of '.' A few weeks later, "OK Computer" appeared like <a href="Banquo">Banquo</a>'s ghost to warn: "No, things can only get worse"." According to Amy Britton, the album "showed not everyone was ready to join the party, instead tapping into another feeling felt throughout the UK—pre-millennial angst. ... huge corporations were impossible to fight against—this was the world "OK Computer" soundtracked, not the wave of British optimism."

In an interview, Yorke doubted that Blair's policies would differ from the preceding two decades of <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> government. He said the public reaction to the <a href="Death%20of%20Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">death</a> of <a href="Diana%2C%20Princess%20of%20Wales">Princess Diana</a> was more significant, as a moment when the British public realised "the <a href="British%20Royal%20Family">royals</a> had had us by the balls for the last hundred years, as had the media and the state." The band's distaste with the commercialised promotion of "OK Computer" reinforced their anti-capitalist politics, which would be further explored on their subsequent releases.

Critics have compared Radiohead's statements of political dissatisfaction to those of earlier rock bands. <a href="David%20Stubbs">David Stubbs</a> said that, where <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> had been a rebellion against a time of deficit and poverty, "OK Computer" protested the "mechanistic convenience" of contemporary surplus and excess. Alex Ross said the album "pictured the onslaught of the <a href="Information%20Age">Information Age</a> and a young person's panicky embrace of it" and made the band into "the <a href="poster%20child">poster boys</a> for a certain kind of knowing alienation—as <a href="Talking%20Heads">Talking Heads</a> and R.E.M. had been before." <a href="Jon%20Pareles">Jon Pareles</a> of "The New York Times" found precedents in the work of Pink Floyd and <a href="Madness%20%28band%29">Madness</a> for Radiohead's concerns "about a culture of numbness, building docile workers and enforced by <a href="self-help">self-help</a> regimes and <a href="antidepressant">anti-depressants</a>."

Many felt the tone of the album was millennial or <a href="futurism">futuristic</a>, anticipating cultural and political trends. According to "The A.V. Club" writer Steven Hyden in the feature "Whatever Happened to Alternative Nation", "Radiohead appeared to be ahead of the curve, forecasting the paranoia, media-driven insanity, and omnipresent sense of impending doom that's subsequently come to characterise everyday life in the 21st century." In "<a href="1000%20Recordings%20to%20Hear%20Before%20You%20Die">1000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die</a>", <a href="Tom%20Moon">Tom Moon</a> described "OK Computer" as a "prescient ... <a href="dystopia">dystopia</a>n essay on the darker implications of technology ... oozing [with] a vague sense of dread, and a touch of <a href="Big%20Brother%20%28Nineteen%20Eighty-Four%29">Big Brother</a> foreboding that bears strong resemblance to the constant disquiet of life on <a href="Homeland%20Security%20Advisory%20System">Security Level Orange</a>, <a href="post-9/11">post-9/11</a>." <a href="Chris%20Martin">Chris Martin</a> of <a href="Coldplay">Coldplay</a> remarked that, "It would be interesting to see how the world would be different if <a href="Dick%20Cheney">Dick Cheney</a> really listened to Radiohead's "OK Computer". I think the world would probably improve. That album is fucking brilliant. It changed my life, so why wouldn't it change his?"

The album inspired a <a href="radio%20drama">radio play</a>, also titled "OK Computer", which was first broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> in 2007. The play, written by <a href="Joel%20Horwood">Joel Horwood</a>, Chris Perkins, <a href="Al%20Smith%20%28playwright%29">Al Smith</a> and Chris Thorpe, interprets the album's 12 tracks into a story about a man who awakens in a Berlin hospital with memory loss and returns to England with doubts that the life he's returned to is his own.

The release of "OK Computer" coincided with the decline of <a href="Britpop">Britpop</a>. Through "OK Computer"s influence, the dominant UK guitar pop shifted toward an approximation of "Radiohead's paranoid but confessional, slurry but catchy" approach. Many newer British acts adopted similarly complex, atmospheric arrangements; for example, the <a href="post-Britpop">post-Britpop</a> band <a href="Travis%20%28band%29">Travis</a> worked with Godrich to create the languid pop texture of "<a href="The%20Man%20Who">The Man Who</a>", which became the fourth best-selling album of 1999 in the UK. Some in the British press accused Travis of appropriating Radiohead's sound. Steven Hyden of "AV Club" said that by 1998, starting with "The Man Who", "what Radiohead had created in "OK Computer" had already grown much bigger than the band," and that the album went on to influence "a wave of British-rock balladeers that reached its zenith in the '00s".

"OK Computer"s popularity influenced the next generation of British alternative rock bands, and established musicians in a variety of genres have praised it. <a href="Bloc%20Party">Bloc Party</a> and <a href="TV%20on%20the%20Radio">TV on the Radio</a> said they were formatively influenced by "OK Computer;" TV on the Radio's debut album was titled "<a href="OK%20Calculator">OK Calculator</a>" as a lighthearted tribute. Radiohead described the pervasiveness of bands that "sound like us" as one reason to break with the style of "OK Computer" for their next album, "<a href="Kid%20A">Kid A</a>".

Although "OK Computer"s influence on rock musicians is widely acknowledged, several critics believe that its experimental inclination was not authentically embraced on a wide scale. Footman said the "Radiohead Lite" bands that followed were "missing ["OK Computer"] sonic inventiveness, not to mention the lyrical substance." David Cavanagh said that most of "OK Computer"s purported mainstream influence more likely stemmed from the ballads on "The Bends". According to Cavanagh, "The populist albums of the post-"OK Computer" era—the <a href="The%20Verve">Verve</a>'s "<a href="Urban%20Hymns">Urban Hymns</a>", Travis's "<a href="Good%20Feeling%20%28album%29">Good Feeling</a>", <a href="Stereophonics">Stereophonics</a>' "<a href="Word%20Gets%20Around">Word Gets Around</a>", <a href="Robbie%20Williams">Robbie Williams</a>' "<a href="Life%20thru%20a%20Lens">Life thru a Lens</a>"—effectively closed the door that "OK Computer"s boffin-esque inventiveness had opened." <a href="John%20Harris%20%28critic%29">John Harris</a> believed that "OK Computer" was one of the "fleeting signs that British rock music might [have been] returning to its inventive traditions" in the wake of Britpop's demise. While Harris concludes that British rock ultimately developed an "altogether more conservative tendency", he said that with "OK Computer" and their subsequent material, Radiohead provided a "clarion call" to fill the void left by Britpop.

"OK Computer" triggered a minor revival of <a href="progressive%20rock">progressive rock</a> and ambitious <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>s, with a new wave of prog-influenced bands crediting "OK Computer" for enabling their scene to thrive. <a href="Brandon%20Curtis">Brandon Curtis</a> of <a href="Secret%20Machines">Secret Machines</a> said, "Songs like 'Paranoid Android' made it OK to write music differently, to be more experimental ... "OK Computer" was important because it reintroduced unconventional writing and song structures." <a href="Steven%20Wilson">Steven Wilson</a> of <a href="Porcupine%20Tree">Porcupine Tree</a> said, "I don't think ambition is a dirty word any more. Radiohead were the Trojan Horse in that respect. Here's a band that came from the indie rock tradition that snuck in under the radar when the journalists weren't looking and started making these absurdly ambitious and pretentious—and all the better for it—records." In 2005, "<a href="Q%20%28magazine%29">Q</a>" named "OK Computer" the tenth best progressive rock album.

Radiohead left <a href="EMI">EMI</a>, parent company of Parlophone, in 2007 after failed contract negotiations. EMI retained the copyright to Radiohead's back catalogue of material recorded while signed to the label. After a period of being <a href="out%20of%20print">out of print</a> on vinyl, EMI <a href="reissue">reissue</a>d a double LP of "OK Computer" on 19 August 2008, along with later albums "Kid A", "<a href="Amnesiac%20%28album%29">Amnesiac</a>" and "<a href="Hail%20to%20the%20Thief">Hail to the Thief</a>", as part of the "From the Capitol Vaults" series. "OK Computer" became the year's tenth bestselling vinyl record, selling almost 10,000 units. The reissue was connected in the press to a general climb in vinyl sales and cultural appreciation of records as a format.

EMI reissued "OK Computer" again on 24 March 2009, alongside "Pablo Honey" and "The Bends", without Radiohead's involvement. The reissue came in two editions: a 2-CD "Collector's Edition" and a 2-CD 1-DVD "Special Collector's Edition". The first disc contains the original studio album, the second disc contains <a href="A-side%20and%20B-side">B-sides</a> collected from "OK Computer" singles and live recording sessions, and the DVD contains a collection of music videos and a live television performance. All the material on the reissue had been previously released.

O'Brien said that EMI had not notified Radiohead of the reissue and that it was "just a company who are trying to squeeze every bit of lost money, it's not about [an] artistic statement". He pointed out that fans already had access to the bonus material on <a href="YouTube">YouTube</a>. Press reaction to the reissue expressed concern that EMI was exploiting Radiohead's back catalogue. Larry Fitzmaurice of "Spin" accused EMI of planning to "issue and reissue [Radiohead's] discography until the cash stops rolling in". "Pitchfork"s Ryan Dombal said it was "hard to look at these reissues as anything other than a cash-grab for EMI/Capitol—an old media company that got dumped by their most forward-thinking band." Daniel Kreps of "Rolling Stone" defended the release, saying: "While it's easy to accuse Capitol of milking the cash cow once again, these sets are pretty comprehensive."

The reissue was critically well received, although reception was mixed about the supplemental material. Reviews in <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a>, "Uncut", "Q", "Rolling Stone", "<a href="Paste%20%28magazine%29">Paste</a>" and "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" praised the supplemental material, but with reservations. A review written by Scott Plagenhoef for "Pitchfork" awarded the reissue a perfect score, arguing that it was worth buying for fans who did not already own the rare material. Plagenhoef said, "That the band had nothing to do with these is beside the point: this is the final word on these records, if for no other reason that the <a href="The%20Beatles%20Stereo%20Box%20Set">Beatles' September 9 remaster campaign</a> is, arguably, the end of the CD era." "The A.V. Club" writer Josh Modell praised both the bonus disc and the DVD, and said of the album, "It really is the perfect synthesis of Radiohead's seemingly conflicted impulses."

In April 2016, <a href="XL%20Recordings">XL Recordings</a> acquired Radiohead's back catalogue recorded under EMI. The "collector's editions" of Radiohead albums, issued without Radiohead's approval, were removed from streaming services. In May 2016, XL reissued Radiohead's back catalogue on vinyl, including "OK Computer".

On 2 May 2017, Radiohead and XL announced a 20th-anniversary "OK Computer" reissue, "<a href="OK%20Computer%20OKNOTOK%201997%202017">OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017</a>". The reissue includes a remastered version of the album, plus eight B-sides and three previously unreleased tracks: "<a href="I%20Promise%20%28Radiohead%20song%29">I Promise</a>," "<a href="Man%20of%20War%20%28song%29">Man of War</a>", and "<a href="Lift%20%28Radiohead%20song%29">Lift</a>". The special edition includes books of artwork and notes and an <a href="Compact%20Cassette">audio cassette</a> of demos and session recordings, including previously unreleased songs. "OKNOTOK" debuted at number two on the <a href="UK%20Albums%20Chart">UK Album Chart</a>, boosted by Radiohead's third headline performance at <a href="Glastonbury%20Festival%202017">Glastonbury Festival</a>. It was the bestselling album in independent UK record shops for a year.

Dream of the Rarebit Fiend

Dream of the Rarebit Fiend is a newspaper <a href="comic%20strip">comic strip</a> by American cartoonist <a href="Winsor%20McCay">Winsor McCay</a>, begun September 10, 1904. It was McCay's second successful strip, after "<a href="Little%20Sammy%20Sneeze">Little Sammy Sneeze</a>" secured him a position on the cartoon staff of the "<a href="New%20York%20Herald">New York Herald</a>". "Rarebit Fiend" appeared in the "<a href="New%20York%20World-Telegram">Evening Telegram</a>", a newspaper published by the "Herald". For contractual reasons, McCay signed the strip with the pen name "Silas".

The strip had no <a href="continuity%20%28fiction%29">continuity</a> or recurring characters, but a recurring theme: a character has a nightmare or other bizarre dream, usually after eating a <a href="Welsh%20rarebit">Welsh rarebit</a>—a cheese-on-toast dish. The character awakens in the closing panel and regrets having eaten the rarebit. The dreams often reveal unflattering sides of the dreamers' <a href="psyche%20%28psychology%29">psyche</a>s—their <a href="phobia">phobia</a>s, <a href="Hypocrisy">hypocrisies</a>, discomforts, and dark fantasies. This was in great contrast to the colorful fantasy dreams in McCay's signature strip "<a href="Little%20Nemo">Little Nemo</a>", which he began in 1905. Whereas children were "Nemo"s target audience, McCay aimed "Rarebit Fiend" at adults.

The popularity of "Rarebit Fiend" and "Nemo" led to McCay gaining a contract in 1911 with <a href="William%20Randolph%20Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>'s chain of newspapers with a star's salary. His editor there thought McCay's highly skilled cartooning "serious, not funny", and had McCay give up comic strips in favor of editorial cartooning. McCay revived the strip in 1923–1925 as "Rarebit Reveries", of which few examples have survived.

A number of film adaptations of "Rarebit Fiend" have appeared, including <a href="Edwin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BS.%20Porter">Edwin S. Porter</a>'s live-action "<a href="Dream%20of%20a%20Rarebit%20Fiend%20%281906%20film%29">Dream of a Rarebit Fiend</a>" in 1906, and four pioneering animated films by McCay himself: "<a href="How%20a%20Mosquito%20Operates">How a Mosquito Operates</a>" in 1912, and 1921's "Bug Vaudeville", "The Pet", and "The Flying House". The strip is said to have anticipated a number of recurring ideas in popular culture, such as marauding giant beasts damaging cities—as later popularized by "<a href="King%20Kong%20%281933%20film%29">King Kong</a>" and "<a href="Godzilla%20%281954%20film%29">Godzilla</a>".

Winsor McCay first produced "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend" in 1904, a year before the dream romps of his "Little Nemo" and a full generation before the artists of the <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist movement</a> unleashed the <a href="Unconscious%20mind">unconscious</a> on the public. The strip had no recurring characters, but followed a theme: after eating a Welsh rarebit, the day's protagonist would be subject to the darker side of his or her psyche. Typically, the strip would begin with an absurd situation which became more and more absurd until the Fiend—the dreamer—awakened in the final panel. Some situations were merely silly: elephants falling from the ceiling, or two women's mink coats having a fight. Other times, they could be more disturbing: characters finding themselves <a href="Dismemberment">dismembered</a>, <a href="Premature%20burial">buried alive</a> from a first-person perspective or a child's mother being planted and becoming a tree. In some strips the Fiend was a spectator watching fantastic or horrible things happen to someone close to . The protagonists are typically urban <a href="bourgeoisie">bourgeoisie</a> whom McCay subjects to fears of public humiliation or loss of social esteem or respectability.

"Rarebit Fiend" was the only one of McCay's strips in which he approached social or political topics, or dealt with contemporary life. He addressed religious leaders, alcoholism, homelessness, political speeches, suicide, fashion, and other topics, whereas his other strips were fantasy or had seemingly vague, timeless backgrounds. The strip referenced contemporary events such as the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201904">1904 election</a> of <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>; the recently built <a href="Flatiron%20Building">Flatiron Building</a> (1902) and <a href="St.%20Regis%20Hotel">St. Regis Hotel</a> (1904) in New York City; and the <a href="Russo-Japanese%20War">Russo-Japanese War</a> of 1904–05.

The rarebit is a dish typically made with rich cheese thinned with <a href="ale">ale</a> and served melted on toast with <a href="Cayenne%20pepper">cayenne</a> and <a href="Mustard%20seed">mustard</a> mixed in. McCay used it despite its innocuousness—cultural theorist <a href="Scott%20Bukatman">Scott Bukatman</a> states rarebit was not the sort of dish a person would associate with having nightmares.

McCay's most famous character, Little Nemo, first appeared in the first year of "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend", on December 10, 1904. In 1905, McCay had Nemo appear in his own strip in the "New York Herald". In comparison to "Little Nemo", the artwork of the "Rarebit Fiend" strips had minimal backgrounds, and were usually done from a static perspective with the main characters often in a fixed position. The content of "Rarebit Fiend" played a much bigger role than it did in "Little Nemo", whose focus was on beautiful visuals. The stories were self-contained, whereas the "Nemo" story continued from week to week. The dreams in "Nemo" were aimed at children, but "Rarebit Fiend" had adult-oriented subjects—social embarrassment, <a href="Necrophobia">fear of dying</a> or going insane, and so on. Some of the dreams in both strips were <a href="Wish%20fulfillment">wish-fulfillment</a> fantasies.

Unlike most comic strips from the time, "Rarebit Fiend" is not humorous or <a href="Escapism">escapist</a>. The strips highlight readers' darker selves—hypocrisies, deceitfulness, phobias, and discomfort. They offer often biting social commentary and show marital, money, and religious matters in a negative light. McCay had an interest in pushing formal boundaries, and playful <a href="Self-reference">self-referentiality</a> plays a role in many of the strips; characters sometimes refer to McCay's alter-ego "Silas" or to the reader. Though frequent in "Rarebit Fiend", this self-referentiality does not appear in McCay's other strips.

In contrast to the skilled artwork, the lettering in the <a href="Speech%20balloon">dialogue balloons</a>, as in McCay's other work, was awkward and could approach illegibility, especially in reproductions, where the artwork has normally been greatly reduced in size. McCay seemed to show little regard for the dialogue balloons, their content, and their placement in the composition. They tend to contain repetitive monologues expressing the increasing distress of the speakers, and show that McCay's gift was in the visual and not the verbal.

McCay began cartooning in the 1890s and had a prolific output published in magazines and newspapers. He became known for his ability to draw quickly, a talent he often employed during <a href="chalk%20talk">chalk talk</a>s on the <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> stage (alongside the likes of <a href="Harry%20Houdini">Harry Houdini</a> and <a href="W.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BC.%20Fields">W. C. Fields</a>). Before "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend" and "Little Nemo", McCay had shown an interest the topic of dreams. Some of his earlier work, numbering at least 10 regular comic strips, had titles such as "Daydreams" and "It Was Only a Dream". McCay's were not the first dream-themed comic strips to be published: McCay's employer, the "New York Herald", had printed at least three such strips, beginning with Charles Reese's "Drowsy Dick" in 1902. <a href="Psychoanalysis">Psychoanalysis</a> and <a href="dream%20interpretation">dream interpretation</a> had begun to enter the public consciousness with the 1900 publication of <a href="Sigmund%20Freud">Freud</a>'s "<a href="The%20Interpretation%20of%20Dreams">Interpretation of Dreams</a>".

McCay first proposed a strip in which a tobacco fiend finds himself at the North Pole, unable to secure a cigarette and a light. In the last panel he awakens to find it a dream. The "Herald" asked McCay to make a series of the strip, but with a Welsh rarebit theme instead of tobacco, and McCay complied. The strip appeared in a "Herald" subsidiary, the "Evening Telegram", and the "Herald"s editor required McCay to use a <a href="Pen%20name">pseudonym</a> for the strip work to keep it separate from his other work. McCay signed "Rarebit Fiend" strips as "Silas", a name he borrowed from a neighborhood garbage cart driver. After switching to William Randolph Hearst's "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York American</a>" newspaper in 1911, McCay dropped the "Silas" pseudonym and signed his work with his own name.

McCay married in 1891, and the marriage was not a happy one. According to McCay biographer John Canemaker, McCay depicts marriage in "Rarebit Fiend" as "a minefield of hypocrisy, jealousy, and misunderstanding". McCay was a short man, barely five feet () tall. He was dominated by his wife, who stood as tall as he was. Images of small, shy men dominated by their taller or fatter wives appear frequently in "Rarebit Fiend". Gigantism, with characters overwhelmed by rapidly growing elements, was another recurring motif, perhaps as compensation on McCay's part for a sense of smallness. McCay's brother Arthur had been put in a mental asylum, which may have inspired the themes of insanity that are common in the strip.

Despite the strip's bleak view, McCay's work was so popular that William Randolph Hearst hired him in 1911 with a star's salary. Hearst editor <a href="Arthur%20Brisbane">Arthur Brisbane</a> deemed McCay's work "serious, not funny", and had the cartoonist give up his comic strips (including "Rarebit Fiend" and "Nemo") to work full-time illustrating editorials.

Scholars such as Claude Moliterni, Ulrich Merkl, Alfredo Castelli, and others have hunted down what they believe to have influenced McCay's work on "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend". Among the possible influences are <a href="Edward%20Lear">Edward Lear</a>'s popular "The Book of Nonsense" (1870), <a href="Gelett%20Burgess">Gelett Burgess</a>' "The Burgess Nonsense Book" (1901), <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>" (1865) (particularly the pool of tears scene, which seems related to the flood of sweat in one early "Rarebit Fiend" strip), and a variety of dream cartoons and illustrations that appeared in various periodicals McCay was likely familiar with.

The most probable immediate influence on the strip was "Welsh Rarebit Tales" (1902) by Harle Oren Cummins. Cummins stated he drew inspiration for this collection of 15 science fiction stories from nightmares brought on by eating Welsh rarebit and lobster—making further likely the influence, as several post-"Herald" strips from 1911 and 1912 were titled "Dream of a Lobster Fiend".

Other influences that have been established include <a href="H.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BG.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a>, <a href="L.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BFrank%20Baum">L. Frank Baum</a>'s "<a href="The%20Wonderful%20Wizard%20of%20Oz">The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</a>" (1900), <a href="J.%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BM.%20Barrie">J. M. Barrie</a>'s "<a href="Peter%20and%20Wendy">Peter Pan</a>" (1904), <a href="Carlo%20Collodi">Carlo Collodi</a>'s "<a href="The%20Adventures%20of%20Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>" (1883), <a href="Arthur%20Conan%20Doyle">Arthur Conan Doyle</a>'s "<a href="Sherlock%20Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and the Engineer's Thumb" (1889), <a href="Henryk%20Sienkiewicz">Henryk Sienkiewicz</a>'s "<a href="Quo%20Vadis%20%28novel%29">Quo Vadis</a>" (1896), <a href="Robert%20Louis%20Stevenson">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>'s "<a href="Strange%20Case%20of%20Dr%20Jekyll%20and%20Mr%20Hyde">Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</a>" (1886), and <a href="Mark%20Twain">Mark Twain</a>'s "The 1,000,000 Pound Bank-Note" (1893).

McCay never acknowledged the influence of Sigmund Freud, whose "The Interpretation of Dreams" had been published in 1900. According to McCay scholar Ulrich Merkl, it is likely McCay was aware of the Viennese doctor's theories, as they had been widely reported and talked about in the New York newspaper world McCay was a part of.

"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend" was McCay's longest running comic strip. He made over 300 more "Rarebit Fiend" episodes than he made of the more famous "Little Nemo". The first strip appeared on September 10, 1904, in the "New York Herald", a few months after the first appearance of McCay's "Little Sammy Sneeze". It was McCay's second successful newspaper strip, after "Sammy Sneeze" landed him a position on the cartooning staff of the "Herald". "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend" ran in the "Evening Telegram", which was published by the "Herald" at the time.

The strip appeared two to three times a week. It typically filled a quarter of a newspaper page on weekdays, and half a page on Saturdays. The strip normally appeared in black-and-white, but 29 of the strips appeared in color throughout 1913, run weekly in the "Herald". These were strips drawn between 1908 and 1911 which the "Evening Telegram" had neglected to print. McCay sometimes encouraged readers to submit dream ideas, to be sent care of the "Herald" to "Silas the Dreamer". McCay acknowledged the submissions he accepted with a "thanks to ..." on the strip beside his own signature. Among those credited were science fiction pioneer <a href="Hugo%20Gernsback">Hugo Gernsback</a>.

"Dream of the Rarebit Fiend" initial run continued until 1911. It appeared again in various papers between 1911 and 1913 under other titles, such as "Midsummer Day Dreams" and "It Was Only a Dream". From 1923 to 1925 McCay revived the strip under the title "Rarebit Reveries". Though signed "Robert Winsor McCay Jr." (McCay's son), the strips appear to be in McCay's own hand, with the possible exception of the lettering. McCay had also signed some of his animation and editorial cartoons with his son's name. As of 2007 only seven examples of "Rarebit Reveries" were known, though it is nearly certain others were printed.

The earliest collection, titled "Dreams of the Rarebit Fiend", appeared in 1905 from <a href="Frederick%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BA.%20Stokes">Frederick A. Stokes</a> and reprinted 61 of the strips. <a href="Dover%20Publications">Dover Publications</a> reprinted this collection in 1973 in a 10% enlarged edition with new introductory material. The Dover edition dropped the final strip from the original collection as it contained <a href="Ethnic%20joke">ethnic humor</a> that the publisher believed would not be to the taste of a 1970s audience.

"Rarebit Fiend" examples appear in "Daydreams and Nightmares" (<a href="Fantagraphics%20Books">Fantagraphics</a>, 1988/2006; editor <a href="Rick%20Marschall">Richard Marschall</a>), a collection of miscellaneous work by McCay. <a href="Checker%20Book%20Publishing%20Group">Checker Books</a> reprinted many of the "Rarebit Fiend" strips over eight volumes of the series "Winsor McCay: Early Works" and in 2006 reprinted 183 of the color Saturday strips in "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend: The Saturdays". The Checker books reprinted all but about 300 of the known "Rarebit Fiend" strips.

In July 2007, German art historian Ulrich Merkl self-published a , 464-page volume called "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend", reproducing 369 of the strips in full size. Previous reprintings of the strip reduced the strips to about a third of their originally published size, resulting in loss of detail and making the lettering hard to read. The size of the book made automatic <a href="Bookbinding">binding</a> impossible, so it had to be bound by hand. The book was limited to 1000 copies, and a DVD was included with <a href="Image%20scanner">scans</a> of the 821 known installments of the strip, the complete text of the book, a "<a href="catalogue%20raisonn%C3%A9">catalogue raisonné</a>" of the strips, and a video of an example of McCay's animation. The sources of the strips were from Merkl's personal collection, the <a href="Billy%20Ireland%20Cartoon%20Library%20%26amp%3B%20Museum">Cartoon Research Library</a> of the <a href="Ohio%20State%20University">Ohio State University</a>, and <a href="Microform">microfilms</a> purchased from the <a href="New%20York%20Public%20Library">New York Public Library</a> containing the complete "New York Evening Journal" run of the strip. Merkl has said that, on average, six hours were required per strip for scanning and <a href="Conservation-restoration%20of%20cultural%20heritage">restoration</a>. The book also featured two essays by Italian comics editor Alfredo Castelli and one by Jeremey Taylor, former president of the International Association for the Study of Dreams.

McCay's work was very popular. It was adapted to film by McCay and others, and was optioned for Broadway. A "comic opera or musical extravanganza" called "Dream of the Welsh Rarebit Fiend" went unproduced, though McCay signed a contract to collaborate on it with music by Max Hirschfeld and lyrics by George Henry Payne and Robert Gilbert Welch.

Film pioneer <a href="Edwin%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BS.%20Porter">Edwin S. Porter</a> produced a seven-minute live-action film adaptation called "The Dream of a Rarebit Fiend" in 1906 for the <a href="Edison%20Studios">Edison Company</a>. The Fiend was played by John P. Brawn, who is tormented by imps in his bed, which flies through the air and leaves him hanging from a steeple—a scene similar to that of an early strips that ran on January 28, 1905.

McCay produced four hand-drawn animated films based upon his "Rarebit Fiend" series:

Put together in December 1911, and released in 1912, McCay's <a href="How%20a%20Mosquito%20Operates">second film</a> (also known as "The Story of a Mosquito") is one of the earliest examples of line-drawn animation. A giant top-hatted mosquito flies in through a window to feed on a man in bed, who tries in vain to defend himself. The mosquito drinks itself so full that it explodes. Rather than expanding like a balloon, the mosquito fills up in a naturalistic fashion according to its body structure. The idea for the film came from a "Rarebit Fiend" strip published on June 5, 1909. McCay biographer John Canemaker commends McCay for his ability to imbue the mosquito with character and a personality.

In the fantasy "Bug Vaudeville", a tramp comes out from a group of meticulously drawn trees and falls asleep, muttering that cheese cakes give him strange dreams. A series of bugs put on performance after performance against highly detailed and realistic backgrounds. The performance ends with a spider who grabs a silhouetted member of the audience and eats him whole.

The film was released in 1921, and draws from McCay's experiences in the worlds of the circus and vaudeville. The film is presented as a vaudeville show, though without the stage interaction McCay used in "<a href="Gertie%20the%20Dinosaur">Gertie the Dinosaur</a>". Film critic <a href="Andrew%20Sarris">Andrew Sarris</a> praised "Bug Vaudeville" as his favorite of McCay's films for "the linear expressiveness of the drawings and the intuitive rhythm of the acts". Sarris wrote that a director like <a href="Federico%20Fellini">Federico Fellini</a> "would be honored by such insight into the ritual of performance".

"The Pet" depicts a couple who adopt a mysterious animal with an insatiable appetite. It consumes its milk, the house cat, the house's furnishings, rat poison, and passing vehicles, including airplanes and a blimp, while growing larger and larger. As it wanders among the skyscrapers of the city a swarm of airplanes and <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a>s gather to bomb the beast.

A "Rarebit Fiend" strip from March 8, 1905, inspired "The Pet", which was released in 1921. The dark film was the last over which McCay had "total creative control", according to McCay biographer <a href="John%20Canemaker">John Canemaker</a>. Cartoonist <a href="Stephen%20R.%20Bissette">Stephen R. Bissette</a> called it "the first-ever 'giant monster attacking a city' motion picture ever made".

Against the backdrop of the rapidly urbanizing United States of the 1910s and 1920s, one house from the artificial grid of modern, planned America takes flight in the dream of a woman who has feasted on Welsh rarebit. "The Flying House" is rendered in meticulous realistic detail. The house is conventional in every respect—until the viewer reaches the attic, where the woman's husband is seen tending an enormous engine. He attaches a propeller to a shaft out front of the house, and tells his wife that his actions are in reaction to their landlord's intention to evict them over nonpayment. He says he plans to "steal the house", and the couple fly away to find a place where their landlord will never find them—a swamp, the ocean, even the moon, where they are chased off by the <a href="Man%20in%20the%20Moon">Man in the Moon</a> with a flyswatter. The film self-consciously directs the viewers to notice the quality and accuracy of the animation when the house takes off into space, calling attention to the "remarkable piece of animation which follows", accurately showing the revolutions of the Earth and Moon and the "beautiful constellation of <a href="Orion%20%28constellation%29">Orion</a>". The woman becomes anxious that they will become "lost in the sky". In the end, the house is struck by a military rocket, bringing the nightmare to an end as the woman awakens in her bed.

The film was released in 1921, and was credited to McCay's son <a href="Bob%20McCay">Robert</a>, though Canemaker states it is unlikely the elder McCay was not involved. A 1921 "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">New York Times</a>" review found the film "interesting because of its excellent workmanship and fantastic character" though it was "not as brightly humorous" as it could be. Film critic <a href="Richard%20Eder">Richard Eder</a> contrasted the film's realistic nightmarishness with the more innocent qualities that came to be associated with American cartoons. In 2011, animator <a href="Bill%20Plympton">Bill Plympton</a> restored the film, using <a href="Kickstarter">Kickstarter</a> to fund the project. He had the film <a href="Film%20colorization">colorized</a>, and actors <a href="Matthew%20Modine">Matthew Modine</a> and <a href="Patricia%20Clarkson">Patricia Clarkson</a> provided voices.

The Edison Military Band performed a piece called "Dream of the Rarebit Fiend" on an <a href="Phonograph%20cylinder">Edison cylinder</a> (Edison 9585) in 1907, written by Thomas W. Thurban. The music was likely inspired by Porter's 1906 film, and may have been intended to accompany it. The piece was written for an 18–20-piece band, and has been recorded numerous times.

"Rarebit Fiend" set up a formula which McCay was to use in the better-known "Little Nemo". A large number of the Nemo strips used ideas recycled from "Rarebit Fiend", such as the October 31, 1907, "walking bed" episode, which was used in the July 26, 1908, episode of "Little Nemo".

Comics scholar Jeet Heer called "Rarebit Fiend" "perhaps the most bizarre newspaper feature in American history". Merkl notes examples of the strip presaging ideas and scenes in later media: the strip includes scenes in which a man kicks a dog, slaps a woman, beats a blind man, and throws another woman out a window, as in <a href="Luis%20Bu%C3%B1uel">Luis Buñuel</a>'s film "<a href="L%27Age%20d%27Or">L'Age d'Or</a>" (1930); and giant characters let loose in the big city, climbing and damaging buildings and subway trains, as in "<a href="King%20Kong%20%281933%20film%29">King Kong</a>" (1933). Merkl compares the strip for March 9, 1907, in which a child's bedroom becomes a lion-infested jungle, to the 1950 <a href="Ray%20Bradbury">Ray Bradbury</a> story "<a href="The%20Veldt%20%28short%20story%29">The Veldt</a>", and the strip from September 26, 1908, depicting a stretchable face, to <a href="Salvador%20Dal%C3%AD">Salvador Dalí</a>'s surrealist painting "Soft self-portrait with fried bacon" (1941) and the <a href="Plastic%20surgery">cosmetic surgeries</a> in <a href="Terry%20Gilliam">Terry Gilliam</a>'s "<a href="Brazil%20%281985%20film%29">Brazil</a>". Stephen R. Bissette compares a strip featuring elevators flying from buildings and other scenes to the 2005 <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a> <a href="Charlie%20and%20the%20Chocolate%20Factory%20%28film%29">take on "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"</a>.

The strip was most likely an influence on episodes of <a href="Frank%20King%20%28cartoonist%29">Frank King</a>'s early comic strip "Bobby Make-Believe". Many scholars believe that <a href="Carl%20Barks">Carl Barks</a>, a professed fan of "Little Nemo", was likely exposed to "Rarebit Fiend", which appeared in "<a href="The%20San%20Francisco%20Examiner">The San Francisco Examiner</a>", which Barks read growing up. Several episodes of Barks's <a href="Donald%20Duck%20in%20comics">Donald Duck strips</a> appear to have taken their subjects from "Rarebit Fiend". Many scenes from animated films by <a href="Tex%20Avery">Tex Avery</a> from between 1943 and 1954 are said to show clearly a "Rarebit Fiend" influence. Science fiction illustrator <a href="Frank%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BR.%20Paul">Frank R. Paul</a> painted a number of <a href="pulp%20magazine">pulp magazine</a> covers influenced by "Rarebit Fiend".

<a href="Art%20Spiegelman">Art Spiegelman</a> paid parodic homage to "Rarebit Fiend" in his 1974 strip "<a href="Breakdowns%20%28comics%29">Real Dream</a>". In 1991, <a href="Rick%20Veitch">Rick Veitch</a> began producing short comics based on his dreams. Beginning in 1994, he put out twenty-one issues of "Roarin' Rick's Rare Bit Fiends" from his own King Hell Press. <a href="John%20Ashbery">John Ashbery</a> published a poem titled "Dream of a Rarebit Fiend."

Interstate 8

Interstate 8 (I-8) is an <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway</a> in the <a href="southwestern%20United%20States">southwestern United States</a>. It runs from the southern edge of <a href="Mission%20Bay%2C%20San%20Diego%2C%20California">Mission Bay</a> at Sunset Cliffs Boulevard in <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, California, almost at the Pacific Ocean, to the junction with <a href="Interstate%2010">I-10</a>, just southeast of <a href="Casa%20Grande%2C%20Arizona">Casa Grande, Arizona</a>. In California, the freeway travels through the San Diego metropolitan area as the Ocean Beach Freeway and the Mission Valley Freeway before traversing the <a href="Cuyamaca%20Mountains">Cuyamaca Mountains</a> and providing access through the <a href="Imperial%20Valley">Imperial Valley</a>, including the city of <a href="El%20Centro%2C%20California">El Centro</a>. Crossing the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> into <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a>, I-8 continues through the city of <a href="Yuma%2C%20Arizona">Yuma</a> across the <a href="Sonoran%20Desert">Sonoran Desert</a> to Casa Grande, in between the cities of <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> and <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson</a>.

The first route over the Cuyamaca Mountains was dedicated in 1912, and a <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> served as the first road across the Imperial Valley to Yuma; east of there, the <a href="Gila%20Trail">Gila Trail</a> continued east to <a href="Gila%20Bend%2C%20Arizona">Gila Bend</a>. These were later replaced by <a href="U.S.%20Route%2080%20in%20California">U.S. Route 80</a> (US 80) across California and part of Arizona, and <a href="Arizona%20State%20Route%2084">Arizona State Route 84</a> (SR 84) between Gila Bend and Casa Grande. The US 80 freeway through San Diego was largely complete by the time it was renumbered as I-8 in the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>; east of San Diego, the US 80 roadway was slowly replaced by I-8 as construction progressed in the Imperial Valley. The Arizona portion of the road was built starting in the 1960s. Several controversies erupted during the construction process; questionable labor practices in Imperial County led to the federal conviction of mobster <a href="Jimmy%20Fratianno">Jimmy Fratianno</a>, and a <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> subcommittee found that the Arizona government had mismanaged financial resources.

The route was completed in 1975 through California, and by 1977 through Arizona, though the bridge over the Colorado River was not completed until 1978. Since then, the freeway through San Diego has been widened due to increasing congestion, and another portion in Imperial County had to be rebuilt following damage by the remnants of <a href="Hurricane%20Kathleen%20%281976%29">Hurricane Kathleen</a>.

I-8 is part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. The freeway from the eastern junction with <a href="California%20State%20Route%26amp%3Bnbsp%3B98">California State Route 98</a> (SR 98) to the eastern end is designated as part of the <a href="Juan%20Bautista%20de%20Anza%20National%20Historic%20Trail">Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail</a> auto tour route, promoted by the <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a>.

The freeway begins at the intersection of Sunset Cliffs Boulevard and Nimitz Boulevard in San Diego. For its first few miles, it parallels the <a href="San%20Diego%20River">San Diego River</a> floodway. Near <a href="Old%20Town%20San%20Diego">Old Town San Diego</a>, I-8 intersects with I-5 as well as with Rosecrans Avenue, the former routing of <a href="California%20State%20Route%20209">SR 209</a>. As the freeway enters <a href="Mission%20Valley">Mission Valley</a>, it continues eastward, bisecting the area known as "Hotel Circle" that has several hotels. I-8 then has interchanges with <a href="California%20State%20Route%20163">SR 163</a>, <a href="Interstate%20805">I-805</a>, and <a href="Interstate%2015%20in%20California">I-15</a> and its continuation, SR 15, before making a small bend to the north. In <a href="La%20Mesa%2C%20California">La Mesa</a>, the route intersects <a href="California%20State%20Route%20125">SR 125</a>. I-8 continues into <a href="El%20Cajon%2C%20California">El Cajon</a>, where it intersects with <a href="California%20State%20Route%2067">SR 67</a> before it ascends into the mountains and the <a href="Cleveland%20National%20Forest">Cleveland National Forest</a>, traveling through towns such as <a href="Alpine%2C%20California">Alpine</a> and <a href="Pine%20Valley%2C%20California">Pine Valley</a>, reaching high points at <a href="Laguna%20Summit">Laguna Summit</a>, <a href="Crestwood%20Summit">Crestwood Summit</a>, and <a href="Tecate%20Divide">Tecate Divide</a>, crossing the <a href="Pine%20Valley%20Creek%20Bridge">Pine Valley Creek Bridge</a> and passing near the <a href="Viejas%20Casino">Viejas Casino</a>. A <a href="United%20States%20Border%20Patrol%20interior%20checkpoints">U.S. border patrol interior checkpoint</a> was constructed in 1995 near Alpine, for westbound traffic on I-8; however, this resulted in smugglers driving the wrong way on I-8 at high speeds in order to avoid the checkpoint, causing several crashes, even after concrete barriers were installed. The freeway intersects with <a href="California%20State%20Route%2079">SR 79</a> in the national forest before passing through the <a href="La%20Posta%20Indian%20Reservation">La Posta</a> and <a href="Campo%20Indian%20Reservation">Campo</a> Indian reservations. In <a href="Boulevard%2C%20California">Boulevard</a>, I-8 has an interchange with the eastern end of <a href="California%20State%20Route%2094">SR 94</a>.

I-8 straddles the <a href="San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">San Diego</a>–<a href="Imperial%20County%2C%20California">Imperial</a> county line for a few miles before turning east. At the Mountain Springs/In Ko Pah grade, the freeway is routed down two separate canyons—<a href="Devils%20Canyon%20%28Jacumba%20Mountains%29">Devils Canyon</a> for westbound traffic and <a href="In-Ko-Pah%20Gorge">In-Ko-Pah Gorge</a> for eastbound traffic—as it descends in . In places, the median is over wide. This portion of the road is known for high winds through the canyons that have made driving difficult, sometimes resulting in closure of the freeway; in 1966, the <a href="California%20Highway%20Patrol">California Highway Patrol</a> estimated that winds blew at speeds of up to . The route enters the Imperial Valley, where it intersects with SR 98, a highway leading to <a href="Calexico%2C%20California">Calexico</a>, and passes near the <a href="Desert%20View%20Tower">Desert View Tower</a>. I-8 then goes through <a href="Coyote%20Wells%2C%20California">Coyote Wells</a> before entering the city of <a href="El%20Centro%2C%20California">El Centro</a> several miles later.

In El Centro, I-8 intersects with <a href="California%20State%20Route%2086">SR 86</a> and <a href="California%20State%20Route%20111">SR 111</a>, both north–south routes which connect to <a href="Interstate%2010%20in%20California">I-10</a> in the <a href="Coachella%20Valley">Coachella Valley</a>, north of the <a href="Salton%20Sea">Salton Sea</a>. <a href="California%20State%20Route%20115">SR 115</a> and SR 98 end at I-8 east of El Centro. The route also has the lowest above-ground elevation of any Interstate at <a href="below%20sea%20level">below sea level</a> near El Centro. The freeway then traverses the <a href="Imperial%20Sand%20Dunes%20Recreation%20Area">Imperial Sand Dunes Recreation Area</a> and intersects with <a href="California%20State%20Route%20186">SR 186</a> leading south to <a href="Baja%20California%20Norte">Baja California Norte</a>, Mexico. I-8 runs parallel to the <a href="All-American%20Canal">All-American Canal</a> across the desert for roughly . At points in eastern Imperial County, the <a href="Mexico%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">Mexican border</a> is less than half a mile () south of the Interstate. I-8 then passes through <a href="Felicity%2C%20California">Felicity</a> and <a href="Winterhaven%2C%20California">Winterhaven</a> before crossing the <a href="Colorado%20River">Colorado River</a> on a bridge into <a href="Yuma%2C%20Arizona">Yuma, Arizona</a>.

I-8 is part of the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a> and is eligible for the <a href="State%20Scenic%20Highway%20System%20%28California%29">State Scenic Highway System</a> from <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">I-5</a> to the western junction of SR 98, though it is not an official state scenic highway. It is officially known as the Border Friendship Route from San Diego to the Arizona state line. The Interstate is signed as the Ocean Beach Freeway west of I-5. For the entire length within San Diego County and into Imperial County, it is signed as the Kumeyaay Highway, after <a href="Kumeyaay%20people">the local Native American tribe</a> and their traditional trade route which the Interstate follows. Between Old Town and El Cajon, I-8 is called the Mission Valley Freeway. In 2014, I-8 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 11,800 vehicles between Bonds Corner Road and SR 115, as well as between SR 98 and Imperial Highway, and 239,000 vehicles between I-805 and I-15, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in California.

I-8 enters Arizona from California at the Colorado River bridge at Yuma. It initially heads south through Yuma until the interchange with <a href="U.S.%20Route%2095%20in%20California">US 95</a>, where the freeway begins to turn to the east and passes through eastern Yuma and <a href="Fortuna%20Foothills%2C%20Arizona">Fortuna Foothills</a>, briefly paralleling US 95 and passing through a second border inspection station. West of <a href="Wellton%2C%20Arizona">Wellton</a>, the highway takes a northeasterly course, paralleling the <a href="Gila%20River">Gila River</a> and passing to the south of <a href="Roll%2C%20Arizona">Roll</a>. Through this part of Arizona, I-8 passes along the northern edge of the <a href="Barry%20M.%20Goldwater%20Air%20Force%20Range">Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range</a> and to the south of the <a href="Yuma%20Proving%20Ground">Yuma Proving Ground</a>. It keeps a northeastern heading, passing through the community of <a href="Dateland%2C%20Arizona">Dateland</a>, until it reaches <a href="Gila%20Bend%2C%20Arizona">Gila Bend</a>. There, the freeway intersects <a href="Arizona%20State%20Route%2085">SR 85</a> heading north to <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix</a> and south to the <a href="Organ%20Pipe%20Cactus%20National%20Monument">Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument</a>.

After leaving Gila Bend, I-8 takes a southeastern course as it passes through the <a href="Sonoran%20Desert%20National%20Monument">Sonoran Desert National Monument</a>. Exiting the national monument grounds, the highway continues on an easterly bearing to a junction with <a href="Arizona%20State%20Route%2084">SR 84</a>, a highway that parallels I-8 to the north and goes through <a href="Casa%20Grande%2C%20Arizona">Casa Grande</a>, while I-8 passes to the south of both <a href="Stanfield%2C%20Arizona">Stanfield</a> and Casa Grande. I-8 reaches its eastern terminus southeast of <a href="Casa%20Grande%20Mountain%20Park">Casa Grande Mountain Park</a> at an interchange with <a href="Interstate%2010%20in%20Arizona">I-10</a>, which continues south to <a href="Tucson%2C%20Arizona">Tucson</a>, and north to Phoenix.

The combination of SR 85 between I-10 and I-8 as well as I-8 between SR 85 and I-10 in Casa Grande has been promoted as a bypass of the Phoenix area for long-distance travelers on I-10. In 2014, I-8 had an AADT of 5,200 vehicles between Butterfield Trail and Freeman Road, and 44,400 vehicles between <a href="Arizona%20State%20Route%20280">SR 280</a> and Araby Road east of Yuma, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway in Arizona. In the early 2010s, I-8 from Casa Grande to Gila Bend was sometimes used for smuggling both drugs and humans.

The I-8 designation was accepted as a <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System%23Chargeable%20and%20non-chargeable%20Interstate%20routes">chargeable Interstate</a> by the <a href="American%20Association%20of%20State%20Highway%20Officials">American Association of State Highway Officials</a> in 1957, and was added to the state highway system in 1964 by the <a href="California%20State%20Legislature">California State Legislature</a>; the US 80 designation was removed at that time.

The freeway that would become I-8 was constructed in the mid-20th century through the San Diego area. The section west of I-5 was originally part of SR 109, and was added to I-8 in 1972. In later years, the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans) made efforts to widen the freeway as congestion increased.

Much of Alvarado Canyon Road from San Diego to La Mesa was originally built between 1947 and 1950, a bypass of the old US 80 routing along El Cajon Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard. Work began to convert the original US 80 <a href="divided%20highway">divided highway</a> into a freeway in 1960, and the freeway was complete west of El Cajon by April 1962. Priority was given to planning US 80 in 1962 by the <a href="California%20Chamber%20of%20Commerce">California Chamber of Commerce</a>. In 1964, I-8 was officially designated by the California State Legislature, and the US 80 designation was removed. By 1965, I-8 from Fairmount Avenue to El Cajon Boulevard was one of the first freeway stretches in the county to have a center barrier installed in the median.

The Ocean Beach Freeway section west of I-5 was authorized as Route 286 in 1959. In 1962, four alternate routes were proposed for this part of the freeway, and for Rosecrans Street. Route 286 was renumbered to SR 109 in the 1964 renumbering. Plans for the Old Town interchange between I-5 (formerly US 101), I-8 (formerly US 80), SR 209 (Rosecrans Street), and SR 109 date from 1962, although several concerns had to be taken into account, including the preservation of historical <a href="Old%20Town%20%28San%20Diego%29">Old Town</a> and keeping traffic through the area moving during construction. The goal was to begin the process in 1966, and complete the interchange in 1969. There were concerns about a $3 million shortfall in funding (about $ in dollars) during May 1966, which caused the San Diego Chamber of Commerce Highway Committee to recommend the completion of SR 109 as a project. This was projected to be the final highway project before I-5 was completed in San Diego County.

The building phase started on September 22, 1966, on the interchange that was to replace the intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street. The cost of the interchange was projected to be $10.86 million (about $ in dollars). SR 109 was planned to follow Camino del Rio up to the Frontier traffic circle, where the city of San Diego would resume construction; both SR 109 and SR 209 were to be built in the future. The eight-lane freeway was projected to relieve traffic in the Frontier Street area coming from the <a href="Valley%20View%20Casino%20Center">San Diego Sports Arena</a>. <a href="Construction%20bidding">Bidding</a> for the SR 109 contract was to begin in 1968, after the City Council endorsed the route in December 1967. Completion of both the interchange and SR 109 was planned for early 1969. An interchange was planned at Midway Drive, and the western end of the freeway was to be at Sunset Cliffs and Nimitz boulevards. The cost of the SR 109 project was estimated to be $2.3 million (about $ in dollars).
The ramp from south I-5 to Camino del Rio opened in February 1968, and a second ramp from southbound I-5 to eastbound I-8 opened in August 1968, with the remainder of the project to be completed in summer 1969. The groundbreaking for the Ocean Beach Freeway took place on September 23, 1968, with the estimated completion to take place within 15 months. However, rain in February 1969 delayed many construction projects across the county, including the SR 109 extension. The entire project was completed in September, with the road scheduled to open in October. The routing of SR 109 was officially added to I-8 in 1972.

Even before the freeway was complete in California, bidding began in 1964 on widening I-8 from six to eight lanes between near Fairmount Avenue and Spring Street, in San Diego and La Mesa. Three years later, a contract was granted for the widening of the Fairmount Avenue to Ward Road stretch, adding two lanes to the freeway. In 1974, the San Diego City Council reached an agreement with state officials to improve I-8 from east of Pacific Highway to Texas Street, over the objections of Councilman Floyd Morrow, who objected to solving traffic issues by continuing to expand freeways. The cost was estimated to be $8 million (about $ in dollars).

The La Mesa City Council asked the state to modify the interchange with SR 125 in 1974; the original interchange did not allow for access to SR 125 from I-8 east or to I-8 west from SR 125. Widening of the portion from SR 125 to El Cajon Boulevard to five lanes in each direction was under way in October. By 1981, the <a href="environmental%20impact%20report">environmental impact report</a> had been completed, and the $50 million (about $ in dollars) project to add ramps and widen I-8 was awaiting clearance from the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. Additional ramps to SR 67 were nearing completion in May 1985, and were completed to I-15 north in October. In 1986, the project revamping the SR 125 interchange was under way, at a cost of $80 million (about $ in dollars); it would add two more lanes to I-8 from Jackson Drive to Fuerte Drive, and allow for SR 125 to be extended north past I-8.

By 1977, traffic had reached 172,300 vehicles a day, which had increased by nearly 10 percent over the previous year. It was hoped that the construction of <a href="California%20State%20Route%2052">SR 52</a> would help to reduce the congestion. A revised Mission Gorge Road eastbound exit opened in 1979, merging with traffic from I-15. Traffic reached 212,000 vehicles a day by February 1981, and Caltrans declared I-8 east of I-805 the busiest highway in the region. In 1987, Caltrans determined that I-8 west between College Avenue and Waring Road had the highest ratio of cars to number of lanes worldwide, at 2400 cars per hour. Plans to add another lane to I-8 west from College Avenue to I-15 began in March 1992.

Caltrans proposed the installation of a metered <a href="traffic%20signal">traffic signal</a> on I-8 west in Lakeside during 1987, in order to improve traffic flow in the mornings by inserting a short delay before entering San Diego should the rate exceed 2,000 vehicles per hour. However, the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter, following several concerns from the public, and from state senator Jim Ellis.

A <a href="stagecoach%20road">stagecoach road</a> existed into the 19th century that passed through the mountains east of San Diego. Before the freeway was constructed, the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains; it was officially dedicated in 1912. This trip was known to take up to four hours, and frequently resulted in the <a href="Radiator%23Engine%20cooling">radiator</a> boiling over, flat tires, or broken <a href="fan%20belt">fan belt</a>s; inclement weather would result in cars becoming mired in the mud. The road was paved in 1926, and was open by 1927; remnants of this road were still present in the late 20th century. Another road was built in the early 1930s, to remove curves and widen the lanes. This was a two-lane road that still had many <a href="hairpin%20turn">switchbacks</a>, with one popularly known as "Dead Man's Curve". Construction of I-8 took place atop much of the roadbed of the highway from the early 1930s. The delay in extending a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California, according to the "<a href="San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">San Diego Union</a>".

Completion of the freeway was the second highest priority according to the Highway Development Association in May 1963, after the I-5 freeway. Bidding began on the portion from Broadway in El Cajon to Harritt Road in September 1963. This section of the freeway was to parallel <a href="U.S.%20Route%2080%20in%20California">US 80</a> to the south up to Lakeview Road, and then to the north. This portion of the freeway was scheduled to be complete by May 1965. By January 1965, I-8 had been completed from I-5 east to an interchange with Lake Jennings Park Road, just south of the latter's intersection with the southern terminus of Harritt Road. At a cost of $3.44 million (about $ in dollars), the project reduced the grade and curves at what was known as "Tunnel Hill" that hindered the flow of traffic. The part of the freeway from west of Harritt Road to west of Alpine was up for bidding in October 1964, and the Highway Commission set aside $2.1 million (about $ in dollars) for this stretch in February 1965. A contract for $1.42 million (about $ in dollars) was issued in August 1965. The entire stretch from Lake Jennings Road to Harbison Canyon Road was under construction by September 1965 and was scheduled to be complete by the next year.

In the Mountain Springs pass between San Diego and Imperial counties, the eastbound lanes traverse the pass on the former roadbed of US 80 through <a href="In-Ko-Pah%20Gorge">In-Ko-Pah Gorge</a> near <a href="Myer%20Creek%20%28Coyote%20Wash%20tributary%29">Myers Creek</a>. The westbound lanes were placed on a different routing through <a href="Devils%20Canyon%20%28Jacumba%20Mountains%29">Devil's Canyon</a> that had been constructed by November 1963. A contract for paving the from the San Diego–Imperial county line to SR 98, including the eastbound lanes, was given to the Isbell Construction Company for $3.69 million (about $ in dollars) in May 1963. This portion was completed in May 1965 "through some of the most rugged, hottest sections of San Diego and Imperial counties," according to "The San Diego Union". Construction ran into difficulties following concerns regarding potential landslides. The westbound lanes were built first, and temporarily contained both directions of traffic while the old highway was converted into the eastbound lanes. The "<a href="Los%20Angeles%20Times">Los Angeles Times</a>" described the stretch east of Mountain Springs as follows: "Through it the freeway engineers have hacked two separate roadways night even in sight of each other, but so overpowering in the sheer magnitude of the cuts through the mountains that it is almost impossible to believe human beings could have so overpowered hostile nature ..." Access to the site for construction workers was difficult, and many slopes had to be stabilized. Temperatures reached in the summer and in winter, with winds reaching up to . While using nuclear explosions to conduct blasting operations in the Laguna Mountains was considered as a possibility, the proposal was not considered to be practical at the time. Two cables and a hook were used to move girders into place; this was the first use of a cable in Southern California road construction.

The portion from Boulevard to near the Imperial County line was included in the California Highway Commission budget for 1965–1966. A extension from Mountain Springs west to what was then known as Road J-35 was given $3.3 million (about $ in dollars) in funding by the Highway Commission in May 1965. The section in between this one and the Mountain Springs pass section was in planning by that September, and was scheduled to begin the building phase shortly thereafter, with the section extending west of Boulevard to follow. That section, from Crestwood to Boulevard, was to begin construction soon after the $3 million (about $ in dollars) contract was given out in January 1966. The coming of the freeway from both west and east of Jacumba was projected to be a significant event in the history of the town. Cafes and gas stations went out of business once the freeway bypassed the town; however, many retirees relocated into the town since the high traffic levels were gone. The labeling of the town Boulevard as Manzanita on I-8 signs raised controversy and forced the Division of Highways to obscure the name on the signs until the issue was resolved.

Construction continued with the issuing of a $6.55 million contract (about $ in dollars) to widen a section of I-8 through Alpine, from Harbison Canyon to east of West Victoria Drive, and to begin construction in April or May 1967, to be completed in 1969. This would leave only a stretch of I-8 that was not at freeway standards. As the process continued, concerns about increased smog from the additional traffic were raised in October 1967. A section to the east of Alpine was scheduled to have bidding opened in November of that year, and was to be finished in 1968; this would produce a continuous freeway from San Diego to the eastern terminus of this route. Both of these projects were underway by May 1968. An additional contract was given out for $7.8 million (about $ in dollars) in August to continue the freeway east from Alpine Street to Japatul Valley Road; this would bring the freeway near Descanso Junction. Roughly 5.5 million cubic yards of dirt and rock were to be generated by all three of these construction projects, since half of a mountain would have to be removed with a million pounds of dynamite. The third project was built near the site of an abandoned attempt to build a tunnel for the old highway after World War II, which proved to be too expensive.

By mid-February 1969, one segment of the freeway running through Alpine was nearing completion and was scheduled to open on February 21; another section was scheduled to open in April. However, although dirt and rocks were transported on a conveyor belt across US 80 to become part of an embankment for the <a href="Sweetwater%20River%20Bridge">Sweetwater River Bridge</a>, the grading of the mountain near Viejas Grade and the Sweetwater River had not been completed on the final link. The historic Ellis Grade radiator stop was to be removed and replaced with one at Vista Point. On April 19, 1969, the part east of Alpine opened to traffic. All of the Alpine part of I-8 opened on May 22, 1969, after a ribbon-cutting ceremony; yet the Viejas Grade segment was now projected to be completed by 1972. The bridge over the Sweetwater River was under construction by 1970, and the entire segment cost $22.1 million (about $ in dollars). By May, this segment was estimated to be completed in the later part of that year. The leveling of the grade resulted in the second highest fill in the state at .

The final portion of I-8 in California, between Japatul Valley Road and west of Boulevard, was prioritized in the 1969–1970 state budget. Due to financial concerns, it was announced in September 1968 that the target date for completing the <a href="Interstate%20Highway%20System">Interstate Highway System</a> would be extended until 1974, from 1972. The missing portion of I-8 was expected to cost $45 million and be constructed in three parts, with one part being started each year. The segments between Japatul Valley Road and west of Laguna Junction, and from La Posta Road to west of Boulevard, were delayed for an entire year at the end of 1969 due to a nationwide effort to fight inflation by reducing spending. A segment from Buckman Springs to Crestwood received funding in May 1970, which would leave only an stretch of the freeway uncompleted when built. The drive time from San Diego to El Centro had been reduced to two hours, according to the California Division of Highways. By August 1970, the remainder of the freeway had been funded, with the part from Japatul Valley Road to Laguna Junction costing $22 million (about $ in dollars), and the Laguna Junction to Crestwood portion costing $15 million (about $ in dollars).

In May 1971, El Centro Mayor Alex Gay requested that passing lanes be added to the remaining two-lane part of I-8 in between El Centro and San Diego due to the frequent traffic jams in between Japatul Valley and Crestwood. At this time, this was the only missing link through the mountains. Bidding took place on the $16.5 million (about $ in dollars) La Posta Road to Crestwood Road and the Japatul Valley Road to Sunrise Highway portions in November 1971. As part of this series of projects, the highest concrete bridge in the state at the time was to be built at over Pine Valley Creek on the segment between Japatul Valley Road and Sunrise Highway. The contract came in at $22.6 million (about $ in dollars), over $5 million (about $ in dollars) beyond budget due to the difficulty of the bridge construction. All three of the projects to complete I-8 were projected to be complete by mid-1974. However, in March 1972, it was announced that the La Posta Road portion of the project would be delayed due to budget troubles.

By the beginning of 1974, the new projected completion date for I-8 was mid-1975, with of two-lane highway remaining. The Pine Valley Creek bridge and the segment extending from Japatul Valley Road to Pine Valley was dedicated on November 24, 1974, and was scheduled to open on November 26; this left of freeway to be constructed. The final stretch of I-8 in California, from Sunrise Highway to La Posta Road, was completed in May 1975.

The Buckman Springs rest area opened in January 1979 in eastern San Diego County. In 1987, the first speed limit sign was posted east of El Cajon, the first one in the state; the speed limit on all I-8 east of El Cajon, except for the Mountain Springs Grade portion, was raised similarly.

The highway through Imperial Valley was originally a <a href="plank%20road">plank road</a> made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915. Following this, US 80 was built through the valley as the main east–west route. Plans for a new freeway across the southernmost reaches of California date from before 1950. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built. In 1957, the City of El Centro expressed a desire for the new freeway to replace US 80 to be routed along the southern limits of the city. Caltrans engineer Jacob Dekema stated at the time that the four-lane freeway would not be constructed on the US 80 routing due to possible expansion of the <a href="Naval%20Air%20Facility%20El%20Centro">Naval Air Facility El Centro</a>.

In October 1964, the portion of I-8 between Imperial Avenue in El Centro to SR 111 appeared in the state budget. By December, a route for the part of I-8 just west of the Colorado River was being examined by the California Highway Commission. Construction was underway on the stretch from Seeley to SR 111 by June 1966, and the entire portion through the county was planned for completion by 1968. This portion, extending west to Drew Road, was planned for completion by early 1967, at a cost of $200 million (about $ in dollars); however, by then the date for completion of the freeway had slipped to 1972. The state ordered the building of the portion from west of Coyote Wells to just east of Drew Road in September 1967. The next year, Dekema indicated that the goal was to have I-8 completed by 1973, citing a deadline in order to have the federal government pay for up to ninety percent of the costs; the other freeways in the region were to be delayed because of this.

In early 1970, the portion of the freeway from west of Ogilby Road to east of Algodones Road was under construction, and projections were to have this portion completed by later that year. This $5.2 million (about $ in dollars) project also included resurfacing the freeway that had already been built through the Colorado Desert Sandhills; this part of the freeway had been built between 1961 and 1965. By this time, it was estimated that the drive from San Diego to El Centro now took two hours, as opposed to the three-and-a-half hours required two decades earlier, and the two days required in the pioneer era. This part of the freeway was opened in July 1970. As the freeway was constructed through the valley, it caused a break in many north–south roads. These breaks were located where access to the part of the road on the other side of the freeway was cut off. Plans were put in place to build <a href="frontage%20road">frontage road</a>s to improve access through the region.

The portion of I-8 bypassing <a href="Holtville%2C%20California">Holtville</a> began construction in December 1969, and was nearing completion in May 1971, to result in a continuous freeway that connected two existing segments from <a href="Crestwood%2C%20California">Crestwood</a> in San Diego County to just west of Winterhaven. It was estimated that the bypass would save travelers 20 minutes of travel time through the Imperial Valley. The cost of this project was $11.2 million (about $ in dollars). However, Holtville residents raised concerns about SR 115 providing the only access to the eastern part of the city, notably the narrow and curved portion leading from the freeway into town. Work on the Holtville portion began at 3:30 a.m. daily during the summer in order to avoid the desert heat. In addition to this, construction of the <a href="Highline%20Canal">Highline Canal</a> overpass involved a steel span that was prefabricated and made of girders that were hoisted into position by barges. The Matich Construction Company attempted to set the world record for laying the most concrete in a day, aided by the level terrain, but failed to do so after the <a href="concrete%20mixer">concrete mixer</a> malfunctioned. That same year, bids for an Arizona plant inspection station near Winterhaven, next to the California agricultural inspection station, were submitted.

The last part of the California portion, from near Algodones Road to west of the Arizona state line, was to enter the bidding phase in early 1972. I-8 was scheduled to be completed in the summer of 1975 between San Diego and Yuma, although there would be a break in the freeway around Yuma; this occurred by October 1975. At the time the California portion was completed, it was the preferred route to Phoenix from some areas of Los Angeles, since <a href="Interstate%2010%20in%20Arizona">I-10</a> had not been completed.

The missing portion of the highway was the new bridge over the Colorado River, which was built at a cost of $7.4 million (about $ in dollars). In June 1975, there were concerns regarding the state delaying new construction projects due to financial concerns, and the effects this would have on the bridge. The bid for the project was awarded to Novo-Rados Construction in October 1975, as one of the final projects before the construction freeze. The new bridge, which replaced the old US 80 bridge, was dedicated on August 18, 1978; this completed I-8 from San Diego to Casa Grande. The Arizona Department of Transportation and the City of Yuma assisted in the planning process. By the time the California portion of the freeway was complete, the average cost was $1 million per mile (about $ in dollars). The bridge opened on September 20, 1978. The State of California was responsible for the bridge erection, even though the State of Arizona owned half of the bridge.

<a href="Jimmy%20Fratianno">Jimmy Fratianno</a> was associated with <a href="Frank%20Bompensiero">Frank Bompensiero</a>, the San Diego mafia leader, in a criminal lawsuit involving the Fratianno Trucking Company and the Miles and Sons Trucking Company in 1966; he was known to law enforcement as "the Mafia's West Coast executioner," with up to 16 deaths for which he was potentially responsible. Both companies were awarded the contracts to transport dirt during the construction of I-8 in El Centro. Drivers were coerced to agree to buy the trucks, although the Fratianno Company still retained the ownership; they also had portions of their wages withheld from them. Following this, the drivers were loaned money from Leo Moceri, another mafia leader. An investigation in early 1966 after complaints from the drivers led to state charges against the two firms as well as five people in August. There were concerns that John Erreca, the state director of public works, had a <a href="conflict%20of%20interest">conflict of interest</a> with Fratianno and did not enforce the law; however, both Transportation Administrator Robert Bradford (upon a request for investigation from then Governor <a href="Pat%20Brown">Pat Brown</a>) and the <a href="Federal%20Bureau%20of%20Investigation">Federal Bureau of Investigation</a> found that there was no conflict of interest.

The truck drivers were given $36,000 (about $ in dollars) in back pay from the state government. Fratianno and Bompensiero were charged with fraud, as well as state labor and public utility code violations. While charges were dropped against Bompensiero, Fratianno was found guilty. The Imperial County <a href="board%20of%20supervisors">Board of Supervisors</a> estimated that $25,000 (about $ in dollars) in damage to county roads took place due to overloaded trucks. The federal government fined him $10,000 (about $ in dollars), which he never paid, and placed him on probation for three years; he was imprisoned when he did not pay, but was released in September 1969. His ex-wife, Jewell, as well as the company, were fined $4,014 (about $ in dollars) individually for their responsibility in the matter. For the state charges, he was sentenced in 1969 to one to three years in prison, after pleading guilty to the charges. He was incarcerated in <a href="Chico%20State%20Prison">Chico State Prison</a> following a parole violation until 1973.

Following <a href="Hurricane%20Kathleen%20%281976%29">Tropical Storm Kathleen</a> in September 1976, a flood eroded 400 pieces of the roadway from westbound I-8 near <a href="Ocotillo%2C%20California">Ocotillo</a>, resulting in the construction of a detour. The freeway reopened to traffic in February 1978 after the damage was repaired and a new bridge was built, at a cost of $1 million (about $ in dollars). But in 1982, the freeway was closed again near Ocotillo due to flooding following another storm.

Between Yuma and Gila Bend, I-8 runs alongside the routes of both the <a href="Gila%20Trail">Gila Trail</a> and the <a href="Butterfield%20Overland%20Mail%20Company">Butterfield Overland Mail Company</a> line. The latter was a <a href="stagecoach%20line">stagecoach line</a> that went between <a href="Tipton%2C%20Missouri">Tipton, Missouri</a>, and San Francisco, with several stations in between, and was used to transport passengers across the country at between 1858 and 1861. In later years, the <a href="Southern%20Pacific%20Railroad">Southern Pacific Railroad</a> was constructed, paralleling the Gila River east of Fortuna; by 1877, the tracks were complete to Yuma. Work continued the next year, and by 1880 the tracks were extended to Tucson from Yuma.

This portion of the route of I-8 was originally part of the proposed state system of highways in 1921. By 1926, this section became part of the cross-country highway <a href="U.S.%20Route%2080%20in%20Arizona">US 80</a>. The route was not paved at this time, but was a gravel road along the entire corridor. By 1928, the portion of I-8 between Gila Bend and Casa Grande was designated as SR 84. A small portion of the highway was paved near Yuma and SR 84 was under construction by the next year. SR 84 was completed by 1930, but not paved, and the segment of US 80 between <a href="Aztec%2C%20Arizona">Aztec</a> and <a href="Sentinel%2C%20Arizona">Sentinel</a> had been paved.

Paving of SR 84 had commenced by 1934, with the portion of the highway in Maricopa County being paved. A group of San Diego citizens raised concerns about the road from Yuma to Gila Bend not being paved in 1934, due to the impact that this would have on tourism in San Diego, and made a request to the federal government to have it paved. The entire future corridor of I-8 had been paved from Yuma to Casa Grande by 1935. Drivers were told to bring spare fan belts, radiator hoses, and additional drinking water for the journey traversing the desert. A "Shortcuts Association" began in 1952 to promote SR 84 as a route to bypass Phoenix on the way to San Diego.

With the coming of the Interstate Highways, the corridor was to be upgraded to Interstate standards. In late 1958, a group of motel owners whose properties were located on SR 84 strongly objected to any routing of I-8 that would not go through the city of Casa Grande. Motel owners in Yuma proposed their own alternative in 1961 to the four routings of I-8 through the city that had been proposed, raising concerns about losing revenue from tourism. In January 1962, the alternatives were narrowed down to two, with one of them being the route supported by the motel owners. However, nearby school officials expressed concerns regarding that route, because 1200 students would no longer be able to walk to school if the freeway was constructed along that route. Later that year, a new route had been proposed, along the Southern Pacific Railroad tracks and the Colorado River. By 1963, work was in progress, with portions of the highway between <a href="Mohawk%2C%20Arizona">Mohawk</a> and Gila Bend, and between Gila Bend and near Stanfield upgraded. Other merchants objected to the routing, and met with the Yuma County Board of Supervisors to raise their concerns following the final approval of the route in 1964. A new park was to be built east of the Colorado River crossing, just opposite downtown; city officials hoped that this would give an improved look to the town as drivers first arrived.

Nevertheless, there was controversy over the work in Arizona as well. In 1964, a <a href="U.S.%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a> investigation discovered that poor management and lack of efficiency were prevalent in four of the projects constructing the I-8 freeway. The Arizona Highway Department was specifically cited in the report for not taking into account protecting government interests when selecting labor for the projects. Several errors were discovered, and one of them, adding too much clay to the gravel mixture, cost the state of Arizona $26,278 (about $ in dollars) to fix. By that year, construction had begun on the freeway west of Casa Grande, while the rest of the Arizona routing was in the design stages.

In 1965, a $1.46 million (about $ in dollars) contract was granted to build the portion from near Araby Road east through Fortuna Wash. Two years later, it was estimated that construction would be complete by 1969, except for the Colorado River bridge. The highway was in progress through the Telegraph Pass east of Yuma, and the portions from Avenue 9-E to 4-E, from there to 4th Street in Yuma, and to the river were estimated to cost $9.69 million (about $ in dollars) in total. Following local complaints, Francis Turner, the executive director of the federal <a href="Bureau%20of%20Public%20Roads">Bureau of Public Roads</a>, agreed to look at constructing an interchange at Trekell Road in Casa Grande again, after an earlier decline to do so. Work began on the Casa Grande part of the freeway in March 1968, at a cost of $3 million (about $ in dollars). That year, many gas station, motel, and restaurant owners noticed a drop in business, possibly due to concerns regarding construction traffic due to I-8; however, they hoped for increased business following completion of the freeway. The Yuma County Chamber of Commerce made plans to promote tourism in the town following the completion of I-8 by late 1968.

Bidding on the last portion of the freeway to be completed in Casa Grande, from Midway Road to I-10, was to begin in January 1969. By November, the freeway east of Yuma was under construction, at a cost of $3.7 million (about $ in dollars). On June 15, 1970, eastbound traffic began on I-8 in Casa Grande, with an exit at both Trekell and Thorton roads, with westbound traffic soon to follow. Businesses did not notice much change with the opening of the eastbound lanes. In 1971, I-8 was nearly complete, including a new alignment east of Yuma built parallel and to the south of the original US 80 alignment. A new alignment was also built to the south of the SR 84 alignment at the eastern end of the highway from southwest of Stanfield to the eastern terminus at I-10 southeast of Casa Grande. The only portions of I-8 not completed at this time were the Gila Bend bypass and the western end near Yuma. The portion east of 16th Street in Yuma was completed in June 1972; the Arizona State Highway Commission authorized the $1.6 million (about $ in dollars) contract to construct the portion through Gila Bend in August. Some Yuma businesses had noticed a decrease in revenue at this time; the Arizona Highway Department agreed to modify some signs to eliminate any confusion. The part of I-8 between 16th and 4th streets was under construction in 1976, which was the only incomplete part of the freeway, along with the bridge over the Colorado River. The water treatment plant in Yuma was to be moved due to the potential of an accident with a vehicle carrying hazardous materials flying off the bridge and contaminating the water supply. The freeway in both states was completed with the opening of the bridge on September 20, 1978.

As the Interstate was completed, the highways that it replaced were removed from the state highway system. In 1973, the SR 84 designation was removed from the highway from Gila Bend to the split where I-8 followed a new alignment southwest of Stanfield. In 1977, the US 80 designation was removed from this stretch in favor of I-8.

There are no three-digit Interstates that are related to I-8. However, there are four signed business routes related to I-8 that provide additional access to particular towns or cities:

Cygnus X-1 was the subject of a <a href="Thorne%E2%80%93Hawking%E2%80%93Preskill%20bet">friendly scientific wager</a> between physicists <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> and <a href="Kip%20Thorne">Kip Thorne</a> in 1974, with Hawking betting that it was not a black hole. He conceded the bet in 1990 after observational data had strengthened the case that there was indeed a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> in the system. This hypothesis lacks direct empirical evidence but has generally been accepted from indirect evidence.

Observation of X-ray emissions allows <a href="astronomer">astronomer</a>s to study celestial phenomena involving gas with temperatures in the millions of degrees. However, because X-ray emissions are blocked by the <a href="Earth%27s%20atmosphere">Earth's atmosphere</a>, observation of <a href="X-ray%20astronomy">celestial X-ray sources</a> is not possible without lifting instruments to altitudes where the X-rays can penetrate. Cygnus X-1 was discovered using <a href="X-ray%20astronomy%20detector">X-ray instruments</a> that were carried aloft by a <a href="Sub-orbital%20spaceflight">sounding rocket launched</a> from <a href="White%20Sands%20Missile%20Range">White Sands Missile Range</a> in <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>. As part of an ongoing effort to map these sources, a survey was conducted in 1964 using two <a href="Aerobee">Aerobee</a> suborbital rockets. The rockets carried <a href="Geiger%20counters">Geiger counters</a> to measure X-ray emission in <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a> range 1– across an 8.4° section of the sky. These instruments swept across the sky as the rockets rotated, producing a map of closely spaced scans.

As a result of these surveys, eight new sources of cosmic X-rays were discovered, including Cyg XR-1 (later Cyg X-1) in the constellation Cygnus. The <a href="Celestial%20coordinate%20system">celestial coordinates</a> of this source were estimated as <a href="right%20ascension">right ascension</a> 1953 and <a href="declination">declination</a> 34.6°. It was not associated with any especially prominent <a href="radio%20astronomy">radio</a> or <a href="light">optical</a> source at that position.

Seeing a need for longer duration studies, in 1963 <a href="Riccardo%20Giacconi">Riccardo Giacconi</a> and <a href="Herb%20Gursky">Herb Gursky</a> proposed the first orbital satellite to study X-ray sources. <a href="NASA">NASA</a> launched their <a href="Uhuru%20%28satellite%29">Uhuru satellite</a> in 1970, which led to the discovery of 300 new X-ray sources. Extended Uhuru observations of Cygnus X-1 showed fluctuations in the X-ray intensity that occurs several times a second. This rapid variation meant that the energy generation must take place over a relatively small region of roughly , as the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a> restricts communication between more distant regions. For a size comparison, the diameter of the <a href="Sun">Sun</a> is about .

In April–May 1971, Luc Braes and George K. Miley from <a href="Leiden%20Observatory">Leiden Observatory</a>, and independently Robert M. Hjellming and Campbell Wade at the <a href="National%20Radio%20Astronomy%20Observatory">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a>, detected radio emission from Cygnus X-1, and their accurate radio position pinpointed the X-ray source to the star AGK2 +35 1910 = HDE 226868. On the <a href="celestial%20sphere">celestial sphere</a>, this star lies about half a <a href="Degree%20%28angle%29">degree</a> from the <a href="apparent%20magnitude">4th magnitude</a> star <a href="Eta%20Cygni">Eta Cygni</a>. It is a supergiant star that is, by itself, incapable of emitting the observed quantities of X-rays. Hence, the star must have a companion that could heat gas to the millions of degrees needed to produce the radiation source for Cygnus X-1.

Louise Webster and Paul Murdin, at the <a href="Royal%20Greenwich%20Observatory">Royal Greenwich Observatory</a>, and <a href="Charles%20Thomas%20Bolton">Charles Thomas Bolton</a>, working independently at the <a href="University%20of%20Toronto">University of Toronto</a>'s <a href="David%20Dunlap%20Observatory">David Dunlap Observatory</a>, announced the discovery of a massive hidden companion to HDE 226868 in 1971. Measurements of the <a href="Doppler%20shift">Doppler shift</a> of the star's spectrum demonstrated the companion's presence and allowed its mass to be estimated from the orbital parameters. Based on the high predicted mass of the object, they surmised that it may be a <a href="black%20hole">black hole</a> as the largest possible <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a> cannot exceed three times the <a href="solar%20mass">mass of the Sun</a>.

With further observations strengthening the evidence, by the end of 1973 the astronomical community generally conceded that Cygnus X-1 was most likely a black hole. More precise measurements of Cygnus X-1 demonstrated variability down to a single <a href="millisecond">millisecond</a>. This interval is consistent with <a href="turbulence">turbulence</a> in a disk of accreted matter surrounding a black hole—the <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a>. X-ray bursts that last for about a third of a second match the expected time frame of matter falling toward a black hole.
Cygnus X-1 has since been studied extensively using observations by <a href="orbit">orbit</a>ing and ground-based instruments. The similarities between the emissions of X-ray binaries such as HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 and <a href="active%20galactic%20nuclei">active galactic nuclei</a> suggests a common mechanism of energy generation involving a black hole, an orbiting accretion disk and associated <a href="Relativistic%20jet">jets</a>. For this reason, Cygnus X-1 is identified among a class of objects called <a href="microquasar">microquasar</a>s; an analog of the <a href="quasar">quasar</a>s, or quasi-stellar radio sources, now known to be distant active galactic nuclei. Scientific studies of binary systems such as HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 may lead to further insights into the mechanics of <a href="active%20galaxy">active galaxies</a>.

The <a href="compact%20object">compact object</a> and <a href="blue%20supergiant">blue supergiant</a> star form a <a href="binary%20star">binary system</a> in which they orbit around their <a href="center%20of%20mass">center of mass</a> every 5.599829 days. From the perspective of the Earth, the compact object never goes behind the other star; in other words, the system does not <a href="eclipse">eclipse</a>. However, the <a href="orbital%20inclination">inclination of the orbital plane</a> to the <a href="Line-of-sight%20propagation">line of sight</a> from the Earth remains uncertain, with predictions ranging from 27–65°. A 2007 study estimated the inclination is , which would mean that the <a href="semi-major%20axis">semi-major axis</a> is about , or 20% of the distance from the Earth to the Sun. The <a href="orbital%20eccentricity">orbital eccentricity</a> is thought to be only ; a nearly circular orbit. Earth's distance to this system is about .

The HDE 226868/Cygnus X-1 system shares a common motion through space with an association of massive stars named Cygnus OB3, which is located at roughly from the Sun. This implies that HDE 226868, Cygnus X-1 and this <a href="stellar%20association">OB association</a> may have formed at the same time and location. If so, then the age of the system is about . The motion of HDE 226868 with respect to Cygnus OB3 is ; a typical value for random motion within a stellar association. HDE 226868 is about from the center of the association, and could have reached that separation in about —which roughly agrees with estimated age of the association.

With a <a href="galactic%20latitude">galactic latitude</a> of 4 degrees and <a href="galactic%20longitude">galactic longitude</a> 71 degrees, this system lies inward along the same <a href="Orion%20Spur">Orion Spur</a> in which the Sun is located within the <a href="Milky%20Way">Milky Way</a>, near where the spur approaches the <a href="Sagittarius%20Arm">Sagittarius Arm</a>. Cygnus X-1 has been described as belonging to the Sagittarius Arm, though the structure of the Milky Way is not well established.

From various techniques, the mass of the compact object appears to be greater than the maximum mass for a <a href="neutron%20star">neutron star</a>. Stellar evolutionary models suggest a mass of , while other techniques resulted in 10 solar masses. Measuring periodicities in the X-ray emission near the object has yielded a more precise value of . In all cases, the object is most likely a black hole—a region of space with a <a href="gravity">gravitational field</a> that is strong enough to prevent the escape of <a href="electromagnetic%20radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> from the interior. The boundary of this region is called the <a href="event%20horizon">event horizon</a> and has an effective radius called the <a href="Schwarzschild%20radius">Schwarzschild radius</a>, which is about for Cygnus X-1. Anything (including <a href="matter">matter</a> and <a href="photon">photon</a>s) that passes through this boundary is unable to escape.

Evidence of just such an event horizon may have been detected in 1992 using <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> (UV) observations with the <a href="High%20Speed%20Photometer">High Speed Photometer</a> on the <a href="Hubble%20Space%20Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>. As self-luminous clumps of matter spiral into a black hole, their radiation will be emitted in a series of pulses that are subject to <a href="gravitational%20redshift">gravitational redshift</a> as the material approaches the horizon. That is, the <a href="wavelength">wavelength</a>s of the radiation will steadily increase, as predicted by <a href="General%20Relativity">General Relativity</a>. Matter hitting a solid, compact object would emit a final burst of energy, whereas material passing through an event horizon would not. Two such "dying pulse trains" were observed, which is consistent with the existence of a black hole.

The spin of the compact object is not yet well determined. Past analysis of data from the space-based <a href="Chandra%20X-ray%20Observatory">Chandra X-ray Observatory</a> suggested that Cygnus X-1 was not rotating to any significant degree. However, evidence announced in 2011 suggests it is rotating extremely rapidly, approximately 790 times per second.

The largest star in the Cygnus OB3 association has a mass 40 times that of the Sun. As more massive stars evolve more rapidly, this implies that the progenitor star for Cygnus X-1 had more than 40 solar masses. Given the current estimated mass of the black hole, the progenitor star must have lost over 30 solar masses of material. Part of this mass may have been lost to HDE 226868, while the remainder was most likely expelled by a strong stellar wind. The <a href="helium">helium</a> enrichment of HDE 226868's outer atmosphere may be evidence for this mass transfer. Possibly the progenitor may have evolved into a <a href="Wolf-Rayet%20star">Wolf-Rayet star</a>, which ejects a substantial proportion of its atmosphere using just such a powerful stellar wind.

If the progenitor star had exploded as a <a href="supernova">supernova</a>, then observations of similar objects show that the remnant would most likely have been ejected from the system at a relatively high velocity. As the object remained in orbit, this indicates that the progenitor may have collapsed directly into a black hole without exploding (or at most produced only a relatively modest explosion).

The compact object is thought to be orbited by a thin, flat disk of accreting matter known as an <a href="accretion%20disk">accretion disk</a>. This disk is intensely heated by friction between ionized gas in faster-moving inner orbits and that in slower outer ones. It is divided into a hot inner region with a relatively high level of ionization—forming a <a href="Plasma%20%28physics%29">plasma</a>—and a cooler, less ionized outer region that extends to an estimated 500 times the Schwarzschild radius, or about 15,000 km.

Though highly and erratically variable, Cygnus X-1 is typically the brightest persistent source of <a href="hard%20X-ray">hard X-ray</a>s—those with energies from about 30 up to several hundred keV—in the sky. The X-rays are produced as lower energy photons in the thin inner accretion disk, then given more energy through <a href="Compton%20scattering">Compton scattering</a> with very high temperature <a href="electron">electron</a>s in a geometrically thicker, but nearly transparent <a href="corona">corona</a> enveloping it, as well as by some further reflection from the surface of the thin disk. An alternative possibility is that the X-rays may be Compton scattered by the base of a jet instead of a disk corona.

The X-ray emission from Cygnus X-1 can vary in a somewhat repetitive pattern called <a href="quasi-periodic%20oscillations">quasi-periodic oscillations</a> (QPO). The mass of the compact object appears to determine the distance at which the surrounding plasma begins to emit these QPOs, with the emission radius decreasing as the mass decreases. This technique has been used to estimate the mass of Cygnus X-1, providing a cross-check with other mass derivations.

Pulsations with a stable period, similar to those resulting from the spin of a neutron star, have never been seen from Cygnus X-1. The pulsations from neutron stars are caused by the neutron star's magnetic field, however, the <a href="no%20hair%20theorem">no hair theorem</a> guarantees that black holes do not have magnetic poles. For example, the X-ray binary <a href="V%200332%2B53">V 0332+53</a> was thought to be a possible black hole until pulsations were found. Cygnus X-1 has also never displayed X-ray bursts similar to those seen from neutron stars. Cygnus X-1 unpredictably changes between two X-ray states, although the X-rays may vary continuously between those states as well. In the most common state, the X-rays are "hard", which means that more of the X-rays have high energy. In the less common state, the X-rays are "soft", with more of the X-rays having lower energy. The soft state also shows greater variability. The hard state is believed to originate in a corona surrounding the inner part of the more opaque accretion disk. The soft state occurs when the disk draws closer to the compact object (possibly as close as ), accompanied by cooling or ejection of the corona. When a new corona is generated, Cygnus X-1 transitions back to the hard state.

The spectral transition of Cygnus X-1 can be explained using a two component advective flow solution, as proposed by Chakrabarti and Titarchuk. A hard state is generated by the inverse Comptonisation of seed photons from the Keplarian disk and likewise synchrotron photons produced by the hot electrons in the Centrifugal Pressure-supported Boundary Layer (<a href="CENBOL">CENBOL</a>).

The X-ray flux from Cygnus X-1 varies periodically every , especially during <a href="superior%20conjunction">superior conjunction</a> when the orbiting objects are most closely aligned with the Earth and the compact source is the more distant. This indicates that the emissions are being partially blocked by circumstellar matter, which may be the stellar wind from the star HDE 226868. There is a roughly periodicity in the emission that could be caused by the <a href="precession">precession</a> of the accretion disk.

As accreted matter falls toward the compact object, it loses gravitational <a href="potential%20energy">potential energy</a>. Part of this released energy is dissipated by <a href="Relativistic%20jet">jets</a> of particles, aligned <a href="perpendicular">perpendicular</a> to the accretion disk, that flow outward with <a href="Special%20relativity">relativistic</a> velocities. (That is, the particles are moving at a significant fraction of the <a href="speed%20of%20light">speed of light</a>.) This pair of jets provide a means for an accretion disk to shed excess energy and <a href="angular%20momentum">angular momentum</a>. They may be created by <a href="magnetic%20field">magnetic field</a>s within the gas that surrounds the compact object.

The Cygnus X-1 jets are inefficient radiators and so release only a small proportion of their energy in the <a href="electromagnetic%20spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>. That is, they appear "dark". The estimated angle of the jets to the line of sight is 30° and they may be <a href="Precession">precessing</a>. One of the jets is colliding with a relatively dense part of the <a href="interstellar%20medium">interstellar medium</a> (ISM), forming an energized ring that can be detected by its radio emission. This collision appears to be forming a <a href="nebula">nebula</a> that has been observed in the <a href="Visible%20spectrum">optical wavelengths</a>. To produce this nebula, the jet must have an estimated average power of 4–, or . This is more than 1,000 times the power emitted by the Sun. There is no corresponding ring in the opposite direction because that jet is facing a lower density region of the <a href="Interstellar%20medium">ISM</a>.

In 2006, Cygnus X-1 became the first stellar mass black hole found to display evidence of <a href="gamma%20ray">gamma ray</a> emission in the very high energy band, above . The signal was observed at the same time as a flare of hard X-rays, suggesting a link between the events. The X-ray flare may have been produced at the base of the jet while the gamma rays could have been generated where the jet interacts with the stellar wind of HDE 226868.

HDE 226868 is a supergiant star with a <a href="spectral%20class">spectral class</a> of O9.7 Iab, which is on the borderline between class O and class B stars. It has an estimated surface temperature of and mass approximately 20–40 times the <a href="solar%20mass">mass of the Sun</a>. Based on a stellar evolutionary model, at the estimated distance of 2,000 parsecs this star may have a radius equal to about 15–17 times the <a href="solar%20radius">solar radius</a> and is approximately 300,000–400,000 times the <a href="solar%20luminosity">luminosity of the Sun</a>. For comparison, the compact object is estimated to be orbiting HDE 226868 at a distance of about 40 solar radii, or twice the radius of this star.

The surface of HDE 226868 is being <a href="Tidal%20force">tidally</a> distorted by the <a href="gravity">gravity</a> of the massive companion, forming a tear-drop shape that is further distorted by rotation. This causes the optical brightness of the star to vary by 0.06 magnitudes during each 5.6-day binary orbit, with the minimum magnitude occurring when the system is aligned with the line of sight. The "ellipsoidal" pattern of light variation results from the <a href="limb%20darkening">limb darkening</a> and <a href="gravity%20darkening">gravity darkening</a> of the star's surface.

When the spectrum of HDE 226868 is compared to the similar star <a href="Epsilon%20Orionis">Epsilon Orionis</a>, the former shows an overabundance of <a href="helium">helium</a> and an underabundance of <a href="carbon">carbon</a> in its atmosphere. The <a href="ultraviolet">ultraviolet</a> and <a href="Hydrogen%20alpha">Hydrogen alpha</a> spectral lines of HDE 226868 show profiles similar to the star <a href="P%20Cygni">P Cygni</a>, which indicates that the star is surrounded by a gaseous envelope that is being accelerated away from the star at speeds of about .

Like other stars of its spectral type, HDE 226868 is thought to be shedding mass in a <a href="stellar%20wind">stellar wind</a> at an estimated rate of solar masses per year. This is the equivalent of losing a mass equal to the Sun's every 400,000 years. The gravitational influence of the compact object appears to be reshaping this stellar wind, producing a focused wind geometry rather than a spherically symmetrical wind. X-rays from the region surrounding the compact object heat and ionize this stellar wind. As the object moves through different regions of the stellar wind during its 5.6-day orbit, the UV lines, the radio emission, and the X-rays themselves all vary.

The <a href="Roche%20lobe">Roche lobe</a> of HDE 226868 defines the region of space around the star where orbiting material remains gravitationally bound. Material that passes beyond this lobe may fall toward the orbiting companion. This Roche lobe is believed to be close to the surface of HDE 226868 but not overflowing, so the material at the stellar surface is not being stripped away by its companion. However, a significant proportion of the stellar wind emitted by the star is being drawn onto the compact object's accretion disk after passing beyond this lobe.

The gas and dust between the Sun and HDE 226868 results in a reduction in the apparent magnitude of the star as well as a reddening of the hue—red light can more effectively penetrate the dust in the interstellar medium. The estimated value of the interstellar <a href="Extinction%20%28astronomy%29">extinction</a> (A) is 3.3 <a href="Apparent%20magnitude">magnitudes</a>. Without the intervening matter, HDE 226868 would be a fifth magnitude star and thus visible to the unaided eye.

Cygnus X-1 was the subject of a bet between physicists <a href="Stephen%20Hawking">Stephen Hawking</a> and <a href="Kip%20Thorne">Kip Thorne</a>, in which Hawking bet against the existence of black holes in the region. Hawking later described this as an "insurance policy" of sorts. In his book "<a href="A%20Brief%20History%20of%20Time">A Brief History of Time</a>" he wrote:

According to the updated 10th anniversary edition of "A Brief History of Time", Hawking has conceded the bet due to subsequent observational data in favor of black holes. In his own book, "<a href="Black%20Holes%20and%20Time%20Warps">Black Holes and Time Warps</a>", Thorne reports that Hawking conceded the bet by breaking into Thorne's office while he was in <a href="Russia">Russia</a>, finding the framed bet, and signing it. (While Hawking referred to the bet as taking place in 1975, the written bet itself (in Thorne's handwriting, with his and Hawking's signatures) bears additional witness signatures under a legend stating "Witnessed this tenth day of December 1974". This date was confirmed by Kip Thorne on the January 10, 2018 episode of <a href="Nova%20%28TV%20series%29">Nova</a> on <a href="PBS">PBS</a>.)

The Eye of Terror, a fictional tear in realspace in the <a href="Warhammer%2040%2C000">Warhammer 40,000</a> universe, is referenced as being known to contemporary astronomers as Cygnus X-1.

Cygnus X-1 is mentioned as being the black hole that destroyed the home world of the Bilusaludo in the <a href="Godzilla">Godzilla</a> anime trilogy.

Canadian rock band <a href="Rush%20%28band%29">Rush</a> recorded a ten-part suite about a voyage of exploration to Cygnus X-1 divided into two “books,” one each on "<a href="A%20Farewell%20to%20Kings">A Farewell to Kings</a>" (1977) and "<a href="Hemispheres%20%28Rush%20album%29">Hemispheres</a>" (1978)

Paul Henderson

Paul Garnet Henderson, (born January 28, 1943) is a Canadian former professional <a href="ice%20hockey">ice hockey</a> player. A <a href="Winger%20%28ice%20hockey%29">left winger</a>, Henderson played 13 seasons in the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL) for the <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a>, <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a> and <a href="Atlanta%20Flames">Atlanta Flames</a> and five in the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA) for the <a href="Toronto%20Toros">Toronto Toros</a> and <a href="Birmingham%20Bulls">Birmingham Bulls</a>. He played over 1,000 games between the two major leagues, scoring 376 <a href="goal%20%28ice%20hockey%29">goal</a>s and 758 <a href="point%20%28ice%20hockey%29">point</a>s. Henderson played in two <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Game">NHL All-Star Game</a>s and was a member of the <a href="Memorial%20Cup">Memorial Cup</a>-winning <a href="Hamilton%20Red%20Wings">Hamilton Red Wings</a> team as a <a href="Junior%20ice%20hockey">junior</a>.

Henderson is best known for leading <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a> to victory at the 1972 <a href="Summit%20Series">Summit Series</a> against the <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Soviet Union</a>. Played during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, the series was viewed as a battle for both hockey and cultural supremacy. Henderson scored the game-winning goal in the sixth, seventh and eighth games, the last of which has become legendary in Canada and made him a national hero: it was voted the "sports moment of the century" by <a href="The%20Canadian%20Press">The Canadian Press</a> and earned him numerous accolades. Henderson has twice been inducted into <a href="Canada%27s%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canada's Sports Hall of Fame</a>: in 1995 individually and in 2005 along with all players of the Summit Series team. He was inducted into the <a href="IIHF%20Hall%20of%20Fame">International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame</a> in 2013.

A <a href="Born%20again%20%28Christianity%29">born-again Christian</a>, Henderson became a minister, motivational speaker and author following his playing career. He has co-written three books related to hockey or his life. Henderson was made a Member of the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a> in 2012 and of the <a href="Order%20of%20Ontario">Order of Ontario</a> in 2014.

Henderson was born January 28, 1943, near <a href="Kincardine%2C%20Ontario">Kincardine, Ontario</a>. His mother, Evelyn, went into labour while staying at his father's parents' farm in the nearby community of <a href="Ashfield%E2%80%93Colborne%E2%80%93Wawanosh">Amberley</a> during a <a href="snowstorm">snowstorm</a>. She gave birth to Paul while the family was crossing <a href="Lake%20Huron">Lake Huron</a> via horse-drawn sleigh attempting to reach the hospital in Kincardine. His father, Garnet, was fighting for Canada during the Second World War at the time and did not meet his son until Paul was nearly three years old. Garnet worked for the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a> following his return and the family – Paul was the eldest to brother Bruce and sisters Marilyn, Coralyn and Sandra – moved frequently to different posts in Ontario before settling in <a href="Lucknow%2C%20Ontario">Lucknow</a>.

The family often struggled financially, though Garnet was always able to provide the basic life necessities. Paul's first experiences with hockey came at a young age in the basement of a Chinese restaurant operated by Charlie Chin, an immigrant who settled in Lucknow. Henderson played with Chin's sons using a ball instead of a puck. The Chin family bought Henderson his first set of hockey equipment; he had been using old catalogues as shin pads. His father coached his youth teams, and at one <a href="minor%20hockey">minor hockey</a> tournament, told his teammates simply to "just give the puck to Paul and get out of his way". That incident remained with Henderson throughout his life: while it embarrassed him at the time to be singled out in front of his friends and teammates, he later realized it stood as an affirmation and expression of his father's pride in him and his abilities.

It was in Lucknow where Henderson met his future wife, Eleanor, at the age of 15 while he was working at a grocery store. They married in 1962 and, wanting to ensure he could provide for his wife, he considered giving up the game to become a history and physical education teacher. His father convinced him to remain in hockey, warning him that he would regret it for the rest of his life if he never tried to make the <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> (NHL). After considering his father's advice and talking with Eleanor, Henderson decided to play two additional years, and if he had not reached the NHL by 1964, he would quit the game and focus on his education.

Henderson attracted the attention of NHL scouts at the age of 15 when he scored 18 goals and 2 <a href="assist%20%28ice%20hockey%29">assist</a>s in a 21–6 victory in a juvenile playoff game. The <a href="junior%20hockey">junior</a> affiliates of both the <a href="Boston%20Bruins">Boston Bruins</a> and <a href="Detroit%20Red%20Wings">Detroit Red Wings</a> offered him tryouts. He chose to sign with the Red Wings as their junior teams were based in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ontario">Hamilton</a>, which was closest to his home. He played the 1959–60 season with the Junior B Goderich Sailors and was the youngest player on the team. Henderson moved up to the Junior A <a href="Hamilton%20Red%20Wings">Hamilton Red Wings</a> in <a href="1960%E2%80%9361%20OHA%20season">1960–61</a> where he was an extra <a href="forward%20%28ice%20hockey%29">forward</a> for much of the season. Returning to Hamilton in <a href="1961%E2%80%9362%20OHA%20season">1961–62</a>, he became a regular player on the team, and recorded 24 goals and 43 <a href="point%20%28ice%20hockey%29">points</a> in 50 games.

Hamilton won the Ontario championship that season, then defeated the <a href="Quebec%20Citadelles%20%28junior%29">Quebec Citadelles</a> in four consecutive games to win the eastern Canadian championship. Henderson scored a goal in the clinching game, a 9–3 win, that propelled the Red Wings to their first <a href="Memorial%20Cup">Memorial Cup</a> final in the team's history. They faced the <a href="Edmonton%20Oil%20Kings%20%28WCHL%29">Edmonton Oil Kings</a> in the <a href="1962%20Memorial%20Cup">1962 Memorial Cup</a> final series. The Red Wings won the best-of-seven set 4–1 to capture the national championship. Henderson scored a goal in the deciding game, a 7–4 victory before over 7,000 fans at <a href="Kitchener%2C%20Ontario">Kitchener, Ontario</a>. He finished with seven goals and seven assists in 14 Memorial Cup playoff games.

Returning for a third season with Hamilton in <a href="1962%E2%80%9363%20OHA%20season">1962–63</a>, Henderson led the <a href="Ontario%20Hockey%20Association">Ontario Hockey Association</a> in scoring with 49 goals in 48 games. He added 27 assists to finish the season with 76 points. A bout of <a href="strep%20throat">strep throat</a> resulted in his missing Hamilton's playoff games, but he was called up to the Detroit Red Wings late in their season when they were short of players. Henderson played his first two NHL games against the <a href="Toronto%20Maple%20Leafs">Toronto Maple Leafs</a>, with only one <a href="List%20of%20ice%20hockey%20terminology%23S">shift</a> in each game. In his first game, Henderson elbowed <a href="Dick%20Duff">Dick Duff</a> in the head, sparking a <a href="fighting%20in%20ice%20hockey">fight</a>. He spent the rest of the game on the bench after several Toronto players threatened retaliation against him. In his second, he incurred a <a href="slashing%20%28ice%20hockey%29">slashing</a> penalty during his only time on the ice. Henderson estimated that he was on the ice for only 20 seconds over the two games, but drew nine <a href="penalty%20%28ice%20hockey%29">penalties in minutes</a>.

After failing to make the Detroit roster out of training camp, Henderson was assigned to their <a href="American%20Hockey%20League">American Hockey League</a> (AHL) affiliate, the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Hornets">Pittsburgh Hornets</a>, to begin the <a href="1963%E2%80%9364%20AHL%20season">1963–64 season</a>. He appeared in 38 games for the Hornets and his speed and aggressive nature helped him score 10 goals and 24 points. Henderson earned a brief recall to Detroit in November, then joined the NHL team permanently early in the new year. He scored his first NHL goal on January 29, 1964, against the <a href="Chicago%20Blackhawks">Chicago Black Hawks</a>. It came late in the game against goaltender <a href="Glenn%20Hall">Glenn Hall</a> and resulted in a 2–2 tie. In 32 regular season NHL games, Henderson recorded three goals and three assists in 32 games, then appeared in 14 playoff games where he added five points. The Red Wings reached the <a href="1964%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">1964 Stanley Cup Final</a>, but lost in seven games to Toronto.

Henderson established himself as a full-time NHL player in <a href="1964%E2%80%9365%20NHL%20season">1964–65</a>, though with limited ice time. He was used primarily in a defensive role and to <a href="short-handed">kill penalties</a>, scoring 8 goals and 21 points, while appearing in 70 games. Switching to the left wing in <a href="1965%E2%80%9366%20NHL%20season">1965–66</a>, Henderson played a more offensive role and scored 22 goals. He added three more in 12 playoff games as the Red Wings reached the <a href="1966%20Stanley%20Cup%20Final">1966 Stanley Cup Final</a> versus the <a href="Montreal%20Canadiens">Montreal Canadiens</a>. Henderson scored the game-winning goal in the first game of the finals. After winning the first two games in Montreal, Detroit lost four straight and the series.

Seeking to double his $7,000 salary from the previous season, Henderson became embroiled in a contract dispute with the Red Wings prior to the <a href="1966%E2%80%9367%20NHL%20season">1966–67 NHL season</a>, before the team acceded to his demands. He then spent the year attempting to overcome injuries; a case of <a href="tracheitis">tracheitis</a> forced him to miss several early season games and led the team to consider having him play wearing a surgical mask to protect against the cold air of the arena. Henderson eventually spent time in the dry air of Arizona to cure the ailment, but he also suffered from torn chest muscles and ultimately missed a third of the season. On the ice, Henderson scored 21 goals and 40 points in 49 games.

The Red Wings were in last place of the NHL's <a href="East%20Division%20%28NHL%29">East Division</a> late in the <a href="1967%E2%80%9368%20NHL%20season">1967–68 season</a> when, on March 3, 1968, they completed one of the biggest trades in league history up to that time: Henderson was sent to the Toronto Maple Leafs as part of a six-player deal, along with <a href="Norm%20Ullman">Norm Ullman</a> and <a href="Floyd%20Smith">Floyd Smith</a>, in exchange for <a href="Frank%20Mahovlich">Frank Mahovlich</a>, <a href="Garry%20Unger">Garry Unger</a> and <a href="Pete%20Stemkowski">Pete Stemkowski</a>. Henderson finished the season with 11 points in 13 games for Toronto, then scored 27 goals and 59 points in <a href="1968%E2%80%9369%20NHL%20season">1968–69</a>.

A groin injury plagued Henderson throughout much of the <a href="1969%E2%80%9370%20NHL%20season">1969–70 season</a>, but he continued to play at the team's request. He finished with 20 goals despite playing the entire season with pain. The Maple Leafs offered Henderson only a small raise, arguing that he did not deserve more because his offensive production had declined. The contract offer and the team's indifference towards his injury left Henderson disillusioned with management's attitude towards its players. Healthy in <a href="1970%E2%80%9371%20NHL%20season">1970–71</a>, he scored 30 goals and a NHL career-high 60 points.

Canada had long been at a disadvantage in international ice hockey tournaments as its best players were professionals in the NHL and therefore ineligible to play at the ostensibly amateur <a href="Ice%20Hockey%20World%20Championships">World Championship</a> and <a href="Ice%20hockey%20at%20the%20Winter%20Olympics">Olympic Games</a>. The Soviets masked the status of their best players by having them serve in the military or hold other jobs affiliated with the teams, so they retained amateur status, even though playing hockey was their only occupational responsibility. The <a href="International%20Ice%20Hockey%20Federation">International Ice Hockey Federation</a> (IIHF) promised to allow Canada to use a limited number of professional players at the 1970 tournament but later reneged, causing the nation to withdraw from all international competition. Officials in Canada and the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a> subsequently negotiated an arrangement that would see the top players of each nation – amateur or professional – play in an eight-game "<a href="Summit%20Series">Summit Series</a>" in September 1972 between the world's two greatest hockey nations. Canadian fans and media approached the series with confidence; many predicted that the Canadian professionals would win all eight games.

Henderson's 38-goal season in <a href="1971%E2%80%9372%20NHL%20season">1971–72</a>, a career high, earned him a place on <a href="Canada%20men%27s%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Team Canada</a>'s roster. He scored a goal early in the first game, in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a>, that gave Canada a 2–0 lead. The <a href="Soviet%20Union%20national%20ice%20hockey%20team">Soviet team</a> then humbled the Canadians by scoring the next four goals and winning 7–3. A 4–1 Canadian win followed in the second game, but the Soviets overcame a 4–2 deficit, the fourth goal scored by Henderson, to tie the third game. Canada lost the fourth game, 5–3, and were jeered by the fans in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> as they headed to Moscow for the final four games with a series deficit. Henderson, like most of his teammates, was frustrated by his team's play and the negative reaction they received from the crowd.

In the first game in Moscow, Henderson scored a goal to help Canada establish a 4–1 lead, but also suffered a concussion when he was tripped into the boards and knocked unconscious. He returned to finish the game, but the Soviets came back to win, 5–4, and were one victory shy of winning the series. In game six, Canada overcame what coach <a href="Harry%20Sinden">Harry Sinden</a> called "the worst officials I have ever seen in my life" to win by a 3–2 score, with Henderson scoring the game-winning goal. The game was also notable for <a href="Bobby%20Clarke">Bobby Clarke</a> using his stick in a two-handed slash that broke <a href="Valeri%20Kharlamov">Valeri Kharlamov</a>'s ankle. Henderson later called the event "the low point of the series" during the 30th anniversary celebration, but apologized for his comments after Clarke took umbrage. Canada drew even in the series at three wins apiece, plus one tie, with a 4–3 victory in game seven. Henderson again scored the winner despite being tripped as he took the shot.
By the eighth game, the competition had become more than a battle for hockey supremacy: it was also viewed as a battle between contrasting ways of life, particularly in the Soviet Union, where success in sport was used to promote the superiority of communism over western capitalism. An estimated 50 million Soviets watched the final contest, while in Canada, offices were closed and schools suspended classes to allow students to watch the game on television in gymnasium assemblies. The two teams ended the first period tied at two goals apiece, but Canada trailed at the second intermission, 5–3, and Soviet officials stated they would claim the overall victory if the game ended in a draw as a result of scoring more goals throughout the series. Canada rallied in the third period to tie the game with seven minutes remaining.

Sitting on the bench as the game entered the final minute of play, Henderson "had a feeling" that he could score. He convinced coach Sinden to send him out when Peter Mahovlich left the ice. Rushing into the Soviet zone, Henderson missed a pass from <a href="Yvan%20Cournoyer">Yvan Cournoyer</a> in front of the net and was tripped by a Soviet defenceman. As he got to his feet, <a href="Phil%20Esposito">Phil Esposito</a> recovered the puck and sent it towards Henderson in front of the net. The first shot was stopped by <a href="Vladislav%20Tretiak">Vladislav Tretiak</a>, but Henderson recovered the rebound and slid it past the fallen goaltender to give Canada a 6–5 lead with only 34 seconds left to play. It was his seventh goal of the tournament, tying him for the series lead with Esposito and <a href="Alexander%20Yakushev">Alexander Yakushev</a>. The goal won the game, and the series, for Canada. The team returned home to massive crowds in Montreal and Toronto, and Paul Henderson had become a national hero.

Henderson struggled to adjust to his new-found popularity. While he appreciated the support from fans and the business opportunities it created, he grew increasingly frustrated over time as the attention intruded on his private life. In his autobiography, "Shooting for Glory", Henderson stated that the fame left him less satisfied than he had ever been. His frustrations with Maple Leafs owner <a href="Harold%20Ballard">Harold Ballard</a>, who Henderson felt was destroying the team, contributed to his developing an ulcer. (Henderson later admitted he was not mature enough at the time to deal with the acerbic Ballard). He briefly turned to alcohol as he struggled to deal with his situation. Henderson's professional career reached its lowest point during the <a href="1972%E2%80%9373%20NHL%20season">1972–73 NHL season</a>. He had become depressed, and by December, had scored only six goals. He struggled with a groin injury and played only 40 games for the Maple Leafs, who missed the playoffs.

Prior to the <a href="1973%E2%80%9374%20NHL%20season">1973–74 NHL season</a>, Henderson spoke to <a href="John%20F.%20Bassett">John Bassett</a>, owner of the <a href="World%20Hockey%20Association">World Hockey Association</a> (WHA)'s <a href="Toronto%20Toros">Toronto Toros</a>. Bassett offered Henderson a five-year contract worth twice his annual $75,000 salary from the Maple Leafs. The deal included a $50,000 signing bonus and performance bonuses based on how he played in his final year with the Maple Leafs. Henderson signed the contract, though he said in his autobiography that he regretted doing so before completing his term with his NHL club. A bitter opponent of the WHA, Ballard had vowed not to lose more players to the rival league. When he found out about the deal, he offered Henderson the same contract terms, but without a signing bonus. Upset at how stingy Ballard had been with his teammates, Henderson told Ballard to "take this contract and shove it". An angered Ballard never forgave Henderson, and never spoke to him again.

Following a 24-goal campaign in his final season with the Maple Leafs, Henderson officially moved to the WHA where he played in another tournament against the Soviets. While the original series was restricted to players from the NHL, the <a href="1974%20Summit%20Series">1974 Summit Series</a> featured a Canadian team made up of WHA players. The series lacked the intensity of the original, yet Henderson felt that he played well: he scored two goals and an assist, and though Canada finished with one win, four losses and three ties, he felt the WHA had proven itself. Henderson scored 33 goals and 63 points in the <a href="1974%E2%80%9375%20WHA%20season">1974–75 WHA season</a> for the Toros while playing 58 games. He missed the playoffs after tearing his knee ligaments in a game against the <a href="Phoenix%20Roadrunners%20%28WHA%29">Phoenix Roadrunners</a> when colliding with Bob Mowat, an opposing player during a <a href="line%20%28ice%20hockey%29">line</a> change.

Henderson scored 24 goals and 55 points in <a href="1975%E2%80%9376%20WHA%20season">1975–76</a>, his last in Toronto. Following that season, the Toros relocated to <a href="Alabama">Alabama</a> where they became the <a href="Birmingham%20Bulls">Birmingham Bulls</a>. While his contract stipulated he did not have to relocate with the team, Henderson appreciated the chance to move to a city where he could play in relative anonymity. He played the final three years of his contract in Birmingham, scoring 23, 37 and 24 goals, but made only one playoff appearance during his five WHA seasons, in 1978.

The WHA <a href="NHL%E2%80%93WHA%20merger">merged</a> with the NHL following the <a href="1978%E2%80%9379%20WHA%20season">1978–79 season</a>. Birmingham was not invited to join the NHL; the team instead joined the <a href="Central%20Hockey%20League%20%281963%E2%80%931984%29">Central Hockey League</a> for the 1979–80 season and became a minor league affiliate of the <a href="Atlanta%20Flames">Atlanta Flames</a>. Henderson considered retiring, but his family had settled in Birmingham and he knew they could remain in the United States only as long as he was employed. The Flames offered him a spot on their roster, but he preferred to remain with his family. He signed a two-year contract with the Flames on the promise that he would stay in Birmingham unless the team needed his services as a result of injury to other players. He spent the majority of the season in Birmingham, but when Atlanta did struggle with injuries, they recalled him for 30 games where he scored seven goals and six assists. Henderson also appeared in four playoff games. In his final game at Toronto's <a href="Maple%20Leaf%20Gardens">Maple Leaf Gardens</a>, Henderson led the Flames to a 5–1 win over the Maple Leafs with a two-goal effort, resulting in his being named the game's <a href="Three%20stars%20%28ice%20hockey%29">first star</a>.

Henderson intended the 1980–81 season to be his last as a player. He was again offered a spot on the Flames, in part to help develop the team's young players, but the franchise had relocated to Canada to become the <a href="Calgary%20Flames">Calgary Flames</a> and Henderson chose to remain with Birmingham, as a player and assistant coach. He missed several games due to injuries but scored six goals in 33 games. However, the Bulls fell into financial difficulty and on February 23, 1981, the team ceased operations mid-season. Choosing not to leave his Birmingham home, Henderson retired as a player and spent the remainder of the season as a scout for the Flames.

Though he was not considered a good puck handler, Henderson was a fast skater and was known for his skills at shooting the puck. His career spanned 19 professional seasons during which he played over 1,000 major league games in the NHL and WHA. He scored 376 goals and 760 points between the two leagues and was a two-time NHL all-star, playing in the <a href="25th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">1972</a> and <a href="26th%20National%20Hockey%20League%20All-Star%20Game">1973</a> <a href="NHL%20All-Star%20Game">All-Star Games</a>. His career, however, was defined by the goal he scored on September 28, 1972, to win the Summit Series for Canada. It is the most famous goal in Canadian hockey history and was the defining moment for a generation of Canadians. Decades later, Henderson remains a national hero. The "<a href="Canadian%20Press">Canadian Press</a>" named Henderson's goal the "sports moment of the century" in 2000. The jersey worn by Henderson when he scored the goal was sold at auction for over $1 million in 2010, thought to be the highest price ever paid for a hockey sweater.

<a href="Frank%20Lennon">Frank Lennon</a>'s photograph, taken moments after the goal and showing a jubilant Henderson being embraced by <a href="Yvan%20Cournoyer">Yvan Cournoyer</a>, has been "etched into the visual cortex of every Canadian". The photo won a <a href="National%20Newspaper%20Awards">National Newspaper Award</a> and has been reproduced by the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mint">Royal Canadian Mint</a> on coins. It was also named "Canadian Press" photograph of the year.

Sportswriters and fans have frequently called for Henderson to be inducted into the <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a> on the strength of his performance. Commentator and former NHL coach <a href="Don%20Cherry">Don Cherry</a> argued that Henderson's status as hero of the "greatest series in hockey history" was enough to qualify him. Henderson himself does not believe he belongs: "So many Canadians get upset that I’m not in the Hall of Fame, and I tell them all the time if I was on the committee, I wouldn’t vote for me. Quite frankly, I didn’t have a Hall of Fame career." Henderson has been honoured by <a href="Canada%27s%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canada's Sports Hall of Fame</a> on two occasions: he was first inducted as an individual in 1995, and again ten years later along with his 1972 teammates. The Summit Series team has also been honoured with a star on <a href="Canada%27s%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Canada's Walk of Fame</a>. Henderson has been inducted into the <a href="Ontario%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Ontario Sports Hall of Fame</a> (1997), the <a href="IIHF%20Hall%20of%20Fame">IIHF Hall of Fame</a> (2013) and has been honoured by <a href="Hockey%20Canada">Hockey Canada</a> with the <a href="Order%20of%20Hockey%20in%20Canada">Order of Hockey in Canada</a> as part of its 2013 class. He was named a Member of the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a> in December 2012 in recognition of "his engagement in support of a range of social and charitable causes" along with his achievements on the ice. In 2014, he was named to the <a href="Order%20of%20Ontario">Order of Ontario</a>.

Henderson and his wife Eleanor have three daughters: Heather, Jennifer and Jill. The family remained in Birmingham for a time following his retirement as a player. He had an opportunity to become a <a href="Color%20commentator">colour commentator</a> for Maple Leafs broadcasts in 1981 but Ballard, still upset that Henderson had defected to the WHA, prevented his hiring. In Birmingham, he became a <a href="stockbroker">stockbroker</a>, briefly joining <a href="brokerage%20firm">brokerage firm</a> <a href="E.%20F.%20Hutton%20%26amp%3B%20Co.">E. F. Hutton</a>. However, he was unable to get a work permit in the United States despite a petition signed by thousands of Birmingham residents who fought for him to stay.

Following the high of the 1972 Summit Series and the personal lows that came after, Henderson struggled with a sense of discontentment. He turned to religion, becoming a <a href="Born%20again%20%28Christianity%29">born-again Christian</a> in 1975. Unable to work as a broker, Henderson entered the <a href="seminary">seminary</a> and studied to become a minister. When he finally gave up his efforts to acquire an American work visa in 1984, he returned to Toronto. Under the auspices of <a href="Power%20to%20Change%20Ministries">Power to Change Ministries</a>, formerly <a href="Campus%20Crusade%20for%20Christ">Campus Crusade for Christ</a> Canada, he founded a men's ministry in Ontario called LeaderImpact and travels across Canada giving talks and speeches, particularly to businessmen. He has received an <a href="Honorary%20degree">honorary doctorate</a> from <a href="Briercrest%20College%20and%20Seminary">Briercrest College and Seminary</a> and an honorary degree from <a href="Tyndale%20University%20College%20and%20Seminary">Tyndale University College and Seminary</a>.

Henderson is also a published author. His autobiography, "Shooting for Glory", was released in 1992. With Jim Prime, he co-authored the 2011 book "How Hockey Explains Canada", an exploration of the relationship between the sport and Canadian culture. He released a memoir in 2012 called "The Goal of My Life" with Roger Lajoie.

The death of his father due to heart problems at the age of 49 had a lasting effect on Henderson. He was conscious of his own health, and survived a blockage in his own heart that was discovered in 2004. He was diagnosed with <a href="chronic%20lymphocytic%20leukemia">chronic lymphocytic leukemia</a> in 2009. The disease prevented him from attending 40th anniversary celebrations of the Summit Series in Moscow, but he was responding well to experimental treatment as part of a clinical trial he participated in into 2013.

Terry Fox

Terrance Stanley "Terry" Fox (July 28, 1958 June 28, 1981) was a Canadian athlete, <a href="Humanitarianism">humanitarian</a>, and <a href="cancer%20research">cancer research</a> activist. In 1980, with one leg having been amputated due to cancer, he embarked on an east to west cross-Canada run to raise money and awareness for cancer research. Although the spread of his cancer eventually forced him to end his quest after 143 days and , and ultimately cost him his life, his efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual <a href="Terry%20Fox%20Run">Terry Fox Run</a>, first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over <a href="Canadian%20dollar">C$</a>750 million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018.

Fox was a distance runner and <a href="basketball">basketball</a> player for his <a href="Port%20Coquitlam">Port Coquitlam</a>, <a href="British%20Columbia">British Columbia</a>, <a href="Terry%20Fox%20Secondary%20School">high school</a> and <a href="Simon%20Fraser%20University">Simon Fraser University</a>. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with <a href="osteosarcoma">osteosarcoma</a>, though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played <a href="wheelchair%20basketball">wheelchair basketball</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>, winning three national championships.

In 1980, he began the Marathon of Hope, a cross-country run to raise money for cancer research. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24 million people. He began with little fanfare from <a href="St%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's, Newfoundland</a>, in April and ran the equivalent of a full <a href="marathon">marathon</a> every day. Fox had become a national star by the time he reached <a href="Ontario">Ontario</a>; he made numerous public appearances with businessmen, athletes, and politicians in his efforts to raise money. He was forced to end his run outside <a href="Thunder%20Bay">Thunder Bay</a> when the cancer spread to his lungs. His hopes of overcoming the disease and completing his marathon ended when he died nine months later.

In addition to being the youngest person ever named a Companion of the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a>, Fox won the 1980 <a href="Lou%20Marsh%20Award">Lou Marsh Award</a> as the nation's top sportsman and was named <a href="Canadian%20Newsmaker%20of%20the%20Year">Canada's Newsmaker of the Year</a> in both 1980 and 1981. Considered a national hero, he has had many buildings, statues, roads, and parks named in his honour across the country.

Terry Fox was born on July 28, 1958, in <a href="Winnipeg">Winnipeg</a>, <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, to Rolland and <a href="Betty%20Fox">Betty Fox</a>. Rolland was a switchman for the <a href="Canadian%20National%20Railway">Canadian National Railway</a>. Terry had an elder brother, Fred, a younger brother, Darrell, and a younger sister, Judith. Terry's maternal grandmother is <a href="M%C3%A9tis">Métis</a> and Terry's younger brother Darrell has official Métis status.

His family moved to <a href="Surrey%2C%20British%20Columbia">Surrey, British Columbia</a>, in 1966, then settled in <a href="Port%20Coquitlam%2C%20British%20Columbia">Port Coquitlam</a>, in 1968. His parents were dedicated to their family, and his mother was especially protective of her children; it was through her that Fox developed his stubborn dedication to whatever task he committed to do. His father recalled that he was extremely competitive, noting that Terry hated to lose so much that he would continue at any activity until he succeeded.

He was an enthusiastic athlete, playing <a href="soccer">soccer</a>, <a href="Rugby%20football">rugby</a> and <a href="baseball">baseball</a> as a child. His passion was for <a href="basketball">basketball</a> and though he stood only five feet tall and was a poor player at the time, Fox sought to make his school team in grade eight. Bob McGill, Terry's physical education teacher and basketball coach at Mary Hill Junior High School, felt he was better suited to be a distance runner and encouraged him to take up the sport. Fox had no desire for cross-country running, but took it up because he respected and wanted to please his coach. He was determined to continue playing basketball, even if he was the last substitute on the team. Fox played only one minute in his grade-eight season but dedicated his summers to improving his play. He became a regular player in grade nine and earned a starting position in grade ten. In grade 12, he won his high school's athlete of the year award jointly with his best friend Doug Alward.

Though he was initially unsure whether he wanted to go to university, Fox's mother convinced him to enrol at <a href="Simon%20Fraser%20University">Simon Fraser University</a>, where he studied <a href="kinesiology">kinesiology</a> as a stepping stone to becoming a physical education teacher. He tried out for the junior varsity basketball team, earning a spot ahead of more talented players due to his determination.
On November 12, 1976, as Fox was driving to the family home at Morrill Street in Port Coquitlam, he became distracted by nearby bridge construction, and crashed into the back of a pickup truck. While his car was left undriveable, Fox emerged with only a sore right knee. He again felt pain in December, but chose to ignore it until the end of basketball season. By March 1977, the pain had intensified and he finally went to a hospital, where he was diagnosed with <a href="osteosarcoma">osteosarcoma</a>, a form of cancer that often starts near the knees. Fox believed his car accident weakened his knee and left it vulnerable to the disease, though his doctors argued there was no connection. He was told that his leg had to be amputated, he would require <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> treatment, and that recent medical advances meant he had a 50-percent chance of survival. Fox learned that two years before, the figure would have been only 15 percent; the improvement in survival rates impressed on him the value of cancer research.

With the help of an artificial leg, Fox was walking three weeks after the amputation. He then progressed to playing golf with his father. Doctors were impressed with Fox's positive outlook, stating it contributed to his rapid recovery. He endured sixteen months of chemotherapy and found the time he spent in the British Columbia Cancer Control Agency facility difficult as he watched fellow cancer patients suffer and die from the disease. Fox ended his treatment with new purpose: he felt he owed his survival to medical advances and wished to live his life in a way that would help others find courage.

In the summer of 1977, <a href="Rick%20Hansen">Rick Hansen</a>, working with the Canadian Wheelchair Sports Association, invited Fox to try out for his <a href="wheelchair%20basketball">wheelchair basketball</a> team. Although he was undergoing chemotherapy treatments at the time, Fox's energy impressed Hansen. Less than two months after learning how to play the sport, Fox was named a member of the team for the national championship in Edmonton. He won three national titles with the team, and was named an all-star by the North American Wheelchair Basketball Association in 1980.

The night before his cancer surgery, Fox had been given an article about <a href="Dick%20Traum">Dick Traum</a>, the first amputee to complete the <a href="New%20York%20City%20Marathon">New York City Marathon</a>. The article inspired him; he embarked on a 14-month training program, telling his family he planned to compete in a marathon himself. In private, he devised a more extensive plan. His hospital experiences had made Fox angry at how little money was dedicated to cancer research. He intended to run the length of Canada in the hope of increasing cancer awareness, a goal he initially divulged to only his friend Douglas Alward.

Fox ran with an unusual gait, as he was required to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time the springs in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20 minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.

On September 2, 1979, Fox competed in a 17-mile road race in <a href="Prince%20George%2C%20British%20Columbia">Prince George, British Columbia</a>. He finished in last place, ten minutes behind his closest competitor, but his effort was met with tears and applause from the other participants. Following the marathon, he revealed his full plan to his family. His mother discouraged him, angering Fox, though she later came to support the project. She recalled, "He said, 'I thought you'd be one of the first persons to believe in me.' And I wasn't. I was the first person who let him down". Fox initially hoped to raise $1 million, then $10 million, but later sought to raise $1 for each of Canada's 24 million people.

On October 15, 1979, Fox sent a letter to the <a href="Canadian%20Cancer%20Society">Canadian Cancer Society</a> in which he announced his goal and appealed for funding. He stated that he would "conquer" his disability, and promised to complete his run, even if he had to "crawl every last mile". Explaining why he wanted to raise money for research, Fox described his personal experience of cancer treatment:

Fox made no promises that his efforts would lead to a cure for cancer, but he closed his letter with the statement: "We need your help. The people in cancer clinics all over the world need people who believe in miracles. I am not a dreamer, and I am not saying that this will initiate any kind of definitive answer or cure to cancer. I believe in miracles. I have to." The Cancer Society was skeptical of his dedication, but agreed to support Fox once he had acquired sponsors and requested he get a medical certificate from a heart specialist stating that he was fit to attempt the run. Fox was diagnosed with <a href="left%20ventricular%20hypertrophy">left ventricular hypertrophy</a> – an enlarged heart – a condition commonly associated with athletes. Doctors warned Fox of the potential risks he faced, though they did not consider his condition a significant concern. They endorsed his participation when he promised that he would stop immediately if he began to experience any heart problems.

A second letter was sent to several corporations seeking donations for a vehicle and running shoes, and to cover the other costs of the run. Fox sent other letters asking for grants to buy a running leg. He observed that while he was grateful to be alive following his cancer treatment, "I remember promising myself that, should I live, I would rise up to meet this new challenge [of fundraising for cancer research] face to face and prove myself worthy of life, something too many people take for granted." The <a href="Ford%20Motor%20Company">Ford Motor Company</a> donated a camper van, while <a href="Imperial%20Oil">Imperial Oil</a> contributed fuel, and <a href="Adidas">Adidas</a> his running shoes. Fox turned away any company that requested he endorse their products and refused any donation that carried conditions, as he insisted that nobody was to profit from his run.

The Marathon began on April 12, 1980, when Fox dipped his right leg in the Atlantic Ocean near <a href="St%20John%27s%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">St. John's</a>, <a href="Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Newfoundland</a>, and filled two large bottles with ocean water. He intended to keep one as a souvenir and pour the other into the Pacific Ocean upon completing his journey at <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria, British Columbia</a>. Fox was supported on his run by Doug Alward, who drove the van and cooked meals.

Fox was met with gale-force winds, heavy rain and a snowstorm in the first days of his run. He was initially disappointed with the reception he received, but was heartened upon arriving in <a href="Channel-Port%20aux%20Basques%2C%20Newfoundland%20and%20Labrador">Port aux Basques, Newfoundland</a>, where the town's 10,000 residents presented him with a donation of over $10,000. Throughout the trip, Fox frequently expressed his anger and frustration to those he saw as impeding the run, and he fought regularly with Alward. By the time they reached <a href="Nova%20Scotia">Nova Scotia</a>, they were barely on speaking terms, and it was arranged for Fox's brother Darrell, then 17, to join them as a buffer. Fox left the <a href="Maritimes">Maritimes</a> on June 10 and faced new challenges entering <a href="Quebec">Quebec</a> due to his group's inability to speak <a href="French%20language">French</a> and drivers who continually forced him off the road. Fox arrived in <a href="Montreal">Montreal</a> on June 22, one-third of the way through his journey, having collected over $200,000 in donations. Around this time, Terry Fox's run caught the attention of <a href="Isadore%20Sharp">Isadore Sharp</a> who was the founder and CEO of <a href="Four%20Seasons%20Hotels%20and%20Resorts">Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts</a> – and who had lost a son to melanoma in 1978 just a year after Terry's diagnosis. Sharp was intrigued by the story of a one-legged kid "trying to do the impossible" and run across the country; so he offered food and accommodation at his hotels en route. When Terry was discouraged because so few people were making donations, Sharp pledged $2 a mile [to the run] and persuaded close to 1,000 other corporations to do the same. Sharp's encouragement persuaded Terry to continue with the Marathon of Hope. Convinced by the Canadian Cancer Society that arriving in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a> for <a href="Canada%20Day">Canada Day</a> would aid fundraising efforts, he remained in Montreal for a few extra days.
Fox crossed into Ontario at the town of <a href="Hawkesbury%2C%20Ontario">Hawkesbury</a> on the last Saturday in June. He was met by a brass band and thousands of residents who lined the streets to cheer him on, while the <a href="Ontario%20Provincial%20Police">Ontario Provincial Police</a> gave him an escort throughout the province. Despite the sweltering heat of summer, he continued to run per day. On his arrival in <a href="Ottawa">Ottawa</a>, Fox met <a href="Governor%20General%20of%20Canada">Governor General</a> <a href="Edward%20Schreyer">Ed Schreyer</a> and <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20Canada">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Pierre%20Trudeau">Pierre Trudeau</a> and was the guest of honour at numerous sporting events in the city. In front of 16,000 fans, he performed a ceremonial kickoff at a <a href="Canadian%20Football%20League">Canadian Football League</a> game and was given a standing ovation. Fox's journal reflected his growing excitement at the reception he had received as he began to understand how deeply moved Canadians were by his efforts.

On July 11, a crowd of 10,000 people met Fox in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, where he was honoured in <a href="Nathan%20Phillips%20Square">Nathan Phillips Square</a>. As he ran to the square, he was joined on the road by many people, including <a href="National%20Hockey%20League">National Hockey League</a> star <a href="Darryl%20Sittler">Darryl Sittler</a>, who presented Fox with his 1980 All-Star Game jersey. The Cancer Society estimated it collected $100,000 in donations that day alone. As he continued through southern Ontario, he was met by <a href="Hockey%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Hockey Hall of Fame</a>r <a href="Bobby%20Orr">Bobby Orr</a> who presented him with a cheque for $25,000. Fox considered meeting Orr the highlight of his journey.

The physical demands of running a marathon every day took their toll on Fox's body. Apart from the rest days in Montreal taken at the request of the Cancer Society, he refused to take a day off, even on his 22nd birthday. He frequently suffered shin splints and an inflamed knee. He developed cysts on his stump and experienced dizzy spells. At one point, he suffered a soreness in his ankle that would not go away. Although he feared he had developed a stress fracture, he ran for three more days before seeking medical attention, and was then relieved to learn it was <a href="tendonitis">tendonitis</a> and could be treated with painkillers. Fox rejected calls for him to seek regular medical checkups, and dismissed suggestions he was risking his future health.

In spite of his immense recuperative capacity, Fox found that by late August he was exhausted before he began his day's run. On September 1, outside Thunder Bay, he was forced to stop briefly after he suffered an intense coughing fit and experienced pains in his chest. Unsure what to do, he resumed running as the crowds along the highway shouted out their encouragement. A few miles later, short of breath and with continued chest pain, he asked Alward to drive him to a hospital. He feared immediately that he had run his last kilometer. The next day, Fox held a tearful press conference during which he announced that his cancer had returned and spread to his lungs. He was forced to end his run after 143 days and . Fox refused offers to complete the run in his stead, stating that he wanted to complete his marathon himself.

Fox had raised $1.7 million by the time he was forced to abandon the Marathon. He realized that the nation was about to see the consequences of the disease, and hoped that this might lead to greater generosity. A week after his run ended, the <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV Television Network</a> organized a nationwide <a href="telethon">telethon</a> in support of Fox and the Canadian Cancer Society. Supported by Canadian and international celebrities, the five-hour event raised $10.5 million. Among the donations were $1 million each by the governments of British Columbia and Ontario, the former to create a new research institute to be founded in Fox's name, and the latter an endowment given to the Ontario Cancer Treatment and Research Foundation. Donations continued throughout the winter, and by the following April, over $23 million had been raised.

Supporters and well wishers from around the world inundated Fox with letters and tokens of support. At one point, he was receiving more mail than the rest of Port Coquitlam combined. Such was his fame that one letter addressed simply to "Terry Fox, Canada" was successfully delivered.

In September 1980, he was invested in a special ceremony as a Companion of the <a href="Order%20of%20Canada">Order of Canada</a>; he was the youngest person to be so honoured. The <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20British%20Columbia">Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia</a> named him to the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Dogwood">Order of the Dogwood</a>, the province's highest award. <a href="Canada%27s%20Sports%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Canada's Sports Hall of Fame</a> commissioned a permanent exhibit, and Fox was named the winner of the <a href="Lou%20Marsh%20Award">Lou Marsh Award</a> for 1980 as the nation's top athlete. He was named Canada's 1980 <a href="Canadian%20Newsmaker%20of%20the%20Year">Newsmaker of the Year</a>. The "<a href="Ottawa%20Citizen">Ottawa Citizen</a>" described the national response to his marathon as "one of the most powerful outpourings of emotion and generosity in Canada's history".

In the following months, Fox received multiple chemotherapy treatments; however, the disease continued to spread. As his condition worsened, Canadians hoped for a miracle and <a href="Pope%20John%20Paul%20II">Pope John Paul II</a> sent a telegram saying that he was praying for Fox. Doctors turned to experimental <a href="interferon">interferon</a> treatments, though their effectiveness against <a href="osteogenic%20sarcoma">osteogenic sarcoma</a> was unknown. He suffered an adverse reaction to his first treatment, but continued the program after a period of rest.

Fox was re-admitted to the <a href="Royal%20Columbian%20Hospital">Royal Columbian Hospital</a> in <a href="New%20Westminster">New Westminster</a> on June 19, 1981, with chest congestion and developed <a href="pneumonia">pneumonia</a>. He fell into a <a href="coma">coma</a> and died at 4:35 a.m. <a href="Pacific%20Daylight%20Time">PDT</a> on June 28, 1981, with his family by his side. The Government of Canada ordered flags across the country lowered to half mast, an unprecedented honour that was usually reserved for statesmen. Addressing the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20Canada">House of Commons</a>, Trudeau said, "It occurs very rarely in the life of a nation that the courageous spirit of one person unites all people in the celebration of his life and in the mourning of his death ... We do not think of him as one who was defeated by misfortune but as one who inspired us with the example of the triumph of the human spirit over adversity".

His funeral in Port Coquitlam was attended by 40 relatives and 200 guests, and broadcast on national television; hundreds of communities across Canada also held memorial services, a public memorial service was held on <a href="Parliament%20Hill">Parliament Hill</a> in Ottawa, and Canadians again overwhelmed Cancer Society offices with donations.

Fox remains a prominent figure in Canadian folklore. His determination united the nation; people from all walks of life lent their support to his run and his memory inspires pride in all regions of the country. A 1999 national survey named him as Canada's greatest hero, and he finished second to <a href="Tommy%20Douglas">Tommy Douglas</a> in the 2004 <a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a> program "<a href="The%20Greatest%20Canadian">The Greatest Canadian</a>". Fox's heroic status has been attributed to his image as an ordinary person attempting a remarkable and inspirational feat. Others have argued that Fox's greatness derives from his audacious vision, his determined pursuit of his goal, his ability to overcome challenges such as his lack of experience and the very loneliness of his venture. As Fox's advocate on "The Greatest Canadian", media personality <a href="Sook-Yin%20Lee">Sook-Yin Lee</a> compared him to a classic hero, <a href="Phidippides">Phidippides</a>, the runner who delivered the news of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marathon">Battle of Marathon</a> before dying, and asserted that Fox "embodies the most cherished Canadian values: compassion, commitment, perseverance". She highlighted the juxtaposition between his celebrity, brought about by the unforgettable image he created, and his rejection of the trappings of that celebrity. Typically amongst Canadian icons, Fox is an unconventional hero, admired but not without flaws. An obituary in the "Canadian Family Physician" emphasized his humanity and noted that his anger – at his diagnosis, at press misrepresentations and at those he saw as encroaching on his independence – spoke against ascribing sainthood for Fox, and thus placed his achievements within the reach of all.

In September 2013, Dr. Jay Wunder, a sarcoma specialist at <a href="Mount%20Sinai%20Hospital%2C%20Toronto">Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto</a>, noted that survival rates for <a href="osteosarcoma">osteosarcoma</a> have increased dramatically since Fox's death. Most patients "get limb-sparing or limb-reconstructive surgery. Now the cure rate's almost up to 80 per cent in younger patients. In older patients it's more like 70 per cent. ... So that's a pretty big turnaround in a couple of decades." These advances in treatment might be partly attributable to the $750 million raised since Terry Fox started his Marathon of Hope, as of January 2018.

Fox expressed a robust attitude to his situation: he refused to regard himself as disabled, and would not allow anyone to pity him, telling a Toronto radio station that he found life more "rewarding and challenging" since he had lost his leg. His feat helped redefine Canadian views of disability and the <a href="Inclusion%20%28disability%20rights%29">inclusion of the disabled</a> in society. Fox's actions increased the visibility of people with disabilities, and in addition influenced the attitudes of those with disabilities, by showing them disability portrayed in a positive light. <a href="Rick%20Hansen">Rick Hansen</a> commented that the run challenged society to focus on ability rather than disability. "What was perceived as a limitation became a great opportunity. People with disabilities started looking at things differently. They came away with huge pride", he wrote.

In contrast, the narrative surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media's focus on stereotyped portrayals of the heroic and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities, rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor <a href="Alan%20Toy">Alan Toy</a> noted "Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement. But a lot of disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven't done something extraordinary. They may be bankers or factory workers – proof enough of their usefulness to society. Do we have to be 'supercrips' in order to be valid? And if we're not super, are we invalid?" The media's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the <a href="social%20model%20of%20disability">social model of disability</a>, where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.

One of Fox's earliest supporters was Isadore Sharp, founder of the Four Seasons Hotels. Sharp had lost his own son to cancer and offered Fox and his companions free accommodation at his hotels. He donated $10,000 and challenged 999 other businesses to do the same. Sharp also proposed an annual fundraising run in Fox's name. Fox agreed, but insisted that the runs be non-competitive. There were to be no winners or losers, and anyone who participated could run, walk or ride. Sharp faced opposition to the project. The Cancer Society feared that a fall run would detract from its traditional April campaigns, while other charities believed that an additional fundraiser would leave less money for their causes. Sharp persisted, and he, the Four Seasons Hotels and the Fox family organized the first Terry Fox Run on September 13, 1981.

Over 300,000 people took part and raised $3.5 million in the first Terry Fox Run. Schools across Canada were urged to join the second run, held on September 19, 1982. School participation has continued since, evolving into the National School Run Day. The runs, which raised over $20 million in their first six years, grew into an international event as over one million people in 60 countries took part in 1999, raising $15 million that year alone. By the Terry Fox Run's 25th anniversary, more than three million people were taking part annually. Grants from the Terry Fox Foundation, which organizes the runs, have helped Canadian scientists make numerous advances in cancer research. The Terry Fox Run is the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research, and over $750 million has been raised in his name, as of January 2018. The 30th Terry Fox Run was held September 19, 2010.

The physical memorials in Canada named after Fox include:

Shortly after his death, Fox was named the Newsmaker of the Year for 1981, and <a href="Canada%20Post">Canada Post</a> announced the production of a commemorative stamp in 1981, bypassing its traditionally held position that stamps honouring people should not be created until ten years after their deaths. British rock star <a href="Rod%20Stewart">Rod Stewart</a> was so moved by the Marathon of Hope that he was inspired to write and dedicate the song "Never Give Up on a Dream" – found on his 1981 album "<a href="Tonight%20I%27m%20Yours">Tonight I'm Yours</a>" – to Fox. Stewart also called his 1981–1982 tour of Canada the "Terry Fox Tour".

The <a href="Terry%20Fox%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Terry Fox Hall of Fame</a> was established in 1994 to recognize individuals that have made contributions that improved the quality of life of disabled people. The <a href="Terry%20Fox%20Laboratory">Terry Fox Laboratory</a> research centre was established in Vancouver to conduct leading edge research into the causes and potential cures for cancer.

The <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Mint">Royal Canadian Mint</a> produced a special dollar coin in 2005 to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the Marathon of Hope. It was their first regular circulation coin to feature a Canadian.

In 2008, Terry Fox was named a <a href="Persons%20of%20National%20Historic%20Significance">National Historic Person of Canada</a>, a recognition given by the <a href="Government%20of%20Canada">Canadian government</a> to those persons who are considered to have played a nationally significant role in the history of the country. Fox's designation was due to his status as an "enduring icon", his personal qualities, and for the manner in which the Marathon of Hope had captivated the country and resonated deeply with Canadians.

Fox's mother, <a href="Betty%20Fox">Betty Fox</a>, was one of eight people to carry the <a href="Olympic%20Flag">Olympic Flag</a> into <a href="BC%20Place%20Stadium">BC Place Stadium</a> at the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics%20opening%20ceremony">opening ceremonies</a> of the <a href="2010%20Winter%20Olympics">2010 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a>. The games saw the <a href="Terry%20Fox%20Award">Terry Fox Award</a> bestowed on Olympic athletes who embodied Fox's characteristics of determination and humility in the face of adversity.

Beginning in 2015 Manitoba designated the first Monday in August, formerly known as <a href="Civic%20Holiday">Civic Holiday</a>, as Terry Fox Day.

Fox's story was dramatized in the 1983 <a href="biopic">biopic</a> "<a href="The%20Terry%20Fox%20Story">The Terry Fox Story</a>". Produced by <a href="Home%20Box%20Office">Home Box Office</a>, the film aired as a <a href="television%20movie">television movie</a> in the United States and had a theatrical run in Canada. The film starred amputee actor <a href="Eric%20Fryer%20%28actor%29">Eric Fryer</a> and <a href="Robert%20Duvall">Robert Duvall</a>, and was the first film made exclusively for pay television. The movie received mixed but generally positive reviews. However, it was criticized by Fox's family over how it portrayed his temper. "The Terry Fox Story" was nominated for eight <a href="Genie%20Awards">Genie Awards</a>, and won five, including <a href="Genie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Motion%20Picture">Best Picture</a> and <a href="Genie%20Award%20for%20Best%20Performance%20by%20an%20Actor%20in%20a%20Leading%20Role">Best Actor</a>.

Rock musician <a href="Ian%20Thomas%20%28Canadian%20musician%29">Ian Thomas</a> had written and recorded a song in response to Terry's story, <a href="Runner%20%28song%29">Runner</a>, which ended up being included in the film. It also was covered by <a href="Manfred%20Mann%27s%20Earth%20Band">Manfred Mann's Earth Band</a>, reaching 22 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984.

A second movie, titled "<a href="Terry%20%28film%29">Terry</a>", focused on the Marathon of Hope, was produced by the <a href="CTV%20Television%20Network">CTV Television Network</a> in 2005. Fox was portrayed by <a href="Shawn%20Ashmore">Shawn Ashmore</a>. He is not an amputee; digital editing was used to superimpose a prosthesis over his real leg. The film was endorsed by Fox's family, and portrayed his attitude more positively than the first movie. Canadian <a href="National%20Basketball%20Association">National Basketball Association</a> star <a href="Steve%20Nash">Steve Nash</a>, who himself was inspired by Fox when he was a child, directed a 2010 documentary "Into the Wind", which aired on <a href="ESPN">ESPN</a> as part of its "<a href="30%20for%2030">30 for 30</a>" series.

Terry Fox was not the first person to attempt to run across Canada. Mark Kent crossed the country in 1974 as he raised money for the Canadian team at the <a href="1976%20Summer%20Olympics">1976 Summer Olympics</a>. While he lived, Fox refused to let anyone else complete the Marathon of Hope, having promised to finish it himself once he recovered. <a href="Steve%20Fonyo">Steve Fonyo</a>, an 18-year-old who suffered from the same form of cancer and who also had a leg amputated, sought in 1984 to duplicate Fox's run, calling his effort the "Journey for Lives". After leaving St. John's on March 31, Fonyo reached the point where Fox was forced to end his marathon at the end of November, and completed the transcontinental run on May 29, 1985. The Journey for Lives raised over $13 million for cancer research.

Canadian <a href="Paralympic%20Games">Paralympic</a> athlete <a href="Rick%20Hansen">Rick Hansen</a>, who had recruited Fox to play on his wheelchair basketball team in 1977, was similarly inspired by the Marathon of Hope. Hansen, who first considered circumnavigating the globe in his wheelchair in 1974, began the <a href="Man%20in%20Motion%20World%20Tour">Man in Motion World Tour</a> in 1985 with the goal of raising $10 million towards research into <a href="spinal%20cord%20injuries">spinal cord injuries</a>. As Fonyo had, Hansen paused at the spot Fox's run ended to honour the late runner. Hansen completed his world tour in May 1987 after 792 days and ; he travelled through 34 countries and raised over $26 million.

September Morn

Matinée de Septembre (English: September Morn) is a controversial <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas completed in 1911 by the French artist <a href="Paul%20%C3%89mile%20Chabas">Paul Émile Chabas</a>. Painted over several summers, it depicts a nude girl or young woman standing in the shallow water of a lake, prominently lit by the morning sun. She is leaning slightly forward in an ambiguous posture, which has been read variously as a straightforward portrayal of protecting her modesty, huddling against the cold, or sponge bathing. It has also been considered a disingenuous pose permitting the "fetishisation of innocence".

"September Morn" was first exhibited at the <a href="Paris%20Salon">Paris Salon</a> of 1912, and although the identity of its first owner is unclear, it is certain that Leon Mantashev acquired the painting by the end of 1913. It was taken to Russia, and in the aftermath of the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> of 1917 was feared lost. It resurfaced in 1935 in the collection of <a href="Calouste%20Gulbenkian">Calouste Gulbenkian</a>, and after his death in 1955 was sold to a Philadelphia broker, who donated it anonymously to the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> (the Met) in 1957. it is not on display.

From 1913 on, reproductions of the painting caused controversy in the United States. An art dealer in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> was charged with indecency and another in New York was targeted by anti-vice crusader <a href="Anthony%20Comstock">Anthony Comstock</a>, both after displaying "September Morn". Over the next few years the work was reproduced in a variety of forms, including on pins and calendars, while censorship and art were debated in newspapers. Chabas' painting inspired songs, stage shows and films; eventually some 7 million reproductions were sold, though Chabas – who had not copyrighted "September Morn" – did not receive any royalties.

Although several women claimed to be the model for "September Morn", Chabas never revealed her identity. He described the work as "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. Later writers, however, have described the painting as <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a>, valuable only as a historic artifact.

"September Morn" depicts, from an oblique point of view, a naked blonde girl or young woman standing ankle-deep in the water near the shoreline of a tranquil lake surrounded by hills. The figure is backlit by the morning sun, but fully visible, if a little darker than her surroundings. Her arms are folded about her body, her right arm passing below her breasts as she grasps her left elbow, while her left arm conceals her pubic area. This pose has been variously interpreted as the subject protecting herself from the cold, covering her modesty, or <a href="sponge%20bath">sponge bath</a>ing, or as the artist's "fetishisation of innocence".

Reviews in 1912 noted that the painting was dominated by grays: those of her shaded body, the blue-grays of the September water, the green-grays of the sky, and the pink-grays of the hills behind her. The art critic François Thiébault-Sisson described this as evoking the morning, the young subject preparing to bathe while "light grey vapours are still floating over the lake". This <a href="oil%20painting">oil painting</a> on canvas measures , and Chabas's signature is located in the lower left.

By the time he painted "September Morn", <a href="Paul%20%C3%89mile%20Chabas">Paul Émile Chabas</a> (1869–1937) already had an established reputation as an <a href="academic%20art">academic art</a>ist. He regularly submitted to the <a href="Salon%20%28Paris%29">Paris Salon</a>, first participating in 1886. He won a third class medal in the Salon of 1895, and four years later won the Prix National for his painting "<a href="Joyeux%20%C3%A9bats">Joyeux ébats</a>", which earned him a gold medal at the 1900 <a href="Exposition%20Universelle%20%281900%29">Exposition Universelle</a> and was acquired by the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20des%20Beaux-Arts%20de%20Nantes">Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nantes</a>. In subsequent years Chabas spent the winters working in Paris, while he passed his summers painting young women along the shores of rivers, lakes, and seas. In 1902 he was made a Chevalier in the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honour">Legion of Honour</a>.

Chabas studied under artists such as <a href="Tony%20Robert-Fleury">Tony Robert-Fleury</a>, <a href="William-Adolphe%20Bouguereau">William-Adolphe Bouguereau</a>, and <a href="Albert%20Maignan">Albert Maignan</a>. Although his earlier works were generally portraits, most of the painter's later production consisted of nude girls and young women. The lakes and rivers of France were common settings for his paintings, which gave prominence to the interaction of light with the models and their surroundings. "September Morn" is typical of his style.

J. Valmy-Baysse, in a 1910 overview of the artist, attributes Chabas's style to the painter's time at the family summer home along the <a href="Erdre">Erdre</a>; he identifies the "grace of adolescence, its undefinable charm, [and] its chaste nudity" of the models with Chabas's reminiscences of his youth. The art historian <a href="Bram%20Dijkstra">Bram Dijkstra</a> has argued otherwise, stating that "no artist was more assiduous in exploiting the prurient possibilities of the woman-child" than Chabas, whom he considers to have "emphasized analogies of nude little girls and the familiar poses of vanity or physical arousal given to adult women".

Female nudes were the dominant subject of painting in French Salons at the end of the 19th century. Female models had become more common than male ones beginning in the early 19th century, first serving allegorical roles or as <a href="muse">muse</a>s, but eventually becoming individuals "who could be classified and whose history could be written". In academic art – such as that of Chabas – the models were not portrayed as they were, but as idealized nudes, based on classical ideals; the body hair of women models, for instance, would not be shown, and the pubic area was rendered smoothly. The hostess <a href="Suzanne%20Delv%C3%A9">Suzanne Delve</a>, who later claimed to have stood for "September Morn", said that models were willing to provide "service to art" by posing nude for such works.

Not all forms of nude imagery were acceptable in France. The end of the 19th century had seen the introduction of various laws against pornography, images of adults and <a href="child%20pornography">children</a> meant to "provoke, incite, or stimulate debauchery". Works targeted were initially those meant for wide distribution (and thus, the lower class). However, the Australian art historian Fae Brauer writes that the line between art and pornography was blurred by the early 1910s; even tighter laws, introduced in 1908, had resulted in censorship of modernist works. For instance, three paintings by <a href="Kees%20van%20Dongen">Kees van Dongen</a> (including two of his daughter) were rejected from the <a href="Salon%20d%27Automne">Salon d'Automne</a> between 1911 and 1913 on grounds of indecency.

The United States had, since colonial times, generally been more puritan in terms of art than Europe. In the mid- and late-19th century the country's government implemented <a href="United%20States%20obscenity%20law">laws against obscenity</a>, such as the <a href="Tariff%20of%201842">Tariff of 1842</a> which banned the importing of foreign works of art deemed obscene. By the end of the 19th century, an uneasy understanding had been reached: museums could hold works depicting nudity, but commercial works (including photographs of artwork) could be – and were – confiscated. Tensions remained over the issue of whether nudes represented European-style sophistication (a trait important to the upper-class) or encouraged behaviors which threatened families and encouraged "impure imaginations".

Chabas began work on "September Morn" in mid-1910 at <a href="Talloires">Talloires</a> on the shores of <a href="Lake%20Annecy">Lake Annecy</a> in <a href="Haute-Savoie">Haute-Savoie</a>, some south-east of Paris. The model, whom he never identified but referred to as "Marthe", was well known to his family. Owing to the financial situation of the sixteen-year-old's family, "Marthe" had to work to support her mother. On the first day of painting, "Marthe" entered the morning water and instinctively recoiled at its chilliness. Chabas approved of this pose, saying that it was "perfect". Over the course of two summers he worked on the painting, half an hour every morning. The work was completed on a September morning in 1911, giving the painting its name. In 1935, responding to claims that "Marthe" was living in poverty, Chabas explained that she had continued posing for him until she was 28, when she married a rich industrialist, and that she was now aged 41, plump, and had three children.

Numerous women have claimed or been claimed to be the model, some presenting different versions of events. In 1913, a Miss Louise Buckley, performing in <a href="Eugene%2C%20Oregon">Eugene, Oregon</a>, said that she had been paid $1,000 and posed in the artist's studio. The Paris-based artist Jules Pages, meanwhile, stated that the woman depicted in "September Morn" had been a 25-year-old of good character who earned her living as an artist's model, but had gone into hiding after the controversy over the painting. Other claimants included a Swedish model named Gloria and a <a href="Variety%20show">variety</a> actress named Irene Shannon; the latter made the claim in the lead-up to a <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a> skit called "November Mourning".
In 1937, twenty-four years after "September Morn" caused controversy in the United States, the Parisian hostess Suzanne Delve declared that she had been the model. In her account, Chabas – who had known her since she was an infant – had her pose nude in his studio and later painted Lake Annecy in her absence. Delve described her nervousness at the first session, her mother chatting to her to distract her mind while Chabas's wife played soothing music on the piano. She said she took her pose "instinctively" and that the controversy over the painting had ruined her life, as no Frenchman would want to marry a woman marred by scandal.

Yet another version is presented by the <a href="Metropolitan%20Museum%20of%20Art">Metropolitan Museum of Art</a> (the Met) in their 1966 catalogue of French holdings, including "September Morn". According to this telling, Chabas completed the painting over three summers at Lake Annecy, though his peasant model served only as the basis for the figure's body. The head was based on a sketch of a young American, Julie Phillips, which Chabas had completed upon observing her and her mother dining in Paris; finding her profile to his liking, he silently drew her, then introduced himself and "apologized for his presumption".

Chabas first exhibited "September Morn" in the Paris Salon of April 14 to June 30, 1912. Because he did not plan to sell it, he gave a price of 50,000 francs ($10,000) – more than he expected anybody to pay. For the painting, and his "Portrait of Mme. Aston Knight", Chabas won a Medal of Honor, receiving 220 of 359 possible votes. At the Salon, the painting was uncontroversial, and it was soon reprinted in American publications such as "<a href="Town%20%26amp%3B%20Country%20%28magazine%29">Town & Country</a>" and "<a href="The%20Studio%20%28magazine%29">The International Studio</a>".

Sources are unclear as to the painting's provenance after the Salon. According to the Met, the New York-based Philip (or Philippe) Ortiz, manager of the New York Branch of Braun and Company, purchased it in late 1912. According to a 1933 report in the "<a href="Times%20Herald-Record">Middletown Times Herald</a>", he paid 12,000 francs ($2,400) for the work, but never brought the painting back to the United States. However, Brauer suggests that Ortiz sent it to his gallery in New York, where it caused <a href="%23New%20York">a controversy</a>. According to "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">Time</a>", the painting was acquired by Leon Mantashev  1913, after the painting was returned to Chabas.

A 1935 article in the "<a href="Montreal%20Gazette">Montreal Gazette</a>", meanwhile, stated that the original "September Morn" had yet to go to the United States, and that Chabas had sold it directly to Mantashev. According to Chabas, this was after an American approached him to purchase the painting, but was unwilling to pay the asking price. In her memoirs, "<a href="Vogue%20%28magazine%29">Vogue</a>" editor <a href="Edna%20Woolman%20Chase">Edna Woolman Chase</a> recounted how Ortiz had arranged for numerous reproductions to be made and sent to New York, and that – although he had been interested in acquiring the original – he had been unable to do so. Although it is possible that the original did not cross the Atlantic by 1913, it is clear that reproductions did.

A full-size reproduction of "September Morn" was displayed in a window of Jackson and Semmelmeyer, a photography shop in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Illinois, in March 1913. A passing police officer noticed the print and on grounds that it was indecent, insisted it be taken down. The mayor of the city, <a href="Carter%20Harrison%2C%20Jr.">Carter Harrison, Jr.</a>, agreed with the policeman's decision, and deemed that the image could be sold, but should not be displayed in public as children could see it. Fred Jackson, the owner, was charged with indecency, and at his request the case was brought to trial on March 18.

In front of a jury, the city's art censor Jeremiah O'Connor testified that "September Morn" was lewd and should not be displayed in public, but rather only in a museum exhibition. W. W. Hallam of the Chicago Vice Committee agreed, arguing that, as the woman was committing the illegal act of bathing in public, "September Morn" had to be banned. Other witnesses for the prosecution included censors, educators, and clergy, such as the superintendent <a href="Ella%20Flagg%20Young">Ella Flagg Young</a> and the head of the <a href="Juvenile%20Protective%20Association">Juvenile Protective Association</a> Gertrude Howe Britton.

Jackson, acting as his own lawyer, highlighted the hypocrisy of censoring the painting while a nude statue of <a href="Diana%20%28mythology%29">Diana</a> stood in front of the <a href="Montgomery%20Ward%20Company%20Complex">Montgomery Ward Building</a>. He called upon painters, poets, and sculptors as his witnesses, including the artist Oliver Grover and the art critic Walter Smith. In his testimony, Grover stated "A nude woman is no more
indecent than a bare tree. Men and women weren't born with overcoats on. Anyhow, indecency may be decidedly apart from nudity."

After less than an hour of deliberations, the jury found for Jackson, allowing him to reinstate the image in his display; Jackson was so pleased that he promised a free copy of "September Morn" to each juror. Ten days after the trial Mayor Harrison went to the city council and proposed stricter obscenity laws. The city government agreed, and imposed a $25–100 fine for displaying nude art along public roads and in places frequented by children. By September Jackson (together with fellow art dealers Samuel Meyer and William Kuhl) had been found in violation of this law. Mayor Harrison later stated that he was "through" with the painting, saying "Chicago has been made the laughing stock of the whole country because of this bathing girl picture".

Further controversy arose in New York in May 1913, two months after the conclusion of the Chicago trial. <a href="Anthony%20Comstock">Anthony Comstock</a>, head of the <a href="New%20York%20Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">New York Society for the Suppression of Vice</a> and nationally recognized for his campaigns against "smut", saw "September Morn" – sources differ as to whether it was the original or a print  – on display in the window of Braun and Company, an art dealership on West 46th Street. Rushing inside, he raged "There's too little morn and too much maid! Take it out!". A clerk, James Kelly, removed the work, but Ortiz, the gallery's manager, reinstated it in the window after returning from his lunch break.

Comstock threatened Ortiz with legal action, and the manager – unaware that Comstock could not arrest him, and fearful that he could cause trouble for the gallery – was initially frightened. He consulted with <a href="Arthur%20Brisbane">Arthur Brisbane</a> of the "<a href="New%20York%20Journal-American">New York Evening Journal</a>", who told him he had nothing to fear, and sent some reporters to cover the story. The following day, the controversy was highly covered in the press, who hailed Ortiz as "one art expert with the courage to stand up against Comstock and his dictatorship". Following Comstock's visit large crowds blocked the street outside Braun and Company, ogling "September Morn". The gallery owner refused to sell his large print of "September Morn", so that it could remain in his window.

After two weeks, when the dealership had sold every print it had, Ortiz removed the display. In a letter to the editor of "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>", he accused Comstock of causing the controversy to earn greater publicity for himself, and stated that he wearied of crowds outside his shop, who blocked paying customers from entering it. Ultimately, Comstock did not pursue legal action. The historian Walter M. Kendrick attributes this apparent leniency to "September Morn" status as a work of art, whereas Gerald Carson, writing in "<a href="American%20Heritage%20%28magazine%29">American Heritage</a>", attributes it to a knowledge that no action could be taken against the work.

The controversy promoted polemics regarding "September Morn" and censorship, and multiple <a href="editorial%20cartoon">editorial cartoon</a>s; one depicted a young woman bathing, only her head showing, with a caption attributed to Comstock reading "Don't you suppose I can imagine what is UNDER the water?". Comstock called the work "demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young", arguing that it must be suppressed in the <a href="Think%20of%20the%20children">interest of the children</a>. He emphasized that "the law is the law ... the picture will have to come out of the window". Reverend Sydney Ussher of <a href="St.%20Bartholomew%27s%20Episcopal%20Church%20%28Manhattan%29">St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church</a> took a more moderate approach, explaining that "so vivid a display of nudity as "September Morn"" would best not be displayed in the United States, owing to the people's relative lack of appreciation for art.
Other, more positive, views were also expressed. The suffragist <a href="Inez%20Milholland">Inez Milholland</a> defended "September Morn", stating that it was "exquisite and delicate, depicting perfect youth and innocence", and found it "funny, if it weren't so sad" that such a work would be censored while more titillating film posters were left untouched. The social activist <a href="Rose%20Pastor%20Stokes">Rose Pastor Stokes</a> wrote that this "glorious work of art" was a "rare" depiction of "the loveliest dream that nature ever made real—the human Body Beautiful" and that shame over one's body should not be blamed on "September Morn", but on a failed education system. The artist <a href="James%20Montgomery%20Flagg">James Montgomery Flagg</a> proclaimed "only a diseased mind can find anything immoral in "September Morn"".

In his 1931 autobiography, the <a href="public%20relations">public relations</a> pioneer <a href="Harry%20Reichenbach">Harry Reichenbach</a> claimed responsibility for the controversy surrounding "September Morn" – and the work's resulting popularity. He stated that Braun and Company had acquired some 2,000 reproductions of the painting which they could not sell, and then hired him for $45 so that he could unload the stock. They then paid for a large <a href="lithograph">lithograph</a> reproduction to be made and put on display. Reichenbach, he stated, then contacted public figures to protest against the display. When there was no response, he accosted Comstock in his office and dragged him to the dealership, where some young children, whom Reichenbach had hired for fifty cents each, lusted over the display. The public relations man then worked towards maintaining interest in the work, prints of which had already increased in price – from 10 cents to a dollar.

A 1937 "<a href="The%20Salt%20Lake%20Tribune">Salt Lake Tribune</a>" article stated that, after the 1913 controversies, reproductions of "September Morn" were shown "on the front page of every newspaper in the land". Ortiz required these newspapers to pay a charge and mention his copyright, otherwise face a penalty of $500 to $1000; Chase recalled that "Vogue" had been one of those charged. These newspaper reproductions, however, were sometimes censored. Fred L. Boalt of "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Star">The Seattle Star</a>", covering a local exhibit of a reproduction, explained his newspaper's rationale for such censorship: "For humane as well as other reasons, [...] the "Star" artist has painted in a short petticoat. He didn't want to do it. He suffered. But we made him do it."

Lithograph copies of "September Morn" were mass-produced for popular sale, extending the <a href="succ%C3%A8s%20de%20scandale">success that followed the scandal</a>, and were widely hung in private homes. Reproductions were featured on a variety of products, including cigar bands, postcards, bottle openers, statuettes, <a href="watch%20fob">watch fob</a>s, and candy boxes; the model was also popular as a tattoo. "September Morn" was the first <a href="nude%20calendar">nude used for calendars</a>, and by the late 1950s it had featured on millions. A couplet referring to Chabas's work, "Please don't think I'm bad or bold, but where its deep it's awful cold", was widely circulated.
Allusions to the painting were common in vaudeville acts, becoming stock gags in the <a href="Orpheum%20Circuit">Orpheum Circuit</a>. Stage imitations of the painting were also created. In 1913, for instance, <a href="Florenz%20Ziegfeld%2C%20Jr.">Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr.</a> cast <a href="Ann%20Pennington%20%28actress%29">Ann Pennington</a> as the model as part of his "<a href="Ziegfeld%20Follies">Follies</a>". In this successful version of "September Morn", the subject bore a sheer cape, with leaves placed strategically over her body, and stood on a stage made-up as water. A <a href="burlesque">burlesque</a> act, deeming itself the "September Morning Glories", was also created, as was a three-act <a href="Musical%20theatre">musical</a> based on the painting. The latter – featuring a fifty-strong <a href="chorus%20line">chorus line</a> – was put on by Arthur Gillespie and Frank Tannehill, Jr. and debuted at the <a href="La%20Salle%20Theater%20%28Chicago%29">La Salle Theater</a> in Chicago. In Milwaukee, a man wearing "little or no clothing" passed himself off as "September Morn" at the 1915 <a href="Wisconsin%20State%20Fair">Wisconsin State Fair</a>; he was brought to trial and fined $25. Theatrical references to the painting continued into the 1950s. For instance, in <a href="Tennessee%20Williams">Tennessee Williams</a>'s 1957 play "<a href="Orpheus%20Descending">Orpheus Descending</a>", the character Val sees it hanging in his room and mentions he "might keep turning the light on to take another look at it".

"September Morn" also inspired several films. A two-reel production by <a href="Path%C3%A9">Pathé</a>, titled "<a href="September%20Morn%20%28film%29">September Morn</a>", was released in February 1914 and followed the misadventures of a sailor who gets a tattoo of the model. After his girlfriend disapproves, he tries clothing the naked woman with a ripped skirt, but this fails to gain his lover's approval; ultimately, he ends up with a fully clothed nude and the text "Votes for Women" inked on his arm. Meanwhile, "September Mourning", a November 1915 release produced by <a href="L-KO%20Kompany">L-KO</a>, portrayed a pair of artists first vying for the attentions of a young woman in the park, then invading a school for girls. Robert McElravy, reviewing for "Moving Picture World", found the film funny, but considered it to lack plot. A third film, <a href="Lois%20Weber">Lois Weber</a>'s "<a href="The%20Hypocrites%20%281915%20film%29">Hypocrites</a>", portrayed "The Naked Truth" (an uncredited Margaret Edwards) in a manner similar to Chabas's model.
Several songs inspired by "September Morn" were likewise released. Musicians Frank Black and Bobby Heath penned a song, "September Morn", based on the painting, and Aubrey Stauffer of Chicago published <a href="sheet%20music">sheet music</a> (for voice and piano) of "", from Gillespie and Tannehill's musical. At <a href="Tin%20Pan%20Alley">Tin Pan Alley</a>, Henry I. Marshall composed two works, a <a href="waltz">waltz</a> for piano titled "", and a piece for voice and piano titled "", the latter featuring lyrics by <a href="Stanley%20Murphy">Stanley Murphy</a>. Both were published through Jerome H. Remick  Co. in 1913.

"September Morn" also inspired an eponymous lime and <a href="grenadine">grenadine</a> cocktail, described in 1917 as having gin, and later in 1930 with rum and egg white. 

As interest grew, purity societies attempted to ban reproductions of "September Morn", and people in possession of them ran the risk of confiscation and fines. Postcards bearing the painting were banned from the postal system. Harold Marx, a <a href="New%20Orleans">New Orleans</a> art dealer who displayed a reproduction, was arrested a month after being told to take the painting down; displays of reproductions were also forcibly removed in <a href="Miami">Miami</a> and <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>. In Chicago, a man was charged with disorderly conduct after bringing home a reproduction. Irene Deal, who dressed in a <a href="union%20suit">union suit</a> and posed as "Miss September Morn" in <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a>, as a publicity stunt, was controversially fined $50 for disorderly conduct. In 1914, students at the <a href="College%20of%20Wooster">College of Wooster</a> in <a href="Wooster%2C%20Ohio">Wooster, Ohio</a>, burned a copy of the painting for being against their religious beliefs.

Ultimately some 7 million reproductions of "September Morn", prints of which remained popular as late as the 1960s, were sold. Reichenbach characterized this popularity as a "laugh on the overzealous guardians of virtue" in which the entire American populace participated. Inspired by the commercial success of "September Morn", displays of images of nude women became more common; a "New York Times" reader wrote in 1915 that they had become "increasingly vulgar and suggestive".

In 1937 "<a href="Life%20%28magazine%29">Life</a>" deemed "September Morn" "one of the most familiar paintings in the world", and a retrospective "<a href="Toledo%20Blade">Toledo Blade</a>" article characterized the model as having become America's number one <a href="pin-up%20girl">pin-up girl</a>. Writing in 1957, Considine declared "September Morn" to be "the most controversial painting in the history of [the United States]", and the "<a href="New%20York%20Post">New York Post</a>" declared it "the most famous nude till the <a href="Marilyn%20Monroe">Marilyn Monroe</a> calendar". Carson wrote in 1961 that "September Morn" had caused "the most heated controversy over nudity, art, and morals" in the United States since <a href="Hiram%20Powers">Hiram Powers</a>' statue "<a href="The%20Greek%20Slave">The Greek Slave</a>" in the 1840s.

The oil baron Leon Mantashev acquired the original "September Morn" in  1913, for a price of $10,000 and brought it with him to Russia. After the outbreak of the <a href="October%20Revolution">October Revolution</a> the painting was feared destroyed. Following Mantashev's escape from Russia, pieces of his sizeable collection that were considered to have artistic value were sent to museums, but there was no information regarding works such as "September Morn". By 1933 Chabas was seeking information regarding his work's fate, which "<a href="The%20Milwaukee%20Journal">The Milwaukee Journal</a>" suggested was "hanging in some crowded Russian room, its owner perhaps completely ignorant of its world fame". At the time several American galleries had copies purported to be the original.

The painting, however, was safe; Mantashev had smuggled it out of the country, reportedly "rip[ping] it out of its frame" when the revolution broke out. In the early 1930s, in desperate need of funds, he sold "September Morn" to the <a href="Armenians">Armenian</a> art collector and philanthropist <a href="Calouste%20Gulbenkian">Calouste Gulbenkian</a> for $30,000; it was the last painting he owned. A <a href="United%20Press">United Press</a> reporter discovered the painting, which was framed as a <a href="tondo%20%28art%29">tondo</a>, in Gulbenkian's Paris home in 1935. There it hung with works by artists such as <a href="Claude%20Monet">Claude Monet</a> and <a href="Paul%20C%C3%A9zanne">Paul Cézanne</a>. By 1937 "September Morn" was on display in the <a href="Mus%C3%A9e%20du%20Luxembourg">Musée du Luxembourg</a>, hung between works by <a href="Jean-Fran%C3%A7ois%20Raffa%C3%ABlli">Jean-François Raffaëlli</a> and <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Carri%C3%A8re">Eugène Carrière</a>. After Gulbenkian's death in 1955, the painting was acquired by Wildenstein and Company of New York.

"September Morn" was purchased by the <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> broker and sportsman William Coxe Wright for $22,000 in 1957. In April of that year he offered it to the <a href="Philadelphia%20Museum%20of%20Art">Philadelphia Museum of Art</a>, but the painting was rejected for having "no relation to the stream of 20th century art". Eventually he anonymously donated the work – valued at an estimated $30,000 – to the Met in New York City. Speaking for the museum, Dudley T. Easby explained that, although the painting could not be classified as a masterpiece, it was nevertheless "a part of art history in view of the controversy that raged around the picture in earlier years".
After acquisition, in September 1957 the painting was displayed near the Met's front entrance, taking a place previously occupied by the <a href="P%C3%A9russis%20Altarpiece">Pérussis Altarpiece</a>. This position of honor was held for several weeks. Hughes reported a "veritable pilgrimage" of visitors came to see the painting, which she considered to add a "fresh, popular appeal" to the Met which drew museum-goers who would never have come otherwise. By then, the earlier scandal of the model's nudity had lessened; discussing an exhibit of the painting in <a href="Toledo%2C%20Ohio">Toledo, Ohio</a>, Alan Schoedel of the "Toledo Blade" quoted a viewer as saying that 1950s America was so inundated with racy calendar art that the painting "couldn't stand the competition".

After "September Morn" was acquired by the Met, it was displayed at several venues, including the <a href="Legion%20of%20Honor%20%28museum%29">Palace of the Legion of Honor</a> in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a> in 1958, the <a href="Toledo%20Museum%20of%20Art">Toledo Museum of Art</a> in Toledo, Ohio (also 1958), and by the Municipal Art Commission of <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> in 1959. Six years later it was again exhibited at Palace of the Legion of Honor, as part of an exhibition of works collected by the Wrights. In 1971, the Met removed "September Morn" from display and placed it in storage; Walter Monfried of "The Milwaukee Journal" wrote that the once-racy painting was now considered "too tame and banal". , the Met's website lists the painting as not on display, though it had been hung in the museum around 2011.

In 1913, Chabas stated that he was "pained and humiliated" by the controversy over "September Morn", though he later expressed more positive views. He described the work as "all I know of painting", and responded positively to statements that it was his masterpiece. In a 1914 interview, he explained that he had not meant to sell the painting, as it "was [his] wife's favorite picture". At the time of his death in 1937, Chabas had only a single picture in his room: a reproduction of the painting, completed from memory; he had boasted "If I had never seen it from the day I put down my brushes after painting it, I could make a perfect copy." However, not having copyrighted the work, he did not receive any royalties from the marketing frenzy in the United States; he recalled, "Nobody was thoughtful enough even to send me a box of cigars."

Reviewing the painting after the Salon, Tr.L. in the praised Chabas's technique as drawing "of a rare purity", and modeling "of a remarkable delicacy". Henri Frantz, reviewing the Paris Salon for "The International Studio", described "September Morn" as "one of the [Salon]'s most remarkable figure subjects", highlighting the nude's "graceful form". In "<a href="Le%20Temps%20%28Paris%29">Le Temps</a>", François Thiébault-Sisson found that, despite an "excessively translucent technique", the painting had "indisputable charm" and included "superior, very artistic, and delicately composed" imagery. A 1913 article in the "<a href="Oregon%20Daily%20Journal">Oregon Daily Journal</a>" described the model as "beautifully drawn", and suggested that "it requires a powerful imagination to find anything suggestive in the work".

Later reviews were less positive. The director of the Met, <a href="James%20Rorimer">James Rorimer</a>, wrote in 1957 that "September Morn" stood at "different ends of a wide spectrum" than the works of <a href="Old%20Master">Old Master</a>s and "modern giants", but was important in helping viewers "realize the full benefit of our heritage" in their explorations of past and present art. That year, the "Montreal Gazette" art critic opined that the painting was banal and unacceptable for display in the Met's main hall. The reviewer suggested that "September Morn", with its "delicate, pearly tonality and simple, sparse, airy composition", would be best served by being displayed among works considered better by early 20th-century collectors but since reviewed poorly, to "dramatiz[e] for the public the danger of too-hasty judgments".

In 1958, Blake-More Godwin of the Toledo Museum of Art stated that, although "September Morn" was certainly art, it was not "great art" and was overshadowed by the controversy it had created; the painting, he said, "bears the same relationship to art as a minor poem does to the classic and the imperishable". Three years later, in an article in "<a href="The%20Kenyon%20Review">The Kenyon Review</a>", Alfred Werner described "September Morn" as a "classic of <a href="kitsch">kitsch</a>" and "the 'idealized' nude at its worst": "without a wrinkle of the skin, without any breathing of the flesh ... pink, soft, spineless". This classification of kitsch has been applied by several further writers, including Kendrick and the film scholar Norman Taylor.

Several writers have included "September Morn" in lists of works depicting children with erotic or pornographic subtexts. Brauer argues that although the nude "seems to embody the moral purity at puberty", this innocence is actually a fetishistic mechanism which both allowed the work to pass the censors and be eroticised. She concludes that the painting is "paedophilically provocative", and that Chabas was protected from censure by his status as an established artist and father. Such views have not been universally held. For instance, the historian <a href="Paul%20S.%20Boyer">Paul S. Boyer</a> describes "September Morn" as "charmingly innocent", and the art writer Elizabeth Lunday finds the painting to be "offensive only on the grounds of blandness".

USS Missouri (BB-63)

USS "Missouri" (BB-63) ("Mighty Mo" or "Big Mo") is an and was the third ship of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> to be named after the <a href="U.S.%20state">U.S. state</a> of <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>. "Missouri" was the last battleship commissioned by the United States and is best remembered as the site of the <a href="Surrender%20of%20Japan">surrender of the Empire of Japan</a> which ended <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>.

"Missouri" was ordered in 1940 and commissioned in June 1944. In the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Theater</a> of World War II she fought in the battles of <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Okinawa</a> and shelled the Japanese home islands, and she fought in the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> from 1950 to 1953. She was decommissioned in 1955 into the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20reserve%20fleets">United States Navy reserve fleets</a> (the "Mothball Fleet"), but reactivated and modernized in 1984 as part of the <a href="600-ship%20Navy">600-ship Navy</a> plan, and provided fire support during <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a> in January/February 1991.

"Missouri" received a total of 11 <a href="battle%20star">battle star</a>s for service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf, and was finally decommissioned on 31 March 1992 after serving a total of 16 years of active service, but remained on the <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> until her name was struck in January 1995. In 1998, she was donated to the USS "Missouri" Memorial Association and became a <a href="museum%20ship">museum ship</a> at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>.

"Missouri" was one of the "<a href="fast%20battleship">fast battleship</a>" designs planned in 1938 by the Preliminary Design Branch at the <a href="Bureau%20of%20Construction%20and%20Repair">Bureau of Construction and Repair</a>. She was laid down at the <a href="Brooklyn%20Navy%20Yard">Brooklyn Navy Yard</a> on 6 January 1941, launched on 29 January 1944 and commissioned on 11 June with <a href="Captain%20%28United%20States%20O-6%29">Captain</a> <a href="William%20M.%20Callaghan">William Callaghan</a> in command. The ship was the third of the "Iowa" class, but the fourth and final "Iowa"-class ship commissioned by the U.S. Navy. The ship was christened at her launching by <a href="Margaret%20Truman">Mary Margaret Truman</a>, daughter of <a href="Harry%20S.%20Truman">Harry S. Truman</a>, then a United States Senator from <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a>.

"Missouri"s main battery consisted of nine <a href="16%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20Mark%207%20gun">/50 cal Mark 7 gun</a>s, which could fire armor-piercing shells some . Her secondary battery consisted of twenty <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun">/38 cal gun</a>s in twin turrets, with a range of about . With the advent of air power and the need to gain and maintain <a href="air%20superiority">air superiority</a> came a need to protect the growing fleet of allied <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s; to this end, "Missouri" was fitted with an array of <a href="Oerlikon%2020%20mm%20cannon">Oerlikon 20 mm</a> and <a href="Bofors%2040%20mm%20gun">Bofors 40 mm</a> <a href="anti-aircraft%20artillery">anti-aircraft guns</a> to defend allied carriers from enemy airstrikes. When reactivated in 1984 "Missouri" had her 20 mm and 40 mm AA guns removed, and was outfitted with <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx CIWS</a> mounts for protection against enemy missiles and aircraft, and <a href="Armored%20Box%20Launcher">Armored Box Launcher</a>s and Quad Cell Launchers designed to fire <a href="Tomahawk%20missile">Tomahawk missile</a>s and <a href="Harpoon%20missile">Harpoon missile</a>s, respectively. "Missouri" and her sister ship "Wisconsin" were fitted with thicker traverse bulkhead armor, , compared to in the first two ships of her class, the "Iowa" and "New Jersey".

"Missouri" was the last U.S. battleship to be completed. , the highest-numbered U.S. battleship built, was completed before "Missouri". The last-two "Iowa"-class battleships, "<a href="USS%20Illinois%20%28BB-65%29">Illinois</a>" and "<a href="USS%20Kentucky%20%28BB-66%29">Kentucky</a>", were ordered but cancelled, and all five of the twelve-gun <a href="Montana-class%20battleship%23Ships">"Montana"-class</a> vessels, BB-67 to BB-71, that were ordered in May 1942, were also cancelled by late July 1943.

After trials off New York and <a href="Shakedown%20cruise">shakedown</a> and battle practice in the <a href="Chesapeake%20Bay">Chesapeake Bay</a>, "Missouri" departed <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a> on 11 November 1944, transited the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a> on 18 November and steamed to San Francisco for final fitting out as fleet <a href="flagship">flagship</a>. She stood out of <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> on 14 December and arrived at <a href="Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor</a>, Hawaii on 24 December 1944. She departed Hawaii on 2 January 1945 and arrived in <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a>, West <a href="Caroline%20Islands">Caroline Islands</a> on 13 January. There she was temporary headquarters ship for <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Marc%20A.%20Mitscher">Marc A. Mitscher</a>. The battleship put to sea on 27 January to serve in the screen of the carrier task group of Mitscher's <a href="Fast%20Carrier%20Task%20Force">TF 58</a>, and on 16 February the task force's <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a>s launched the first naval air strikes against Japan since the famed <a href="Doolittle%20raid">Doolittle raid</a>, which had been launched from the carrier in April 1942.

"Missouri" then steamed with the carriers to <a href="Iwo%20Jima">Iwo Jima</a> where her main guns provided direct and continuous support to the <a href="Battle%20of%20Iwo%20Jima">invasion landings</a> begun on 19 February. After TF 58 returned to Ulithi on 5 March, "Missouri" was assigned to the carrier task group. On 14 March, "Missouri" departed Ulithi in the screen of the fast carriers and steamed to the Japanese mainland. During strikes against targets along the coast of the <a href="Seto%20Inland%20Sea">Inland Sea</a> of Japan beginning on 18 March, "Missouri" shot down four Japanese aircraft.

Raids against <a href="airfield">airfield</a>s and <a href="naval%20base">naval base</a>s near the Inland Sea and southwestern <a href="Honsh%C5%AB">Honshū</a> continued. When the carrier "" incurred battle damage, the "Missouri"s carrier task group provided cover for the "Franklin's" retirement toward Ulithi until 22 March, then set course for pre-invasion strikes and <a href="bombardment">bombardment</a> of <a href="Okinawa">Okinawa</a>.

"Missouri" joined the fast battleships of TF 58 in bombarding the southeast coast of Okinawa on 24 March, an action intended to draw enemy strength from the west coast beaches that would be the actual site of invasion landings. "Missouri" rejoined the screen of the carriers as <a href="United%20States%20Marine%20Corps">Marine</a> and <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> units <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">stormed the shores of Okinawa</a> on the morning of 1 April. An attack by Japanese forces was repulsed successfully.

On 11 April, a low-flying "<a href="kamikaze">kamikaze</a>" Zero, although fired upon, crashed on "Missouri"s <a href="starboard">starboard</a> side, just below her main deck level. The starboard wing of the plane was thrown far forward, starting a gasoline fire at Gun Mount No. 3. The battleship suffered only superficial damage, and the fire was brought quickly under control. The remains of the pilot were recovered on board the ship just aft of one of the 40 mm gun tubs. Although crewmen wanted to hose the remains over the side, Captain Callaghan decided that the young Japanese pilot had done his job to the best of his ability, and with honor, so he should be given a <a href="military%20funeral">military funeral</a>. The following day he was <a href="burial%20at%20sea">buried at sea</a> with military honors. The dent made by the Zero in the "Missouri's" side remains to this day.

About 23:05 on 17 April, "Missouri" detected an enemy <a href="submarine">submarine</a> from her formation. Her report set off a hunter-killer operation by the <a href="Light%20aircraft%20carrier">light carrier</a> and four destroyers, which sank the Japanese submarine .

"Missouri" was detached from the carrier task force off Okinawa on 5 May and sailed for Ulithi. During the Okinawa campaign she had shot down five enemy planes, assisted in the destruction of six others, and scored one probable kill. She helped repel 12 daylight attacks of enemy raiders and fought off four night attacks on her <a href="carrier%20battle%20group">carrier task group</a>. Her shore bombardment destroyed several gun emplacements and many other military, governmental, and industrial structures.

"Missouri" arrived at Ulithi on 9 May and then proceeded to <a href="Apra%20Harbor">Apra Harbor</a>, <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, arriving on 18 May. That afternoon <a href="Admiral">Admiral</a> <a href="William%20F.%20Halsey%2C%20Jr.">William F. Halsey, Jr.</a>, Commander <a href="United%20States%20Third%20Fleet">Third Fleet</a>, brought his staff from cruiser "Louisville" onto the "Missouri". She passed out of the harbor on 21 May, and by 27 May was again conducting shore bombardment against Japanese positions on Okinawa. "Missouri" led the 3rd Fleet in strikes on airfields and installations on <a href="Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Kyūshū</a> on 2–3 June. She rode out a fierce storm on 5 and 6 June. Some topside fittings were smashed, but "Missouri" suffered no major damage. Her fleet again struck Kyūshū on 8 June, then hit hard in a coordinated air-surface bombardment before retiring towards <a href="Leyte%20%28island%29">Leyte</a>. She arrived at <a href="San%20Pedro%20Bay%20%28Philippines%29">San Pedro Bay</a>, Leyte on 13 June, after almost three months of continuous operations in support of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Okinawa campaign</a>.

Here she rejoined the powerful 3rd Fleet in strikes at the heart of Japan from within its home waters. The fleet set a northerly course on 8 July to approach the Japanese main island, Honshū. Raids took Tokyo by surprise on 10 July, followed by more devastation at the juncture of <a href="Honsh%C5%AB">Honshū</a> and <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a>, the second-largest Japanese island, on 13–14 July. For the first time, naval gunfire destroyed a major installation within the home islands when "Missouri" <a href="Allied%20naval%20bombardments%20of%20Japan%20during%20World%20War%20II">joined in a shore bombardment</a> on 15 July that severely damaged the Nihon Steel Co. and the Wanishi Ironworks at <a href="Muroran%2C%20Hokkaido">Muroran, Hokkaido</a>.

During the nights of 17 and 18 July, "Missouri" bombarded industrial targets in Honshū. Inland Sea aerial strikes continued through 25 July, and "Missouri" guarded the carriers as they attacked the Japanese home islands.

Strikes on <a href="Hokkaid%C5%8D">Hokkaidō</a> and northern Honshū resumed on 9 August, the day <a href="Fat%20Man">the second atomic bomb</a> was dropped.

After the Japanese agreed to surrender, Admiral Sir <a href="Bruce%20Fraser%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fraser%20of%20North%20Cape">Bruce Fraser</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>, the Commander of the <a href="British%20Pacific%20Fleet">British Pacific Fleet</a>, boarded "Missouri" on 16 August and conferred the honour of <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire</a> upon Admiral Halsey. "Missouri" transferred a landing party of 200 officers and men to the battleship for temporary duty with the initial occupation force for Tokyo on 21 August. "Missouri" herself entered <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a> early on 29 August to prepare for the signing by Japan of the official <a href="Japanese%20Instrument%20of%20Surrender%20%281945%29">instrument of surrender</a>.

High-ranking military officials of all the <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied Powers</a> were received on board on 2 September, including <a href="Republic%20of%20China">Chinese</a> <a href="Shang%20Jiang">General</a> <a href="Xu%20Yongchang">Hsu Yung-Ch'ang</a>, British <a href="Admiral-of-the-Fleet">Admiral-of-the-Fleet</a> Sir <a href="Bruce%20Fraser%2C%201st%20Baron%20Fraser%20of%20North%20Cape">Bruce Fraser</a>, <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet</a> <a href="Lieutenant-General">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Kuzma%20Nikolaevich%20Derevyanko">Kuzma Nikolaevich Derevyanko</a>, Australian <a href="General%20%28Australia%29">General</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Blamey">Thomas Blamey</a>, Canadian Colonel <a href="Lawrence%20Moore%20Cosgrave">Lawrence Moore Cosgrave</a>, French <a href="Army%20General%20%28France%29">Général d'Armée</a> <a href="Philippe%20Leclerc%20de%20Hauteclocque">Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque</a>, Dutch <a href="Vice%20Admiral">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="Conrad%20Emil%20Lambert%20Helfrich">Conrad Emil Lambert Helfrich</a>, and New Zealand <a href="Air%20Vice%20Marshal">Air Vice Marshal</a> <a href="Leonard%20Monk%20Isitt%20%28aviator%29">Leonard M. Isitt</a>.

<a href="Fleet%20admiral%20%28United%20States%29">Fleet Admiral</a> <a href="Chester%20Nimitz">Chester Nimitz</a> boarded shortly after 0800, and <a href="General%20of%20the%20Army%20%28United%20States%29">General of the Army</a> <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>, the Supreme Commander for the Allies, came on board at 0843. The Japanese representatives, headed by <a href="Foreign%20Minister">Foreign Minister</a> <a href="Mamoru%20Shigemitsu">Mamoru Shigemitsu</a>, arrived at 0856. At 0902, General MacArthur stepped before a battery of <a href="microphone">microphone</a>s and opened the 23-minute surrender ceremony to the waiting world by stating, "It is my earnest hope—indeed the hope of all mankind—that from this solemn occasion a better world shall emerge out of the blood and carnage of the past, a world founded upon faith and understanding, a world dedicated to the dignity of man and the fulfillment of his most cherished wish for freedom, tolerance, and justice."

During the surrender ceremony, the deck of "Missouri" was decorated with a 31-star American flag that had been taken ashore by <a href="Commodore%20%28United%20States%29">Commodore</a> <a href="Matthew%20C.%20Perry">Matthew Perry</a> in 1853 after his squadron of "Black Ships" sailed into Tokyo Bay to force the opening of Japan's ports to foreign trade. This flag was actually displayed with the reverse side showing, i.e., stars in the upper right corner: the historic flag was so fragile that the conservator at the Naval Academy Museum had sewn a protective linen backing to one side to help secure the fabric from deteriorating, leaving its "wrong side" visible. The flag was displayed in a wood-framed case secured to the bulkhead overlooking the surrender ceremony. Another U.S. flag was raised and flown during the occasion, a flag that some sources have indicated was in fact that flag which had flown over the U.S. Capitol on 7 December 1941. This is not true; it was a flag taken from the ship's stock, according to "Missouri"s commanding officer, Captain Stuart "Sunshine" Murray, and it was "...just a plain ordinary GI-issue flag".

By 09:30 the Japanese emissaries had departed. In the afternoon of 5 September, Admiral Halsey transferred his flag to the battleship , and early the next day "Missouri" departed Tokyo Bay. As part of the ongoing <a href="Operation%20Magic%20Carpet">Operation Magic Carpet</a> she received homeward bound passengers at <a href="Guam">Guam</a>, then sailed unescorted for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 20 September and flew Admiral Nimitz's flag on the afternoon of 28 September for a reception.

The next day, "Missouri" departed Pearl Harbor bound for the eastern seaboard of the United States. She reached New York City on 23 October and hoisted the flag of <a href="United%20States%20Fleet%20Forces%20Command">Atlantic Fleet</a> commander Admiral <a href="Jonas%20Ingram">Jonas Ingram</a>. Four days later, "Missouri" boomed out a <a href="21-gun%20salute">21-gun salute</a> as President Truman boarded for <a href="Navy%20Day">Navy Day</a> ceremonies.

After an overhaul in the <a href="New%20York%20Naval%20Shipyard">New York Naval Shipyard</a> and a training cruise to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, "Missouri" returned to New York. During the afternoon of 21 March 1946, she received the remains of the <a href="Turkey">Turkish</a> Ambassador to the United States, <a href="M%C3%BCnir%20Erteg%C3%BCn">Münir Ertegün</a>. She departed on 22 March for <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a>, and on 5 April anchored in the <a href="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> off <a href="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>. She rendered full honors, including the firing of 19-gun salutes during the transfer of the remains of the late ambassador and again during the funeral ashore.

"Missouri" departed Istanbul on 9 April and entered <a href="Phaleron%20Bay">Phaleron Bay</a>, <a href="Piraeus%2C%20Greece">Piraeus, Greece</a>, the following day for an overwhelming welcome by Greek government officials and anti-communist citizens. Greece had become the scene of a <a href="Greek%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> between the communist World War II resistance movement and the returning Greek government-in-exile. The United States saw this as an important test case for its new doctrine of <a href="containment">containment</a> of the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. The Soviets were also pushing for concessions in the <a href="Dodecanese">Dodecanese</a> to be included in the <a href="Treaty%20of%20Peace%20with%20Italy%2C%201947">peace treaty with Italy</a> and for access through the <a href="Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a> strait between the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> and the Mediterranean. The voyage of "Missouri" to the eastern Mediterranean symbolized America's strategic commitment to the region. News media proclaimed her a symbol of U.S. interest in preserving both nations' independence.

"Missouri" departed Piraeus on 26 April, touching at <a href="Algiers">Algiers</a> and <a href="Tangiers">Tangiers</a> before arriving at <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk</a> on 9 May. She departed for <a href="Culebra%20Island">Culebra Island</a> on 12 May to join Admiral Mitscher's <a href="United%20States%20Eighth%20Fleet">8th Fleet</a> in the Navy's first large-scale postwar Atlantic training maneuvers. The battleship returned to New York City on 27 May, and spent the next year steaming Atlantic coastal waters north to the <a href="Davis%20Strait">Davis Strait</a> and south to the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> on various Atlantic command training exercises. On 13 December, during a target practice exercise in the North Atlantic, a <a href="star%20shell">star shell</a> accidentally struck the battleship, but without causing injuries.

"Missouri" arrived at <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> on 30 August 1947 for the <a href="Inter-American%20Conference%20for%20the%20Maintenance%20of%20Hemisphere%20Peace%20and%20Security">Inter-American Conference for the Maintenance of Hemisphere Peace and Security</a>. President Truman boarded on 2 September to celebrate the signing of the <a href="Rio%20Treaty">Rio Treaty</a>, which broadened the <a href="Monroe%20Doctrine">Monroe Doctrine</a> by stipulating that an attack on any one of the signatory American countries would be considered an attack on all.

The Truman family boarded "Missouri" on 7 September 1947 to return to the United States and disembarked at Norfolk on 19 September. Her overhaul in New York—which lasted from 23 September to 10 March 1948—was followed by refresher training at <a href="Guantanamo%20Bay%20Naval%20Base">Guantanamo Bay</a>. The summer of 1948 was devoted to midshipman and reserve training cruises. Also in 1948, "Missouri" became the first battleship to host a <a href="helicopter">helicopter</a> detachment, operating two Sikorsky <a href="Sikorsky%20H-5">HO3S-1</a> machines for utility and rescue work. The battleship departed Norfolk on 1 November 1948 for a second three-week <a href="Arctic">Arctic</a> cold-weather training cruise to the <a href="Davis%20Strait">Davis Strait</a>. During the next two years, "Missouri" participated in Atlantic command exercises from the <a href="New%20England">New England</a> coast to the Caribbean, alternated with two midshipman summer training cruises. She was overhauled at Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 23 September 1949 to 17 January 1950.

Throughout the latter half of the 1940s, the various service branches of the United States had been reducing their inventories from their World War II levels. For the Navy, this resulted in several vessels of various types being decommissioned and either sold for scrap or placed in one of the various <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20reserve%20fleets">United States Navy reserve fleets</a> scattered along the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">East</a> and <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">West Coast of the United States</a>. As part of this contraction, three of the "Iowa"-class battleships had been de-activated and decommissioned; however, President Truman refused to allow "Missouri" to be decommissioned. Against the advice of <a href="Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Louis%20A.%20Johnson">Louis Johnson</a>, <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="John%20L.%20Sullivan%20%28Navy%29">John L. Sullivan</a>, and <a href="Chief%20of%20Naval%20Operations">Chief of Naval Operations</a> <a href="Louis%20E.%20Denfeld">Louis E. Denfeld</a>, Truman ordered "Missouri" to be maintained with the active fleet partly because of his fondness for the battleship and partly because the battleship had been christened by his daughter <a href="Margaret%20Truman">Margaret Truman</a>.

Then the only U.S. battleship in commission, "Missouri" was proceeding seaward on a training mission from <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> early on 17 January 1950 when she <a href="USS%20Missouri%20grounding%20incident">ran aground</a> from <a href="Thimble%20Shoal%20Light">Thimble Shoal Light</a>, near <a href="Old%20Point%20Comfort">Old Point Comfort</a>. She hit shoal water a distance of three ship-lengths from the main channel. Lifted some above waterline, she stuck hard and fast. With the aid of <a href="tugboats">tugboats</a>, <a href="Pontoon%20%28boat%29">pontoons</a>, and a rising tide, she was refloated on 1 February 1950 and repaired.

In 1950, the <a href="Korean%20War">Korean War</a> broke out, prompting the United States to intervene in the name of the <a href="United%20Nations">United Nations</a>. President Truman was caught off guard when the invasion struck, but quickly ordered U.S. forces stationed in Japan into South Korea. Truman also sent U.S.-based troops, tanks, <a href="Fighter%20aircraft">fighter</a> and <a href="bomber">bomber</a> aircraft, and a strong naval force to Korea to support the Republic of Korea. As part of the naval mobilization "Missouri" was called up from the Atlantic Fleet and dispatched from Norfolk on 19 August to support UN forces on the Korean peninsula.

"Missouri" arrived just west of <a href="Ky%C5%ABsh%C5%AB">Kyūshū</a> on 14 September, where she became the <a href="flagship">flagship</a> of <a href="Rear%20Admiral">Rear Admiral</a> <a href="Allan%20Edward%20Smith">Allan Edward Smith</a>. The first American battleship to reach Korean waters, she bombarded <a href="Samchok">Samchok</a> on 15 September 1950 in an attempt to divert troops and attention from the <a href="Battle%20of%20Incheon">Incheon landings</a>. This was the first time since World War II that "Missouri" had fired her guns in anger, and in company with the cruiser and two <a href="destroyer">destroyer</a>s, she helped prepare the way for the <a href="U.S.%20Eighth%20Army">U.S. Eighth Army</a> offensive.

"Missouri" arrived at <a href="Incheon">Incheon</a> on 19 September, and on 10 October became flagship of Rear Admiral J. M. Higgins, commander, Cruiser Division 5 (CruDiv 5). She arrived at <a href="U.S.%20Fleet%20Activities%20Sasebo">Sasebo</a> on 14 October, where she became flagship of Vice Admiral A. D. Struble, Commander, <a href="United%20States%20Seventh%20Fleet">7th Fleet</a>. After screening the aircraft carrier along the east coast of <a href="Korea">Korea</a>, she conducted bombardment missions from 12 to 26 October in the <a href="Chongjin">Chongjin</a> and <a href="Tanchon">Tanchon</a> areas, and at <a href="Wonsan">Wonsan</a> where she again screened carriers eastward of Wonsan.

MacArthur's <a href="Battle%20of%20Incheon">amphibious landings at Incheon</a> had severed the North Korean Army's supply lines; as a result, North Korea's army had begun a lengthy retreat from South Korea into North Korea. This retreat was closely monitored by the <a href="People%27s%20Republic%20of%20China">People's Republic of China</a> (PRC), out of fear that the UN offensive against Korea would create a US-backed enemy on China's border, and out of concern that the UN offensive in Korea could evolve into a UN war against China. The latter of these two threats had already manifested itself during the Korea War: U.S. <a href="F-86%20Sabre">F-86 Sabre</a>s on patrol in "<a href="MiG%20Alley">MiG Alley</a>" frequently crossed into China while pursuing Communist MiGs operating out of Chinese airbases.

Moreover, there was talk among the U.N. commanders—notably General <a href="Douglas%20MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>—about a potential campaign against the People's Republic of China. In an effort to dissuade UN forces from completely overrunning North Korea, the People's Republic of China issued diplomatic warnings that they would use force to protect North Korea, but these warnings were not taken seriously for a number of reasons, among them the fact that China lacked air cover to conduct such an attack. This changed abruptly on 19 October 1950, when the first of an eventual total of soldiers under the command of General <a href="Peng%20Dehuai">Peng Dehuai</a> crossed into North Korea, launching a full-scale <a href="Battle%20of%20Chosin%20Reservoir">assault against advancing U.N. troops</a>. The PRC offensive caught the UN completely by surprise; UN forces realized they would have to fall back, and quickly executed an emergency retreat. UN assets were shuffled in order to cover this retreat, and as part of the force tasked with covering the UN retreat "Missouri" was moved into <a href="Hungnam">Hungnam</a> on 23 December to provide gunfire support about the Hungnam defense perimeter until the last UN troops, the <a href="3rd%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20States%29">U.S. 3rd Infantry Division</a>, were evacuated by way of the sea on 24 December 1950.

"Missouri" conducted additional operations with carriers and shore bombardments off the east coast of Korea until 19 March 1951. She arrived at <a href="U.S.%20Fleet%20Activities%20Yokosuka">Yokosuka</a> on 24 March, and 4 days later was relieved of duty in the Far East. She departed Yokosuka on 28 March, and upon arrival at Norfolk on 27 April became the flagship of Rear Admiral <a href="James%20L.%20Holloway%2C%20Jr.">James L. Holloway, Jr.</a>, commander, Cruiser Force, Atlantic Fleet. During the summer of 1951, she engaged in two <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> training cruises to northern Europe. Under the command of Captain <a href="John%20Sylvester">John Sylvester</a>, "Missouri" entered <a href="Norfolk%20Naval%20Shipyard">Norfolk Naval Shipyard</a> 18 October 1951 for an overhaul, which lasted until 30 January 1952.

Following winter and spring training out of Guantanamo Bay, "Missouri" visited New York, then set course from Norfolk on 9 June 1952 for another midshipman cruise. She returned to Norfolk on 4 August and entered Norfolk Naval Shipyard to prepare for a second tour in the Korean combat zone.

"Missouri" stood out of <a href="Hampton%20Roads">Hampton Roads</a> on 11 September 1952 and arrived at Yokosuka on 17 October. Vice Admiral <a href="Joseph%20J.%20Clark">Joseph J. Clark</a>, commander of the 7th Fleet, brought his staff onboard on 19 October. Her primary mission was to provide seagoing <a href="artillery">artillery</a> support by bombarding enemy targets in the Chaho-Tanchon area, at <a href="Chongjin">Chongjin</a>, in the Tanchon-Sonjin area, and at Chaho, <a href="Wonsan">Wonsan</a>, <a href="Hamhung">Hamhung</a>, and Hungnam during the period 25 October through 2 January 1953.

"Missouri" put into Incheon on 5 January 1953 and sailed thence to Sasebo, Japan. General <a href="Mark%20W.%20Clark">Mark W. Clark</a>, Commander in Chief, U.N. Command, and Admiral Sir <a href="Guy%20Russell">Guy Russell</a>, <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> <a href="Commander-in-Chief%2C%20Far%20East%20Fleet">Commander-in-Chief, Far East Fleet</a>, visited the battleship on 23 January. In the following weeks, "Missouri" resumed "Cobra" patrol along the east coast of Korea to support troops ashore. Repeated bombardment of Wonsan, Tanehon, Hungnam, and Kojo destroyed main supply routes along the eastern seaboard of Korea.

The last bombardment mission by "Missouri" was against the Kojo area on 25 March. On 26 March, her commanding officer—Captain Warner R. Edsall—suffered a fatal heart attack while conning her through the submarine net at Sasebo. She was relieved as the 7th Fleet <a href="flagship">flagship</a> on 6 April by her older sister .

"Missouri" departed Yokosuka on 7 April and arrived at Norfolk on 4 May to become flagship for Rear Admiral E. T. Woolridge, commander, Battleships-Cruisers, Atlantic Fleet, on 14 May. She departed on 8 June on a midshipman training cruise, returned to Norfolk on 4 August, and was overhauled in Norfolk Naval Shipyard from 20 November 1953 to 2 April 1954. As the flagship of Rear Admiral R. E. Kirby, who had relieved Admiral Woolridge, "Missouri" departed Norfolk on 7 June as flagship of the midshipman training cruise to <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a> and <a href="Cherbourg-Octeville">Cherbourg</a>. During this voyage "Missouri" was joined by the other three battleships of her class, "New Jersey", "Wisconsin", and "Iowa", the only time the four ships sailed together. She returned to Norfolk on 3 August and departed on 23 August for inactivation on the West Coast. After calls at <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach</a> and San Francisco, "Missouri" arrived in <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> on 15 September. Three days later she entered <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Naval%20Shipyard">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</a> where she was decommissioned on 26 February 1955, entering the <a href="Bremerton">Bremerton</a> group, <a href="Pacific%20Reserve%20Fleet">Pacific Reserve Fleet</a>.

Upon arrival in Bremerton, west of <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, "Missouri" was moored at the last pier of the reserve fleet berthing. She served as a popular tourist attraction, logging about 250,000 visitors per year, who came to view the "surrender deck" where a bronze plaque memorialized the spot () in <a href="Tokyo%20Bay">Tokyo Bay</a> where Japan surrendered to the Allies, and the accompanying historical display that included copies of the surrender documents A small cottage industry grew in the civilian community just outside the gates, selling souvenirs and other memorabilia. Nearly thirty years passed before "Missouri" returned to active duty.

Under the <a href="Ronald%20Reagan">Reagan Administration</a>’s program to build a <a href="600-ship%20Navy">600-ship Navy</a>, led by <a href="United%20States%20Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="John%20F.%20Lehman">John F. Lehman</a>, "Missouri" was reactivated and towed by the salvage ship to the Long Beach Naval Yard in the summer of 1984 to undergo modernization in advance of her scheduled recommissioning. In preparation for the move, a skeleton crew of 20 spent three weeks working 12- to 16-hour days preparing the battleship for her tow. During the modernization "Missouri" had her obsolete armament removed: 20 mm and 40 mm anti-aircraft guns, and four of her ten gun mounts.

Over the next several months, the ship was upgraded with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 <a href="Harpoon%20%28missile%29">RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles</a>, eight <a href="Armored%20Box%20Launcher">Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher</a> mounts for 32 <a href="Tomahawk%20%28missile%29">BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles</a>, and a quartet of <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx Close In Weapon System</a> <a href="Gatling%20gun">Gatling gun</a>s for defense against enemy <a href="anti-ship%20missile">anti-ship missile</a>s and enemy aircraft. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to <a href="radar">radar</a> and <a href="fire%20control%20system">fire control system</a>s for her guns and missiles, and improved <a href="electronic%20warfare">electronic warfare</a> capabilities. During the modernization "Missouri"s bell, which had been removed from the battleship and sent to <a href="Jefferson%20City%2C%20Missouri">Jefferson City, Missouri</a> for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. "Missouri" was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986. "This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power," <a href="Secretary%20of%20Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> <a href="Caspar%20Weinberger">Caspar Weinberger</a> told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to "listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you. They speak to you of honor and the importance of duty. They remind you of your own traditions." Also present at the recommissioning ceremony was Missouri governor <a href="John%20Ashcroft">John Ashcroft</a>, U.S. Senator <a href="Pete%20Wilson">Pete Wilson</a>, <a href="Secretary%20of%20the%20Navy">Secretary of the Navy</a> <a href="John%20Lehman">John Lehman</a>, San Francisco mayor <a href="Dianne%20Feinstein">Dianne Feinstein</a>, and <a href="Margaret%20Truman">Margaret Truman</a>, (who christened the ship in 1943) gave a short speech especially aimed at the ship's crew, which ended with "now take care of my baby." Her remarks were met with rounds of applause from the crew.

Four months later "Missouri" departed from her new home port of <a href="Naval%20Station%20Long%20Beach">Long Beach</a> for an around-the-world cruise, visiting Pearl Harbor Hawaii; Sydney, Hobart, and Perth, Australia; Diego Garcia; the Suez Canal; Istanbul, Turkey; Naples, Italy; Rota, Spain; Lisbon, Portugal; and the Panama Canal. "Missouri" became the first American battleship to <a href="circumnavigation">circumnavigate</a> the globe since <a href="Theodore%20Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a>'s "<a href="Great%20White%20Fleet">Great White Fleet</a>" 80 years before—a fleet which included the first battleship named .
In 1987, "Missouri" was outfitted with 40 mm <a href="grenade%20launcher">grenade launcher</a>s and 25 mm <a href="chain%20gun">chain gun</a>s and sent to take part in <a href="Operation%20Earnest%20Will">Operation "Earnest Will"</a>, the escorting of reflagged <a href="Kuwait">Kuwait</a>i <a href="oil%20tankers">oil tankers</a> in the <a href="Persian%20Gulf">Persian Gulf</a>. These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of <a href="Iran">Iran</a>ian-manned, <a href="Sweden">Swedish</a>-made <a href="Boghammar">Boghammar</a> <a href="cigarette%20boat">cigarette boat</a>s operating in the Persian Gulf at the time. On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a>. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment. As the centerpiece for Battlegroup Echo, "Missouri" escorted tanker convoys through the <a href="Strait%20of%20Hormuz">Strait of Hormuz</a>, keeping her <a href="fire%20control%20system">fire control system</a> trained on land-based Iranian <a href="Silkworm%20%28missile%29">Silkworm missile</a> launchers.

"Missouri" returned to the United States via <a href="Diego%20Garcia">Diego Garcia</a>, Australia, and Hawaii in early 1988. Several months later, "Missouri"s crew again headed for Hawaiian waters for the Rim of the Pacific (RimPac) exercises, which involved more than 50,000 troops and ships from the navies of Australia, Canada, Japan, and the United States. Port visits in 1988 included <a href="Vancouver">Vancouver</a> and <a href="Victoria%2C%20British%20Columbia">Victoria</a> in Canada, San Diego, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a>, and Bremerton.

In the early months of 1989, "Missouri" was in the <a href="Long%20Beach%20Naval%20Shipyard">Long Beach Naval Shipyard</a> for routine maintenance. On 1 July 1989, while berthed at Pier D, the music video for <a href="Cher">Cher</a>'s "<a href="If%20I%20Could%20Turn%20Back%20Time">If I Could Turn Back Time</a>" was filmed aboard Missouri and featured the ship's crew. A few months later she departed for <a href="PACEX%2089">Pacific Exercise (PacEx) '89</a>, where she and "New Jersey" performed a simultaneous gunfire demonstration for the aircraft carriers and . The highlight of PacEx was a port visit in <a href="Pusan">Pusan</a>, <a href="Republic%20of%20Korea">Republic of Korea</a>. In 1990, "Missouri" again took part in the RimPac Exercise with ships from Australia, Canada, Japan, Korea, and the U.S.

On 2 August 1990 <a href="Iraq">Iraq</a>, led by President <a href="Saddam%20Hussein">Saddam Hussein</a>, <a href="Invasion%20of%20Kuwait">invaded Kuwait</a>. In the middle of the month U.S. President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, in keeping with the <a href="Carter%20Doctrine">Carter Doctrine</a>, sent the first of several hundred thousand troops, along with a strong force of naval support, to <a href="Saudi%20Arabia">Saudi Arabia</a> and the Persian Gulf area to support a multinational force in a standoff with Iraq.

"Missouri"s scheduled four-month Western Pacific port-to-port cruise set to begin in September was canceled just a few days before the ship was to leave. She had been placed on hold in anticipation of being mobilized as forces continued to mass in the Middle East. "Missouri" departed on 13 November 1990 for the troubled waters of the Persian Gulf. She departed from Pier 6 at Long Beach, with extensive press coverage, and headed for Hawaii and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> for more work-ups en route to the Persian Gulf. Along the way she made stops at <a href="U.S.%20Naval%20Base%20Subic%20Bay">Subic Bay</a> and Pattaya Beach, <a href="Thailand">Thailand</a>, before transiting the Strait of Hormuz on 3 January 1991. During subsequent operations leading up to <a href="Operation%20Desert%20Storm">Operation Desert Storm</a>, "Missouri" prepared to launch Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles (TLAMs) and provide naval gunfire support as required.

"Missouri" fired her first Tomahawk missile at Iraqi targets at 01:40 am on 17 January 1991, followed by 27 additional missiles over the next five days.

On 29 January, the led "Missouri" northward, using advanced mine-avoidance sonar. In her first <a href="naval%20gunfire">naval gunfire</a> support action of Desert Storm she shelled an Iraqi command and control bunker near the Saudi border, the first time her guns had been fired in combat since March 1953 off Korea. The battleship bombarded Iraqi beach defenses in occupied Kuwait on the night of 3 February, firing 112 rounds over the next three days until relieved by "Wisconsin". "Missouri" then fired another 60 rounds off <a href="Khafji">Khafji</a> on 11–12 February before steaming north to Faylaka Island. After <a href="Minesweeper%20%28ship%29">minesweepers</a> cleared a lane through Iraqi defenses, "Missouri" fired 133 rounds during four shore bombardment missions as part of the amphibious landing <a href="feint">feint</a> against the Kuwaiti shore line the morning of 23 February. The heavy pounding attracted Iraqi attention; in response to the battleship's artillery strike, the Iraqis fired two HY-2 <a href="Silkworm%20missile">Silkworm missile</a>s at the battleship, one of which missed. The other missile was intercepted by a GWS-30 <a href="Sea%20Dart%20missile">Sea Dart missile</a> launched from the British air defence destroyer within 90 seconds and crashed into the sea roughly in front of "Missouri".

During the campaign, "Missouri" was involved in a <a href="friendly%20fire">friendly fire</a> incident with the "Oliver Hazard Perry"-class frigate . According to the official report, on 25 February, "Jarrett"s <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx CIWS</a> engaged the <a href="Chaff%20%28radar%20countermeasure%29">chaff</a> fired by "Missouri" as a countermeasure against enemy missiles, and stray rounds from the firing struck "Missouri", one penetrating through a <a href="Bulkhead%20%28partition%29">bulkhead</a> and becoming embedded in an interior passageway of the ship. Another round struck the ship on the forward funnel, passing completely through it. One sailor aboard "Missouri" was struck in the neck by flying shrapnel and suffered minor injuries. Those familiar with the incident are skeptical of this account, however, as "Jarrett" was reportedly over away at the time and the characteristics of chaff are such that a Phalanx would not normally regard it as a threat and engage it. There is no dispute that the rounds that struck "Missouri" did come from "Jarrett", and that it was an accident. There was suspicion that a <a href="Phalanx%20CIWS">Phalanx</a> operator on "Jarrett" may have accidentally fired off a few rounds manually, although there is no supporting evidence.

During the operation, "Missouri" also assisted coalition forces engaged in clearing Iraqi <a href="naval%20mine">naval mine</a>s in the Persian Gulf. By the time the war ended, "Missouri" had destroyed at least 15 naval mines.

With combat operations out of range of the battleship's weapons on 26 February, "Missouri" had fired a total 783 rounds of shells and launched 28 <a href="Tomahawk%20cruise%20missiles">Tomahawk cruise missiles</a> during the campaign, and commenced to conduct patrol and armistice enforcement operations in the northern Persian Gulf until sailing for home on 21 March. Following stops at Fremantle and Hobart, Australia, the warship visited Pearl Harbor before arriving home in April. She spent the remainder of the year conducting type training and other local operations, the latter including 7 December "voyage of remembrance" to mark the 50th anniversary of the <a href="Attack%20on%20Pearl%20Harbor">Pearl Harbor attack</a> in 1941. During that ceremony, "Missouri" hosted President <a href="George%20H.%20W.%20Bush">George H. W. Bush</a>, the first such presidential visit for the warship since Harry S. Truman boarded the battleship in September 1947.

With the <a href="History%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union%20%281985-1991%29">collapse of the Soviet Union</a> in the early 1990s and the absence of a perceived threat to the United States came drastic cuts in the defense budget, and the high cost of maintaining and operating battleships as part of the United States Navy's active fleet became uneconomical; as a result, "Missouri" was decommissioned on 31 March 1992 at <a href="Long%20Beach%2C%20California">Long Beach, California</a> after 16 total years of active service. Her last commanding officer, Captain Albert L. Kaiss, wrote in the ship's final Plan of the Day:

"Missouri" returned to be part of the <a href="United%20States%20Navy%20reserve%20fleet">United States Navy reserve fleet</a> at <a href="Puget%20Sound%20Naval%20Shipyard">Puget Sound Naval Shipyard</a>, Bremerton, Washington, until 12 January 1995, when she was struck from the <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a>. She remained in Bremerton, but was not open to tourists as she had been from 1957 to 1984. In spite of attempts by citizens' groups to keep her in Bremerton and be re-opened as a tourist site, the U.S. Navy wanted to pair a symbol of the end of World War II with one representing its beginning. On 4 May 1998, Secretary of the Navy <a href="John%20H.%20Dalton">John H. Dalton</a> signed the donation contract that transferred her to the nonprofit USS "Missouri" Memorial Association (MMA) of <a href="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>, Hawaii. She was towed from Bremerton on 23 May to <a href="Astoria%2C%20Oregon">Astoria, Oregon</a>, where she sat in <a href="fresh%20water">fresh water</a> at the mouth of the <a href="Columbia%20River">Columbia River</a> to kill and drop the saltwater <a href="barnacle">barnacle</a>s and <a href="sea%20grass">sea grass</a>es that had grown on her <a href="Hull%20%28watercraft%29">hull</a> in Bremerton, then towed across the eastern Pacific, and docked at <a href="Ford%20Island%2C%20Pearl%20Harbor">Ford Island, Pearl Harbor</a> on 22 June, just from the <a href="USS%20Arizona%20Memorial">"Arizona" Memorial</a>. Less than a year later, on 29 January 1999, "Missouri" was opened as a museum operated by the MMA.

Originally, the decision to move "Missouri" to Pearl Harbor was met with some resistance. The <a href="National%20Park%20Service">National Park Service</a> expressed concern that the battleship, whose name has become synonymous with the end of World War II, would overshadow the battleship , whose dramatic explosion and subsequent sinking on 7 December 1941 has since become synonymous with the attack on Pearl Harbor. To help guard against this impression "Missouri" was placed well back from and facing the "Arizona" Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on "Missouri"s aft decks would not have sight of the "Arizona" Memorial. The decision to have "Missouri"s bow face the "Arizona" Memorial was intended to convey that "Missouri" watches over the remains of "Arizona" so that those interred within "Arizona"s hull may rest in peace.

A gun from "Missouri" is paired with a gun formerly on "Arizona" at the <a href="Wesley%20Bolin%20Memorial%20Plaza">Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza</a> just east of the <a href="Arizona">Arizona</a> <a href="Arizona%20State%20Capitol">state capitol</a> complex in downtown <a href="Phoenix%2C%20Arizona">Phoenix, Arizona</a>. It is part of a memorial representing the start and end of the Pacific War for the United States. 

"Missouri" was listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> on 14 May 1971 for hosting the signing of the instrument of Japanese surrender that ended World War II. She is not eligible for designation as a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a> because she was extensively modernized in the years following the surrender.

On 14 October 2009, "Missouri" was moved from her berthing station on Battleship Row to a <a href="drydock">drydock</a> at the <a href="Pearl%20Harbor%20Naval%20Shipyard">Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard</a> to undergo a three-month overhaul. The work, priced at $18 million, included installing a new anti-corrosion system, repainting the hull, and upgrading the internal mechanisms. Drydock workers reported that the ship was leaking at some points on the starboard side. The repairs were completed the first week of January 2010 and the ship was returned to her berthing station on Battleship Row on 7 January 2010. The ship's grand reopening occurred on 30 January.

"Missouri" was central to the plot of the film "<a href="Under%20Siege">Under Siege</a>", and the ship was prominently featured in another movie, <a href="Battleship%20%28film%29">"Battleship"</a>. As "Missouri" has not moved under her own power since 1992, shots of the ship at sea were obtained with the help of three tugboats. The music video for Cher's "<a href="If%20I%20Could%20Turn%20Back%20Time">If I Could Turn Back Time</a>" was also filmed aboard the "Missouri". The U.S. Navy, which had granted permission to shoot the video there, was unhappy with the sexual nature of the performance.

"Missouri" received three <a href="battle%20star">battle star</a>s for her service in World War II, five for her service during the Korean War, and three for her service during the Gulf War. "Missouri" also received numerous awards for her service in World War II, Korea, and the Persian Gulf.

Menstrual cycle

The menstrual cycle is the regular natural change that occurs in the <a href="female%20reproductive%20system">female reproductive system</a> (specifically the <a href="uterus">uterus</a> and <a href="ovary">ovaries</a>) that makes <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> possible. The cycle is required for the production of oocytes, and for the preparation of the uterus for <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a>. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms during the one to two weeks prior to <a href="menstruation">menstruation</a>. Common symptoms include <a href="acne%20vulgaris">acne</a>, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability and mood changes. These symptoms interfere with normal life and therefore qualify as <a href="premenstrual%20syndrome">premenstrual syndrome</a> in 20 to 30% of women. In 3 to 8%, they are severe.
The first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age, a point in time known as <a href="menarche">menarche</a>. They may occasionally start as early as eight, and this onset may still be normal. The average age of the first period is generally later in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a> and earlier in <a href="developed%20world">developed world</a>. The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women and 21 to 35 days in adults (an average of 28 days). Menstruation stops occurring after <a href="menopause">menopause</a> which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days.
The menstrual cycle is governed by hormonal changes. These changes can be altered by using <a href="hormonal%20birth%20control">hormonal birth control</a> to prevent pregnancy. Each cycle can be divided into three phases based on events in the ovary (ovarian cycle) or in the uterus (uterine cycle). The ovarian cycle consists of the <a href="follicular%20phase">follicular phase</a>, <a href="ovulation">ovulation</a>, and <a href="luteal%20phase">luteal phase</a> whereas the uterine cycle is divided into <a href="menstruation">menstruation</a>, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.

Stimulated by gradually increasing amounts of <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a> in the follicular phase, discharges of blood (menses) flow stop, and the <a href="Endometrium">lining</a> of the uterus thickens. <a href="Ovarian%20follicle">Follicles</a> in the ovary begin developing under the influence of a complex interplay of hormones, and after several days one or occasionally two become dominant (non-dominant follicles shrink and die). Approximately mid-cycle, 24–36 hours after the <a href="luteinizing%20hormone">luteinizing hormone</a> (LH) surges, the dominant follicle releases an <a href="ovocyte">ovocyte</a>, in an event called ovulation. After ovulation, the ovocyte only lives for 24 hours or less without fertilization while the remains of the dominant follicle in the ovary become a <a href="corpus%20luteum">corpus luteum</a>; this body has a primary function of producing large amounts of <a href="progesterone">progesterone</a>. Under the influence of progesterone, the <a href="endometrium">uterine lining</a> changes to prepare for potential <a href="Implantation%20%28human%20embryo%29">implantation</a> of an embryo to establish a pregnancy. If implantation does not occur within approximately two weeks, the corpus luteum will involute, causing a sharp drop in levels of both progesterone and estrogen. The hormone drop causes the uterus to shed its lining in a process termed menstruation. Menstruation also occurs in closely related <a href="primate">primate</a>s (<a href="ape">ape</a>s and <a href="monkeys">monkeys</a>).

The average age of menarche is 12–15. They may occasionally start as early as eight, and this onset may still be normal. This first period often occurs later in the <a href="developing%20world">developing world</a> than the <a href="developed%20world">developed world</a>.

The average age of menarche is approximately 12.5 years in the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, 12.7 in <a href="Canada">Canada</a>, 12.9 in the <a href="UK">UK</a> and 13.1 years in <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>. Factors such as genetics, diet and overall health can affect timing.

The cessation of menstrual cycles at the end of a woman's reproductive period is termed <a href="menopause">menopause</a>. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered "premature" in industrialised countries. Like the age of menarche, the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.

The length of a woman's menstrual cycle typically varies somewhat, with some shorter cycles and some longer cycles. A woman who experiences variations of less than eight days between her longest cycles and shortest cycles is considered to have regular menstrual cycles. It is unusual for a woman to experience cycle length variations of more than four days. Length variation between eight and 20 days is considered as moderately <a href="irregular%20cycles">irregular cycles</a>. Variation of 21 days or more between a woman's shortest and longest cycle lengths is considered very irregular. 

The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days. The variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 25 to 39. Subsequently, the variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44.

The luteal phase of the menstrual cycle is about the same length in most individuals (mean 14.13 days, <a href="standard%20deviation">standard deviation</a> 1.41 days) whereas the follicular phase tends to show much more variability (log-normally distributed with 95% of individuals having follicular phases between 10.3 and 16.3 days). The follicular phase also seems to get significantly shorter with age (geometric mean 14.2 days in women aged 18–24 vs. 10.4 days in women aged 40–44).

Some women with <a href="Neurology">neurological conditions</a> experience increased activity of their conditions at about the same time during each menstrual cycle. For example, drops in estrogen levels have been known to trigger <a href="migraines">migraines</a>, especially when the woman who suffers migraines is also taking the birth control pill. Many women with <a href="epilepsy">epilepsy</a> have more seizures in a pattern linked to the menstrual cycle; this is called "<a href="catamenial%20epilepsy">catamenial epilepsy</a>". Different patterns seem to exist (such as seizures coinciding with the time of menstruation, or coinciding with the time of ovulation), and the frequency with which they occur has not been firmly established. Using one particular definition, one group of scientists found that around one-third of women with intractable partial epilepsy has catamenial epilepsy. An effect of hormones has been proposed, in which progesterone declines and estrogen increases would trigger seizures. Recently, studies have shown that high doses of estrogen can cause or worsen seizures, whereas high doses of progesterone can act like an antiepileptic drug. Studies by medical journals have found that women experiencing menses are 1.68 times more likely to <a href="suicide%20attempt">attempt suicide</a>.

Mice have been used as an experimental system to investigate possible mechanisms by which levels of <a href="sex%20steroid">sex steroid</a> hormones might regulate <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> function. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when progesterone is highest, the level of <a href="Neuron">nerve-cell</a> <a href="GABA%20A%20receptor">GABA receptor</a> subtype delta was high. Since these GABA receptors are <a href="Inhibitory%20postsynaptic%20potential">inhibitory</a>, nerve cells with more delta receptors are less likely to fire than cells with lower numbers of delta receptors. During the part of the mouse estrous cycle when estrogen levels are higher than progesterone levels, the number of delta receptors decrease, increasing nerve cell activity, in turn increasing anxiety and seizure susceptibility.

Estrogen levels may affect <a href="thyroid">thyroid</a> behavior. For example, during the luteal phase (when estrogen levels are lower), the velocity of blood flow in the thyroid is lower than during the follicular phase (when estrogen levels are higher).

Among women living closely together, it was once thought that the onsets of menstruation tend to <a href="Menstrual%20synchrony">synchronize</a>. This effect was first described in 1971, and possibly explained by the action of <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s in 1998. Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.

Research indicates that women have a significantly higher likelihood of <a href="anterior%20cruciate%20ligament">anterior cruciate ligament</a> injuries in the pre-ovulatory stage, than post-ovulatory stage.

The most fertile period (the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from <a href="sexual%20intercourse">sexual intercourse</a>) covers the time from some 5 days before until 1 to 2 days after ovulation. In a 28‑day cycle with a 14‑day luteal phase, this corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week. A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called <a href="fertility%20awareness">fertility awareness</a>.

There are many <a href="fertility%20testing">fertility testing</a> methods, including <a href="Urinalysis">urine test</a> kits that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary test results, or changes in saliva are called <a href="fertility%20monitors">fertility monitors</a>. Fertility awareness methods that rely on cycle length records alone are called <a href="calendar-based%20methods">calendar-based methods</a>. Methods that require observation of one or more of the three primary fertility signs (<a href="basal%20body%20temperature">basal body temperature</a>, <a href="cervical%20mucus">cervical mucus</a>, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods.

A <a href="Female%20fertility">woman's fertility</a> is also affected by her age. As a woman's total egg supply is formed in fetal life, to be ovulated decades later, it has been suggested that this long lifetime may make the <a href="chromatin">chromatin</a> of eggs more vulnerable to division problems, breakage, and mutation than the chromatin of sperm, which are produced continuously during a man's reproductive life. However, despite this hypothesis, a similar <a href="paternal%20age%20effect">paternal age effect</a> has also been observed.

As measured on women undergoing <a href="in%20vitro%20fertilization">in vitro fertilization</a>, a longer menstrual cycle length is associated with higher pregnancy and delivery rates, even after age adjustment. <a href="Delivery%20rate">Delivery rate</a>s after IVF have been estimated to be almost doubled for women with a menstrual cycle length of more than 34 days compared with women with a menstrual cycle length shorter than 26 days. A longer menstrual cycle length is also significantly associated with better ovarian response to <a href="gonadotropin">gonadotropin</a> stimulation and <a href="embryo%20quality">embryo quality</a>.

The different phases of the menstrual cycle correlate with women's <a href="Mood%20%28psychology%29">moods</a>. In some cases, hormones released during the menstrual cycle can cause behavioral changes in females; mild to severe mood changes can occur. The menstrual cycle phase and ovarian <a href="hormones">hormones</a> may contribute to increased <a href="empathy">empathy</a> in women. The natural shift of hormone levels during the different phases of the menstrual cycle has been studied in conjunction with test scores. When completing empathy exercises, women in the <a href="Follicular%20phase">follicular stage</a> of their menstrual cycle performed better than women in their <a href="Luteal%20phase">midluteal phase</a>. A significant correlation between <a href="progesterone">progesterone</a> levels and the ability to accurately recognize emotion was found. Performances on <a href="emotion%20recognition">emotion recognition</a> tasks were better when women had lower progesterone levels. Women in the follicular stage showed higher emotion recognition accuracy than their midluteal phase counterparts. Women were found to react more to negative stimuli when in midluteal stage over the women in the follicular stage, perhaps indicating more reactivity to social stress during that menstrual cycle phase. Overall, it has been found that women in the follicular phase demonstrated better performance in tasks that contain empathetic traits.

<a href="Fear%20processing%20in%20the%20brain">Fear response</a> in women during two different points in the menstrual cycle has been examined. When <a href="oestrogen">estrogen</a> is highest in the <a href="Preovulatory">preovulatory stage</a>, women are significantly better at identifying expressions of fear than women who were menstruating, which is when estrogen levels are lowest. The women were equally able to identify happy faces, demonstrating that the fear response was a more powerful response. To summarize, menstrual cycle phase and the estrogen levels correlates with women’s fear processing.

However, the examination of daily moods in women with measuring ovarian hormones may indicate a less powerful connection. In comparison to levels of <a href="stress%20%28biology%29">stress</a> or physical health, the ovarian hormones had less of an impact on overall mood. This indicates that while changes of ovarian hormones may influence mood, on a day-to-day level it does not influence mood more than other stressors do.

Sexual feelings and behaviors change during the menstrual cycle. Before and during ovulation, high levels of estrogen and <a href="androgen">androgen</a>s result in women having a relatively increased interest in sexual activity. Unlike other mammals, women may show interest in sexual activity across all days of the menstrual cycle, regardless of fertility.

Behavior towards potential mating partners changes during different phases of the menstrual cycle. Near ovulation, women may have increased physical attraction and interest in attending social gatherings with men. During the fertile phase of the cycle, women appear to prefer males who are more <a href="masculine">masculine</a>. The intensity of <a href="Mate%20guarding%20in%20humans">mate guarding</a> differs across the phases of the cycle, with increased mate guarding occurring when women are fertile.

During the fertile phase, many women experience more attraction, fantasies and sexual interest for <a href="Extra-pair%20copulation">extra pair men</a> but not for the primary partner. They also engage in extra-pair flirtations and demonstrate a preference for <a href="Extra-pair%20copulation">extra pair copulation</a>.

Preferences for voice pitch change across the cycle. When seeking a short term mating partner, women may prefer a male with a low voice pitch, particularly during the fertile phase. During the late follicular phase, it is common for women demonstrate a preference for mates with a masculine, deep voice. Research has also been conducted on the attractiveness of the female voice throughout the cycle. During their most fertile phase of the menstrual cycle, there is some evidence that female voices are rated as significantly more attractive. This effect is not found with women on the birth control pill.

Women's preference for male's body odor can change across the menstrual cycle. Males who score highly on dominance have been rated as sexier by females during the fertile phase of the menstrual cycle. Additionally, during their most fertile phase of the menstrual cycle, women may show preference for the odor of symmetrical men. This effect is not found for women on the birth control pill. Also, during the late follicular and ovulatory phases, women prefer the scent of masculine men. The scent of androsterone (responsible for testosterone levels) is highly preferred by women during the peak of their fertility in the menstrual cycle. Moreover, women may demonstrate preference for men with a scent that indicates developmental stability.

With regard to women's smell across the cycle, some evidence indicates that men use olfactory cues in order to know if a woman is ovulating. Using a rating of women's odors, women who are ovulating have been rated as more attractive by men. Men demonstrate preferences for the scent of fertile women.

Preferences for facial features in mates can also change across the cycle. There has been no difference found in preference for long-term mating partners during the menstrual cycle; however, those seeking a short-term relationship were more likely to choose a partner with more masculine features than usual. This was found to be the case especially during the woman's high conception risk stage and when salivary <a href="testosterone">testosterone</a> was high. However, when women are in the luteal (non-fertile) phase, they tend to prefer men (and females) with more feminine faces. A preference is also shown for self-resembling faces and apparent health in faces during the luteal phase of the cycle. Apparent health preferences were found to be strongest when progesterone levels were high. Additionally, during the fertile phase, many women show a preference for men with darker skin pigmentation. Research on facial symmetry is mixed.

Preferences for body features can change during the fertile phase of the cycle. Women seeking a short-term partner demonstrate a preference for taller and muscular males. Women also show preferences of males with masculine bodies at peak fertility. Mixed research has been found regarding body symmetry preferences throughout different phases of the cycle.

In short term mates, during the fertile phase, women may show more attraction to dominant men who display social presence. For long-term mates, shifts in desired trait preferences do not occur throughout the cycle.

Females have been found to experience different eating habits at different stages of their menstrual cycle, with food intake being higher during the <a href="luteal%20phase">luteal phase</a> than the <a href="follicular%20phase">follicular phase</a>. Food intake increases by approximately 10% during the luteal phase compared to the follicular phase.

Various studies have shown that during the luteal phase woman consume more <a href="carbohydrate">carbohydrate</a>s, <a href="protein">protein</a>s and <a href="fat">fat</a>s and that 24-hour <a href="Energy%20homeostasis">energy expenditure</a> shows increases between 2.5-11.5%. The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. This is due to the higher metabolic demand during this phase. In particular, women tend to show a cravings for chocolate, with higher cravings during the luteal phase.

Females with <a href="premenstrual%20syndrome">premenstrual syndrome</a> (PMS) report changes in appetite across the menstrual cycle more than non-sufferers of PMS, possibly due to their oversensitivity to changes in hormone levels. In women with PMS, food intake is higher in the <a href="luteal%20phase">luteal phase</a> than <a href="Follicular%20phase">follicular</a>. The remaining symptoms of PMS, including mood changes and physical symptoms, also occur during the luteal phase. No difference for preference of food types has been found between PMS sufferers and non-sufferers.

The different levels of <a href="ovarian%20hormones">ovarian hormones</a> at different stages of the cycle have been used to explain eating behaviour changes. Progesterone has been shown to promote fat storage, causing a higher intake of fatty foods during the luteal phase when progesterone levels are higher. Additionally, with a high <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a> level dopamine is ineffective in converting to <a href="Norepinephrine">noradrenaline</a>, a hormone which promotes eating, therefore decreasing appetite. In humans, the level of these ovarian hormones during the menstrual cycle have been found to influence <a href="binge%20eating">binge eating</a>.

It is theorized that the use of <a href="oral%20contraceptive%20pill">birth control pill</a>s should affect eating behaviour as they minimise or remove the fluctuations in hormone levels. The <a href="neurotransmitter">neurotransmitter</a> <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> is also thought to play a role in food intake. Serotonin is responsible for inhibiting eating and controlling meal size, among other things, and is modulated in part by ovarian hormones.

A number of factors affect whether dieting will affect these menstrual processes: age, weight loss and the diet itself. First, younger women are likely to experience <a href="Irregular%20menstruation">menstrual irregularities</a> due to their diet. Second, menstrual abnormalities are more likely with more weight loss. For example, <a href="anovulatory%20cycle">anovulatory cycle</a>s can occur as a result of adopting a restricted diet, as well as engaging in a high amount of exercise. Finally, the cycle is affected more by a vegetarian diet compared to a non-vegetarian diet.

Studies investigating effects of the menstrual cycle on alcohol consumption have found mixed evidence. However, some evidence suggests that individuals consume more alcohol during the luteal stage, especially if these individuals are heavy drinkers or have a family history of <a href="alcohol%20abuse">alcohol abuse</a>.

The level of substance abuse increases with PMS, mostly with addictive substances such as <a href="nicotine">nicotine</a>, <a href="tobacco">tobacco</a> and <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>. One theory behind this suggests this higher level of substance abuse is due to decreased self-control as a result of the higher metabolic demands during the luteal phase.

Infrequent or irregular ovulation is called "oligoovulation". The absence of ovulation is called "<a href="anovulation">anovulation</a>". Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an <a href="anovulatory%20cycle">anovulatory cycle</a>. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called "estrogen breakthrough bleeding". Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called <a href="withdrawal%20bleeding">withdrawal bleeding</a>. Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before <a href="menopause">menopause</a> (perimenopause) and in women with <a href="polycystic%20ovary%20syndrome">polycystic ovary syndrome</a>.

Very little flow (less than 10 ml) is called "<a href="hypomenorrhea">hypomenorrhea</a>". Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are "<a href="polymenorrhea">polymenorrhea</a>"; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as "<a href="metrorrhagia">metrorrhagia</a>". Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed "<a href="menorrhagia">menorrhagia</a>". Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is "<a href="menometrorrhagia">menometrorrhagia</a>". The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is "<a href="oligomenorrhea">oligomenorrhea</a>". <a href="Amenorrhea">Amenorrhea</a> refers to more than three to six months without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman's reproductive years.
The term for painful periods is "<a href="Dysmenorrhea">Dysmenorrhea</a>".

The menstrual cycle can be described by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes that occur in the <a href="Ovarian%20follicle">follicles</a> of the ovary whereas the uterine cycle describes changes in the <a href="Endometrium">endometrial lining</a> of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase, whereas the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.

The follicular phase is the first part of the ovarian cycle. During this phase, the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg. The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.

Through the influence of a rise in <a href="follicle%20stimulating%20hormone">follicle stimulating hormone</a> (FSH) during the first days of the cycle, a few <a href="ovarian%20follicle">ovarian follicle</a>s are stimulated. These follicles, which were present at birth and have been developing for the better part of a year in a process known as <a href="folliculogenesis">folliculogenesis</a>, compete with each other for dominance. Under the influence of several hormones, all but one of these follicles will stop growing, while one dominant follicle in the ovary will continue to maturity. The follicle that reaches maturity is called a tertiary or Graafian follicle, and it contains the ovum.

Ovulation is the second phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is released from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, <a href="estradiol">estradiol</a> suppresses release of <a href="luteinizing%20hormone">luteinizing hormone</a> (LH) from the <a href="anterior%20pituitary%20gland">anterior pituitary gland</a>. When the egg has nearly matured, levels of <a href="estradiol">estradiol</a> reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day 12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.

The exact mechanism of these opposite responses of LH levels to estradiol is not well understood. In animals, a <a href="gonadotropin-releasing%20hormone">gonadotropin-releasing hormone</a> (GnRH) surge has been shown to precede the LH surge, suggesting that estrogen's main effect is on the hypothalamus, which controls GnRH secretion. This may be enabled by the presence of two different estrogen receptors in the hypothalamus: <a href="estrogen%20receptor%20alpha">estrogen receptor alpha</a>, which is responsible for the negative feedback estradiol-LH loop, and <a href="estrogen%20receptor%20beta">estrogen receptor beta</a>, which is responsible for the positive estradiol-LH relationship. However, in humans it has been shown that high levels of estradiol can provoke 32 increases in LH, even when GnRH levels and pulse frequencies are held constant, suggesting that estrogen acts directly on the pituitary to provoke the LH surge.

The release of LH matures the egg and weakens the wall of the follicle in the ovary, causing the fully developed follicle to release its <a href="secondary%20oocyte">secondary oocyte</a>. If it is fertilized by a sperm, the secondary oocyte promptly matures into an <a href="ootid">ootid</a> and then becomes a mature <a href="ovum">ovum</a>. If it is not fertilized by a sperm, the secondary oocyte will degenerate. The mature ovum has a diameter of about 0.2 mm.

Which of the two ovaries—left or right—ovulates appears essentially random; no known left and right co-ordination exists. Occasionally, both ovaries will release an egg; if both eggs are fertilized, the result is <a href="fraternal%20twin">fraternal twin</a>s.

After being released from the ovary, the egg is swept into the <a href="fallopian%20tube">fallopian tube</a> by the <a href="Fimbria%20%28female%20reproductive%20system%29">fimbria</a>, which is a fringe of tissue at the end of each fallopian tube. After about a day, an unfertilized egg will disintegrate or dissolve in the fallopian tube.

Fertilization by a <a href="spermatozoon">spermatozoon</a>, when it occurs, usually takes place in the <a href="Ampulla%20of%20uterine%20tube">ampulla</a>, the widest section of the fallopian tubes. A fertilized egg immediately begins the process of <a href="Human%20embryogenesis">embryogenesis</a>, or development. The developing embryo takes about three days to reach the uterus and another three days to implant into the endometrium. It has usually reached the <a href="blastocyst">blastocyst</a> stage at the time of implantation.

In some women, ovulation features a characteristic pain called "<a href="mittelschmerz">mittelschmerz</a>" (German term meaning "middle pain"). The sudden change in hormones at the time of ovulation sometimes also causes light mid-cycle blood flow.

The luteal phase is the final phase of the ovarian cycle and it corresponds to the secretory phase of the uterine cycle. During the luteal phase, the <a href="Pituitary%20gland">pituitary hormones</a> FSH and LH cause the remaining parts of the dominant follicle to transform into the corpus luteum, which produces progesterone. The increased progesterone in the adrenals starts to induce the production of estrogen. The hormones produced by the corpus luteum also suppress production of the FSH and LH that the corpus luteum needs to maintain itself. Consequently, the level of FSH and LH fall quickly over time, and the corpus luteum subsequently atrophies. Falling levels of progesterone trigger menstruation and the beginning of the next cycle. From the time of ovulation until progesterone withdrawal has caused menstruation to begin, the process typically takes about two weeks, with 14 days considered normal. For an individual woman, the follicular phase often varies in length from cycle to cycle; by contrast, the length of her luteal phase will be fairly consistent from cycle to cycle.

The loss of the corpus luteum is prevented by fertilization of the egg. The <a href="syncytiotrophoblast">syncytiotrophoblast</a>, which is the outer layer of the resulting embryo-containing structure (the <a href="blastocyst">blastocyst</a>) and later also becomes the outer layer of the placenta, produces <a href="human%20chorionic%20gonadotropin">human chorionic gonadotropin</a> (hCG), which is very similar to LH and which preserves the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum can then continue to secrete progesterone to maintain the new pregnancy. Most <a href="pregnancy%20test">pregnancy test</a>s look for the presence of hCG.

The uterine cycle has three phases: menses, proliferative, secretory.

Menstruation (also called menstrual bleeding, menses, catamenia or a period) is the first phase of the uterine cycle. The flow of menses normally serves as a sign that a woman has not become <a href="pregnancy">pregnant</a>. (However, this cannot be taken as certainty, as a number of factors can cause <a href="Vaginal%20bleeding%23Pregnant%20women">bleeding during pregnancy</a>; some factors are specific to <a href="First%20trimester%20bleeding">early pregnancy</a>, and some can cause <a href="Obstetrical%20hemorrhage">heavy flow</a>.)

"Eumenorrhea" denotes normal, regular menstruation that lasts for a few days (usually 3 to 5 days, but anywhere from 2 to 7 days is considered normal). The average <a href="Bleeding">blood loss</a> during menstruation is 35 milliliters with 10–80 ml considered normal. Women who experience <a href="Menorrhagia">Menorrhagia</a> are more susceptible to <a href="iron%20deficiency%20%28medicine%29">iron deficiency</a> than the average person. An <a href="enzyme">enzyme</a> called <a href="plasmin">plasmin</a> inhibits <a href="blood%20clotting">clotting</a> in the menstrual fluid.

Painful cramping in the abdomen, back, or upper thighs is common during the first few days of menstruation. Severe uterine pain during menstruation is known as <a href="dysmenorrhea">dysmenorrhea</a>, and it is most common among adolescents and younger women (affecting about 67.2% of adolescent females). When menstruation begins, symptoms of <a href="premenstrual%20syndrome">premenstrual syndrome</a> (PMS) such as <a href="mastalgia">breast tenderness</a> and irritability generally decrease. <a href="Menstruation%23Menstrual%20products">Sanitary products</a> include pads and tampons, and are essential items for use during menstruation.

The proliferative phase is the second phase of the uterine cycle when estrogen causes the lining of the uterus to grow, or proliferate, during this time. As they mature, the ovarian follicles secrete increasing amounts of <a href="estradiol">estradiol</a>, and <a href="estrogen">estrogen</a>. The estrogens initiate the formation of a new layer of <a href="endometrium">endometrium</a> in the uterus, histologically identified as the proliferative endometrium. The estrogen also stimulates <a href="Crypt%20%28anatomy%29">crypts</a> in the <a href="cervix">cervix</a> to produce cervical mucus, which causes vaginal discharge regardless of arousal, and can be tracked by women practicing <a href="fertility%20awareness">fertility awareness</a>.

The secretory phase is the final phase of the uterine cycle and it corresponds to the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle. During the secretory phase, the corpus luteum produces progesterone, which plays a vital role in making the <a href="endometrium">endometrium</a> receptive to <a href="implantation%20%28human%20embryo%29">implantation</a> of the <a href="blastocyst">blastocyst</a> and supportive of the early pregnancy, by increasing blood flow and uterine secretions and reducing the contractility of the <a href="smooth%20muscle">smooth muscle</a> in the uterus; it also has the side effect of raising the woman's <a href="basal%20body%20temperature">basal body temperature</a>.

While some forms of <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a> do not affect the menstrual cycle, hormonal contraceptives work by disrupting it. Progestogen <a href="negative%20feedback">negative feedback</a> decreases the pulse frequency of <a href="gonadotropin-releasing%20hormone">gonadotropin-releasing hormone</a> (GnRH) release by the <a href="hypothalamus">hypothalamus</a>, which decreases the release of <a href="follicle-stimulating%20hormone">follicle-stimulating hormone</a> (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the <a href="anterior%20pituitary">anterior pituitary</a>. Decreased levels of FSH inhibit follicular development, preventing an increase in <a href="estradiol">estradiol</a> levels. Progestogen negative feedback and the lack of estrogen <a href="positive%20feedback">positive feedback</a> on LH release prevent a mid-cycle LH surge. Inhibition of follicular development and the absence of a LH surge prevent ovulation.

The degree of ovulation suppression in progestogen-only contraceptives depends on the <a href="progestogen">progestogen</a> activity and dose. Low dose progestogen-only contraceptives—traditional <a href="progestogen%20only%20pill">progestogen only pill</a>s, <a href="subdermal%20implant">subdermal implant</a>s <a href="Norplant">Norplant</a> and Jadelle, and <a href="IntraUterine%20System">intrauterine system</a> Mirena—inhibit ovulation in about 50% of cycles and rely mainly on other effects, such as thickening of cervical mucus, for their contraceptive effectiveness. Intermediate dose progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant <a href="Nexplanon">Nexplanon</a>—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles. The same cervical mucus changes occur as with very low-dose progestogens. High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables <a href="Depo-Provera">Depo-Provera</a> and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.

Combined hormonal contraceptives include both an estrogen and a progestogen. Estrogen negative feedback on the anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular <a href="breakthrough%20bleeding">breakthrough bleeding</a>. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—<a href="combined%20oral%20contraceptive%20pill">the pill</a>, <a href="NuvaRing">NuvaRing</a>, and the <a href="contraceptive%20patch">contraceptive patch</a>—are usually used in a way that causes regular <a href="withdrawal%20bleeding">withdrawal bleeding</a>. In a normal cycle, <a href="menstruation">menstruation</a> occurs when estrogen and progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be <a href="extended%20cycle%20combined%20hormonal%20contraceptive">taken continuously</a>, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.

<a href="Breastfeeding">Breastfeeding</a> causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycle may resume. Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently. The production of <a href="prolactin">prolactin</a> in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea. On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.

The word "menstruation" is etymologically related to "moon". The terms "menstruation" and "menses" are derived from the <a href="Latin">Latin</a> "mensis" (month), which in turn relates to the <a href="Greek%20language">Greek</a> "mene" (moon) and to the roots of the English words "month" and "moon".

Even though the average length of the human menstrual cycle is similar to that of the <a href="lunar%20cycle">lunar cycle</a>, in modern humans there is no relation between the two. The relationship is believed to be a coincidence. Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans. A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle, nor did data analysed by period-tracking app Clue, submitted by 1.5m women, of 7.5m menstrual cycles.

<a href="Dogon%20people">Dogon villagers</a> did not have electric lighting and spent most nights outdoors, talking and sleeping, so they were apparently an ideal population for detecting a lunar influence; none was found.

In a number of countries, mainly in Asia, legislation or corporate practice has introduced formal <a href="menstrual%20leave">menstrual leave</a> to provide women with either paid or unpaid leave of absence from their employment while they are menstruating. Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea. The practice is controversial in western cultures due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers, as well as concerns that it is unfair to men.

Battle of Valcour Island

The naval Battle of Valcour Island, also known as the Battle of Valcour Bay, took place on October 11, 1776, on <a href="Lake%20Champlain">Lake Champlain</a>. The main action took place in <a href="Valcour%20Bay">Valcour Bay</a>, a narrow <a href="strait">strait</a> between the <a href="Province%20of%20New%20York">New York</a> mainland and <a href="Valcour%20Island">Valcour Island</a>. The battle is generally regarded as one of the first <a href="naval%20battle">naval battle</a>s of the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, and one of the first fought by the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. Most of the ships in the American fleet under the command of <a href="Benedict%20Arnold">Benedict Arnold</a> were captured or destroyed by a <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Great%20Britain">British</a> force under the overall direction of General <a href="Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester">Guy Carleton</a>. However, the American defense of Lake Champlain stalled British plans to reach the upper <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a> valley.

The <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> had retreated from <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Quebec</a> to <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a> and <a href="Fort%20Crown%20Point">Fort Crown Point</a> in June 1776 after British forces were massively reinforced. They spent the summer of 1776 fortifying those forts, and building additional ships to augment the small American fleet already on the lake. General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at <a href="Fort%20Saint-Jean%20%28Quebec%29">Fort Saint-Jean</a>, but needed to build a fleet to carry it on the lake. The Americans, during their retreat, had either taken or destroyed most of the ships on the lake. By early October, the British fleet, which significantly outgunned the American fleet, was ready for launch.

On October 11, Arnold drew the British fleet to a position he had carefully chosen to limit their advantages. In the battle that followed, many of the American ships were damaged or destroyed. That night, Arnold sneaked the American fleet past the British one, beginning a retreat toward Crown Point and Ticonderoga. Unfavorable weather hampered the American retreat, and more of the fleet was either captured or grounded and burned before it could reach Crown Point. Upon reaching Crown Point Arnold had the fort's buildings burned and retreated to Ticonderoga.

The British fleet included four officers who later became admirals in the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>: <a href="Thomas%20Pringle%20%28admiral%29">Thomas Pringle</a>, <a href="James%20Richard%20Dacres%20%281749%E2%80%931810%29">James Dacres</a>, <a href="Edward%20Pellew%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Exmouth">Edward Pellew</a> and <a href="John%20Schank">John Schank</a>. Valcour Bay, the site of the battle, is now a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>, as is , which sank shortly after the October 11 battle, and was raised in 1935. The underwater site of , located in 1997, is on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

The <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, which began in April 1775 with the <a href="Battles%20of%20Lexington%20and%20Concord">Battles of Lexington and Concord</a>, widened in September 1775 when the <a href="Continental%20Army">Continental Army</a> embarked on <a href="Invasion%20of%20Canada%20%281775%29">an invasion</a> of the British <a href="Province%20of%20Quebec%20%281763-1791%29">Province of Quebec</a>. The province was viewed by the <a href="Second%20Continental%20Congress">Second Continental Congress</a> as a potential avenue for British forces to attack and divide the rebellious colonies, and was at the time lightly defended. The invasion reached a peak on December 31, 1775, when the <a href="Battle%20of%20Quebec%20%281775%29">Battle of Quebec</a> ended in disaster for the Americans. In the spring of 1776, 10,000 British and German troops arrived in Quebec, and General <a href="Guy%20Carleton%2C%201st%20Baron%20Dorchester">Guy Carleton</a>, the provincial governor, drove the Continental Army out of Quebec and back to <a href="Fort%20Ticonderoga">Fort Ticonderoga</a>.

Carleton then launched his own offensive intended to reach the <a href="Hudson%20River">Hudson River</a>, whose navigable length begins south of Lake Champlain and extends down to <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Control of the upper Hudson would enable the British to link their forces in Quebec with those in New York, recently <a href="New%20York%20and%20New%20Jersey%20campaign">captured in the New York campaign</a> by Major General <a href="William%20Howe%2C%205th%20Viscount%20Howe">William Howe</a>. This strategy would separate the American colonies of <a href="New%20England">New England</a> from those farther south and potentially quash the rebellion. Lake Champlain, a long and relatively narrow lake formed by the action of glaciers during the <a href="Quaternary%20glaciation">last ice age</a>, separates the <a href="Green%20Mountains">Green Mountains</a> of <a href="Vermont">Vermont</a> from the <a href="Adirondack%20Mountains">Adirondack Mountains</a> of <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>. Its length and maximum width creates more than of shoreline, with many bays, inlets and promontories. More than 70 islands dot the surface, although during periods of low and high water, these numbers can change. The lake is relatively shallow, with an average depth of . Running roughly from south to north, the lake's waters empty into the <a href="Richelieu%20River">Richelieu River</a>, where waterfalls at <a href="Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu">Saint-Jean</a> in Quebec mark the northernmost point of navigation.
The American strongholds of <a href="Fort%20Crown%20Point">Fort Crown Point</a> and Fort Ticonderoga near the lake's southern end protected access to <a href="wikt%3Ahead%20of%20navigation">uppermost navigable reaches</a> of the Hudson River. Elimination of these defenses required the transportation of troops and supplies from the British-controlled <a href="St.%20Lawrence%20Valley">St. Lawrence Valley</a> to the north. Roads were either impassable or nonexistent, making water transport on the lake the only viable option. The only ships on the lake following the American retreat from Quebec were a small fleet of lightly armed ships that Benedict Arnold had assembled following the <a href="capture%20of%20Fort%20Ticonderoga">capture of Fort Ticonderoga</a> in May 1775. This fleet, even if it had been in British hands, was too small to transport the large <a href="British%20Army%20during%20the%20American%20War%20of%20Independence">British Army</a> to Fort Ticonderoga.

During their retreat from Quebec, the Americans carefully took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove useful to the British. When Arnold and his troops, making up the rear guard of the army, abandoned <a href="Fort%20Saint-Jean%20%28Quebec%29">Fort Saint-Jean</a>, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and set fire to the sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.

The two sides set about building fleets: the British at Saint-Jean and the Americans at the other end of the lake in Skenesborough (present-day <a href="Whitehall%20%28village%29%2C%20New%20York">Whitehall, New York</a>). While planning Quebec's defenses in 1775, General Carleton had anticipated the problem of transportation on Lake Champlain, and had requested the provisioning of prefabricated ships from Europe. By the time Carleton's army reached Saint-Jean, ten such ships had arrived. These ships and more were assembled by skilled shipwrights on the upper Richelieu River. Also assembled there was , a 180-ton warship they disassembled at Quebec City and transported upriver in pieces. In total, the British fleet (25 armed vessels) had more firepower than the Americans' 15 vessels, with more than 80 guns outweighing the 74 smaller American guns. Two of Carleton's ships, "Inflexible" (18 12-pounders) and (six 24-pound guns, six 12-pound guns, and two howitzers), by themselves outgunned the combined firepower of the American fleet. In addition to "Inflexible" and "Thunderer", the fleet included the <a href="schooner">schooner</a>s (14 guns), (12 guns), and (6 guns), and 20 single-masted gunboats each armed with two cannons.

The American generals leading their shipbuilding effort encountered a variety of challenges. <a href="Shipwright">Shipwright</a> was not a common occupation in the relative wilderness of upstate New York, and the <a href="Continental%20Navy">Continental Navy</a> had to pay extremely high wages to lure skilled craftsmen away from the coast. The carpenters hired to build boats on Lake Champlain were the best-paid employees of the navy, excepting only the Navy's Commodore, <a href="Esek%20Hopkins">Esek Hopkins</a>. By the end of July there were more than 200 shipwrights at Skenesborough. In addition to skilled help, materials and supplies specific to maritime use needed to be brought to Skenesborough, where the ships were constructed, or Fort Ticonderoga, where they were fitted out for use.

The shipbuilding at Skenesborough was overseen by Hermanus Schuyler (possibly a relation of Major General <a href="Philip%20Schuyler">Philip Schuyler</a>), and the outfitting was managed by military engineer <a href="Jeduthan%20Baldwin">Jeduthan Baldwin</a>. Schuyler began work in April to produce boats larger and more suitable for combat than the small shallow-draft boats known as <a href="bateaux">bateaux</a> that were used for transport on the lake. The process eventually came to involve General Arnold, who was an experienced ship's captain, and <a href="David%20Waterbury">David Waterbury</a>, a Connecticut militia leader with maritime experience. Major General <a href="Horatio%20Gates">Horatio Gates</a>, in charge of the entire shipbuilding effort, eventually asked Arnold to take more responsibility in the effort, because "I am intirely uninform'd as to Marine Affairs."

Arnold took up the task with relish, and Gates rewarded him with command of the fleet, writing that "[Arnold] has a perfect knowledge in maritime affairs, and is, besides, a most gallant and deserving officer." Arnold's appointment was not without trouble; <a href="Jacobus%20Wynkoop">Jacobus Wynkoop</a>, who had been in command of the fleet, refused to accept that Gates had authority over him, and had to be arrested. The shipbuilding was significantly slowed in mid-August by an outbreak of disease among the shipwrights. Although the army leadership had been scrupulous about keeping <a href="smallpox">smallpox</a> sufferers segregated from others, the disease that slowed the shipbuilding for several weeks was some kind of fever.

While both sides busied themselves with shipbuilding, the growing American fleet patrolled the waters of Lake Champlain. At one point in August, Arnold sailed part of the fleet to the northernmost end of the lake, within of Saint-Jean, and formed a battle line. A British outpost, well out of range, fired a few shots at the line without effect. On September 30, expecting the British to sail soon, Arnold retreated to the shelter of <a href="Valcour%20Island">Valcour Island</a>. During his patrols of the lake Arnold had commanded the fleet from the <a href="schooner">schooner</a> , carrying 12 guns and captained by <a href="Captain%20David%20Hawley">David Hawley</a>. When it came time for the battle, Arnold transferred his flag to , a <a href="row%20galley">row galley</a>. Other ships in the fleet included and , also two-masted schooners carrying 8 guns, as well as , a <a href="sloop">sloop</a> (12 guns), and 8 <a href="gundalow">gundalow</a>s outfitted as <a href="gunboats">gunboats</a> (each with three guns): , , , , , , , , the <a href="Cutter%20%28boat%29">cutter</a> "Lee", and the row galleys and . "Liberty" was not present at the battle, having been sent to Ticonderoga for provisions.

Arnold, whose business activities before the war had included sailing ships to Europe and the <a href="West%20Indies">West Indies</a>, carefully chose the site where he wanted to meet the British fleet. Reliable intelligence he received on October 1 indicated that the British had a force significantly more powerful than his. Because his force was inferior, he chose the narrow, rocky body of water between the western shore of Lake Champlain and Valcour Island (near modern <a href="Plattsburgh%2C%20New%20York">Plattsburgh, New York</a>), where the British fleet would have difficulty bringing its superior firepower to bear, and where the inferior seamanship of his relatively unskilled sailors would have a minimal negative effect. Some of Arnold's captains wanted to fight in open waters where they might be able to retreat to the shelter of Fort Crown Point, but Arnold argued that the primary purpose of the fleet was not survival but the delay of a British advance on Crown Point and Ticonderoga until the following spring.

Carleton's fleet, commanded by Captain <a href="Thomas%20Pringle%20%28Royal%20Navy%20officer%29">Thomas Pringle</a> and including 50 unarmed support vessels, sailed onto Lake Champlain on October 9. They cautiously advanced southward, searching for signs of Arnold's fleet. On the night of October 10, the fleet anchored about to the north of Arnold's position, still unaware of his location. The next day, they continued to sail south, assisted by favorable winds. After they passed the northern tip of Valcour Island, Arnold sent out "Congress" and "Royal Savage" to draw the attention of the British. Following an inconsequential exchange of fire with the British, the two ships tried to return to Arnold's crescent-shaped firing line. However, "Royal Savage" was unable to fight the headwinds, and ran aground on the southern tip of Valcour Island. Some of the British gunboats swarmed toward her, as Captain Hawley and his men hastily abandoned ship. Men from "Loyal Convert" boarded her, capturing 20 men in the process, but were then forced to abandon her under heavy fire from the Americans. Many of Arnold's papers were lost with the destruction of "Royal Savage", which was burned by the British.
The British gunboats and "Carleton" then maneuvered within range of the American line. "Thunderer" and "Maria" were unable to make headway against the winds, and did not participate in the battle, while "Inflexible" eventually came far enough up the strait to participate in the action. Around 12:30 pm, the battle began in earnest, with both sides firing broadsides and cannonades at each other, and continued all afternoon. "Revenge" was heavily hit; "Philadelphia" was also heavily damaged and eventually sank around 6:30 pm. "Carleton", whose guns wrought havoc against the smaller American <a href="gundalow">gundalow</a>s, became a focus of attention. A lucky shot eventually snapped the line holding her broadside in position, and she was seriously damaged before she could be towed out of range of the American line. Her casualties were significant; eight men were killed and another eight wounded. The young <a href="Edward%20Pellew%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Exmouth">Edward Pellew</a>, serving as a <a href="midshipman">midshipman</a> aboard "Carleton", distinguished himself by ably commanding the vessel to safety when its senior officers, including its captain, Lieutenant <a href="James%20Richard%20Dacres%20%281749%E2%80%931810%29">James Dacres</a>, were injured. Another lucky American shot hit a British gunboat's magazine and the vessel exploded.

Toward sunset, "Inflexible" finally reached the action. Her big guns quickly silenced most of Arnold's fleet. The British also began landing <a href="Aboriginal%20peoples%20in%20Canada">Indian</a>s on both Valcour Island and the lakeshore, in order to deny the Americans the possibility of retreating to land. As darkness fell, the American fleet retreated, and the British called off the attack, in part because some boats had run out of ammunition. Lieutenant James Hadden, commanding one of the British gunboats, noted that "little more than one third of the British Fleet" saw much action that day.

When the sun set on October 11, the battle had clearly gone against the Americans. Most of the American ships were damaged or sinking, and the crews reported around 60 casualties. The British reported around 40 casualties on their ships. Aware that he could not defeat the British fleet, Arnold decided to try reaching the cover of Fort Crown Point, about to the south. Under the cover of a dark and foggy night, the fleet, with muffled oars and minimal illumination, threaded its way through a gap about one mile (1.6 km) wide between the British ships and the western shore, where Indian campfires burned. By morning, they had reached <a href="Schuyler%20Island">Schuyler Island</a>, about south. Carleton, upset that the Americans had escaped him, immediately sent his fleet around Valcour Island to find them. Realizing the Americans were not there, he regrouped his fleet and sent scouts to find Arnold.

Adverse winds as well as damaged and leaky boats slowed the American fleet's progress. At Schuyler Island, "Providence" and "Jersey" were sunk or burned, and crude repairs were effected to other vessels. The cutter "Lee" was also abandoned on the western shore and eventually taken by the British. Around 2:00 pm, the fleet sailed again, trying to make headway against biting winds, rain, and sleet. By the following morning, the ships were still more than from Crown Point, and the British fleet's masts were visible on the horizon. When the wind finally changed, the British had its advantage first. They closed once again, opening fire on "Congress" and "Washington", which were in the rear of the American fleet. Arnold first decided to attempt grounding the slower gunboats at Split Rock, short of Crown Point. "Washington", however, was too badly damaged and too slow to make it, and she was forced to <a href="striking%20the%20colors">strike her colors</a> and surrender; 110 men were taken prisoner.
Arnold then led many of the remaining smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold's Bay 2 miles south of <a href="Buttonmold%20Bay">Buttonmold Bay</a>, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow. These boats were then run aground, stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship "Congress". The surviving ships' crews, numbering about 200, then made their way overland to Crown Point, narrowly escaping an Indian ambush. There they found "Trumbull", "New York", "Enterprise", and "Revenge", all of which had escaped the British fleet, as well as "Liberty", which had just arrived with supplies from Ticonderoga.

Arnold, convinced that Crown Point was no longer viable as a point of defense against the large British force, destroyed and abandoned the fort, moving the forces stationed there to Ticonderoga. General Carleton, rather than shipping his prisoners back to Quebec, returned them to Ticonderoga under a flag of truce. On their arrival, the released men were so effusive in their praise of Carleton that they were sent home to prevent the desertion of other troops.

With control of the lake, the British landed troops and occupied Crown Point the next day. They remained for two weeks, pushing scouting parties to within three miles (4.8 km) of Ticonderoga. The battle-season was getting late as the first snow began to fall on October 20 and his supply line would be difficult to manage in winter, so Carleton decided to withdraw north to winter quarters; Arnold's plan of delay had succeeded. <a href="Friedrich%20Adolf%20Riedesel">Baron Riedesel</a>, commanding the <a href="Hessian%20%28soldiers%29">Hessian</a>s in Carleton's army, noted that, "If we could have begun our expedition four weeks earlier, I am satisfied that everything could have ended this year."

The <a href="Saratoga%20campaign">1777 British campaign</a>, led by General <a href="John%20Burgoyne">John Burgoyne</a>, was halted by Continental forces, some led with vigor by General Arnold, in the <a href="Battles%20of%20Saratoga">Battles of Saratoga</a>. Burgoyne's subsequent surrender paved the way for the entry of <a href="France">France</a> into the war as <a href="Franco-American%20alliance">an American ally</a>.

The captains of "Maria", "Inflexible", and "Loyal Convert" wrote a letter criticizing Captain Pringle for making Arnold's escape possible by failing to properly blockade the channel, and for not being more aggressive in directing the battle. Apparently the letter did not cause any career problems for Pringle or its authors; he and <a href="John%20Schank">John Schank</a>, captain of "Inflexible", became admirals, as did midshipman Pellew and Lieutenant Dacres. Carleton was awarded the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Order of the Bath</a> by <a href="George%20III%20of%20Great%20Britain">King George III</a> for his success at Valcour Island. On December 31, 1776 one year after the Battle of Quebec, a <a href="mass%20%28liturgy%29">mass</a> was held in celebration of the British success, and Carleton threw a grand ball.

The loss of Benedict Arnold's papers aboard "Royal Savage" was to have important consequences later in his career. For a variety of reasons, Congress ordered an inquiry into his conduct of the Quebec campaign, which included a detailed look at his claims for compensation. The inquiry took place in late 1779, when Arnold was in military command of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and recuperating from serious wounds received at Saratoga. Congress found that he owed it money since he could not produce receipts for expenses he claimed to have paid from his own funds. Although Arnold had already been secretly negotiating with the British over a change of allegiance since May 1779, this news contributed to his decision to resign the command of Philadelphia. His next command was <a href="West%20Point">West Point</a>, which he sought with the intention of facilitating its surrender to the British. His plot was however exposed in September 1780, at which time he fled to the British in New York City.

In the 1930s, Lorenzo Hagglund, a veteran of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and a history buff, began searching the strait for remains of the battle. In 1932 he found the remains of "Royal Savage"s hull, which he successfully raised in 1934. Stored for more than fifty years, the remains were sold by his son to the <a href="National%20Civil%20War%20Museum">National Civil War Museum</a>. As of March 2009, the remains were in a city garage in <a href="Harrisburg%2C%20Pennsylvania">Harrisburg, Pennsylvania</a>. The city of <a href="Plattsburgh%2C%20New%20York">Plattsburgh, New York</a>, has claimed ownership of the remains and would like them returned to upstate New York.

In 1935 Hagglund followed up his discovery of "Royal Savage" with the discovery of "Philadelphia"s remains, sitting upright on the lake bottom. He raised her that year; she is now on display at the <a href="Smithsonian%20Institution">Smithsonian Institution</a>'s <a href="National%20Museum%20of%20American%20History">National Museum of American History</a> in Washington, D.C., and is listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a> and is designated a <a href="National%20Historic%20Landmark">National Historic Landmark</a>. The site of the battle, <a href="Valcour%20Bay">Valcour Bay</a>, was declared a National Historic Landmark on January 1, 1961, and added to the National Register on October 15, 1966.

In 1997 another pristine underwater wreck was located during a survey by the <a href="Lake%20Champlain%20Maritime%20Museum">Lake Champlain Maritime Museum</a>. Two years later it was conclusively identified as the gundalow "Spitfire"; this site was listed on the National Register in 2008, and it has been named as part of the U.S. government's <a href="Save%20America%27s%20Treasures">Save America's Treasures</a> program.

Jack Leonard "J. L." Warner (August 2, 1892 – September 9, 1978), born Jacob Warner, was a Canadian-American film executive who was the president and driving force behind the <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros. Studios</a> in <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a>, <a href="California">California</a>. Warner's career spanned some 45 years, its duration surpassing that of any other of the seminal Hollywood studio moguls.

As co-head of production at Warner Bros. Studios, he worked with his brother, <a href="Sam%20Warner">Sam Warner</a>, to procure the technology for the film industry's first talking picture. After Sam's death, Jack clashed with his surviving older brothers, <a href="Harry%20Warner">Harry</a> and <a href="Albert%20Warner">Albert Warner</a>. He assumed exclusive control of the film production company in the 1950s, when he secretly purchased his brothers' shares in the business after convincing them to participate in a joint sale of stocks.

Although Warner was feared by many of his employees and inspired ridicule with his uneven attempts at humor, he earned respect for his shrewd instincts and tough-mindedness. He recruited many of Warner Bros.' top stars and promoted the hard-edged social dramas for which the studio became known. Given to decisiveness, Warner once commented, "If I'm right fifty-one percent of the time, I'm ahead of the game."

Throughout his career, he was viewed as a contradictory and enigmatic figure. Although he was a staunch <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28USA%29">Republican</a>, Warner encouraged film projects that promoted the agenda of <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28USA%29">Democratic</a> President <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>. He opposed European <a href="fascism">fascism</a> and criticized <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a> well before America's involvement in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. An opponent of <a href="Communism">Communism</a>, after the war Warner appeared as a friendly witness before the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a>, voluntarily naming screenwriters who had been fired as suspected Communists or sympathizers. Despite his controversial public image, Warner remained a force in the motion picture industry until his retirement in the early 1970s.

Jack Warner was born in <a href="London%2C%20Ontario">London, Ontario</a>, in 1892. His parents were <a href="Jew">Jew</a>ish immigrants from <a href="Congress%20Poland">Poland</a> who spoke mainly <a href="Yiddish">Yiddish</a>. Jack was the fifth surviving son of Benjamin Warner a cobbler from <a href="Krasnosielc">Krasnosielc</a>, Poland (then located in the "Russian" part of Poland known as <a href="Congress%20Poland">Congress Kingdom</a>), and his wife, the former Pearl Leah Eichelbaum. Following their marriage in 1876, the couple had three children in Poland, one of whom died at a young age. One of the surviving children was Jack's eldest brother, Hirsch (later Harry). The Warner family had occupied a "hostile world", where the "night-riding of <a href="cossacks">cossacks</a>, the burning of houses, and the raping of women (<a href="pogroms">pogroms</a>) were part of life's burden for the Jews of the '<a href="shtetl">shtetl</a>'". In 1888, in search of a better future for his family and himself, Benjamin made his way to <a href="Hamburg">Hamburg</a>, <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, and then took a ship to America. The Warner surname was perhaps originally "Wonsal" or "Wonskolaser" Upon arriving in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, Benjamin introduced himself as "Benjamin Warner", and the surname "Warner" remained with him for the rest of his life. Pearl Warner and the couple's two children joined him in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore</a>, <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a>, less than a year later. In Baltimore, the couple had five more children, including Abraham (later known as Albert) and Sam Warner.
Benjamin Warner's decision to move to Canada in the early 1890s was inspired by a friend's advice that he could make an excellent living bartering tin wares with trappers in exchange for furs. Their sons Jack and David were born in Ontario. After two arduous years in Canada, Benjamin and Pearl Warner returned to Baltimore, bringing along their growing family. Two more children, Sadie and Milton, were added to the household there. In 1896, the family relocated to <a href="Youngstown%2C%20Ohio">Youngstown</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>, following the lead of Harry Warner, who established a shoe repair shop in the heart of the emerging industrial town. Benjamin worked with his son Harry in the shoe repair shop until he secured a loan to open a meat counter and grocery store in the city's downtown area.

Jack spent much of his youth in Youngstown. He observed in his autobiography that his experiences there molded his sensibilities. Warner wrote: "<a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a> told me that Youngstown in those days was one of the toughest cities in America, and a gathering place for <a href="Sicily">Sicilian</a> thugs active in <a href="the%20Mafia">the Mafia</a>. There was a murder or two almost every Saturday night in our neighborhood, and knives and <a href="brass%20knuckles">brass knuckles</a> were standard equipment for the young hotheads on the prowl." Warner claimed that he briefly belonged to a street gang based at Westlake's Crossing, a notorious neighborhood located just west of the city's downtown area. Meanwhile, he received his first taste of <a href="show%20business">show business</a> in the burgeoning <a href="Rust%20Belt">steel town</a>, singing at local theaters and forming a brief business partnership with another aspiring "song-and-dance man". During his brief career in <a href="vaudeville">vaudeville</a>, he officially changed his name to Jack Leonard Warner. Jack's older brother Sam disapproved of these youthful pursuits. "Get out front where they pay the actors," Sam Warner advised Jack. "That's where the money is."

In Youngstown, the Warner brothers took their first tentative steps into the entertainment industry. In the early 20th century, Sam Warner formed a business partnership with another local resident and "took over" the city's Old Grand Opera House, which he used as a venue for "cheap vaudeville and photoplays". The venture failed after one summer. Sam Warner then secured a job as a <a href="projectionist">projectionist</a> at <a href="Idora%20Park%2C%20Youngstown">Idora Park</a>, a local amusement park. He convinced the family of the new medium's possibilities and negotiated the purchase of a Model B <a href="Kinetoscope">Kinetoscope</a> from a projectionist who was "down on his luck". The purchase price was $1,000, and Jack Warner contributed $150 to the venture by pawning a horse, according to his obituary.

The enterprising brothers screened a well-used copy of "<a href="The%20Great%20Train%20Robbery%20%281903%20film%29">The Great Train Robbery</a>" throughout <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> before renting a vacant store in <a href="New%20Castle%2C%20Pennsylvania">New Castle, Pennsylvania</a>. This makeshift theatre, called the Bijou, was furnished with chairs borrowed from a local undertaker. Jack, who was still living in Youngstown at the time, arrived on weekends "to sing illustrated song-slides during reel changes". In 1906, the brothers purchased a small theater in New Castle, which they called the Cascade Movie Palace. They maintained the theater until moving into film distribution in 1907. That year, the Warner brothers established the <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh</a>-based Duquesne Amusement Company, a distribution firm that proved lucrative until the advent of <a href="Thomas%20Edison">Thomas Edison</a>'s <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Patents%20Company">Motion Picture Patents Company</a> (also known as the Edison Trust), which charged distributors exorbitant fees. In 1909, Harry agreed to bring Jack into the family business; he sent his younger brother to <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk, Virginia</a>, where Jack assisted Sam in the operation of a second film exchange company. Later that year, the Warners sold the family business to the General Film Company for "$10,000 in cash, $12,000 in preferred stock, and payments over a four-year period for a total of $52,000" (equivalent to $ today).

The Warner brothers pooled their resources and moved into film production in 1910. Then, in 1912, they lent their support to filmmaker <a href="Carl%20Laemmle">Carl Laemmle</a>'s Independent Motion Picture Company, which challenged the monopolistic control of the Edison Trust. That same year, Jack Warner acquired a job as a film splicer in New York, where he assisted brother Sam with the production of the film "Dante's Inferno". Despite the film's success at the box office, Harry Warner remained concerned about the economic threat presented by the Edison Trust. He subsequently broke with Laemmle and sent Jack to establish a film exchange in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>, while Sam did the same in Los Angeles. The brothers were soon poised to exploit the expanding California movie market. In 1917, Jack was sent to Los Angeles to open another film exchange company. Their first opportunity to produce a major film came in 1918, when they purchased the film rights for "My Four Years in Germany", a bestselling novel that condemned German wartime atrocities. The film proved to be a commercial and critical success, and the four brothers were able to establish a studio in California. In the new studio, Jack became co-head of production along with his older brother, Sam. In this capacity, the two brothers secured new scripts and story lines, managed film production, and looked for ways to reduce production costs.
Warner Bros. followed up the success of "My Four Years in Germany" with a popular serial titled "The Tiger's Claw" in 1919. That same year, the studio was less successful in its efforts to promote "Open Your Eyes", a tract on the dangers of <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a> that featured Jack Warner's sole screen appearance. During this period, the studio earned few profits; and in 1920, the Warners secured a bank loan to settle outstanding debts. Shortly thereafter, the Warners relocated their production studio from <a href="Culver%20City%2C%20California">Culver City, California</a>, to Hollywood, where they purchased a lot on the corner of <a href="Sunset%20Boulevard">Sunset Boulevard</a> and Bronson Avenue, known today as Sunset Bronson Studios. The new location and upgraded facilities did not significantly improve the studio's image, which remained defined by its low-budget comedies and racy films on declining morality.

The studio discovered a trained <a href="German%20Shepherd%20Dog">German Shepherd</a> named <a href="Rin%20Tin%20Tin">Rin Tin Tin</a> in 1923. The canine made his debut in "Where the North Begins", a film about an abandoned pup who is raised by wolves and befriends a fur trapper. According to one biographer, Jack Warner's initial doubts about the project were quelled when he met Rin Tin Tin, "who seemed to display more intelligence than some of the Warner comics." Rin Tin Tin proved to be the studio's most important commercial asset until the introduction of sound. Screenwriter <a href="Darryl%20F.%20Zanuck">Darryl F. Zanuck</a> produced several scripts for Rin Tin Tin vehicles and, during one year, wrote more than half of the studio's features. Between 1928 and 1933, Zanuck served as Jack Warner's right-hand man and executive producer, a position whose responsibilities included the day-to-day production of films. Despite the success of Rin Tin Tin and other projects, Warner Bros. was unable to compete with Hollywood's "Big Three" – <a href="Paramount%20Studios">Paramount</a>, <a href="Universal%20Studios">Universal</a>, and <a href="First%20National%20Pictures">First National</a> studios.

In 1925, the studio expanded its operations and acquired the Brooklyn-based theater company Vitagraph. Later that year, Sam Warner urged his brother, Harry, to sign an agreement with <a href="Western%20Electric">Western Electric</a> to develop a series of talking "shorts" using the newly developed <a href="Vitaphone">Vitaphone</a> technology. Sam died of pneumonia in 1927 (just before the premiere of the first feature-length talking picture, "<a href="The%20Jazz%20Singer">The Jazz Singer</a>"), and Jack became sole head of production. Sam's death left Jack inconsolable. One biographer writes, "Throughout his life, Jack had been warmed by Sam's sunshiny optimism, his thirst for excitement, his inventive mind, his gambling nature. Sam had also served as a buffer between Jack and his stern eldest brother, Harry. In the years to come, Jack ran the Warner Bros. <a href="Burbank%2C%20California">Burbank</a> studio with an iron hand. Following his brother's death, he became increasingly difficult to deal with and inspired the resentment of many of his employees.

As the family grieved over Sam's sudden passing, the success of "The Jazz Singer" helped establish Warner Bros. as a major studio. While Warner Bros. invested only $500,000 in the film, the studio reaped $3 million in profits. Hollywood's five major studios, which controlled most of the nation's movie theaters, initially attempted to block the growth of "talking pictures". In the face of such organized opposition, Warner Bros. produced 12 "talkies" in 1928 alone. The following year, the newly formed <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a> recognized Warner Bros. for "revolutionizing the industry with sound".

Despite Warner Bros.' new prosperity, Jack kept a tight rein on costs. He placed the studio's directors on a quota system and decreed a flat, low-key lighting style to make the sets look cheaper than they were.

The studio emerged relatively unscathed from the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and produced a broad range of films, including "backstage musicals," "crusading biopics," "swashbucklers," and "women's pictures." As Thomas Schatz observed, this repertoire was "a means of stabilizing marketing and sales, of bringing efficiency and economy into the production of some fifty feature films per year, and of distinguishing Warners' collective output from that of its competitors". Warner Bros. became best known, however, for its hard-hitting social dramas, whose production Jack Warner tended to support. These included gangster classics such as "<a href="Little%20Caesar%20%28film%29">Little Caesar</a>" and "<a href="The%20Public%20Enemy">The Public Enemy</a>" as well as the critically acclaimed "<a href="I%20Am%20a%20Fugitive%20from%20a%20Chain%20Gang">I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang</a>", starring <a href="Paul%20Muni">Paul Muni</a>. Some of these films reflected a surprising (albeit temporary) shift in Warner's political outlook. By 1932, despite his longstanding association with the Republican Party, he openly supported Democratic presidential candidate Franklin D. Roosevelt, staging a "Motion Picture and Electrical Parade Sports Pageant" at L.A. Stadium in Roosevelt's honor. This development foreshadowed an "era in which Warner would recruit the most <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a>-ish (often simultaneously the most left-wing) writers".
During this period, Warner took an active role in recruiting talent. To furnish Warner Bros. with much needed "star power", he raided contract players from rival studios, in some cases offering to double their salaries. This strategy yielded three leading stars from <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount</a> Studios – <a href="William%20Powell">William Powell</a>, <a href="Kay%20Francis">Kay Francis</a>, and <a href="Ruth%20Chatterton">Ruth Chatterton</a>. In 1929, Warner persuaded British stage and screen actor <a href="George%20Arliss">George Arliss</a> to play the title role in a <a href="Disraeli%20%281929%20film%29">remake</a> of the 1921 <a href="United%20Artists">United Artists</a> film "<a href="Disraeli%20%281921%20film%29">Disraeli</a>", a project that turned out to be a box-office hit. Then, in 1930, he spotted future stars <a href="James%20Cagney">James Cagney</a>, <a href="Joan%20Blondell">Joan Blondell</a>, and <a href="Frank%20McHugh">Frank McHugh</a> in the cast of a <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a> play called "Penny Arcade". Although Cagney turned out to be Warner's greatest prize, he was also the studio executive's biggest professional challenge. During his frequent arguments with Warner, Cagney often resorted to screaming the Yiddish obscenities he learned during his upbringing in the Yorkville district of New York City. According to a 1937 "<a href="Fortune%20%28magazine%29">Fortune</a>" magazine article, Warner's most intense contract disputes involved Cagney, "who got sick of being typed as a girl-hitting mick and of making five pictures a year instead of four."

The studio's executive producer, Darryl F. Zanuck, resigned during a contract dispute with Harry Warner in 1933. According to a 1933 letter that Jack wrote to <a href="Will%20H.%20Hays">Will H. Hays</a>, then president of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America</a>, Zanuck requested a higher salary and "indicated his desire to raise the salaries of the actors and personnel in the motion pictures we were producing". That year, Zanuck established <a href="Twentieth%20Century%20Pictures">Twentieth Century Pictures</a>, which merged with <a href="Fox%20Film%20Corporation">Fox Film Corporation</a> in 1935. Longtime producer for the studio, <a href="Hal%20B.%20Wallis">Hal B. Wallis</a>, took over as the studio's executive producer. Warner, however, denied Wallis the sweeping powers enjoyed by Zanuck, and the result was a decentralization of creative and administrative control that often created confusion at the studio. Under the new system, each picture was assigned a supervisor who was usually plucked from the ranks of the studio's screenwriters. Although Warner Bros. maintained a high rate of production throughout the 1930s, some pictures showed an uneven quality that reflected "not only the difficulty of shifting to a supervisory system but also the consequences of dispersing authority into the creative ranks".
Meanwhile, Jack Warner's role in production became somewhat limited. After acquiring a creative property, he often had little to do with a film's production until it was ready for preview. Nevertheless, Warner could be heavy-handed in his dealings with employees, and he was "merciless in his firings." Film director <a href="Gottfried%20Reinhardt">Gottfried Reinhardt</a> claimed that Warner "derived pleasure" from humiliating subordinates. "<a href="Harry%20Cohn">Harry Cohn</a> was a sonofabitch," Reinhardt said, "but he did it for business; he was not a sadist. [Louis B.] Mayer could be a monster, but he was not mean for the sake of meanness. Jack was."

Warner's management style frustrated many studio employees. Comedian <a href="Jack%20Benny">Jack Benny</a>, who once worked at Warner Bros., quipped, "Jack Warner would rather tell a bad joke than make a good movie". Warner frequently clashed with actors and supposedly banned them from the studio's executive dining room, with the explanation, "I don't need to look at actors when I eat." The studio executive did, however, win the affection of a few film personalities.

Among these was <a href="Bette%20Davis">Bette Davis</a>, one of the studio's leading stars, who once fled to England to secure release from her contract. In later years, Davis defended Warner against rumors of sexual impropriety when she wrote: "No lecherous boss was he! His sins lay elsewhere. He was the father. The power. The glory. And he was in business to make money." Davis revealed that, after the birth of her child, Warner's attitude toward her became warm and protective. "We became father and child, no question about it." she said. "He told me I didn't have to come back to work until I really felt like it. He was a thoughtful man. Not many nice things were said about him." Warner also earned the gratitude and affection of <a href="Errol%20Flynn">Errol Flynn</a>. In 1935, the studio head personally selected Flynn for the title role of "<a href="Captain%20Blood%20%281935%20film%29">Captain Blood</a>", even though Flynn was an unknown actor at the time. In 1936, following the success of another costume epic, "<a href="The%20Charge%20of%20the%20Light%20Brigade%20%281936%20film%29">The Charge of the Light Brigade</a>", Warner tore up Flynn's contract and signed him to a long-term deal that doubled his weekly salary.

As the 1930s came to an end, both Jack and Harry Warner became increasingly alarmed over the rise of <a href="Nazism">Nazism</a>. As Bernard F. Dick observed, the Warners, "as sons of Polish Jews who fled their homeland because of antisemitic pogroms ... had a personal interest in exposing Nazism." Moreover, the attraction to films critical of German militarism had a long history with the Warners that predated their production of "My Four Years in Germany" in 1918. In 1917, while it was still in distribution, the Warners had secured the rights for "<a href="War%20Brides%20%28film%29">War Brides</a>", a movie that featured <a href="Alla%20Nazimova">Alla Nazimova</a> as "a woman who kills herself rather than breed children for an unidentified country whose army looks suspiciously Teutonic."

Beyond this, Jack Warner was shaken by the 1936 murder of studio salesman Joe Kaufman, who was beaten to death by Nazi stormtroopers in <a href="Berlin">Berlin</a>. Warner later described the incident in the following terms: "Like many an outnumbered Jew he was trapped in an alley. They [Nazi hoodlums] hit him with fists and clubs and then kicked the life out of him with their boots and left him dying there." Hence, while other Hollywood studios sidestepped the issue, fearing domestic criticism and the loss of European markets, Warner Brothers produced films that were openly critical of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>.

In 1939, the studio published "<a href="Confessions%20of%20a%20Nazi%20Spy">Confessions of a Nazi Spy</a>", starring <a href="Edward%20G.%20Robinson">Edward G. Robinson</a>. The film project, which was recommended to Jack Warner by <a href="FBI%20Director">FBI Director</a> <a href="J.%20Edgar%20Hoover">J. Edgar Hoover</a>, drew on the real-life experiences of agent <a href="Leon%20G.%20Turrou">Leon G. Turrou</a>, who had worked as an undercover agent. Despite legal ramifications preventing the use of actual names, the studio aimed for an "aura of authenticity", and Hal Wallis initially recommended eliminating credits to give the film "the appearance of a newsreel."

"Confessions of a Nazi Spy" was widely criticized. The critic Pare Lorentz wrote, "The Warner brothers have declared war on Germany with this one." The German ambassador responded by issuing a protest to Secretary of State <a href="Cordell%20Hull">Cordell Hull</a>, and the German dictator, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, who watched the film at <a href="Berchtesgaden">Berchtesgaden</a>, was outraged. Meanwhile, the studio received stern warnings from <a href="U.S.%20Congressman">U.S. Congressman</a> <a href="Martin%20Dies%20Jr.">Martin Dies Jr.</a>, about defaming a "friendly country".

Initially, the studio bowed to pressure from the <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt%20Administration">Roosevelt Administration</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Motion%20Picture%20Production%20Code%20of%201930">Hays Office</a>, and isolationist lawmakers to desist from similar projects. Jack Warner announced that the studio would release no more "propaganda pictures" and promptly ordered the shelving of several projects with an anti-Nazi theme. In time, however, Warner Bros. produced more films with anti-Nazi messages, including "<a href="Underground%20%281941%20film%29">Underground</a>" and "<a href="All%20Through%20the%20Night%20%28film%29">All Through the Night</a>". In 1940, the studio produced short films that dramatically documented the devastation wrought by the German bombing raids on <a href="London">London</a>. Meanwhile, the studio celebrated the exploits of the <a href="Royal%20Canadian%20Air%20Force">Royal Canadian Air Force</a>, with films such as "<a href="Captains%20of%20the%20Clouds">Captains of the Clouds</a>". In 1941, Warner also produced the influential war film "<a href="Sergeant%20York%20%28film%29">Sergeant York</a>".

Contemporary reports that Jack Warner had banned the use of the German language throughout the company's studios were denied by studio representatives who indicated that this move would have prevented scores of studio employees from communicating with each other.

After the American declaration of war against the <a href="Axis%20Powers">Axis Powers</a>, Jack Warner, like some other studio heads, was commissioned as a <a href="lieutenant%20colonel">lieutenant colonel</a> in the <a href="U.S.%20Army">U.S. Army</a>.

In 1943 the studio's film "<a href="Casablanca%20%28film%29">Casablanca</a>" won the <a href="Academy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Picture">Academy Award for Best Picture</a>. When the award was announced, producer Hal B. Wallis got up to accept, only to find Jack Warner had rushed onstage "with a broad, flashing smile and a look of great self-satisfaction" to take the trophy, Wallis later recalled. "I couldn't believe it was happening. Casablanca had been my creation; Jack had absolutely nothing to do with it. As the audience gasped, I tried to get out of the row of seats and into the aisle, but the entire Warner family sat blocking me. I had no alternative but to sit down again, humiliated and furious. ... Almost forty years later, I still haven't recovered from the shock."

In 1943, Warner, at the advice of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, produced a film adaptation of the controversial book "<a href="Mission%20to%20Moscow">Mission to Moscow</a>", a film intended to inspire public support of the uneasy military alliance that the United States had with the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. Later, while testifying before the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> on October 27, 1947, Warner dismissed allegations during the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a> that this film was subversive, and he argued that "Mission to Moscow" was produced "only to help a desperate war effort, and not for posterity." After the film's lackluster response under distribution, the <a href="Republican%20National%20Committee">Republican National Committee</a> accused Warner of producing it as "New Deal propaganda."

In line with the Warner brothers' early opposition to Nazism, Warner Bros. produced more pictures about the war than any other studio, covering every branch of the armed services. In addition, the studio produced patriotic musicals such as "<a href="This%20Is%20the%20Army">This Is the Army</a>" and "<a href="Yankee%20Doodle%20Dandy">Yankee Doodle Dandy</a>".

Jack Warner responded grudgingly to the rising popularity of television in the late 1940s. Initially, he tried to compete with the new medium, introducing gimmicks such as <a href="3-D%20films">3-D films</a>, which soon lost their appeal among moviegoers. In 1954, Warner finally engaged the new medium, providing <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC</a> with a weekly show, "<a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Presents">Warner Bros. Presents</a>". The studio followed up with a series of Western dramas, such as "<a href="Maverick%20%28TV%20series%29">Maverick</a>", "<a href="Bronco%20%28TV%20series%29">Bronco</a>", and "<a href="Colt%20.45%20%28TV%20series%29">Colt .45</a>". Accustomed to dealing with actors in a high-handed manner, within a few years Warner provoked hostility among emerging TV stars like <a href="James%20Garner">James Garner</a>, who filed a lawsuit against Warner Bros. over a contract dispute. He was angered by the perceived ingratitude of television actors, who evidently showed more independence than film actors, and this deepened his contempt for the new medium. Following his deal with ABC, Warner also made his son, Jack Jr., head of the company's new <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Television">television department</a>.
During this period, Warner showed little foresight in his treatment of the studio's cartoon operation. Animated characters such as <a href="Bugs%20Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a>, <a href="Daffy%20Duck">Daffy Duck</a>, and <a href="Porky%20Pig">Porky Pig</a>, while embraced by cartoon lovers, "were always stepchildren at Warner Bros." As biographer Bob Thomas wrote, "Jack Warner...considered cartoons no more than an extraneous service provided to exhibitors who wanted a full program for their customers." In 1953, during a rare meeting between the Warners and the studio's cartoon makers, Jack confessed that he didn't "even know where the hell the <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Cartoons">cartoon studio</a> is", and Harry added, "The only thing I know is that we make <a href="Mickey%20Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a>," a reference to the flagship character of a competing company, <a href="Walt%20Disney%20Productions">Walt Disney Productions</a>. Several years later, Jack sold all of the 400 cartoons Warner Bros. made before 1948 for $3,000 apiece. As Thomas noted, "They have since earned millions, but not for Warner Bros."

Jack Warner's tumultuous relationship with his brother Harry worsened in February 1956, when Harry learned of Jack's decision to sell the Warner Bros.' pre-1950 films to <a href="Associated%20Artists%20Productions">Associated Artists Productions</a> (soon to merge with <a href="United%20Artists%20Television">United Artists Television</a>) for the modest sum of $21 million.

"This is our heritage, what we worked all our lives to create, and now it is gone," Harry exclaimed, upon hearing of the deal. The breach between Jack and Harry widened later that year. In July 1956, Jack, Harry, and Albert announced that they were putting Warner Bros. on the market. Jack, however, secretly organized a <a href="syndicate">syndicate</a> that purchased control of the company. By the time Harry and Albert learned of their brother's dealings, it was too late.

Jack Warner, as the company's largest stockholder, appointed himself as the new company president. Shortly after the deal was closed, Jack Warner announced that the company and its subsidiaries would be "directed more vigorously to the acquisition of the most important story properties, talents, and to the production of the finest motion pictures possible".

The two brothers had often argued, and earlier in the decade, studio employees claimed they saw Harry chase Jack through the studio with a lead pipe, shouting, "I'll get you for this, you son of a bitch" and threatening to kill him. This subterfuge, however, proved too much for Harry. He never spoke to Jack again. When Harry Warner died on July 27, 1958, Jack did not attend the funeral, and he departed for his annual vacation at <a href="Antibes">Cap d'Antibes</a>. Asked to respond to his brother's death, Jack said, "I didn't give a shit about Harry." At the same time, Jack took pride in the fact that President <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a> sent him a letter of condolence.

In the 1960s, Warner kept pace with rapid changes in the industry and played a key role in developing films that were commercial and critical successes. In February 1962, he purchased the film rights for the Broadway musical "<a href="My%20Fair%20Lady">My Fair Lady</a>", paying an unprecedented $6.5 million. The previous owner, <a href="CBS">CBS</a> director <a href="William%20S.%20Paley">William S. Paley</a>, set terms that included 50 percent of the distributor's gross profits "plus ownership of the negative at the end of the contract." Despite the "outrageous" purchase price, and the ungenerous terms of the contract, the deal proved lucrative for Warner Bros., securing the studio $12 million in profits. Warner was criticized for choosing a non-singing star, <a href="Audrey%20Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>, to play the leading role of <a href="Eliza%20Doolittle">Eliza Doolittle</a>; indeed, the 1964 Academy Award for Best Actress went to <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a>, who had played Eliza on Broadway and in London, for "<a href="Mary%20Poppins%20%28film%29">Mary Poppins</a>", while Audrey Hepburn was not even nominated. However, the film won the best-picture <a href="Academy%20Awards">Oscar</a> for 1964.

In 1965, Warner surprised many industry observers when he purchased the rights to "<a href="Who%27s%20Afraid%20of%20Virginia%20Woolf%3F%20%28film%29">Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?</a>", <a href="Edward%20Albee">Edward Albee</a>'s searing play about a destructive marriage. From the beginning, the project was beset by controversy. <a href="Ernest%20Lehman">Ernest Lehman</a>'s script, which was extremely faithful to Albee's play, stretched the U.S. film industry's <a href="United%20States%20Motion%20Picture%20Production%20Code%20of%201930">Production Code</a> to the limit. <a href="Jack%20Valenti">Jack Valenti</a>, who just assumed leadership of the <a href="Motion%20Picture%20Association%20of%20America">Motion Picture Association of America</a>, recalled that a meeting with Warner and studio aide Ben Kalmenson left him "uneasy". "I was uncomfortable with the thought that this was just the beginning of an unsettling new era in film, in which we would lurch from crisis to crisis without any suitable solution in sight," Valenti wrote. Meanwhile, Lehman and the film's director, <a href="Mike%20Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>, battled with studio executives and exhibitors who insisted that the film be shot in color rather than black and white. These controversies soon faded into the background while Jack Warner challenged the validity of the production code by publicly requiring theaters showing the film to post an "Adults only" label and restrict tickets sales accordingly, all as a marketing tease to entice audiences to see what warranted that restriction. At this, the MPAA — wary of a repeat of the embarrassment it had trying to censor the highly acclaimed film, "<a href="The%20Pawnbroker%20%28film%29">The Pawnbroker</a>" — gave in and approved the film as a special exception because of its quality, which led to other filmmakers to challenge the code themselves even more aggressively. Upon its release, "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" was embraced by audiences and critics alike. It secured 13 nominations from the Academy including one for Best Picture of 1966.

Despite these achievements, Jack grew weary of making films, and he sold a substantial amount of his studio stock to <a href="Seven%20Arts%20Productions">Seven Arts Productions</a> on November 14, 1966. Some observers believed that Ben Kalmenson, Warner Bros.'s executive vice president, persuaded Warner to sell his stock so that Kalmenson could assume leadership of the studio. Warner, however, had personal reasons for seeking retirement. His wife, Ann, continually pressured him to "slow down", and the aging studio head felt a need to put his affairs in order. Warner sold his 1.6 million shares of studio stock shortly after producing the film adaptation of <a href="Lerner%20%26amp%3B%20Loewe">Lerner & Loewe</a>'s "Camelot". The sale yielded, after capital gains taxes, about $24 million (equivalent to $ million today). Eight months after the sale, Warner quipped, "Who would ever have thought that a butcher boy from Youngstown, Ohio, would end up with twenty-four million smackers in his pocket?" At the time of the sale, Warner had earned the distinction of being the second chief to also serve as company president, after <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>' Harry Cohn.

Warner's decision to sell came at a time when he was losing the formidable power that he once took for granted. He had already survived the dislocations of the 1950s, when other studio heads – including <a href="Louis%20B.%20Mayer">Louis B. Mayer</a>, <a href="David%20O.%20Selznick">David O. Selznick</a>, and <a href="Samuel%20Goldwyn">Samuel Goldwyn</a> – were pushed out by stockholders who "sought scapegoats for dwindling profits". Structural changes that occurred in the industry during this period ensured that studios would become "more important as backers of independent producers than as creators of their own films", a situation that left little room for the traditional movie mogul. By the mid-1960s, most of the film moguls from the Golden Age of Hollywood had died, and Warner was regarded as one of the last of a dying breed. Evidence of Warner's eroding control at Warner Bros. included his failure to block production of the controversial but highly influential film, "<a href="Bonnie%20and%20Clyde%20%28film%29">Bonnie and Clyde</a>", a film project he initially "hated". Similarly, as producer of the film adaptation of "<a href="Camelot%20%28film%29">Camelot</a>", Warner was unable to persuade director <a href="Joshua%20Logan">Joshua Logan</a> to cast <a href="Richard%20Burton">Richard Burton</a> and <a href="Julie%20Andrews">Julie Andrews</a> in the leading roles. Instead, Logan selected <a href="Richard%20Harris">Richard Harris</a> and <a href="Vanessa%20Redgrave">Vanessa Redgrave</a>, a move that contributed to the project's critical – and commercial – failure. Another factor was that Logan was able to manipulate Warner's ego to persuade him from cutting the screenplay's length, despite the fact that the studio executive had already agreed with the film's unofficial producer, Joel Freeman, that it was overlong. Warner officially retired from his studio in 1969.

Warner remained active as an independent producer until the early 1970s to run some of the company's distributions and exhibition division. Among his last productions was a film adaptation of a Broadway musical, "<a href="1776%20%28film%29">1776</a>", which was released through <a href="Columbia%20Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a>. Before the film's release, Warner showed a preview cut to U.S. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a>, who recommended substantial changes, including the removal of the song 'Cool, Cool, Considerate Men' that struck him as veiled criticisms of the ongoing <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>. Without consulting the film's director, <a href="Peter%20H.%20Hunt">Peter H. Hunt</a>, Warner ordered the film re-edited. The cuts have since been restored in most television showings and in the film's DVD release.

In November 1972, the film opened to enthusiastic audiences at <a href="Radio%20City%20Music%20Hall">Radio City Music Hall</a>, but it fared poorly in theaters. Faced with a polarized political climate, few Americans were drawn to "a cheery exercise in prerepublic civics". Warner's efforts to promote the film were sometimes counterproductive. During an interview with talk show host <a href="Merv%20Griffin">Merv Griffin</a>, the elderly producer engaged in a lengthy tirade against "pinko communists". This would become Warner's only television interview.

On October 14, 1914, Warner married Irma Claire Salomon, the daughter of Sam Salomon and Bertha Franklin Salomon from one of <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>'s pioneer Jewish families. Irma Warner gave birth to the couple's only child, <a href="Jack%20M.%20Warner">Jack M. Warner</a>, on March 27, 1916. Jack Warner named the child after himself, disregarding an Eastern European Jewish custom that children should not be named after living relatives. Although his son bore a different middle initial, he "has been called Junior all his life". The marriage ended in 1935, when Warner left his wife for another woman, Ann Page. Warner and Ann had a daughter named Barbara. Irma Warner sued her husband for divorce on the grounds of desertion. Jack's older brother, Harry, reflected the Warner family feelings about the marriage when he exclaimed, "Thank God our mother didn't live to see this". Warner married Ann after the divorce. The Warners, who took Irma's side in the affair, refused to accept Ann as a family member. In the wake of this falling out, Jack's relationship with his son, Jack Warner Jr., also became strained.

In the late 1950s, Warner was almost killed in a car accident that left him in a <a href="coma">coma</a> for several days. On August 5, 1958, after an evening of <a href="Baccarat%20%28card%20game%29">baccarat</a> at the Palm Beach Casino in <a href="Cannes">Cannes</a>, Warner's <a href="Alfa%20Romeo">Alfa Romeo</a> roadster swerved into the path of a coal truck on a stretch of road located near the seaside villa of <a href="Prince%20Aly%20Khan">Prince Aly Khan</a>. Warner was thrown from the car, which burst into flames upon impact. Shortly after the accident, his son, Jack Jr., joined other family members in France, where the unconscious studio head was hospitalized. In an interview with reporters, Jack Jr. suggested that his father was dying. Then, during a visit to his father's hospital room, the young man offended Ann Warner, whom he largely blamed for his parents' divorce. When Warner regained consciousness, he was enraged by reports of his son's behavior, and their "tenuous" relationship came to an end. On December 30, 1958, Jack Jr. was informed, by Jack Sr.'s lawyer Arnold Grant, that the elder Warner had released him from the company. When he attempted to report for work, studio guards denied him entry. The two men never achieved a reconciliation, and Jack Jr. is not mentioned in his father's 1964 autobiography.

Warner made no pretense of faithfulness to his wife, Ann, and kept a series of mistresses throughout the 1950s and 1960s. The most enduring of these "girlfriends" was an aspiring actress named Jackie Park, who bore a "startling" resemblance to Warner's second wife. The relationship was in its fourth year when Ann Warner pressed her husband to terminate the affair. Although Ann did once have an affair with studio actor <a href="Eddie%20Albert">Eddie Albert</a> in 1941, she was much more devoted to the marriage by contrast. In the 1960s, she insisted that, despite his reputation for ruthlessness, Jack Warner had a softer side. In a note to author Dean Jennings, who assisted Warner on his 1964 autobiography, "My First Hundred Years in Hollywood", Ann Warner wrote: "He is extremely sensitive, but there are few who know that because he covers it with a cloak."

An "ardent Republican", Jack Warner nevertheless supported <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Franklin%20D.%20Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> and the <a href="New%20Deal">New Deal</a> in the early 1930s. Later in the decade, he made common cause with opponents of <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>, overlooking ideological differences with those who held <a href="Left-wing%20politics">leftist</a> political views. In 1947, however, Warner served as a "friendly witness" for the <a href="House%20Un-American%20Activities%20Committee">House Un-American Activities Committee</a> (HUAC), thereby lending support to allegations of a "Red" infiltration of Hollywood. Warner felt that Communists were responsible for the studio's month-long strike that occurred in the fall of 1946, and on his own initiative, he provided the names of a dozen screenwriters who were dismissed because of suspected Communist sympathies, a move that effectively destroyed their careers. Former studio employees named by Warner included <a href="Alvah%20Cecil%20Bessie">Alvah Bessie</a>, <a href="Howard%20Koch%20%28screenwriter%29">Howard Koch</a>, <a href="Ring%20Lardner%20Jr.">Ring Lardner Jr.</a>, <a href="John%20Howard%20Lawson">John Howard Lawson</a>, <a href="Albert%20Maltz">Albert Maltz</a>, <a href="Robert%20Rossen">Robert Rossen</a>, <a href="Dalton%20Trumbo">Dalton Trumbo</a>, <a href="Clifford%20Odets">Clifford Odets</a>, and <a href="Irwin%20Shaw">Irwin Shaw</a>. As one biographer observed, Warner "was furious when <a href="Humphrey%20Bogart">Humphrey Bogart</a>, <a href="Lauren%20Bacall">Lauren Bacall</a>, <a href="Paul%20Henreid">Paul Henreid</a> and <a href="John%20Huston">John Huston</a> joined other members of the stellar <a href="Committee%20for%20the%20First%20Amendment">Committee for the First Amendment</a> in a flight to <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington</a> to preach against the threat to free expression". Lester D. Friedman noted that Warner's response to the HUAC hearings was similar to other Jewish studio heads who "feared that a blanket equation of Communists with Jews would destroy them and their industry".

Warner publicly supported Richard Nixon during the 1960 presidential election and paid for full-page ads in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" "to proclaim why Nixon should be elected". In the wake of Nixon's loss to <a href="John%20F.%20Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>, however, the studio head made arrangements to attend a fundraiser at the <a href="Hollywood%20Palladium">Hollywood Palladium</a> in honor of the president-elect. Several weeks later, Warner received a phone call from the new chief executive's father, <a href="Joseph%20P.%20Kennedy">Joseph P. Kennedy</a>, and within a short time, Warner Bros. purchased the film rights for Robert Donovan's book, "<a href="PT%20109%20%28film%29">PT 109</a>", a bestseller concerning John Kennedy's exploits during World War II. "I don't think President Kennedy would object to my friendship with Dick Nixon," Warner said later. "I would have voted for both of them if I could. You might think this is a form of fence-straddling, but I love everybody." In the late 1960s, he emerged as an outspoken proponent of the <a href="Vietnam%20War">Vietnam War</a>.

By the end of 1973, those closest to Warner became aware of signs that he was becoming disoriented. Shortly after losing his way in the building that housed his office, Warner retired. In 1974, Warner suffered a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> that left him blind and enfeebled. During the next several years, he gradually lost the ability to speak, and became unresponsive to friends and relatives. Finally, on August 13, 1978, Warner was admitted to <a href="Cedars-Sinai%20Medical%20Center">Cedars-Sinai Hospital</a>, where he died of a heart inflammation ("<a href="edema">edema</a>") on September 9. He was 86 years old. A funeral service was held at the <a href="Wilshire%20Boulevard%20Temple">Wilshire Boulevard Temple</a>, the synagogue to which many members of the Warner family belonged. He was interred at <a href="Home%20of%20Peace%20Cemetery%20%28East%20Los%20Angeles%29">Home of Peace Cemetery</a> in <a href="East%20Los%20Angeles%2C%20California">East Los Angeles, California</a>.

Jack Warner left behind an estate estimated at $15 million. Much of the Warner estate, including property and memorabilia, was bequeathed to his widow, Ann. Warner, however, left $200,000 to his estranged son, Jack Jr., perhaps in an effort to discourage him from contesting the will. In the days following Warner's death, newspaper obituaries recounted the familiar story of "the four brothers who left the family butcher shop for nickelodeons" and went on to revolutionize American cinema. A front-page story in Warner's adopted hometown of Youngstown featured accounts of the family's pre-Hollywood struggles in Ohio, describing how Jack Warner drove a wagon for his father's business when he was only seven years old. The late movie [mogul] was widely eulogized for his role in "shaping Hollywood's 'Golden Age'".

Several months after Warner's death, a more personal tribute was organized by the Friends of the Libraries at the <a href="University%20of%20Southern%20California">University of Southern California</a>. The event, called "The Colonel: An Affectionate Remembrance of Jack L. Warner", drew Hollywood notables such as entertainers <a href="Olivia%20de%20Havilland">Olivia de Havilland</a> and <a href="Debbie%20Reynolds">Debbie Reynolds</a>, and cartoon voice actor <a href="Mel%20Blanc">Mel Blanc</a>. Blanc closed the event with a rendition of Porky Pig's famous farewell, "A-bee-a-bee-a-bee–that's all, folks." In recognition of his contributions to the <a href="motion%20picture">motion picture</a> industry, Jack Warner was accorded a star on the <a href="Hollywood%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>, located at 6541 Hollywood Boulevard. He is also represented on <a href="Canada%27s%20Walk%20of%20Fame">Canada's Walk of Fame</a> (where he was inducted in 2004) in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a>, which honours outstanding Canadians from all fields.

Warner is portrayed by American actor and director <a href="Mark%20Rydell">Mark Rydell</a> in the 2001 television film "<a href="James%20Dean%20%282001%20film%29">James Dean</a>", <a href="Danny%20Wells">Danny Wells</a> in the 2002 television film "<a href="Gleason%20%282002%20film%29">Gleason</a>", British actor <a href="Ben%20Kingsley">Ben Kingsley</a> in the 2015 drama film "<a href="Life%20%282015%20film%29">Life</a>" and by <a href="Stanley%20Tucci">Stanley Tucci</a> in the <a href="FX%20%28TV%20channel%29">FX</a> series "<a href="Feud%20%28TV%20series%29">Feud</a>".

Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home

Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home is a 1986 American <a href="science%20fiction%20film">science fiction film</a> released by <a href="Paramount%20Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. It is the fourth feature film based on "<a href="Star%20Trek">Star Trek</a>", and is a <a href="sequel">sequel</a> to "" (1984). It completes the story arc begun in "" (1982) and continued in "The Search for Spock". Intent on returning home to Earth to face trial for their actions in the previous film, the former crew of the <a href="Starship%20Enterprise">USS "Enterprise"</a> finds the planet in grave danger from an alien probe attempting to contact now-extinct <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a>s. The crew travel to Earth's past to find whales who can answer the probe's call.

After directing "The Search for Spock", cast member <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> was asked to direct the next feature, and given greater freedom regarding the film's content. Nimoy and producer <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> conceived a story with an environmental message and no clear-cut villain. Dissatisfied with the first screenplay produced by Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes, Paramount hired "The Wrath of Khan" writer and director <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a>. Meyer and Bennett divided the story between them and wrote different parts of the script, requiring approval from Nimoy, lead actor <a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a>, and Paramount. Principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. Unlike previous "Star Trek" films, "The Voyage Home" was shot extensively <a href="Location%20shooting">on location</a>; many real settings and buildings were used as stand-ins for scenes set around and in the city of San Francisco. Special effects firm <a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a> (ILM) assisted in post-production and the film's special effects. Few of the humpback whales in the film were real: ILM devised full-size animatronics and small motorized models to stand in for the real creatures.

"The Voyage Home" was released on November 26, 1986 in North America, and became the top-grossing film at the weekend box office. The film's humor and unconventional story were well received by critics, fans of the series and the general audience. It was financially successful, earning $133 million worldwide. The film earned several awards and four <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a> nominations for its cinematography and audio. It was dedicated to the crew of the <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger">Space Shuttle "Challenger"</a>, which <a href="Space%20Shuttle%20Challenger%20disaster">broke up 73 seconds after takeoff</a> on the morning of January 28, 1986. Principal photography for "The Voyage Home" began four weeks after "Challenger" and its crew were lost.

In 2286, an enormous cylindrical probe moves through space, sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling the power of every ship it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> Command sends out a planetary <a href="distress%20call">distress call</a> and warns all space-faring vessels not to approach Earth.

On the planet <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29%23Homeworld">Vulcan</a>, the former officers of the late <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">USS "Enterprise"</a> are living in exile (following the events of ""). Accompanied by the Vulcan <a href="Spock">Spock</a>, still recovering from his resurrection, the crew — except for Saavik, who remains on Vulcan — take their captured Klingon Bird of Prey (renamed the "Bounty", after the <a href="HMS%20Bounty">Royal Navy ship</a>) and return to Earth to face trial for their actions. Receiving Starfleet's warning, Spock determines that the probe's signal matches the <a href="whale%20sound">song</a> of extinct <a href="humpback%20whale">humpback whale</a>s, and that the object will continue to wreak havoc until its call is answered. The crew uses their ship to <a href="time%20travel%20in%20fiction">travel back in time</a> via a <a href="Gravity%20assist">slingshot maneuver around the Sun</a>, planning to return with a whale to answer the alien signal.

Arriving in 1986, the crew finds their ship's power drained by the time travel maneuver. Hiding the "Bounty" in <a href="San%20Francisco">San Francisco</a>'s <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Park">Golden Gate Park</a> using its <a href="cloaking%20device">cloaking device</a>, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a> and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while <a href="Montgomery%20Scott">Montgomery Scott</a>, <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a>, and <a href="Hikaru%20Sulu">Hikaru Sulu</a> construct a tank to hold the whales they need for a return to the 23rd century. <a href="Uhura">Uhura</a> and <a href="Pavel%20Chekov">Pavel Chekov</a> are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage can be collected and used to re-power the Klingon vessel.

Kirk and Spock discover a pair of whales in the care of Dr. Gillian Taylor at a <a href="Sausalito">Sausalito</a> aquarium, and learn they will soon be released into the wild. Kirk tells her of his mission and asks for the tracking frequency for the whales, but she refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, Scott, McCoy, and Sulu trade the formula of <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20materials%23Transparent_aluminum">transparent aluminum</a> for the materials needed for the whale tank. Uhura and Chekov locate a nuclear powered ship, the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> "<a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28CVN-65%29">Enterprise</a>". They collect the power they need, but are discovered on board. Uhura is beamed out but Chekov is captured, and subsequently severely injured in an escape attempt.

Gillian learns the whales have been released early, and goes to Kirk for assistance. Gillian, Kirk, and McCoy rescue Chekov from a nearby hospital and return to the now recharged Bird of Prey. After saving the whales from poachers and transporting them aboard, the crew returns with Gillian to their own time. On approaching Earth, the "Bounty" loses power due to the alien probe, and crash-lands into the waters of <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. Once released from near-drowning, the whales respond to the probe's signal, causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth and return to the depths of space. For their part in saving the planet, all charges against the "Enterprise" crew are dropped, save one for disobeying a superior officer, leveled solely at Kirk. Kirk is demoted from Admiral to the rank of Captain and returned to the command of a starship. Kirk and Gillian part ways, as she has been assigned to a science vessel by Starfleet. The crew departs on their ship, the newly christened <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-A%29">USS "Enterprise" (NCC-1701-A)</a>, and leaves on a shakedown mission.

<a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a> portrays Admiral <a href="James%20T.%20Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>, former captain of the "Enterprise". Shatner was unwilling to reprise the role of Kirk until he received a salary of $2 million and the promise of directing the next film. Shatner described "The Voyage Home"s comic quality as one "that verges on tongue-in-cheek but isn't; it's as though the characters within the play have a great deal of joy about themselves, a joy of living [and] you play it with the reality you would in a kitchen-sink drama written for today's life".

<a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> plays <a href="Spock">Spock</a>, who was resurrected by the effects of the Genesis planet and had his "living spirit" restored to his body in the previous film. <a href="DeForest%20Kelley">DeForest Kelley</a> portrays Doctor <a href="Leonard%20McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a>, who is given many of the film's comedic lines; Kelley biographer Terry Lee Rioux wrote that in the film "he seemed to be playing straight man to himself." On Earth McCoy was paired with engineer <a href="Montgomery%20Scott">Montgomery Scott</a> (<a href="James%20Doohan">James Doohan</a>), as producer Harve Bennett felt that Kelley worked well with Doohan's "old vaudeville comic". The other members of the "Enterprise" crew include <a href="George%20Takei">George Takei</a> as helmsman <a href="Hikaru%20Sulu">Hikaru Sulu</a>, <a href="Walter%20Koenig">Walter Koenig</a> as Commander <a href="Pavel%20Chekov">Pavel Chekov</a>, and <a href="Nichelle%20Nichols">Nichelle Nichols</a> as <a href="Uhura">Uhura</a>. Koenig commented that Chekov was a "delight" to play in this film because he worked best in comedic situations.

<a href="Catherine%20Hicks">Catherine Hicks</a> plays Dr. Gillian Taylor, a biologist on 20th century Earth. During production a rumor circulated that the part had been created after Shatner demanded a love interest, a regular aspect of the television series that was absent from the first three films. Writer <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a> denied this, saying that the inspiration for Taylor came from a biologist featured in a "<a href="National%20Geographic%20Society">National Geographic</a>" documentary about whales. Nimoy chose Hicks after inviting her to lunch with Shatner and witnessing a chemistry between the two. The role was originally written for <a href="Eddie%20Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> as an astrophysicist at Berkeley.

<a href="Majel%20Barrett">Majel Barrett</a> reprises her role as <a href="Christine%20Chapel">Christine Chapel</a>, the director of Starfleet Command's medical services. Many of her scenes—some reportedly very large—were omitted in the final cut, angering the actress. Her final role in the film consists of one line of dialogue and a reaction shot. <a href="Mark%20Lenard">Mark Lenard</a> and <a href="Jane%20Wyatt">Jane Wyatt</a> play Spock's parents, Ambassador <a href="Sarek">Sarek</a> and <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20characters%20%28G%E2%80%93M%29%23G">Amanda Grayson</a>, respectively, with Wyatt reprising the role she had previously played in the 1967 episode "<a href="Journey%20to%20Babel">Journey to Babel</a>". Wyatt commented that although she generally disliked working with actors who were directing, she found Nimoy an exception because he could concentrate on being part of the cast as well as setting up the crew. <a href="Robin%20Curtis">Robin Curtis</a> reprises the role of <a href="Saavik">Saavik</a>, a Starfleet lieutenant. Saavik's role is minimal in the film—originally, she was intended to remain behind on Vulcan because she was pregnant after she had mated with the younger Spock in "". In the final cut of the film, all references to her condition were dropped.

The film contains several cameos and smaller roles. <a href="Alex%20Henteloff">Alex Henteloff</a> plays Dr. Nichols, plant manager of Plexicorp. <a href="Madge%20Sinclair">Madge Sinclair</a> makes an uncredited appearance as captain of the USS <a href="List%20of%20Starfleet%20starships%20ordered%20by%20class">"Saratoga"</a> (the first female Federation starship captain to appear in Star Trek). Musician <a href="Jane%20Wiedlin">Jane Wiedlin</a> and tennis star <a href="Vijay%20Amritraj">Vijay Amritraj</a> appear as Starfleet officers seen briefly on video screens at Starfleet Command. <a href="John%20Schuck">John Schuck</a> appears as a Klingon ambassador, <a href="Robert%20Ellenstein">Robert Ellenstein</a> as the <a href="United%20Federation%20of%20Planets">Federation President</a>, <a href="Michael%20Berryman">Michael Berryman</a> as an alien display officer at Starfleet Command, and <a href="Brock%20Peters">Brock Peters</a> as <a href="List%20of%20Star%20Trek%20characters%20%28A%E2%80%93F%29%23C">Fleet Admiral Cartwright</a>. <a href="Grace%20Lee%20Whitney">Grace Lee Whitney</a> reprises her role as <a href="Janice%20Rand">Janice Rand</a> from the original television series.

Before "The Search for Spock" was released, its director Leonard Nimoy was asked to return to direct the next film in the franchise. Whereas Nimoy had been under certain constraints in filming the previous picture, Paramount gave the director greater freedom for the sequel. "[Paramount] said flat out that they wanted my vision," Nimoy recalled. In contrast to the drama-heavy and operatic events of the three previous "Star Trek" features, Nimoy and producer <a href="Harve%20Bennett">Harve Bennett</a> wanted a lighter movie that did not have a clear-cut villain. As William Shatner was unwilling to return, Nimoy and Bennett spent eight months considering a <a href="prequel">prequel</a> concept by <a href="Ralph%20Winter%20%28producer%29">Ralph Winter</a> about the characters at <a href="Starfleet%20Academy">Starfleet Academy</a>, before Shatner received a pay increase and signed on to star. Nimoy and Shatner each received $2.5 million for the film, less than their original demands, but the film cast's rising salaries caused Paramount to create a new television series, "" (1987), with less-expensive, lesser-known actors.

Despite Shatner's doubts, Nimoy and Bennett selected a <a href="time%20travel">time travel</a> story in which the "Enterprise" crew encounters a problem that could only be fixed by something only available in the present day (the "Star Trek" characters' past). They considered ideas about violin makers and oil drillers, or a disease that had its cure destroyed with the <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a>s. "But the depiction of thousands of sick and dying people seemed rather gruesome for our light-hearted film, and the thought of our crew taking a 600-year round trip just to bring back a <a href="snail%20darter">snail darter</a> wasn't all that thrilling," explained Nimoy. The director read a book on extinct animals and conceived the storyline that was eventually adopted. Nimoy hit upon the idea of humpback whales after talking with a friend—their song added mystery to the story, and their size added logistical challenges the heroes would have to overcome.

Nimoy approached "<a href="Beverly%20Hills%20Cop">Beverly Hills Cop</a>" writer <a href="Daniel%20Petrie%2C%20Jr.">Daniel Petrie, Jr.</a> to write the screenplay when a concept that executive producer <a href="Jeffrey%20Katzenberg">Jeffrey Katzenberg</a> described as "either the best or worst idea in the world" arose—"Star Trek" fan <a href="Eddie%20Murphy">Eddie Murphy</a> wanted a starring role. Nimoy and Murphy acknowledged his part would attract non-"Star Trek" fans to the franchise following the rising popularity of Murphy, but it also meant the film might be ridiculed. Steve Meerson and Peter Krikes were hired to write a script with Murphy as a college professor who believes in aliens and likes to play <a href="whale%20sound">whale songs</a>. Murphy disliked the part, explaining he wanted to play an alien or a Starfleet officer, and chose to make "<a href="The%20Golden%20Child">The Golden Child</a>"—a decision Murphy later said was a mistake. The character intended for Murphy was combined with those of a marine biologist and a female reporter to become Gillian Taylor.

Paramount was dissatisfied with the script, so its head of production <a href="Dawn%20Steel">Dawn Steel</a> asked <a href="Nicholas%20Meyer">Nicholas Meyer</a>, the writer and director of "", to help rewrite it. Meyer never read the earlier script, reasoning it pointless to do so since the content had no appeal to the studio. He and Bennett split the task of conceiving the plot between them. Bennett wrote the first quarter of the story, up to the point where the crew goes back in time. Meyer wrote the story's middle portion, taking place on 20th-century Earth, and Bennett handled the ending. After 12 days of writing, Meyer and Bennett combined their separate portions. In this version, Gillian Taylor stays on 1986's Earth and vows to ensure the survival of the humpback whale despite the paradox it could create. Meyer preferred this "righter ending" to the film version, explaining "the end in the movie detracts from the importance of people in the present taking the responsibility for the ecology and preventing problems of the future by doing something today, rather than catering to the fantasy desires of being able to be transported in time to the near-utopian future." Meyer and Bennett cut out Krikes and Meerson's idea of having the Klingon Bird-of-Prey fly over the <a href="Super%20Bowl">Super Bowl</a> and the hint that Saavik remained on Vulcan because she was pregnant with Spock's child.

Nimoy said Meyer gave the script "the kind of humor and social comment, gadfly attitude I very much wanted". He added that his vision was for "no dying, no fighting, no shooting, no photon torpedoes, no phaser blasts, no stereotypical bad guy. I wanted people to really have a great time watching this film [and] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed a couple of big ideas at them, well, then that would be even better." One of Meyer's earlier films, "<a href="Time%20After%20Time%20%281979%20film%29">Time After Time</a>", was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that "The Voyage Home" had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a>—"The Voyage Home"s scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from "Time After Time".

Meyer found writing the script to be a smooth process. He would write a few pages, show it to Nimoy and Bennett for consultation, and return to his office to write some more. Once Nimoy, Bennett, and Meyer were happy, they showed the script to Shatner, who offered his own notes for another round of rewrites. The completed script was shown to Paramount executives, who were very pleased.

<a href="Industrial%20Light%20%26amp%3B%20Magic">Industrial Light & Magic</a> (ILM) was responsible for "The Voyage Home"s model design and optical effects. The alien probe was the responsibility of ILM's model shop, which brought in outside help like illustrator <a href="Ralph%20McQuarrie">Ralph McQuarrie</a> for concept art. The modelmakers started with art director <a href="Nilo%20Rodis">Nilo Rodis</a>' basic design, a simple cylinder with whalelike qualities. The prototype was covered with barnacles and colored. The ball-shaped antenna that juts out from the bottom of the probe was created out of a piece of irrigation pipe; internal machinery turned the device. Three sizes of the "whale probe" were created; the primary probe model was supplemented by a smaller model for wide shots and a large model that used <a href="forced%20perspective">forced perspective</a> to give the probe the illusion of massive dimensions.

The effects crew focused on using in-camera tricks to realize the probe; post-production effects were time-consuming, so lighting effects were done on stage while filming. Model shop supervisor Jeff Mann filled the probe's antenna with tube lamps and halogen bulbs that were turned on in sequence for different exposures; three different camera passes for each exposure were combined for the final effect. After watching the first shot, the team found the original, whalelike probe design lacking in menace. The modelmakers repainted the probe a shiny black, pockmarked its surface for greater texture and interest, and re-shot the scene. Although they wanted to avoid post-production effects work, the opticals team had to recolor the antenna ball in a blue hue, as the original orange looked too much like a spinning basketball.

Aside from the probe, "The Voyage Home" required no new starship designs. The USS "Saratoga", the first Federation starship disabled by the probe, was the USS "Reliant" model from "The Wrath of Khan". The Bird-of-Prey model from "The Search for Spock" was reused, but ILM built additional sturdy versions for "The Voyage Home"s action sequences. The inside of the Bird-of-Prey was represented by a different set than "The Search for Spock", but the designers made sure to adhere to a sharp and alien architectural aesthetic. To give the set a smokier, atmospheric look, the designers rigged display and instrumentation lights to be bright enough that they could light the characters, rather than relying on ambient or rigged lighting. While Paramount had instructed ILM to trash the large <a href="Earth%20Spacedock">Spacedock</a> model created for "The Search for Spock", the team had been loath to discard the complicated model and its miles of fiber optic lighting. When "The Voyage Home" called for the return of Spacedock, ILM had only to reassemble the model from storage.

<a href="Robert%20Fletcher%20%28costume%20designer%29">Robert Fletcher</a> served as costume designer for the film. During the Earth-based scenes, Kirk and his crew continue to wear their 23rd-century clothing. Nimoy debated whether the crew should change costumes, but after seeing how people in San Francisco are dressed, he decided they would still fit in.

Nimoy chose <a href="Donald%20Peterman">Donald Peterman</a>, <a href="American%20Society%20of%20Cinematographers">ASC</a>, as <a href="director%20of%20photography">director of photography</a>. Nimoy said he regarded the cinematographer as a fellow artist, and that it was important for them to agree on "a certain look" that Peterman was committed to delivering. Nimoy had seen Peterman's work and felt it was more nuanced than simply lighting a scene and capturing an image.

The film's opening scenes aboard the starship "Saratoga" were the first to be shot; principal photography commenced on February 24, 1986. The set was a redress of the science vessel "Grissom"s bridge from "The Search for Spock", in turn a redress of the "Enterprise" bridge created for "The Motion Picture". The scenes were filmed first to allow time for the set to be revamped as the bridge of the new "Enterprise"-A at the end of filming.

As with previous "Star Trek" films, existing props and footage were reused where possible to save money, though "The Voyage Home" required less of this than previous films. The Earth Spacedock interiors and control booth sets were reused from "The Search for Spock", although the computer monitors in these scenes featured new graphics—the old reels had deteriorated in storage. Stock footage of the destruction of the "Enterprise" and the Bird-of-Prey's movement through space were reused. While the Bird-of-Prey bridge was a completely new design, other parts of the craft's interior were also redresses; the computer room was a modification of the reactor room where Spock died in "The Wrath of Khan". After all other Bird-of-Prey bridge scenes were completed, the entire set was painted white for one shot that transitioned into a <a href="dream%20sequence">dream sequence</a> during the time travel.

"The Voyage Home" was the first "Star Trek" film to extensively film on location—only one day was spent doing so in "The Search for Spock". Much of the production was filmed in and around San Francisco during ten days of shooting. The production wanted to film scenes that were readily identifiable as the city. The use of extensive location shooting caused logistical problems; a scene in which Kirk is nearly run over by an irate cab driver required 12–15 cars to be repositioned if the shot was incorrect, taking a half-hour to reshoot. Other scenes were filmed in the city but used sets rather than real locations, such as an Italian restaurant where Taylor and Kirk eat. In the film, the Bird-of-Prey lands cloaked in <a href="Golden%20Gate%20Park">Golden Gate Park</a>, surprising trashmen who flee the scene in their truck. The production had planned to film in the real park, where they had filmed scenes for "The Wrath of Khan", but heavy rains before the day of shooting prevented it—the garbage truck would have become bogged down in the mud. <a href="Will%20Rogers%20State%20Historic%20Park">Will Rogers Park</a> in western Los Angeles was used instead.

When Kirk and Spock are traveling on a public bus, they encounter a punk rocker blaring his music on a boom box, to the discomfort of everyone around him. Spock takes matters into his own hands and performs a <a href="Vulcan%20nerve%20pinch">Vulcan nerve pinch</a>. Part of the inspiration for the scene came from Nimoy's personal experiences with a similar character on the streets of New York; "[I was struck] by the arrogance of it, the aggressiveness of it, and I thought if I was Spock I'd pinch his brains out!" On learning about the scene, <a href="Kirk%20Thatcher">Kirk Thatcher</a>, an associate producer on the film, convinced Nimoy to let him play the role; Thatcher shaved his hair into a mohawk and bought clothes to complete the part. Credited as "punk on bus", Thatcher (along with sound designer <a href="Mark%20Mangini">Mark Mangini</a>) also wrote and recorded "I Hate You", the song in the scene, and it was his idea to have the punk—rendered unconscious by the pinch—hit the stereo and turn it off with his face.
Much of the Cetacean Institute, Taylor's workplace, was created by using the real-life <a href="Monterey%20Bay%20Aquarium">Monterey Bay Aquarium</a>. A holding tank for the whales was added via special effects to the Aquarium's exterior. For close-ups of the characters as they watched the whales in the tank, the Aquarium's walls and railings were measured and replicated for a set on the Paramount parking lot. One scene takes place by a large glass through which observers view the whales—and Spock's initiation of a <a href="Vulcan%20%28Star%20Trek%29%23Mind%20melds">mind meld</a>—underwater. Footage of the actors shot in front of them as they reacted to a brick wall in the Aquarium was combined with shots taken from their rear as they stood in front of a large blue screen at ILM to produce this scene. The footage of Spock's melding with the whales was shot weeks later in a large water tank used to train astronauts for weightlessness.

In the film, Uhura and Chekov visit the <a href="aircraft%20carrier">aircraft carrier</a> <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28CVN-65%29">USS "Enterprise"</a>. The real "Enterprise", out at sea at the time, was unavailable for filming, so the non-nuclear-powered carrier <a href="USS%20Ranger%20%28CV-61%29">USS "Ranger" (CV-61)</a> was used. <a href="Oakland%20International%20Airport">Oakland International Airport</a> was used for the foreground element of <a href="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> Headquarters. Scenes in the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Bay">San Francisco Bay</a> were shot at a tank on Paramount's backlot.

The scene in which Uhura and Chekov question passersby about the location of nuclear vessels was filmed with a hidden camera. However, the people with whom Koenig and Nichols speak were extras hired off the street for that day's shooting and, despite legends to the contrary, knew they were being filmed. In an interview with "StarTrek.com", <a href="Layla%20Sarakalo">Layla Sarakalo</a>, the extra who said, "I don't know if I know the answer to that... I think it's across the bay, in <a href="Alameda%2C%20California">Alameda</a>," stated that after her car was impounded because she refused to move it for the filming, she approached the assistant director about appearing with the other extras, hoping to be paid enough to get her car out of impoundment. She had been told to act naturally, and so she answered them and the filmmakers kept her response in the film, though she had to be inducted into the Screen Actors Guild in order for her lines to be kept.
Vulcan and the Bird-of-Prey exterior was created with a combination of matte paintings and a soundstage. Nimoy had searched for a suitable location for the scene of the "Enterprise" crew's preparations to return to Earth, but various locations did not work, so the scene was instead filmed on a Paramount backlot. The production had to mask the fact that production buildings were away. A wide-angle shot of Spock on the edge of a cliff overlooking the scene was filmed at <a href="Vasquez%20Rocks">Vasquez Rocks</a>, a park north of Los Angeles. The Federation council chamber was a large set filled with representatives from many alien races. Production manager <a href="Jack%20T.%20Collis">Jack T. Collis</a> economized by building the set with only one end; reverse angle shots used the same piece of wall. The positions of the Federation President's podium and the actors on the seats were switched for each shot. Since "The Voyage Home" was the first "Star Trek" film to show the operations at Starfleet Command, Bennett and Nimoy visited NASA's <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a> to learn how a real deep space command center might look and operate. Among the resulting set's features was a large central desk with video monitors that the production team nicknamed "the pool table"; the prop later became a fixture in USS "Enterprise"-D's engine room on the television series "Star Trek: The Next Generation".

Nimoy approached ILM early in development and helped create storyboards for the optical effects sequences. Many shots used <a href="Matte%20%28filmmaking%29">matte paintings</a> to extend backgrounds and create <a href="establishing%20shot">establishing shot</a>s without the cost of building a set. Matte supervisor Chris Evans attempted to create paintings that felt less contrived and more real—while the natural instinct of filmmaking is to place important elements in an orderly fashion, Evans said that photographers would "shoot things that [...] are odd in some way" and end up with results that look natural instead. The task of establishing the location and atmosphere at Starfleet Headquarters fell to the matte department, who had to make it feel like a bustling futuristic version of San Francisco. The matte personnel and Ralph McQuarrie provided design input. The designers decided to make actors in the foreground more prominent, and filmed them on a large area of smooth concrete runway at the Oakland Airport. Elements like a shuttlecraft that thirty extras appeared to interact with were also mattes blended to appear as if they were sitting by the actors. Ultimately the artists were not satisfied with how the shot turned out; matte photography supervisor <a href="Craig%20Barron">Craig Barron</a> believed that there were too many elements in the scene.

The scenes of the Bird-of-Prey on Vulcan were combinations of live-action footage—actors on a set in the Paramount parking lot that was covered with clay and used backdrops—and matte paintings for the ship itself and harsh background terrain. The scene of the ship's departure from Vulcan for Earth was more difficult to accomplish; the camera pans behind live-action characters to follow the ship as it leaves the atmosphere, and other items like flaming pillars and a flaring sun had to be integrated into the shot. Rather than try to match and combine camera pans of each element, each component was shot with a static camera and the pan was added to the resulting composite by a motion control camera. The sun (a light bulb focused by a convex lens) was shot in different passes to create realistic light effects on the Bird-of-Prey without having the light bleed around other elements in the shot.

The script called for the probe to vaporize the Earth's oceans, generating heavy cloud cover. While effects cinematographer Don Dow wanted to go to sea and record plumes of water created by exploding <a href="detonating%20cord">detonating cord</a>s in the water, the team decided to create the probe's climatic effect in another way after a government fishing agency voiced concerns for the welfare of marine life in the area. The team used a combination of baking soda and <a href="cloud%20tank">cloud tank</a> effects; the swirling mist created by the water-filled tank was shot on black velvet, and color and dynamic swirls were added by injecting paint into the tank. These shots were composited onto a painting of the Earth along with overlaid lightning effects, created by double-exposing lights as they moved across the screen.

The Bird-of-Prey's travel through time was one of the most difficult effects sequences of the film. While ILM was experienced in creating the streaking warp effect they used for previous films, the sequence required the camera to trail a sustained warp effect as the Bird-of-Prey rounded the sun. Matching the effect to the model was accomplished through trial-and-error guesswork. The team did not have the time to wait for the animation department to create the sun for this shot. Assistant cameraman Pete Kozachic devised a way of creating the sun on-stage. He placed two sheets of textured plexiglass next to each other and backlit them with a powerful yellow light. The rig was rotated on a circular track and the sheet in front created a <a href="moire%20pattern">moire pattern</a> as its position shifted. Animator <a href="John%20Knoll">John Knoll</a> added solar flare effects to complete the look; Dow recalled that the effect came close to matching footage of the sun taken by the <a href="Jet%20Propulsion%20Laboratory">Jet Propulsion Laboratory</a>.

Traveling through time, Kirk and crew experience what author Jody Duncan Shay termed a "dreamlike state". The script's only direction for the effect was "now [they] go through time"; Nimoy and McQuarrie envisioned Kirk's dream as a montage of bizarre images. The filmmakers decided early on that part of the dream sequence would use computer-generated animation to give it an unreal quality divorced from the rest of the film. ILM worked from McQuarrie's storyboards and created a rough mock-up or <a href="Storyboard%23Animatics">animatic</a> to show Nimoy and hone the direction of the sequence. For the very beginning of the dream, the inside of the Bird-of-Prey bridge was painted stark white. Part of the final sequence involved morphing the heads of the "Enterprise" crew into one another; ILM digitized the cast members' heads using a 3-D scanning technology developed by <a href="Cyberware%20%28company%29">Cyberware</a> and used the resulting data for the computer models. Because each head model had the same number of key points of reference, transforming one character into another was simple; more difficult, the animators recalled, was ensuring that the transformation looked "pleasing" and not "grotesque". The resulting thirty seconds of footage took weeks to render; the department used every spare computer they could find to help in the processing chores. ILM's stage, optical, and matte departments collaborated to complete other shots for the dream sequence. The shot of a man's fall to Earth was created by filming a small puppet on bluescreen. Shots of liquid nitrogen composited behind the puppet gave the impression of smoke. The background plate of the planet was a large matte that allowed the camera to zoom in very close. The final shot of marshy terrain was practical and required no effects.

The filmmakers knew from the beginning of production that the whales were their biggest effects concern; Dow recalled that they were prepared to change to another animal in case creating the whales proved too difficult. When <a href="Humphrey%20the%20Whale">Humphrey the Whale</a> wandered into the San Francisco Bay, Dow and his camera crew attempted to gather usable footage of the humpback but failed to do so. Other footage of real humpbacks either did not exist on 35 mm film or would have been difficult to match to specific actions required by the script. Compositing miniatures shot against bluescreen on top of water backgrounds would not have provided realistic play of light. Creating full-size mechanical whales on tracks would severely limit the types of angles and shots. To solve the whale problem, Rodis hired <a href="robotics">robotics</a> expert <a href="Walt%20Conti">Walt Conti</a>. While Conti was not experienced in film, Rodis believed his background in engineering and design made him well-equipped for Rodis' planned solution: the creation of independent and self-contained miniature whale models.

After watching footage of whale movement, Conti determined that the models could be simplified by making the front of the whale entirely rigid, relying on the tail and fins for movement. Conti showed footage of the operation of a prototype to Paramount executives, who according to Conti, ""loved" it... It really knocked them out." With Paramount's approval, ILM hired marine author, conservationist and illustrator Pieter Folkens to sculpt a realistic whale exterior. ILM decided on a finished model size of —the size prevented delicate components like the tail from buckling under stress—and fitted it with mechanics and radio equipment required for control and operation. To prevent water from ruining the whale's electronics, the modelmakers sealed every individual mechanical component rather than attempting to waterproof the entire whale. Balloons and lead weights were added to achieve the proper balance and buoyancy. The finished models were put in the swimming pool of <a href="Jun%C3%ADpero%20Serra%20High%20School%20%28San%20Mateo%2C%20California%29">Serra High School</a> in San Mateo, California, for two weeks of shooting; the operation of the whales required four handlers and divers with video cameras to help set up the shots. Accurately controlling the whales was difficult because of the murky water—ILM added <a href="diatomaceous%20earth">diatomaceous earth</a> to the water to match realistic ocean visibility. For a few shots, such as the whales' breaching the water towards the end of the film, the creatures were represented by life-size animatronics shot at Paramount.

Models of the starship <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701%29">USS "Enterprise"</a> were destroyed in the previous film partly because visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston wanted to build a "more state-of-the-art ship for the next film", but the filmmakers made the less costly decision to have the crew return to serve on the duplicate <a href="USS%20Enterprise%20%28NCC-1701-A%29">USS "Enterprise" A</a>, and six weeks were spent repairing and repainting the old model. A travel pod from "" was also reused for the ending, although the interior set had to be rebuilt. Graphic designer <a href="Michael%20Okuda">Michael Okuda</a> designed smooth controls with backlit displays for the Federation. Dubbed "<a href="LCARS">Okudagrams</a>", the system was also used for displays on the Klingon ship, though the buttons were larger.

<a href="James%20Horner">James Horner</a>, composer for "The Wrath of Khan" and "The Search for Spock", declined to return for "The Voyage Home". Nimoy turned to his friend <a href="Leonard%20Rosenman">Leonard Rosenman</a>, who had written the music to "<a href="Fantastic%20Voyage">Fantastic Voyage</a>", <a href="Ralph%20Bakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a>'s "<a href="The%20Lord%20of%20the%20Rings%20%281978%20film%29">The Lord of the Rings</a>", and two "<a href="Planet%20of%20the%20Apes%20%281968%20film%29">Planet of the Apes</a>" sequels. Rosenman wrote an arrangement of <a href="Alexander%20Courage">Alexander Courage</a>'s "Star Trek" television theme as the title music for "The Voyage Home", but Nimoy requested an original composition. Music critic Jeff Bond writes, "The final result was one of the most unusual "Star Trek" movie themes," consisting of a six-note theme and variations set against a repetitious four-note brass motif; the theme's bridge borrows content from Rosenman's "Frodo March" for "The Lord of the Rings". The melody is played in the beginning of the film on Vulcan and the scenes of Taylor's search for Kirk to help find her whales.

The Earth-based setting of the filming gave Rosenman leeway to write a variety of music in different styles. Nimoy intended the crew's introduction to the streets of San Francisco to be accompanied by something reminiscent of <a href="George%20Gershwin">George Gershwin</a>, but Rosenman changed the director's mind, and the scene was scored with a contemporary <a href="jazz%20fusion">jazz fusion</a> piece by <a href="Yellowjackets">Yellowjackets</a>. When Chekov flees detention aboard the aircraft carrier, Rosenman wrote a bright cue that incorporates classical Russian compositions. The music for the escape from the hospital was done in a baroque style. More familiar Rosenman compositions include the action music for the face off between the Bird-of-Prey and a whaling ship in open water, and the atmospheric music (reminiscent of the composer's work in "Fantastic Voyage") during the probe's communication. After the probe leaves, a <a href="Antonio%20Vivaldi">Vivaldiesque</a> "whale fugue" begins. The first sighting of the "Enterprise"-A uses the Alexander Courage theme before the end titles.

Mark Mangini served as "The Voyage Home"s sound designer. He described it as different from working on many other films because Nimoy appreciated the role of sound effects and made sure that they were prominent in the film. Since many sounds familiar to "Star Trek" had been established—the Bird-of-Prey's cloaking device, the transporter beam, "et al."—Mangini focused on making only small changes to them. The most important sounds were those of the whales and the probe. Mangini's brother lived near biologist <a href="Roger%20Payne">Roger Payne</a>, who had recordings of whale song. Mangini went through the tapes and chose sounds that could be mixed to suggest conversation and language. The probe's screeching calls were the whale song in distorted form. The humpback's communication with the probe at the climax of the film contained no dramatic music, meaning that Mangini's sounds had to stand alone. He recalled that he had difficulty with envisioning how the scene would unfold, leading Bennett to perform a <a href="Puppetry">puppet show</a> to explain. Nimoy and the other producers were unhappy with Mangini's attempts to create the probe's droning operating noise; after more than a dozen attempts, the sound designer finally asked Nimoy what he thought the probe should sound like. Mangini recorded Nimoy's guttural "wub-wub-wub" response, distorted it with "just the tiniest bit of dressing", and used it as the final sound.

The punk music during the bus scene was written by Thatcher after he learned that the audio for the scene would be by "<a href="Duran%20Duran">Duran Duran</a>, or whoever" and not "raw" and authentic punk. Thatcher collaborated with Mangini and two sound editors who were in punk bands to create their own music. They decided that punk distilled down to the sentiment of "I hate you", and wrote a song centered on the theme. Recording in the sound studio as originally planned produced too clean a sound, so they moved to the outside hallway and recorded the song in one take using cheap microphones to create a distorted sound. The song was also used in Paramount's "<a href="Back%20to%20the%20Beach">Back to the Beach</a>".

"The Voyage Home" opened theatrically in North America on <a href="Thanksgiving">Thanksgiving</a> weekend, November 26, 1986. Since "Star Trek" had traditionally performed poorly internationally, the producers created a special trailer for foreign markets that de-emphasized the "Star Trek" part of the title, as well as retelling the events of "The Wrath of Khan" and "The Search for Spock". Winter recalled that the marketing did not seem to make a difference. "The Voyage Home" was the first "Star Trek" film shown in the Soviet Union, screened by the <a href="World%20Wide%20Fund%20for%20Nature">World Wildlife Fund</a> on June 26, 1987, in Moscow to celebrate a ban on whaling. Attending the screening with Nimoy, Bennett was amazed the film proved as entertaining to the Russians as it did with American audiences; he said "the single most rewarding moment of my "Star Trek" life" was when the Moscow audience applauded at McCoy's line, "The bureaucratic mentality is the only constant in the universe. We'll get a freighter." Bennett believed it was a clear "messenger of what was to come".

<a href="Vonda%20N.%20McIntyre">Vonda N. McIntyre</a> wrote a <a href="novelization">novelization</a> that was released at the same time as the film. It was the biggest tie-in novel published by <a href="Pocket%20Books">Pocket Books</a>, and spent eight weeks on "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" bestseller list, peaking at #3. <a href="MCA%20Records">MCA Records</a> released the film's soundtrack November 26, 1986.

In its first week, "The Voyage Home" ended "<a href="Crocodile%20Dundee">Crocodile Dundee</a>"s 8-week reign of the American box office. The "Star Trek" film made $39.6 million in its first five days of release, exceeding "The Search for Spock"s opening by $14 million. Ultimately, the film grossed a global total of $133,000,000 against its $21 million cost ($1 million under budget). In six weeks, "The Voyage Home" sold $81.3 million in tickets, more than the franchise's second or third film, and almost as much as "Star Trek: The Motion Picture". The film was a major commercial success for Paramount, which released five of the top ten films of the year, and garnered 22 percent of all money taken in at American theaters. Much of the credit for Paramount's success was given to chairman <a href="Frank%20Mancuso%2C%20Sr.">Frank Mancuso, Sr.</a>, who moved "The Voyage Home"s release from Christmas to Thanksgiving after research showed that the film might draw filmgoers away from "The Golden Child".

Despite grossing $6,000,000 less than "Star Trek: The Motion Picture", "The Voyage Home" was the most profitable of the series, grossing $133,000,000 against a $21,000,000 budget.

"The Voyage Home" received mostly positive reviews—Nimoy called it the most well-received of all "Star Trek" films made at that point—and it appealed to general audiences in addition to franchise fans. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A+" on an A+ to F scale.

The movie was a "loose, jovial, immensely pleasurable Christmas entertainment" for "<a href="The%20Washington%20Post">The Washington Post</a>"s <a href="Paul%20Attanasio">Paul Attanasio</a>, and a retrospective <a href="BBC">BBC</a> review called the film "one of the series' strongest episodes and proof that the franchise could weather the absence of space-bound action and the iconic USS "Enterprise", and still be highly enjoyable". Although <a href="Janet%20Maslin">Janet Maslin</a> of "The New York Times" admitted the film's plot was "demented", she wrote that the film "has done a great deal to ensure the series' longevity". <a href="Rushworth%20Kidder">Rushworth Kidder</a> of the "<a href="The%20Christian%20Science%20Monitor">Christian Science Monitor</a>" praised the film for giving audiences a view of their modern life from a different perspective (the <a href="Mooreeffoc">mooreeffoc</a> effect), while simultaneously proving that a film does not need to have murder, violence, innuendo or even a main villain for dramatic storytelling.

The film's "fish out of water" comedy and acting were mostly lauded. The "<a href="The%20Courier-Mail">Courier Mail</a>" wrote that the film was funnier than its predecessors, and while not "flippant", a sense of humor was revealed through the efforts of the cast, writers and director. "<a href="Newsweek">Newsweek</a>"s David Ansen considered "The Voyage Home" not only the most light-hearted of the movie franchise, but the most true in spirit to the original television series. A more negative review was offered by Liam Lacey of "<a href="The%20Globe%20and%20Mail">The Globe and Mail</a>", who wrote that under Nimoy's "choppy" direction there was a lack of comic timing paired with feeble humor.

The special effects were generally well-received; critics for "The Sydney Morning Herald" and "Courier Mail" noted that the effects played a lesser role in the film compared to the characters and dialogue. Similarly, "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" felt the lack of special effects allowed the cast to "prove themselves more capable actors than ever before". Maslin wrote that Nimoy's technical direction left "much to be desired" (pointing out a special effects scene where the Bird-of-Prey does not cast a shadow on the whaling ship as a mistake), but his "unmistakable" sincerity made up for these issues.

"The Voyage Home" garnered 11 nominations at the 14th annual <a href="Saturn%20Award">Saturn Award</a>s, tying "<a href="Aliens%20%28film%29">Aliens</a>" for number of nominations. Nimoy and Shatner were nominated for best actor for their roles, and Catherine Hicks was nominated for best supporting actress. At the <a href="59th%20Academy%20Awards">59th Academy Awards</a>, "The Voyage Home" was nominated for Best Cinematography, Sound (<a href="Terry%20Porter%20%28sound%20engineer%29">Terry Porter</a>, <a href="David%20J.%20Hudson">David J. Hudson</a>, <a href="Mel%20Metcalfe">Mel Metcalfe</a> and <a href="Gene%20Cantamessa">Gene Cantamessa</a>), Sound Effects Editing, and Original Score.

"The Voyage Home" was first released on VHS home media on September 30, 1987. Paramount Home Video spent $20 million marketing the film's release alongside 10 episodes of the original series. The video sold hundreds of thousands of copies in the United States and Canadian markets, and was in the top ten rankings for sales and rentals in December and January 1988. Paramount re-released the film on March 12, 1992, with "<a href="Fatal%20Attraction">Fatal Attraction</a>" as part of a "Director's Series"; these editions had additional commentary and were presented in a widescreen <a href="letterbox">letterbox</a> format to preserve the film's original cinematography. Nimoy was interviewed on the Paramount lots and discussed his acting career as well as his favorable opinion of the widescreen format.

A "bare bones" DVD of the film was released on November 9, 1999. Aside from the film, the contents include the original theatrical trailer and the introduction from the "Director's Series" VHS release. Three and a half years later, a two disc "Collector's Edition" was released with supplemental material and the same video transfer as the original DVD release. Among other special features, it contains a text commentary by <a href="Michael%20Okuda">Michael Okuda</a> and an <a href="audio%20commentary">audio commentary</a> from director <a href="Leonard%20Nimoy">Leonard Nimoy</a> and star <a href="William%20Shatner">William Shatner</a>.

The film was released on <a href="Blu-ray%20Disc">Blu-ray Disc</a> in May 2009 to coincide with the new "<a href="Star%20Trek%20%28film%29">Star Trek</a>" feature, along with the other five films that feature the original crew in "Star Trek: Original Motion Picture Collection". "The Voyage Home" was remastered in <a href="1080p">1080p</a> <a href="High-definition%20video">high-definition</a>.

Kakapo

The kakapo (<a href="M%C4%81ori%20language">Māori</a>: kākāpō) or "night parrot", also called owl parrot ("Strigops habroptilus"), is a species of large, <a href="Flightless%20bird">flightless</a>, <a href="Nocturnal%20animal">nocturnal</a>, ground-dwelling parrot of the super-family <a href="New%20Zealand%20parrot">Strigopoidea</a>, <a href="Endemism%20in%20birds">endemic</a> to <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>.

It has finely blotched yellow-green plumage, a distinct facial disc, a large grey beak, short legs, large feet, and relatively short wings and tail. A combination of traits make it unique among its kind; it is the world's only flightless <a href="parrot">parrot</a>, the heaviest parrot, nocturnal, herbivorous, visibly <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexually dimorphic</a> in body size, has a low <a href="basal%20metabolic%20rate">basal metabolic rate</a> and no male parental care, and is the only parrot to have a <a href="Polygyny%20in%20animals">polygynous</a> <a href="Lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">lek</a> breeding system. It is also possibly one of the world's longest-living birds.

Its anatomy typifies the tendency of bird evolution on oceanic islands, with few predators and abundant food: a generally robust physique at the expense of flight abilities, resulting in reduced wing muscles and a diminished <a href="Keel%20%28bird%29">keel</a> on the <a href="sternum">sternum</a>. Like many other New Zealand bird species, the kakapo was historically important to <a href="M%C4%81ori%20people">Māori</a>, the indigenous people of New Zealand, appearing in many of their traditional legends and folklore; however it was also heavily hunted and used as a resource by Māori, both for its meat as a food source and for its feathers, which were used to make highly valued pieces of clothing. Kakapo were also occasionally kept as pets.

The kakapo is critically endangered; as of February 2019, the total known adult population was <a href="List%20of%20kakapo">living individuals</a>, all of which are named. Because of the <a href="Invasive%20species%20in%20New%20Zealand">introduction of predators</a> such as cats, rats, ferrets, and stoats during European colonisation, the kakapo was almost wiped out. Conservation efforts began in the 1890s, but they were not very successful until the implementation of the Kakapo Recovery Programme in 1995.

Most kakapo are kept on two predator-free islands, <a href="Codfish%20Island">Codfish / Whenua Hou</a> and <a href="Anchor%20Island">Anchor</a>, where they are closely monitored, and <a href="Little%20Barrier%20Island">Little Barrier / Hauturu Island</a> is being trialled as a third home for the species.

The common English name "kakapo" comes from the <a href="M%C4%81ori%20language">Māori</a> "kākāpō", from "kākā" ("parrot") + "pō" ("night"); the name is both singular and plural. "Kākāpō" is increasingly written in New Zealand English with the <a href="Macron%20%28diacritic%29">macrons</a> that indicate long vowels.

The kakapo was originally described by English <a href="Ornithology">ornithologist</a> <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Robert Gray</a> in 1845 and named "Strigops habroptilus". Its generic name "Strigops" is derived from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "strix", genitive "strigos" "owl", and "ops" "face", while its specific <a href="epithet">epithet</a> "habroptilus" comes from "habros" "soft", and "ptilon" "feather".

The bird has so many unusual features that it was initially placed in its own <a href="tribe%20%28biology%29">tribe</a>, Strigopini. Recent <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> studies have confirmed the unique position of this genus as well as the closeness to the <a href="k%C4%81k%C4%81">kākā</a> and the <a href="kea">kea</a>, both belonging to the New Zealand parrot genus "Nestor". Together, they are now considered a separate superfamily within the parrots, Strigopoidea, the most basal of all living parrots.

Within the Strigopoidea, the kakapo is placed in its own <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a>, Strigopidae. The common ancestor of the kakapo and the genus "<a href="Nestor%20%28genus%29">Nestor</a>" became isolated from the remaining parrot species when New Zealand broke off from <a href="Gondwana">Gondwana</a>, around 82 million years ago. Around 30 million years ago, the kakapo diverged from the genus "Nestor".

Earlier ornithologists felt that the kakapo might be related to the <a href="Pezoporus">ground parrots</a> and <a href="night%20parrot">night parrot</a> of Australia due to their similar coloration, but this is contradicted by recent studies; rather, the <a href="crypsis">cryptic</a> colour seems to be <a href="adaptation">adaptation</a> to terrestrial habits that evolved twice <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergently</a>.

The kakapo is a large, rotund parrot; the adult can measure from in length, and weight can vary from at maturity. Males are larger than females. Twenty-eight males were found to average in one study, and 39 males were found to average in another. In the same studies, 28 females were found to average and 18 females were found to average , respectively. Kakapo are the heaviest living species of parrot and on average weigh about more than the largest flying parrot, the <a href="hyacinth%20macaw">hyacinth macaw</a>.

The kakapo cannot fly, having relatively short wings for its size and lacking the <a href="Keel%20%28bird%20anatomy%29">keel</a> on the <a href="sternum">sternum</a> (breastbone), where the flight muscles of other birds attach. It uses its wings for balance and to break its fall when leaping from trees. Unlike many other land birds, the kakapo can accumulate large amounts of body fat.

The upper parts of the kakapo have yellowish moss-green feathers barred or mottled with black or dark brownish grey, blending well with native vegetation. Individuals may have strongly varying degrees of mottling and colour tone and intensity – museum specimens show that some birds had completely yellow colouring. The breast and flank are yellowish-green streaked with yellow. The belly, undertail, neck, and face are predominantly yellowish streaked with pale green and weakly mottled with brownish-grey. Because the feathers do not need the strength and stiffness required for flight, they are exceptionally soft, giving rise to the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "habroptilus". The kakapo has a conspicuous facial disc of fine feathers resembling the face of an owl; thus, early European settlers called it the "owl parrot". The beak is surrounded by delicate feathers which resemble <a href="whiskers">vibrissae</a> or "whiskers"; it is possible kakapo use these to sense the ground as they walk with its head lowered, but there is no evidence for this. The mandible is variable in colour, mostly ivory, with the upper part often bluish-grey. The eyes are dark brown. Kakapo feet are large, scaly, and, as in all parrots, <a href="dactyly">zygodactyl</a> (two toes face forward and two backward). The pronounced claws are particularly useful for climbing. The ends of the tail feathers often become worn from being continually dragged on the ground.

Females are easily distinguished from males as they have a narrower and less domed head, narrower and proportionally longer beak, smaller <a href="Beak%23Cere">cere</a> and <a href="Beak%23Nares">nostrils</a>, more slender and pinkish grey legs and feet, and proportionally longer tail. While their plumage colour is not very different from that of the male, the toning is more subtle, with less yellow and mottling. Nesting females also have a <a href="brood%20patch">brood patch</a> on the bare skin of the belly.

The kakapo's <a href="Altriciality">altricial</a> young are first covered with greyish white down, through which their pink skin can be easily seen. They become fully feathered at approximately 70 days old. Juvenile individuals tend to have duller green coloration, more uniform black barring, and less yellow present in their feathers. They are additionally distinguishable because of their shorter tails, wings, and beaks. At this stage, they have a ring of short feathers surrounding their irises that resemble eyelashes.

Like many other parrots, kakapo have a variety of calls. As well as the "booms" (see <a href="Kakapo%23Media">below</a> for a recording) and "chings" of their mating calls, they will often loudly "skraark".

The kakapo has a well-developed <a href="Olfaction">sense of smell</a>, which complements its nocturnal lifestyle. It can distinguish between odours while foraging, a behaviour reported in only one other parrot species. The kakapo has a large olfactory bulb ratio (longest diameter of the olfactory bulb/longest diameter of the brain) indicating that it does, indeed, have a more developed sense of smell than other parrots. One of the most striking characteristics of the kakapo is its distinct musty-sweet odour. The smell often alerts predators to the presence of kakapo.

As a nocturnal species, the kakapo has adapted its senses to living in darkness. Its optic tectum, nucleus rotundus, and entopallium are smaller in relation to its overall brain size than those of diurnal parrots. Its retina shares some qualities with that of other nocturnal birds but also has some qualities typical of diurnal birds, lending to best function around twilight. These modifications allow the kakapo to have enhanced light sensitivity but with poor visual acuity.

The skeleton of the kakapo differs from other parrots in several features associated with flightlessness. Firstly, it has the smallest relative wing size of any parrot. Its wing feathers are shorter, more rounded, less asymmetrical, and have fewer distal barbules to lock the feathers together. The sternum is small and has a low, <a href="vestigial">vestigial</a> keel and a shortened <a href="spina%20externa">spina externa</a>. As in other flightless birds and some flighted parrots, the <a href="furcula">furcula</a> is not fused but consists of a pair of <a href="clavicles">clavicles</a> lying in contact with each <a href="coracoid">coracoid</a>. As in other flightless birds, the angle between the coracoid and sternum is enlarged. The kakapo has a larger pelvis than other parrots. The proximal bones of the leg and arm are disproportionately long and the distal elements are disproportionately short.

The <a href="pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoral</a> musculature of the kakapo is also modified by flightlessness. The <a href="pectoralis%20major%20muscle">pectoralis</a> and <a href="supracoracoideus">supracoracoideus</a> muscles are greatly reduced. The <a href="propatagialis%20tendo%20longus">propatagialis tendo longus</a> has no distinct muscle belly. The <a href="sternocoracoideus">sternocoracoideus</a> is tendinous. There is an extensive <a href="cucularis%20capitis%20clavicularis">cucularis capitis clavicularis</a> muscle that is associated with the large crop.

Because kakapo passed through a genetic bottleneck, in which the world population was reduced to 49 birds, they are extremely inbred and have low genetic diversity. This manifests in lower disease resistance and fertility problems: 40% of kakapo eggs are infertile. Beginning in 2015, the Kākāpō 125 project aimed to sequence the <a href="genome">genome</a> of all living kakapo, as well as some museum specimens – the first time an entire species has had its genome sequenced. The project is a collaboration between <a href="Duke%20University">Duke University</a> and the New Zealand Genomics lab in <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>.

Before the arrival of humans, the kakapo was distributed throughout both main islands of New Zealand. Although it may have inhabited Stewart Island before human arrival, it has so far not been found in the extensive fossil collections from there. Kakapo lived in a variety of habitats, including <a href="tussock%20grass">tussocklands</a>, scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited <a href="forest">forest</a>s dominated by <a href="Podocarpaceae">podocarps</a> (<a href="Dacrydium%20cupressinum">rimu</a>, <a href="Prumnopitys%20taxifolia">matai</a>, <a href="Dacrycarpus%20dacrydioides">kahikatea</a>, <a href="Podocarpus%20totara">totara</a>), <a href="Nothofagus">beeches</a>, <a href="tawa%20%28tree%29">tawa</a>, and <a href="Metrosideros%20umbellata">rata</a>. In <a href="Fiordland">Fiordland</a>, areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger, <a href="Aristotelia%20serrata">wineberry</a>, <a href="bush%20lawyer%20%28plant%29">bush lawyer</a>, <a href="tutu%20%28plant%29">tutu</a>, <a href="hebe%20%28plant%29">hebes</a>, and <a href="coprosma">coprosma</a>s – became known as "kakapo gardens".

The kakapo is considered to be a "habitat generalist". Though they are now confined to islands free of predation, they were once able to live in nearly any climate present on the islands of New Zealand. They survived dry, hot summers on the North Island as well as cold winter temperatures in the sub-alpine areas of Fiordland. Kakapo seem to have preferred broadleaf or <a href="Nothofagus%20solandri%20var.%20cliffortioides">mountain beech</a> and <a href="Podocarpus%20laetus">Hall's tōtara</a> forest with mild winters and high rainfall, but the species was not exclusively forest-dwelling. All kakapo that were transferred to predator-free islands in the last decades have adapted well to any changes in environment and food plants.

It seems that the kakapo – like many of New Zealand's bird species – has <a href="evolution">evolved</a> to occupy an <a href="ecological%20niche">ecological niche</a> normally filled by various species of mammal (the only non-marine mammals native to New Zealand are ).

The kakapo is primarily nocturnal; it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night.

Though the kakapo cannot fly, it is an excellent climber, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also "parachute" – descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres at an angle of less than 45 degrees. With only 3.3% of its mass made up of pectoral muscle, it is no surprise that the kakapo cannot use its wings to lift its heavy body off the ground. Because of its flightlessness, it has very low metabolic demands in comparison to flighted birds. It is able to survive easily on very little or on very low quality food sources. Unlike most other bird species, the kakapo is entirely herbivorous, feeding on fruits, seeds, leaves, stems, and rhizomes. When foraging, kakapo tend to leave crescent-shaped wads of fiber in the vegetation behind them, called "browse signs".

Having lost the ability to fly, it has developed strong legs. <a href="Animal%20locomotion">Locomotion</a> is often by way of a rapid "jog-like" gait by which it can move several kilometres. A female has been observed making two return trips each night during nesting from her nest to a food source up to away and the male may walk from its home range to a mating arena up to away during the mating season (October–January).
Young birds indulge in play fighting, and one bird will often lock the neck of another under its chin. The kakapo is curious by nature and has been known to interact with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kakapo, which have distinct personalities. While they are curious toward humans, kakapo are not social birds.

The kakapo was a very successful species in pre-human New Zealand, and was well adapted to avoid the birds of prey which were their only predators. As well as the <a href="New%20Zealand%20falcon">New Zealand falcon</a>, there were two other birds of prey in pre-human New Zealand: <a href="Haast%27s%20eagle">Haast's eagle</a> and <a href="Eyles%27%20harrier">Eyles' harrier</a>. All these <a href="Bird%20of%20prey">raptors</a> soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid them the kakapo evolved camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. When a kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the vegetation its plumage resembles. Kakapo were not entirely safe at night, when the <a href="laughing%20owl">laughing owl</a> was active, and it is apparent from owl nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that kakapo were among their prey.

Kakapo defensive adaptations were no use, however, against the mammalian predators introduced to New Zealand by humans. Birds hunt very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually hunt by day. Mammalian predators, in contrast to birds, often hunt by night, and rely on their sense of smell and hearing to find prey; a common way for humans to hunt kakapo was by releasing trained dogs. The kakapo's adaptations to avoid avian predation have thus been useless against its new enemies, and the reason for its massive decline since the introduction of dogs, cats and <a href="Mustelidae">mustelids</a> (see "<a href="Kakapo%23Human%20impact">Conservation: Human impact</a>"). 
The kakapo is the only species of flightless parrot in the world, and the only flightless bird that has a <a href="lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">lek</a> breeding system. Males loosely gather in an arena and compete with each other to attract females. Females listen to the males as they display, or "lek". They choose a mate based on the quality of his display; they are not pursued by the males in any overt way. No pair bond is formed; males and females meet only to mate.

During the courting season, males leave their home ranges for hilltops and ridges where they establish their own mating courts. These leks can be up to from a kakapo's usual territory and are an average of apart within the lek arena. Males remain in the region of their court throughout the courting season. At the start of the breeding season, males will fight to try to secure the best courts. They confront each other with raised feathers, spread wings, open beaks, raised claws and loud screeching and growling. Fighting may leave birds with injuries or even kill them. Mating occurs only approximately every five years, with the ripening of the rimu fruit. In mating years, males making "booming" calls for 6–8 hours every night for more than four months.

Each court consists of one or more saucer-shaped depressions or "bowls" dug in the ground by the male, up to deep and long enough to fit the half-metre length of the bird. The kakapo is one of only a handful of birds in the world which actually constructs its leks. Bowls are often created next to rock faces, banks, or tree trunks to help reflect sound: the bowls themselves function as amplifiers to enhance the projection of the males' booming mating calls. Each male's bowls are connected by a network of trails or tracks which may extend along a ridge or in diameter around a hilltop. Males meticulously clear their bowls and tracks of debris. One way researchers check whether bowls are visited at night is to place a few twigs in the bowl; if the male visits overnight, he will pick them up in his beak and toss them away.

To attract females, males make loud, low-frequency (below 100 <a href="Hertz">Hz</a>) booming calls from their bowls by inflating a <a href="thorax">thoracic</a> sac. They start with low grunts, which increase in volume as the sac inflates. After a sequence of about 20 loud booms, the male kakapo emits a high-frequency, metallic "ching" sound. He stands for a short while before again lowering his head, inflating his chest and starting another sequence of booms. The booms can be heard at least away on a still night; wind can carry the sound at least . Males boom for an average of eight hours a night; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard.

Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 40 minutes or more. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female.
The female kakapo lays 1–4 eggs per breeding cycle, with several days between each egg. She nests on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female incubates the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30 days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after <a href="fledge">fledging</a>. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12 weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6 months.

Because the kakapo is long-lived, with an average life expectancy of 60 (plus or minus 20) years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding. Males start booming at about 5 years of age. It was thought that females reached <a href="sexual%20maturity">sexual maturity</a> at 9 years of age, but four five-year-old females have now been recorded reproducing. The kakapo does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast (fruit heavily), providing a plentiful food supply. <a href="Dacrydium%20cupressinum">Rimu</a> mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu-dominant forests, such as those on Whenua Hou, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently.

Another aspect of the kakapo's breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female in good condition produces more male offspring (males have 30%–40% more body weight than females). Females produce offspring biased towards the dispersive sex when competition for resources (such as food) is high and towards the non-dispersive sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the <a href="Trivers%E2%80%93Willard%20hypothesis">Trivers–Willard hypothesis</a>. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species.

The beak of the kakapo is adapted for grinding food finely. For this reason, the kakapo has a very small <a href="gizzard">gizzard</a> compared to other birds of their size. It is entirely <a href="Herbivore">herbivorous</a>, eating native plants, seeds, fruits, pollen and even the sapwood of trees. A study in 1984 identified 25 plant species as kakapo food. It is particularly fond of the fruit of the <a href="Dacrydium%20cupressinum">rimu</a> tree, and will feed on it exclusively during seasons when it is abundant. The kakapo strips out the nutritious parts of the plant out with its beak, leaving a ball of indigestible fibre. These little clumps of plant fibres are a distinctive sign of the presence of the bird. The kakapo is believed to employ bacteria in the fore-gut to ferment and help digest plant matter.

Kakapo diet changes according to the season. The plants eaten most frequently during the year include some species of "<a href="Lycopodium%20ramulosum">Lycopodium ramulosum</a>", "Lycopodium fastigium", "Schizaea fistulosa", "Blechnum minus", "Blechnum procerum", "Cyathodes juniperina", "Dracophyllum longifolium", "Olearia colensoi" and "Thelymitra venosa". Individual plants of the same species are often treated differently. Kakapo leave conspicuous evidence of their feeding activities, over feeding areas that range between and per individual. Kakapo feeding grounds almost always host <a href="Leptospermum%20scoparium">manuka</a> and yellow silver pine ("<a href="Lepidothamnus%20intermedius">Lepidothamnus intermedius</a>") scrubs.

Fossil records indicate that in pre-Polynesian times, the kakapo was New Zealand's third most common bird and it was widespread on all three main islands. However, the kakapo population in New Zealand has declined massively since human settlement of the country, and its conservation status as ranked by the Department of Conservation continues to be "Nationally Critical". Since 1891, conservation efforts have been made to prevent extinction. The most successful scheme has been the Kakapo Recovery Programme; this was implemented in 1995 and continues.

The first factor in the decline of the kakapo was the arrival of humans. <a href="M%C4%81ori%20mythology">Māori folklore</a> suggests that the kakapo was found throughout the country when the <a href="Polynesians">Polynesians</a> first arrived in <a href="Aotearoa">Aotearoa</a> 700 years ago. <a href="Subfossil">Subfossil</a> and <a href="midden">midden</a> deposits show that the bird was present throughout the North and South Island before and during early Māori times. Māori hunted the kakapo for food and for their skins and feathers, which were made into <a href="M%C4%81ori%20traditional%20textiles">cloaks</a>. They used the dried heads as ear ornaments.

Due to its inability to fly, strong scent and habit of freezing when threatened, the kakapo was easy prey for the Māori and their dogs. Its eggs and chicks were also preyed upon by the <a href="Polynesian%20rat">Polynesian rat</a> or kiore, which the Māori brought to New Zealand. Furthermore, the deliberate clearing of vegetation by Māori reduced the habitable range for kakapo. Although the kakapo was extinct in many parts of the islands by the time Europeans arrived, including the <a href="Tararua%20Ranges">Tararua</a> and <a href="Aorangi%20Range">Aorangi Range</a>s, it was locally abundant in parts of New Zealand, such as the central North Island and forested parts of the South Island.

Although kakapo numbers were reduced by Māori settlement, they rapidly declined after European colonisation. Beginning in the 1840s, <a href="P%C4%81keh%C4%81">Pākehā</a> settlers <a href="Deforestation%20in%20New%20Zealand%23European%20settlement">cleared vast tracts of land</a> for farming and grazing, further reducing kakapo habitat. They brought more dogs and other mammalian predators, including domestic cats, black rats and <a href="Stoats%20in%20New%20Zealand">stoats</a>. Europeans knew little of the kakapo until <a href="George%20Robert%20Gray">George Gray</a> of the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a> described it from a skin in 1845. As the Māori had done, early European explorers and their dogs ate kakapo. In the late 19th century, the kakapo became well known as a scientific curiosity, and thousands were captured or killed for zoos, museums and collectors. Most captured specimens died within months. From at least the 1870s, collectors knew the kakapo population was declining; their prime concern was to collect as many as possible before the bird became extinct.

In the 1880s, large numbers of <a href="Mustelidae">mustelids</a> (stoats, ferrets and weasels) were released in New Zealand to reduce rabbit numbers, but they also preyed heavily on many native species including the kakapo. Other browsing animals, such as introduced deer, competed with the kakapo for food, and caused the extinction of some of its preferred plant species. The kakapo was reportedly still present near the head of the <a href="Whanganui%20River">Whanganui River</a> as late as 1894, with one of the last records of a kakapo in the North Island being a single bird caught in the <a href="Kaimanawa%20Range">Kaimanawa Range</a>s by Te Kepa Puawheawhe in 1895.

In 1891, the New Zealand government set aside <a href="Resolution%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Resolution Island</a> in Fiordland as a nature reserve. In 1894, the government appointed <a href="Richard%20Treacy%20Henry">Richard Henry</a> as caretaker. A keen naturalist, Henry was aware that native birds were declining, and began catching and moving kakapo and <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a> from the mainland to the predator-free Resolution Island. In six years, he moved more than 200 kakapo to Resolution Island. By 1900, however, <a href="stoat">stoat</a>s had swum to Resolution Island and colonised it; they wiped out the nascent kakapo population within 6 years.

In 1903, three kakapo were moved from Resolution Island to the nature reserve of <a href="Little%20Barrier%20Island">Little Barrier Island</a> (Hauturu-o-Toi) north-east of <a href="Auckland">Auckland</a>, but <a href="feral%20cats">feral cats</a> were present and the kakapo were never seen again. In 1912, three kakapo were moved to another reserve, <a href="Kapiti%20Island">Kapiti Island</a>, north-west of <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>. One of them survived until at least 1936, despite the presence of feral cats for part of the intervening period.

By the 1920s, the kakapo was extinct in the <a href="North%20Island">North Island</a> and its range and numbers in the <a href="South%20Island">South Island</a> were declining. One of its last refuges was rugged Fiordland. There, during the 1930s, it was often seen or heard, and occasionally eaten, by hunters or roadworkers. By the 1940s, reports of kakapo were becoming scarce.

In the 1950s, the <a href="New%20Zealand%20Wildlife%20Service">New Zealand Wildlife Service</a> was established and began making regular expeditions to search for the kakapo, mostly in Fiordland and what is now the <a href="Kahurangi%20National%20Park">Kahurangi National Park</a> in the northwest of the South Island. Seven Fiordland expeditions between 1951 and 1956 found only a few recent signs. Finally, in 1958 a kakapo was caught and released in the <a href="Milford%20Sound">Milford Sound</a> catchment area in Fiordland. Six more kakapo were captured in 1961; one was released and the other five were transferred to the <a href="aviary">aviaries</a> of the Mount Bruce Bird Reserve near <a href="Masterton">Masterton</a> in the North Island. Within months, four of the birds had died and the fifth died after about four years. In the next 12 years, regular expeditions found few signs of the kakapo, indicating that numbers were continuing to decline. Only one bird was captured in 1967; it died the following year.

By the early 1970s, it was uncertain whether the kakapo was still an extant species. At the end of 1974, scientists located several more male kakapo and made the first scientific observations of kakapo booming. These observations led <a href="Don%20Merton">Don Merton</a> to speculate for the first time that the kakapo had a <a href="Lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">lek</a> breeding system. From 1974 to 1978 a total of 18 kakapo were discovered in Fiordland, but all were males. This raised the possibility that the species would become extinct, because there might be no surviving females. One male bird was captured in the Milford area in 1975, christened "Richard Henry", and transferred to <a href="Maud%20Island">Maud Island</a>. All the birds the Wildlife Service discovered from 1951 to 1976 were in U-shaped <a href="glaciated%20valley">glaciated valley</a>s flanked by almost-vertical cliffs and surrounded by high mountains. Such extreme terrain had slowed colonisation by browsing mammals, leaving islands of virtually unmodified native vegetation. However, even here, stoats were present and by 1976 the kakapo was gone from the valley floors and only a few males survived high on the most inaccessible parts of the cliffs.

Before 1977, no expedition had been to Stewart Island/Rakiura to search for the bird. In 1977, sightings of kakapo were reported on Stewart Island. An expedition to the island found a track and bowl system on its first day; soon after, it located several dozen kakapo. The finding in an 8,000-hectare area of fire-modified <a href="scrubland">scrubland</a> and forest raised hope that the population would include females. The total population was estimated at 100 to 200 birds.

<a href="Mustelid">Mustelid</a>s have never colonised Stewart Island/Rakiura, but feral cats were present. During a survey, it was apparent that cats killed kakapo at a rate of 56% per year. At this rate, the birds could not survive on the island and therefore an intensive cat control was introduced in 1982, after which no cat-killed kakapo were found. However, to ensure the survival of the remaining birds, scientists decided later that this population should be transferred to predator-free islands; this operation was carried out between 1982 and 1997.

In 1989, a Kakapo Recovery plan was developed, and a Kakapo Recovery programme was established in 1995. The New Zealand <a href="Department%20of%20Conservation%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Department of Conservation</a> replaced the Wildlife Service for this task.

The first action of the plan was to relocate all the remaining kakapo to suitable islands for them to breed. None of the New Zealand islands were ideal to establish kakapo without <a href="Island%20restoration">rehabilitation</a> by extensive re-vegetation and the eradication of introduced mammalian predators and competitors. Four islands were finally chosen: <a href="Maud%20Island">Maud</a>, <a href="Little%20Barrier%20Island">Hauturu/Little Barrier</a>, <a href="Codfish%20Island">Codfish</a> and <a href="Mana%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Mana</a>. Sixty-five kakapo (43 males, 22 females) were successfully transferred onto the four islands in five translocations. Some islands had to be rehabilitated several times when feral cats, stoats and <a href="weka">weka</a> kept appearing. Little Barrier Island was eventually viewed as unsuitable due to the rugged landscape, the thick forest and the continued presence of rats, and its birds were evacuated in 1998. Along with Mana Island, it was replaced with two new kakapo sanctuaries: <a href="Chalky%20Island%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Chalky Island (Te Kakahu)</a> and <a href="Anchor%20Island">Anchor Island</a>. The entire kakapo population of Codfish Island was temporarily relocated in 1999 to <a href="Pearl%20Island%20%28New%20Zealand%29">Pearl Island</a> in <a href="Port%20Pegasus">Port Pegasus</a> while rats were being eliminated from Codfish. All kakapo on Pearl and Chalky Islands were moved to Anchor Island in 2005.

A key part of the Recovery Programme is the supplementary feeding of females. Kakapo breed only once every two to five years, when certain plant species, primarily <a href="Dacrydium%20cupressinum">"Dacrydium cupressinum" (rimu)</a>, produce protein-rich fruit and seeds. During breeding years when rimu masts supplementary food is provided to kakapo to increase the likelihood of individuals successfully breeding. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds and walnuts) were supplied "<a href="ad%20libitum">ad libitum</a>" each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 for the first time since 1982, although nesting success was low.

Supplementary feeding affects the <a href="sex%20ratio">sex ratio</a> of kakapo offspring, and can be used to increase the number of female chicks by deliberately manipulating maternal condition. During the winter of 1981, only females lighter than were given supplementary feeding to avoid raising their body condition, and the sex ratio results in 1982 were close to parity, eliminating the male-biased sex ratios in the unrestricted feeding.

Today commercial parrot food is supplied to all individuals of breeding age on Whenua Hou and Anchor. The amount eaten and individual weights are carefully monitored to ensure that optimum body condition is maintained.

Kakapo nests are intensively managed. Before <a href="Polynesian%20rat">Polynesian rat</a>s were removed from Whenua Hou, they were a threat to the survival of young kakapo. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection was intensified after 1995 by using <a href="rat%20trap">traps</a> and poison stations as soon as a nest was detected. A small video camera and <a href="Infrared">infra-red light source</a> would watch the nest continuously, and scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds.

All kakapo islands are now rat-free, but infrared cameras still allow rangers to remotely monitor the behaviour of females and chicks in nests. Data loggers record when mother kakapo come and go, allowing rangers to pick a time to check on the health of chicks, and also indicate how hard females are having to work to find food. Because mother kakapo often struggle to successfully rear multiple chicks, Kakapo Recovery rangers will move chicks between nests as needed.

Eggs are often removed from nests for incubation to reduce the likelihood of accidents, such as lost eggs or crushing. If chicks become ill, aren’t putting on weight, or there are too many chicks in the nest (and no available nest to move them to) they will be hand-reared by the Kakapo Recovery team. In the 2019 season, eggs were also removed from nests to encourage females to re-nest. By hand-raising the first group of chicks in captivity and encouraging females to lay more eggs, the Kakapo Recovery Team hopes that overall chick production will be increased.

To monitor the kakapo population continuously, each bird is equipped with a <a href="radio%20transmitter">radio transmitter</a>. <a href="List%20of%20kakapo">Every known kakapo, barring some young chicks, has been given a name</a> by Kakapo Recovery Programme officials, and detailed data is gathered about every individual. GPS transmitters are also being trialled to provide more detailed data about the movement of individual birds and their habitat use. The signals also provide behavioural data, letting rangers gather information about mating and nesting remotely. Every individual kakapo receives an annual health check and has their transmitter replaced.

The Kakapo Recovery programme has been successful, with the numbers of kakapo increasing steadily. Adult survival rate and productivity have both improved significantly since the programme's inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self-sustaining, unmanaged population of kakapo as a functional component of the <a href="ecosystem">ecosystem</a> in a protected habitat. To help meet this conservation challenge, <a href="Resolution%20Island%2C%20New%20Zealand">Resolution Island</a> (20,860 ha) in Fiordland has been prepared for kakapo re-introduction with ecological restoration including the eradication of stoats. Ultimately, the Kakapo Recovery vision for the species is to restore the "mauri" (Maori for "life-force") of the kakapo by breeding 150 adult females.


The kakapo is associated with a rich tradition of Māori folklore and beliefs. The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or "<a href="Mast%20year">masting</a>" events of particular plant species such as the <a href="Dacrydium%20cupressinum">rimu</a>, which led Māori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future. Used to substantiate this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the <a href="Elaeocarpus%20dentatus">hinau</a> and <a href="Tawa%20%28tree%29">tawa</a> trees (when they were in season) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead; in legend this became the origin of the Māori practice of immersing food in water for the same purpose.

The meat of kakapo made good eating and was considered by Māori to be a delicacy and it was hunted for food when it was still widespread. One source states that its flesh "resembles <a href="Lamb%20and%20mutton">lamb</a> in taste and texture", although European settlers have described the bird as having a "strong and slightly stringent [sic] flavour".

In breeding years, the loud booming calls of the males at their <a href="Lek%20%28mating%20arena%29">mating arenas</a> made it easy for Māori hunting parties to track the kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using <a href="Trapping%20%28Animal%29%23Snares">snares</a>, pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated <a href="Kur%C4%AB">Polynesian dogs</a> which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness, stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier. Cooking was done in a <a href="h%C4%81ngi">hāngi</a> or in gourds of boiling oil. The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the <a href="Ng%C4%81i%20Tahu">Ngāi Tahu</a> tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of <a href="totara">totara</a> tree or in containers constructed from <a href="kelp">kelp</a>. Bundles of kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents. Also taken by the Māori were the bird's eggs, which are described as whitish "but not pure white", and about the same size as a <a href="kerer%C5%AB">kererū</a> egg.

As well as eating the meat of the kakapo, Māori would use kakapo skins with the feathers still attached or individually weave in kakapo feathers with flax fibre to create cloaks and capes. Each one required up to 11,000 feathers to make. Not only were these garments considered very beautiful, they also kept the wearer very warm. They were highly valued, and the few still in existence today are considered "<a href="taonga">taonga</a>" (treasures) – indeed, the old Māori adage "You have a kākāpō cape and you still complain of the cold" was used to describe someone who is never satisfied. Kakapo feathers were also used to decorate the heads of <a href="taiaha">taiaha</a>, but were removed before use in combat.

Despite this, the kakapo was also regarded as an affectionate pet by the Māori. This was corroborated by European settlers in New Zealand in the 19th century, among them <a href="George%20Edward%20Grey">George Edward Grey</a>, who once wrote in a letter to an associate that his pet kakapo's behaviour towards him and his friends was "more like that of a dog than a bird".

The conservation of the kakapo has made the species well known. Many books and documentaries detailing the plight of the kakapo have been produced in recent years, one of the earliest being "Two in the Bush", made by <a href="Gerald%20Durrell">Gerald Durrell</a> for the <a href="BBC">BBC</a> in 1962. A feature-length documentary, "The Unnatural History of the Kakapo" won two major awards at the <a href="Reel%20Earth%20Environmental%20Film%20Festival">Reel Earth Environmental Film Festival</a>. Two of the most significant documentaries, both made by <a href="NHNZ">NHNZ</a>, are "Kakapo – Night Parrot" (1982) and "To Save the Kakapo" (1997). The BBC's Natural History Unit also featured the kakapo, including a sequence with <a href="David%20Attenborough">Sir David Attenborough</a> in "<a href="The%20Life%20of%20Birds">The Life of Birds</a>". It was also one of the endangered animals <a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a> and <a href="Mark%20Carwardine">Mark Carwardine</a> set out to find for the radio series and book "<a href="Last%20Chance%20to%20See">Last Chance to See</a>". An updated version of the series has been produced for BBC TV, in which <a href="Stephen%20Fry">Stephen Fry</a> and Carwardine revisit the animals to see how they are getting on almost 20 years later, and in January 2009, they spent time filming the kakapo on Codfish Island. Footage of a kakapo named <a href="Sirocco%20%28parrot%29">Sirocco</a> attempting to mate with Carwardine's head was viewed by millions worldwide, leading to Sirocco becoming "spokes-bird" for New Zealand wildlife conservation in 2010. The kakapo was featured in the episode "Strange Islands" of the documentary series "<a href="South%20Pacific%20%28TV%20series%29">South Pacific</a>", originally aired on 13 June 2009, in the episode "Worlds Apart" of the series "<a href="The%20Living%20Planet">The Living Planet</a>", and in episode 3 of the BBC's "New Zealand Earth's Mythical Islands".

John C. Breckinridge

John Cabell Breckinridge (January 16, 1821 – May 17, 1875) was an American lawyer, politician, and soldier. He represented <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> in both houses of <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> and became the 14th and youngest-ever <a href="vice%20president%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice president of the United States</a>, serving from 1857 to 1861. He was a member of the Democratic party. He served in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> during the outbreak of the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, but was expelled after joining the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate Army</a>. He was appointed <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Confederate secretary of war</a> in 1865.

Breckinridge was born near <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington</a>, Kentucky to a <a href="Breckinridge%20family">prominent local family</a>. After non-combat service during the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>, he was elected as a <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democrat</a> to the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a> in 1849, where he took a <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> position against interference with <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>. Elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1850, he allied with <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> in support of the <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a>. After <a href="United%20States%20congressional%20apportionment">reapportionment</a> in 1854 made his re-election unlikely, he declined to run for another term. He was nominated for vice-president at the <a href="1856%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1856 Democratic National Convention</a> to balance a ticket headed by <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a>. The Democrats won the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">election</a>, but Breckinridge had little influence with Buchanan and, as presiding officer of the Senate, could not express his opinions in debates. He joined Buchanan in supporting the pro-slavery <a href="Lecompton%20Constitution">Lecompton Constitution</a> for Kansas, which led to a split in the Democratic Party. In 1859, he was elected to succeed Senator <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a> at the end of Crittenden's term in 1861.

After <a href="Southern%20Democrats">Southern Democrats</a> walked out of the <a href="1860%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1860 Democratic National Convention</a>, the party's northern and southern factions held rival conventions in <a href="Baltimore">Baltimore</a> that nominated Douglas and Breckinridge, respectively, for president. A third party, the <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Union Party</a>, nominated <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>. These three men split the Southern vote, while more anti-slavery <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> candidate <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> won all but three electoral votes in the North, allowing him to win the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201860">election</a>. Breckinridge carried most of the Southern states. Taking his seat in the Senate, Breckinridge urged compromise to preserve the Union. Unionists were in control of the state legislature, and gained more support when <a href="Kentucky%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War%23Neutrality%20violated">Confederate forces moved into Kentucky</a>.

Breckinridge fled behind Confederate lines. He was commissioned a <a href="brigadier%20general%20%28CSA%29">brigadier general</a> and then expelled from the Senate. Following the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> in 1862, he was promoted to <a href="major%20general%20%28CSA%29">major general</a>, and in October he was assigned to the <a href="Army%20of%20Mississippi">Army of Mississippi</a> under <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a>. After Bragg charged that Breckinridge's drunkenness had contributed to defeats at <a href="Battle%20of%20Stone%20River">Stone River</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Missionary%20Ridge">Missionary Ridge</a>, and after Breckinridge joined many other high-ranking officers in criticizing Bragg, he was transferred to the <a href="Department%20of%20East%20Tennessee%20and%20West%20Virginia">Trans-Allegheny Department</a>, where he won his most significant victory in the 1864 <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Market">Battle of New Market</a>. After participating in <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a>'s <a href="Valley%20Campaigns%20of%201864">campaigns in the Shenandoah Valley</a>, Breckinridge was charged with defending supplies in <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> and <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>. In February 1865, <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate President</a> <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> appointed him Secretary of War. Concluding that the war was hopeless, he urged Davis to arrange a national surrender. After the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Petersburg">fall</a> of <a href="Richmond%2C%20Virginia">Richmond</a>, Breckinridge ensured the preservation of Confederate records. He then escaped the country and lived abroad for more than three years. When President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> extended <a href="pardon">amnesty</a> to all former Confederates in 1868, Breckinridge returned to Kentucky, but resisted all encouragement to resume his political career. War injuries sapped his health, and he died in 1875. Breckinridge is regarded as an effective military commander. Though well-liked in Kentucky, he was reviled by many in the North as a traitor.

John Cabell Breckinridge was born at Thorn Hill, his family's estate near <a href="Lexington%2C%20Kentucky">Lexington, Kentucky</a> on January 16, 1821. The fourth of six children born to <a href="Cabell%20Breckinridge">Joseph "Cabell" Breckinridge</a> and Mary Clay (Smith) Breckinridge, he was their only son. His mother was the daughter of <a href="Samuel%20Stanhope%20Smith">Samuel Stanhope Smith</a>, who founded <a href="Hampden%E2%80%93Sydney%20College">Hampden–Sydney College</a> in 1775, and granddaughter of <a href="John%20Witherspoon">John Witherspoon</a>, a signer of the <a href="United%20States%20Declaration%20of%20Independence">Declaration of Independence</a>. Having previously served as Speaker of the <a href="Kentucky%20House%20of%20Representatives">Kentucky House of Representatives</a>, Breckinridge's father had been appointed <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20of%20Kentucky">Kentucky's Secretary of State</a> just prior to his son's birth. In February, one month after Breckinridge's birth, the family moved with <a href="Governor%20of%20Kentucky">Governor</a> <a href="John%20Adair">John Adair</a> to the <a href="Old%20Governor%27s%20Mansion%20%28Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky%29">Governor's Mansion</a> in <a href="Frankfort%2C%20Kentucky">Frankfort</a>, so that his father could better attend to his duties as Secretary of State.

In August 1823, an illness referred to as "the prevailing fever" struck Frankfort, and Cabell Breckinridge took his children to stay with his mother in Lexington. On his return, both he and his wife fell ill. Cabell Breckinridge died, but she survived. His assets were not enough to pay his debts, and his widow joined the children in Lexington, supported by her mother-in-law. While in Lexington, Breckinridge attended Pisgah Academy in <a href="Woodford%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Woodford County</a>. His grandmother taught him the political philosophies of her late husband, <a href="John%20Breckinridge%20%28U.S.%20Attorney%20General%29">John Breckinridge</a>, who served in the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> and as <a href="United%20States%20Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> under <a href="President%20of%20the%20United%20States">President</a> <a href="Thomas%20Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>. As a state legislator, Breckinridge had introduced the <a href="Kentucky%20and%20Virginia%20Resolutions">Kentucky Resolutions</a> in 1798, which stressed <a href="states%27%20rights">states' rights</a> and endorsed the doctrine of <a href="Nullification%20%28U.S.%20Constitution%29">nullification</a> in response to the <a href="Alien%20and%20Sedition%20Acts">Alien and Sedition Acts</a>.

After an argument between Breckinridge's mother and grandmother in 1832, he, his mother, and his sister Laetitia moved to <a href="Danville%2C%20Kentucky">Danville, Kentucky</a>, to live with his sister Frances and her husband, who was president of <a href="Centre%20College">Centre College</a>. Breckinridge's uncle, William Breckinridge, was also on the faculty there, prompting him to enroll in November 1834. Among his schoolmates were <a href="Beriah%20Magoffin">Beriah Magoffin</a>, <a href="William%20Birney">William Birney</a>, <a href="Theodore%20O%27Hara">Theodore O'Hara</a>, <a href="Thomas%20Leonidas%20Crittenden">Thomas L. Crittenden</a> and <a href="Jeremiah%20Boyle">Jeremiah Boyle</a>. After earning a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Arts">Bachelor of Arts</a> degree in September 1838, he spent the following winter as a "resident graduate" at the College of New Jersey (now <a href="Princeton%20University">Princeton University</a>). Returning to Kentucky in mid-1839, he <a href="reading%20law">read law</a> with Judge <a href="William%20Owsley">William Owsley</a>. In November 1840, he enrolled in the second year of the law course at <a href="Transylvania%20University">Transylvania University</a> in Lexington, where his instructors included two members of the <a href="Kentucky%20Court%20of%20Appeals">Kentucky Court of Appeals</a> – <a href="George%20Robertson%20%28congressman%29">George Robertson</a> and <a href="Thomas%20A.%20Marshall">Thomas A. Marshall</a>. On February 25, 1841, he received a <a href="Bachelor%20of%20Laws">Bachelor of Laws</a> degree and was licensed to practice the next day.

Breckinridge remained in Lexington while deciding where to begin practice, borrowing law books from the library of <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a>, Thomas Crittenden's father. Deciding that Lexington was overcrowded with lawyers, he moved to Frankfort, but was unable to find an office. After being spurned by a love interest, he and former classmate Thomas W. Bullock departed for the <a href="Iowa%20Territory">Iowa Territory</a> on October 10, 1841 seeking better opportunities. Journeying westward, they considered settling on land Breckinridge had inherited in <a href="Jacksonville%2C%20Illinois">Jacksonville, Illinois</a>, but they found the <a href="Bar%20%28law%29">bar</a> stocked with able men like <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a> and <a href="Abraham%20Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. They continued on to <a href="Burlington%2C%20Iowa">Burlington, Iowa</a>, and by the winter of 1842–1843, Breckinridge reported to family members that his firm handled more cases than almost any other in Burlington. Influenced by Bullock and the citizens of Iowa, he identified with the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a>, and by February 1843, he had been named to the Democratic committee of <a href="Des%20Moines%20County%2C%20Iowa">Des Moines County</a>. Most of the Kentucky Breckinridges were <a href="Whig%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Whigs</a>, and when he learned of his nephew's party affiliation, William Breckinridge declared, "I felt as I would have done if I had heard that my daughter had been dishonored."

Breckinridge visited Kentucky in May 1843. His efforts to mediate between his mother and the Breckinridges extended his visit and after he contracted <a href="influenza">influenza</a>, he decided to remain for the summer rather than returning to Iowa's colder climate. While at home, he met Bullock's cousin, <a href="Mary%20Cyrene%20Burch%20Breckinridge">Mary Cyrene Burch</a>, and by September, they were engaged. In October, Breckinridge went to Iowa to close out his business, then returned to Kentucky and formed a law partnership with Samuel Bullock, Thomas's cousin. He married on December 12, 1843, and settled in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Kentucky">Georgetown, Kentucky</a>. The couple had six children – Joseph Cabell (b. 1844), <a href="Clifton%20R.%20Breckinridge">Clifton Rodes</a> (b. 1846; later a <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Congressman</a> from <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a>), Frances (b. 1848), John Milton (b. 1849), John Witherspoon (b. 1850) and <a href="Mary%20Desha">Mary Desha</a> (b. 1854). Gaining confidence in his ability as a lawyer, Breckinridge moved his family back to Lexington in 1845 and formed a partnership with future U.S. Senator <a href="James%20B.%20Beck">James B. Beck</a>.

A supporter of the <a href="Mexican%E2%80%93American%20War">Mexican–American War</a>, Breckinridge sought appointment to the staff of Major General <a href="William%20Orlando%20Butler">William Orlando Butler</a>, a prominent Kentucky Democrat, but Butler could only offer him an unpaid aide position and advised him to decline it. In July 1847, Breckinridge delivered an address at a mass military funeral in Frankfort to honor Kentuckians killed in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Buena%20Vista">Battle of Buena Vista</a>. The oration brought Whig Senator <a href="Henry%20Clay">Henry Clay</a> of Kentucky, whose <a href="Henry%20Clay%20Jr.">son</a> was among the dead, to tears, and inspired <a href="Theodore%20O%27Hara">Theodore O'Hara</a> to write "<a href="Bivouac%20of%20the%20Dead">Bivouac of the Dead</a>".

Breckinridge again applied for a military commission after <a href="William%20Owsley">William Owsley</a>, the Governor of Kentucky, called for two additional regiments on August 31, 1847. Owsley's advisors encouraged the Whig governor to commission at least one Democrat, and Whig Senator <a href="John%20J.%20Crittenden">John J. Crittenden</a> supported Breckinridge's application. On September 6, 1847, Owsley appointed <a href="Manlius%20Valerius%20Thomson">Manlius V. Thomson</a> as colonel, Thomas Crittenden as lieutenant colonel and Breckinridge as <a href="Major%20%28United%20States%29">major</a> of the Third Kentucky Infantry Regiment. The regiment left Kentucky on November 1 and reached <a href="Veracruz%20%28city%29">Vera Cruz</a> by November 21. After a serious epidemic of "La Vomito," or <a href="yellow%20fever">yellow fever</a>, broke out at Vera Cruz, the regiment hurried to <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>. Reports indicate that Breckinridge walked all but two days of the journey, allowing weary soldiers to use his horse. When the Third Kentucky reached Mexico City on December 18, the fighting was almost over; they participated in no combat and remained in the city as an army of occupation until May 30, 1848.

In demand more for his legal expertise than his military training, he was named as assistant counsel for <a href="Gideon%20Johnson%20Pillow">Gideon Johnson Pillow</a> during a court of inquiry initiated against him by <a href="Winfield%20Scott">Winfield Scott</a>. Seeking to derail Scott's presidential ambitions, Pillow and his supporters composed and published letters that lauded Pillow, not Scott, for the American victories at <a href="Battle%20of%20Contreras">Contreras</a> and <a href="Battle%20of%20Churubusco">Churubusco</a>. To hide his involvement, Pillow convinced a subordinate to take credit for the letter he wrote. Breckinridge biographer <a href="William%20C.%20Davis%20%28historian%29">William C. Davis</a> writes that it was "most unlikely" that Breckinridge knew the details of Pillow's intrigue. His role in the proceedings was limited to questioning a few witnesses; records show that Pillow represented himself during the court's proceedings.

Returning to <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> on July 16, the Third Kentucky mustered out on July 21. During their time in Mexico, over 100 members of the 1,000-man regiment had died of illness. Although he saw no combat, Breckinridge's military service proved an asset to his political prospects in Kentucky.

Breckinridge campaigned for Democratic presidential nominee <a href="James%20K.%20Polk">James K. Polk</a> in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201844">1844 election</a>. He decided against running for county clerk of <a href="Scott%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Scott County</a> after his law partner complained that he spent too much time in politics. In 1845, some local Democrats encouraged him to seek the <a href="Kentucky%27s%208th%20congressional%20district">Eighth District</a>'s congressional seat, but he declined, supporting instead <a href="Alexander%20Keith%20Marshall">Alexander Keith Marshall</a>, the party's unsuccessful nominee. As a private citizen, he opposed the <a href="Wilmot%20Proviso">Wilmot Proviso</a> that would have banned slavery in the territory acquired in the war with <a href="Mexico">Mexico</a>. In the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201848">1848 presidential election</a>, he backed the unsuccessful Democratic ticket of <a href="Lewis%20Cass">Lewis Cass</a> and William Butler. He did not vote in the election. Defending his decision during a speech in Lexington on September 5, 1860, Breckinridge explained:
In August 1849, Kentuckians elected delegates to a state <a href="Constitutional%20convention%20%28political%20meeting%29">constitutional convention</a> in addition to state representatives and <a href="Kentucky%20Senate">senators</a>. Breckinridge's <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20States">abolitionist</a> uncles, William and <a href="Robert%20Jefferson%20Breckinridge">Robert</a>, joined with <a href="Cassius%20Marcellus%20Clay%20%28politician%29">Cassius Marcellus Clay</a> to nominate slates of like-minded candidates for the constitutional convention and the legislature. In response, a bipartisan group of pro-slavery citizens organized its own slate of candidates, including Breckinridge for one of <a href="Fayette%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Fayette County</a>'s two seats in the House of Representatives. Breckinridge, who by this time owned five slaves, had publicly declared his opposition to "impairing in any form" the legal protection of <a href="Slavery%20in%20the%20United%20States">slavery</a>. Despite his endorsement of slavery protections, he was a member of the <a href="Freemasonry">Freemasons</a> and the <a href="First%20Presbyterian%20Church%2C%20Lexington">First Presbyterian Church in Lexington</a>, both of which officially opposed slavery. He had also previously represented <a href="Free%20negro">free blacks</a> in court, expressed support for <a href="Manumission">voluntary emancipation</a>, and supported the Kentucky Colonization Society, which was dedicated to the relocation of free blacks to <a href="Liberia">Liberia</a>.
Breckinridge received 1,481 votes in the election, over 400 more than his nearest competitor, making it the first time that Fayette County had elected a Democrat to the state House of Representatives. Between the election and the legislative session, Breckinridge formed a new law partnership with Owsley's former Secretary of State, George B. Kinkead; his previous partner having died in a <a href="cholera">cholera</a> epidemic earlier in the year. He also co-founded the "Kentucky Statesman", a semi-weekly Democratic newspaper, and visited his cousin, <a href="Mary%20Todd%20Lincoln">Mary Todd</a>, where he met her husband, Abraham Lincoln, for the first time; despite their political differences, they became friends.

When the House convened, Breckinridge received a plurality of votes for Speaker, but fell at least eight votes short of a majority. Unable to break the deadlock, he withdrew from the race, and the position went to Whig Thomas Reilly. Breckinridge biographer Frank H. Heck wrote that Breckinridge was the leader of the House Democratic caucus during the session, during which time most of the measures considered were "local or personal ... and in any case, petty". Breckinridge was assigned to the House's standing committees on Federal Relations and the Judiciary. He supported bills allocating funding for <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a>, a traditionally Whig stance. As Congress debated Henry Clay's proposed <a href="Compromise%20of%201850">Compromise of 1850</a>, the four Whigs on the Committee on Federal Relations drew up resolutions urging the Kentucky congressional delegation to support the compromise as a "fair, equitable, and just basis" for settlement of the slavery issue in the newly acquired U.S. territories. Breckinridge felt that the resolution was too vague and authored a minority report that explicitly denied federal authority to interfere with slavery in states and territories. Both sets of resolutions, and a set adopted by the Senate, were all <a href="Table%20%28parliamentary%20procedure%29">laid on the table</a>.

On March 4, 1850, three days before the end of the session, Breckinridge took a leave of absence to care for his son, John Milton, who had become ill; he died on March 18. Keeping a busy schedule to cope with his grief, he urged adoption of the proposed constitution at a series of meetings around the state. His only concern with the document was its lack of an amendment process. The constitution was overwhelmingly ratified in May. Democrats wanted to nominate him for re-election, but he declined, citing problems "of a private and imperative character". Davis wrote "his problem – besides continuing sadness over his son's death – was money."

Breckinridge was a delegate to the January 8, 1851, state Democratic convention which nominated <a href="Lazarus%20W.%20Powell">Lazarus W. Powell</a> for governor. A week later, he announced that he would seek election to Congress from Kentucky's Eighth District. Nicknamed the "Ashland district" because it contained <a href="Ashland%20%28Henry%20Clay%20estate%29">Ashland</a>, the estate of Whig Party founder Henry Clay, and much of the area Clay once represented, the district was a Whig stronghold. In the previous congressional election, Democrats had not even nominated a candidate. Breckinridge's opponent, <a href="Leslie%20Combs%20%28soldier%20and%20politician%29">Leslie Combs</a>, was a former state legislator whose popularity was bolstered by his association with Clay and his participation in the <a href="War%20of%201812">War of 1812</a>; he was expected to win the election easily. In April, the candidates held a debate in Frankfort, and in May, they jointly canvassed the district, making daily speeches. Breckinridge reiterated his <a href="strict%20constructionism">strict constructionist</a> view of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">U.S. Constitution</a> and denounced the protective tariffs advocated by the Whigs, stating that "free thought needs free trade". His strong voice and charismatic personality contrasted with the campaign style of the much older Combs. On election day, he carried only three of the district's seven counties, but accumulated a two-to-one victory margin in <a href="Owen%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Owen County</a>, winning the county by 677 votes and the election by 537. Democrats carried five of Kentucky's ten congressional districts, and Powell was elected as the first Democratic governor since 1834.

Supporters promoted Breckinridge for <a href="Speaker%20of%20the%20United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">Speaker of the House</a>, but he refused to allow his own nomination and voted with the majority to elect fellow Kentuckian <a href="Linn%20Boyd">Linn Boyd</a>. Despite this, the two were factional enemies, and Boyd assigned Breckinridge to the lightly regarded <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Foreign%20Affairs">Committee on Foreign Affairs</a>. Breckinridge's first speech, and several subsequent ones, were made to defend William Butler, again a presidential aspirant in <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201852">1852</a>, from charges leveled by proponents of the <a href="Young%20America%20movement">Young America movement</a> that he was too old and had not made his stance on slavery clear. The attacks came from the pages of <a href="George%20Nicholas%20Sanders">George Nicholas Sanders</a>'s "Democratic Review", and on the House floor from several men, nearly all of whom supported Stephen Douglas for the nomination. These men included <a href="California">California</a>'s <a href="Edward%20C.%20Marshall">Edward C. Marshall</a>, who was Breckinridge's cousin. Their attacks ultimately hurt Douglas's chances for the nomination and Breckinridge's defense of Butler enhanced his own reputation. After this controversy, he was more active in the chamber's debates but introduced few significant pieces of legislation. He defended the constitutionality of the <a href="Fugitive%20Slave%20Act%20of%201850">Fugitive Slave Act of 1850</a> against attacks by <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> Representative <a href="Joshua%20Giddings">Joshua Giddings</a> and opposed <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a>'s proposed <a href="Homestead%20Acts">Homestead Act</a> out of concern that it would create more territories that excluded slavery. Despite his campaign rhetoric that federal funds should only be used for <a href="internal%20improvements">internal improvements</a> "of a national character", he sought to increase Kentucky's federal allocation for construction and maintenance of rivers and harbors, and supported bills that benefited his district's hemp farmers.

Returning home from the legislative session, Breckinridge made daily visits with Henry Clay, who lay dying in Lexington, and was chosen to deliver his eulogy in Congress when the next session commenced. The eulogy enhanced his popularity and solidified his position as Clay's political heir apparent. He also campaigned for the election of Democrat <a href="Franklin%20Pierce">Franklin Pierce</a> as president. Although Pierce lost Kentucky by 3,200 votes, Breckinridge wielded more influence with him than he had with outgoing Whig President <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a>. A week after his inauguration, Pierce offered Breckinridge an appointment as governor of <a href="Washington%20Territory">Washington Territory</a>. He had initially sought the appointment, securing letters of recommendation from Powell and Butler, but by the time it was offered, he had decided to stay in Kentucky and seek re-election to the House.

The Whigs, seeking to recapture Breckinridge's seat, nominated Kentucky State <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Kentucky">Attorney General</a> <a href="James%20Harlan%20%28congressman%29">James Harlan</a>, but some Whig factions opposed him, and he withdrew in March. <a href="Robert%20P.%20Letcher">Robert P. Letcher</a>, a former congressman and governor who had won 14 elections in Kentucky without a loss, was the party's second choice. Both candidates campaigned vigorously throughout the Eighth District, making multiple speeches a day between May and August. Letcher was an experienced campaigner, but his popular, anecdote-filled oratory was unpolished, and he was prone to outbursts of anger when frustrated. By contrast, Breckinridge delivered calm, well-reasoned speeches. Cassius Clay, a political enemy of Letcher's for years, endorsed Breckinridge, despite their differences on slavery. Citing this endorsement and the abolitionism of Breckinridge's uncles, Letcher tried to paint Breckinridge as an enemy of slavery. Breckinridge pointed to his consistent support for slavery and claimed Letcher was actually hostile to the interests of slaveholders. Although the district had gone for Whig candidate Winfield Scott by over 600 votes in the <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201852">previous year's presidential election</a>, Breckinridge defeated Letcher by 526 votes. Once again, he received a large margin in Owen County, which reported 123 more votes than eligible voters living in the county. Grateful for the support of the reliably Democratic county, he gave his son John Witherspoon Breckinridge the nickname "Owen".

Of the 234 members of the House, Breckinridge was among the 80 that were returned to their seats for the <a href="Thirty-third%20Congress">Thirty-third Congress</a>. Due to his increased seniority, he was assigned to the more prestigious <a href="United%20States%20House%20Committee%20on%20Ways%20and%20Means">Ways and Means Committee</a>, but he was not given a committee chairmanship as many had expected. Although he supported Pierce's pro-slavery agenda on the principle of states' rights and believed that <a href="secession">secession</a> was legal, he opposed secession as a remedy to the country's immediate problems. This, coupled with his earlier support of manumission and African colonization, balanced his support for slavery; most still considered him a moderate legislator.

An ally of <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>' <a href="Stephen%20A.%20Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a>, Breckinridge supported the doctrine of <a href="Popular%20sovereignty%20in%20the%20United%20States">popular sovereignty</a> as expressed in Douglas's <a href="Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska%20Act">Kansas–Nebraska Act</a>. He believed passage of the act would remove the issue of slavery from national politics – although it ultimately had the opposite effect – and acted as a liaison between Douglas and Pierce to secure its passage. During the debate on the House floor, <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York</a>'s <a href="Francis%20B.%20Cutting">Francis B. Cutting</a>, incensed by a statement that Breckinridge had made, demanded that he explain or retract it. Breckinridge interpreted Cutting's demand as a challenge to <a href="duel">duel</a>. Under "<a href="code%20duello">code duello</a>", the individual being challenged retained the right to name the weapons used and the distance between the combatants; Breckinridge chose rifles at 60 paces. He also specified that the duel should be held at <a href="Silver%20Spring%2C%20Maryland">Silver Spring, Maryland</a>, the home of his friend <a href="Francis%20Preston%20Blair">Francis Preston Blair</a>. Cutting, who had not intended his initial remark as a challenge, believed that Breckinridge's naming of terms constituted a challenge; he chose to use pistols at a distance of 10 paces. While the two men attempted to clarify who had issued the challenge and who reserved the right to choose the terms, mutual friends resolved the issue, preventing the duel. The recently adopted Kentucky Constitution prevented anyone who participated in a duel from holding elected office, and the peaceful resolution of the issue may have saved Breckinridge's political career.

In February 1854, the Whig majority in the Kentucky General Assembly passed – over Powell's veto – a <a href="United%20States%20congressional%20apportionment">reapportionment</a> bill that redrew Breckinridge's district, removing Owen County and replacing it with <a href="Harrison%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Harrison</a> and <a href="Nicholas%20County%2C%20Kentucky">Nicholas</a> counties. This, combined with the rise of the <a href="Know%20Nothing%20Party">Know Nothing Party</a> in Kentucky, left Breckinridge with little hope of re-election, and he decided to retire from the House at the expiration of his term. Following the December 1854 resignation of <a href="Pierre%20Soul%C3%A9">Pierre Soulé</a>, the <a href="United%20States%20Ambassador%20to%20Spain">U.S. Minister to Spain</a> who failed to negotiate a U.S. annexation of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a> following the controversial <a href="Ostend%20Manifesto">Ostend Manifesto</a>, Pierce nominated Breckinridge to the position. Although the Senate <a href="Advise%20and%20consent">confirmed</a> the nomination, Breckinridge declined it on February 8, 1855, telling Pierce only that his decision was "of a private and domestic nature." His term in the house expired on March 4.

Desiring to care for his sick wife and rebuild his personal wealth, Breckinridge returned to his law practice in Lexington. In addition to his legal practice, he engaged in land speculation in <a href="Minnesota%20Territory">Minnesota</a> territory and <a href="Wisconsin">Wisconsin</a>. When Governor <a href="Willis%20A.%20Gorman">Willis A. Gorman</a> of the Minnesota Territory thwarted an attempt by Breckinridge's fellow investors (not including Breckinridge) to secure approval of a railroad connecting <a href="Dubuque%2C%20Iowa">Dubuque, Iowa</a>, with their investments near <a href="Superior%2C%20Wisconsin">Superior, Wisconsin</a>, they petitioned Pierce to remove Gorman and appoint Breckinridge in his place. In 1855, Pierce authorized two successive investigations of Gorman, but failed to uncover any wrongdoing that would justify his removal. During his time away from politics, Breckinridge also promoted the advancement of horse racing in his native state and was chosen president of the Kentucky Association for the Improvement of the Breed of Horses.

As a delegate to the <a href="1856%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1856 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Cincinnati">Cincinnati</a>, Ohio, Breckinridge favored Pierce's re-nomination for president. When Pierce's hopes of securing the nomination faltered, Breckinridge joined other erstwhile Pierce backers by throwing his support behind his friend, Stephen Douglas. Even with this additional support, Douglas was still unable to garner a majority of the delegates' votes, and he withdrew, leaving <a href="James%20Buchanan">James Buchanan</a> as the Democratic nominee. <a href="William%20Alexander%20Richardson">William Alexander Richardson</a>, a Kentucky-born Congressman from Illinois, then suggested that nominating Breckinridge for vice-president would balance Buchanan's ticket and placate disgruntled supporters of Douglas or Pierce. A delegate from <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> placed his name before the convention, and although Breckinridge desired the nomination, he declined, citing his deference to fellow Kentuckian and former House Speaker <a href="Linn%20Boyd">Linn Boyd</a>, who was supported by the Kentucky delegation.

Ten men received votes on the first vice-presidential ballot. <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>'s <a href="John%20A.%20Quitman">John A. Quitman</a> had the most support with 59 votes. Eight state delegations – with a total of 55 votes – voted for Breckinridge in spite of his refusal of the nomination, making him the second-highest vote getter. Kentucky cast its 12 votes for Boyd, bringing his third-place total to 33 votes. Seeing Breckinridge's strength on the first ballot, large numbers of delegates voted for him on the second ballot, and those who did not soon saw that his nomination was inevitable and changed their votes to make it unanimous.

Unlike many political nominees of his time, Breckinridge actively campaigned for his and Buchanan's <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201856">election</a>. During the first ten days of September 1856, he spoke in <a href="Hamilton%2C%20Ohio">Hamilton</a> and Cincinnati in <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a>; <a href="Lafayette%2C%20Indiana">Lafayette</a> and <a href="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> in <a href="Indiana">Indiana</a>; <a href="Kalamazoo%2C%20Michigan">Kalamazoo, Michigan</a>; <a href="Covington%2C%20Kentucky">Covington, Kentucky</a>; and <a href="Pittsburgh%2C%20Pennsylvania">Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania</a>. His speeches stressed the idea that Republicans were fanatically devoted to emancipation, and their election would prompt the dissolution of the Union. Breckinridge's presence on the ticket helped the Democrats carry his home state of Kentucky – which the party had not won since <a href="United%20States%20presidential%20election%2C%201828">1828</a> – by 6,000 votes. Buchanan and Breckinridge received 174 electoral votes to 114 for Republicans <a href="John%20C.%20Fr%C3%A9mont">John C. Frémont</a> and <a href="William%20L.%20Dayton">William L. Dayton</a> and 8 for Know Nothing candidates <a href="Millard%20Fillmore">Millard Fillmore</a> and <a href="Andrew%20Jackson%20Donelson">Andrew Jackson Donelson</a>. Thirty-six years old at the time of his inauguration on March 4, 1857, Breckinridge was the youngest <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20the%20United%20States">vice-president</a> in U.S. history, exceeding the minimum age required under the Constitution by only a year.

Buchanan resented the fact that Breckinridge had supported both Pierce and Douglas before endorsing his nomination. Relations between the two were further strained when, upon asking for a private interview with Buchanan, Breckinridge was told to come to the White House and ask for <a href="Harriet%20Lane">Harriet Lane</a>, who acted as the mansion's host for the unmarried president. Feeling slighted by the response, Breckinridge refused to carry out these instructions; later, three of Buchanan's intimates informed Breckinridge that requesting to speak to Miss Lane was actually a secret instruction to White House staff to usher the requestor into a private audience with the president. They also conveyed Buchanan's apologies for the misunderstanding.
Buchanan rarely consulted Breckinridge when making patronage appointments, and meetings between the two were infrequent. When Breckinridge and Buchanan endorsed the <a href="Lecompton%20Constitution">Lecompton Constitution</a>, which would have admitted <a href="Kansas">Kansas</a> as a slave state instead of allowing the people to vote, they managed to alienate most Northern Democrats, including Douglas. This disagreement ended plans for Breckinridge, Douglas, and <a href="Minnesota">Minnesota</a>'s <a href="Henry%20Mower%20Rice">Henry Mower Rice</a> to build a series of three elaborate, conjoined <a href="row%20house">row house</a>s in which to live during their time in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> In November 1857, after Breckinridge found alternative lodging in Washington, he sold a slave woman and her young infant which, according to historian <a href="James%20C.%20Klotter">James C. Klotter</a>, probably ended his days as a slaveholder. When Breckinridge did not travel to Illinois to campaign for Douglas's re-election to the Senate and gave him only a lukewarm endorsement, relations between them worsened.

Functioning as the Senate's presiding officer, Breckinridge's participation in the chamber's debates was also restricted, but he won respect for presiding "gracefully and impartially." On January 4, 1859, he was asked to deliver the final address in the <a href="Old%20Senate%20Chamber">Old Senate Chamber</a>; in the speech, he expressed his desire that the Congress find a solution that would preserve the Union. During its half century in the chamber, the Senate had grown from 32 to 64 members. During those years, he observed, the Constitution had "survived peace and war, prosperity and adversity" to protect "the larger personal freedom compatible with public order." Breckinridge expressed hope that eventually "another Senate, in another age, shall bear to a new and larger Chamber, this Constitution vigorous and inviolate, and that the last generation of posterity shall witness the deliberations of the Representatives of American States, still united, prosperous, and free." Breckinridge then led a procession to the new chamber. Breckinridge opposed the idea that the federal government could coerce action by a state, but maintained that secession, while legal, was not the solution to the country's problems.

Although John Crittenden's Senate term did not expire until 1861, the <a href="Kentucky%20General%20Assembly">Kentucky General Assembly</a> met to choose his successor in 1859. Until just days before the election, the contest was expected to be between Breckinridge and Boyd, who had been elected <a href="Lieutenant%20Governor%20of%20Kentucky">lieutenant governor</a> in August; Boyd's worsening health prompted his withdrawal on November 28, 1859. On December 12, the Assembly chose Breckinridge over <a href="Joshua%20Fry%20Bell">Joshua Fry Bell</a>, the defeated candidate in the August gubernatorial election, by a vote of 81–53. In his acceptance speech, delivered to the Kentucky House of Representatives on December 21, Breckinridge endorsed the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20the%20United%20States">Supreme Court</a>'s decision in "<a href="Dred%20Scott%20v.%20Sandford">Dred Scott v. Sandford</a>" – which ruled that Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories – and insisted that <a href="John%20Brown%20%28abolitionist%29">John Brown</a>'s recent <a href="John%20Brown%27s%20raid%20on%20Harpers%20Ferry">raid on Harpers Ferry</a> was evidence of Republicans' insistence on either "negro equality" or violence. Resistance in some form, he predicted, would eventually be necessary. He still urged the Assembly against secession – "God forbid that the step shall ever be taken!" – but his discussion of growing sectional conflict bothered some, including his uncle Robert.

Early in 1859, Senator <a href="James%20Henry%20Hammond">James Henry Hammond</a> of <a href="South%20Carolina">South Carolina</a> reported to a friend that Breckinridge was seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, but as late as January 1860, Breckinridge told family members that he had no desire for the nomination. A "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" editorial noted that while Buchanan was falling "in prestige and political consequence, the star of the Vice President rises higher above the clouds." Douglas, considered the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, was convinced that Breckinridge would be a candidate; this, combined with Buchanan's reluctant support of Breckinridge and Breckinridge's public support for a federal slave code deepened the rift between the two.

Among Breckinridge's supporters at the <a href="1860%20Democratic%20National%20Convention">1860 Democratic National Convention</a> in <a href="Charleston%2C%20South%20Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a>, were several prominent Kentuckians. They were former Kentucky Governor and current Senator <a href="Lazarus%20W.%20Powell">Lazarus W. Powell</a>, former Kentucky Congressmen <a href="William%20Preston%20%28Kentucky%29">William Preston</a> (a distant relative) and law partner <a href="James%20Brown%20Clay">James Brown Clay</a>, and <a href="James%20B.%20Beck">James B. Beck</a>. Breckinridge did not attend the convention, but instructed his supporters not to nominate him as long as <a href="James%20Guthrie%20%28Kentucky%29">James Guthrie</a> remained a candidate. Accordingly, when a delegate from Arkansas nominated Breckinridge for president on the thirty-sixth ballot, Beck asked that it be withdrawn, and the request was honored. Over the course of 57 ballots, Douglas maintained a wide plurality, but failed to gain the necessary two-thirds majority; Guthrie consistently ran second. Unable to nominate a candidate, delegates voted to reconvene in <a href="Baltimore%2C%20Maryland">Baltimore, Maryland</a> on June 18.

Pro-Southern delegates, who had walked out of the Charleston convention in protest of its failure to adopt a federal slave code plank in its platform, did not participate in the Baltimore convention. The delegates from Alabama and Louisiana – all of whom had walked out at Charleston – had been replaced with Douglas supporters from those states, leading to the nomination of Douglas and <a href="Herschel%20Vespasian%20Johnson">Herschel Vespasian Johnson</a> for president and vice-president, respectively. The protesting delegates convened five days later in Baltimore. On the first ballot, Breckinridge received 81 votes, with 24 going to former Senator <a href="Daniel%20S.%20Dickinson">Daniel S. Dickinson</a> of New York. Dickinson supporters gradually changed their support to Breckinridge in order to make his nomination unanimous, and <a href="Joseph%20Lane">Joseph Lane</a> of Oregon was chosen by acclamation as his running mate. Despite concerns about the breakup of the party, Breckinridge accepted the nomination. In August, Mississippi Senator <a href="Jefferson%20Davis">Jefferson Davis</a> attempted to broker a compromise under which Douglas, Breckinridge, and Tennessee's <a href="John%20Bell%20%28Tennessee%20politician%29">John Bell</a>, the nominee of the <a href="Constitutional%20Union%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Constitutional Union Party</a>, would all withdraw in favor of a compromise candidate. Both Breckinridge and Bell readily agreed to the plan, but Douglas was opposed to compromising with the "Bolters," and his supporters retained an intense dislike for Breckinridge that made them averse to Davis's proposal.

Opponents knew Breckinridge believed in the right of secession and accused him of favoring the breakup of the Union; he denied the latter during a speech in Frankfort: "I am an American citizen, a Kentuckian who never did an act nor cherished a thought that was not full of devotion to the Constitution and the Union." While he had very little support in the northern states, most, if not all, of the southern states were expected to go for Breckinridge. This would give him only 120 of 303 electoral votes, but to gain support from any northern states, he had to minimize his connections with the southern states and risked losing their support to Bell. Some Breckinridge supporters believed his best hope was for the election to be thrown to the House of Representatives; if he could add the support of some Douglas or Bell states to the thirteen believed to support him, he could best Lincoln, who was believed to carry the support of fifteen states. To Davis's wife, <a href="Varina%20Davis">Varina</a>, Breckinridge wrote, "I trust I have the courage to lead a forlorn hope."
In the four-way contest, Breckinridge came in third in the popular vote, with 18.1%, but second in the <a href="Electoral%20College%20%28United%20States%29">Electoral College</a>. The final electoral vote was 180 for Lincoln, 72 for Breckinridge, 39 for Bell, and 12 for Douglas. Although Breckinridge won the states of the <a href="Deep%20South">Deep South</a>, his support in those states came mostly from rural areas with low slave populations; the urban areas with higher slave populations generally went for Bell or Douglas. Breckinridge also carried the <a href="Border%20states%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">border states</a> of <a href="Maryland">Maryland</a> and <a href="Delaware">Delaware</a>. Historian <a href="James%20C.%20Klotter">James C. Klotter</a> points out in light of these results that, while Douglas maintained that there was "not a disunionist in America who is not a Breckinridge man", it is more likely that party loyalty and economic status played a more prominent role in Breckinridge's support than did issues of slavery and secession. He lost to Douglas in <a href="Missouri">Missouri</a> and Bell in <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a> and Tennessee. Bell also captured Breckinridge's home state, Kentucky. Lincoln swept most of the northern states, although <a href="New%20Jersey">New Jersey</a> split its electoral votes, giving four to Lincoln and three to Douglas. As the candidate of the Buchanan faction, Breckinridge outpolled Douglas in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a> and received support comparable to Douglas in <a href="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, although he received very little support elsewhere in the North. It was Breckinridge's duty as vice-president to announce Lincoln as the winner of the electoral college vote on February 13, 1861.

On February 24, Breckinridge visited Lincoln at <a href="Willard%20InterContinental%20Washington">Willard's Hotel</a> in Washington, D.C., and frequently thereafter he visited his cousin, now the <a href="First%20Lady%20of%20the%20United%20States">First Lady</a>, at the White House. In the <a href="lame%20duck%20session">lame duck session</a> following the election, Congress adopted a resolution authored by Lazarus Powell, now in the Senate, calling for a committee of thirteen (Committee of Thirteen on the Disturbed Condition of the Country) "to consider that portion of the President's message relating to the disturbances of the country." Frank Heck wrote that Breckinridge appointed "an able committee, representing every major faction." He endorsed <a href="Crittenden%20Compromise">Crittenden's proposed compromise</a>, a collection of constitutional amendments designed to avert secession and appease the South. Breckinridge used his influence as the Senate's presiding officer in an unsuccessful attempt to get it approved by either the committee or the Senate. Ultimately, the committee reported that they were unable to agree on a recommendation. On March 4, 1861, the last day of the session, Breckinridge swore in <a href="Hannibal%20Hamlin">Hannibal Hamlin</a> as his successor as vice-president. Hamlin, in turn, swore in the newly elected senators, including Breckinridge.

Seven states had already seceded when Breckinridge took his seat as a senator, leaving the remaining Southern senators more outnumbered in their defense of slavery. Seeking to find a compromise that would reunite the states under constitutional principles, he urged Lincoln to withdraw federal forces from the Confederate states in order to avert war. The congressional session ended on March 28, and in an April 2 address to the Kentucky General Assembly, he continued to advocate peaceful reconciliation of the states and proposed a conference of border states to seek a solution. On April 12, <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Sumter">Confederate troops fired on Fort Sumter</a>, ending plans for the conference. Breckinridge recommended that Governor <a href="Beriah%20Magoffin">Beriah Magoffin</a> call a sovereignty convention to determine whether Kentucky would side with the Union or the Confederacy. On May 10, he was chosen by the legislature as one of six delegates to a conference to decide the state's next action. The states' rights delegates were Breckinridge, Magoffin, and <a href="Richard%20Hawes">Richard Hawes</a>; the Unionist delegates were Crittenden, <a href="Archibald%20Dixon">Archibald Dixon</a>, and <a href="Samuel%20Smith%20Nicholas">S.S. Nicholas</a>. Unable to agree on substantial issues, the delegates recommended that Kentucky adopt a neutral stance in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">Civil War</a> and arm itself to prevent invasion by either federal or Confederate forces. Breckinridge did not support this recommendation, but he agreed to abide by it once it was approved by the legislature.

In special elections in June, pro-Union candidates captured 9 of 10 seats in Kentucky's House delegation. Returning to the Senate for a special session in July, Breckinridge was regarded as a traitor by most of his fellow legislators because of his <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate</a> sympathies. He condemned as unconstitutional Lincoln's enlistment and arming of men for a war Congress had not officially declared, his expending funds for the war that had not been allocated by Congress, and his suspension of the writ of <a href="habeas%20corpus">habeas corpus</a>. He was the only senator to vote against a resolution authorizing Lincoln to use "the entire resources of the government" for the war. Asked what he would do if he were president, he replied, "I would prefer to see these States all reunited upon true constitutional principles to any other object that could be offered me in life ... But I infinitely prefer to see a peaceful separation of these States than to see endless, aimless, devastating war, at the end of which I see the grave of public liberty and of personal freedom." On August 1, he declared that, if Kentucky sided with the federal government against the Confederacy, "she will be represented by some other man on the floor of this Senate."

Kentucky's neutrality was breached by both federal and Confederate forces in early September 1861. Confederate forces under the command of Major General <a href="Leonidas%20Polk">Leonidas Polk</a> invaded Kentucky on September 3 and occupied the southwestern town of <a href="Columbus%2C%20Kentucky">Columbus</a>. They were followed by a Union force commanded by Brigadier General <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, which on the morning of September 6 occupied the town of <a href="Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">Paducah</a> on the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a>. Soon after, Unionists in the state arrested former governor <a href="Charles%20S.%20Morehead">Charles S. Morehead</a> for his suspected Confederate sympathies and shut down the "<a href="Louisville%20Courier-Journal">Louisville Courier</a>" because of its pro-Confederate editorials. Word reached Breckinridge that <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> General <a href="Thomas%20E.%20Bramlette">Thomas E. Bramlette</a> intended to arrest him next. To avoid detainment, on September 19, 1861, he left Lexington. Joined in <a href="Prestonsburg%2C%20Kentucky">Prestonsburg</a> by Confederate sympathizers <a href="George%20W.%20Johnson%20%28governor%29">George W. Johnson</a>, <a href="George%20Baird%20Hodge">George Baird Hodge</a>, William Preston, and <a href="William%20E.%20Simms">William E. Simms</a>, he continued to <a href="Abingdon%2C%20Virginia">Abingdon, Virginia</a>, and from there by rail to Confederate-held <a href="Bowling%20Green%2C%20Kentucky">Bowling Green, Kentucky</a>. The state legislature immediately requested his resignation.

In an open letter to his constituents dated October 8, 1861, Breckinridge maintained that the Union no longer existed and that Kentucky should be free to choose her own course; he defended his sympathy to the Southern cause and denounced the Unionist state legislature, declaring, "I exchange with proud satisfaction a term of six years in the Senate of the United States for the musket of a soldier." He was indicted for <a href="treason">treason</a> in U.S. federal district court in Frankfort on November 6, 1861, having officially enlisted in the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Army">Confederate army</a> days earlier. On December 2, 1861, he was declared a traitor by the United States Senate. A resolution stating "Whereas John C. Breckinridge, a member of this body from the State of Kentucky, has joined the enemies of his country, and is now in arms against the government he had sworn to support: Therefore—Resolved, That said John C. Breckinridge, the traitor, be, and he hereby is, expelled from the Senate," was adopted by a vote of 36–0 on December 4. Ten Southern Senators had been expelled earlier that year in July.

On the recommendation of <a href="Simon%20Bolivar%20Buckner">Simon Bolivar Buckner</a>, the former commander of the Kentucky State Militia who had also joined the Army of the Confederate States, Breckinridge was commissioned as a <a href="Brigadier%20General%20%28CSA%29">brigadier general</a> in the Confederate Army on November 2, 1861. On November 16, he was given command of the 1st Kentucky Brigade. Nicknamed the <a href="Orphan%20Brigade">Orphan Brigade</a> because its men felt orphaned by Kentucky's Unionist state government, the brigade was in Buckner's 2nd Division of the <a href="Army%20of%20Mississippi">Army of Mississippi</a>, commanded by General <a href="Albert%20Sidney%20Johnston">Albert Sidney Johnston</a>. For several weeks, he trained his troops in the city, and he also participated in the organization of a provisional <a href="Confederate%20government%20of%20Kentucky">Confederate government for the state</a>. Although not sanctioned by the legislature in Frankfort, its existence prompted the Confederacy to admit Kentucky on December 10, 1861.

Johnston's forces were forced to withdraw from Bowling Green in February 1862. During the retreat, Breckinridge was put in charge of Johnston's Reserve Corps. Johnston decided to attack <a href="Ulysses%20S.%20Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>'s forces at Shiloh, Tennessee on April 6, 1862 by advancing North from his base in <a href="Corinth%2C%20Mississippi">Corinth, Mississippi</a>. Breckinridge's reserves soon joined the <a href="Battle%20of%20Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> as Johnston tried to force Grant's troops into the river. Despite Johnston being killed in the fighting, the Confederates made steady progress against Grant's troops until <a href="P.%20G.%20T.%20Beauregard">P. G. T. Beauregard</a> – who assumed command after Johnston's death – ordered his generals to break off the fighting at about 6 o'clock in the afternoon. The next day, the Union forces regrouped and repelled the Confederates. Of the 7,000 troops under Breckinridge's command at the battle, 386 were killed and 1,628 were wounded, Breckinridge among the latter.
Breckinridge's performance earned him a promotion to <a href="Major%20General%20%28CSA%29">major general</a> on April 14, 1862. After his promotion, he joined <a href="Earl%20Van%20Dorn">Earl Van Dorn</a> near <a href="Vicksburg%2C%20Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>. The Confederate forces awaited a Union attack throughout most of July. Finally, Van Dorn ordered Breckinridge to attempt to recapture <a href="Baton%20Rouge%2C%20Louisiana">Baton Rouge, Louisiana</a>, from federal forces. Despite having his forces reduced to around 3,000 by illness and desertions, on August 5, he <a href="Battle%20of%20Baton%20Rouge%20%281862%29">attacked the Union garrison</a>, capturing several prisoners, destroying its supplies, and driving it from the city. The ironclad "<a href="CSS%20Arkansas">CSS Arkansas</a>" was supposed to support Breckinridge's attack, but it was immobilized by a mechanical failure and its crew sank it to prevent its capture. Without naval support, the Confederates were unable to hold the city.

Later that month, Breckinridge served as an independent commander in the lower <a href="Mississippi%20Valley">Mississippi Valley</a>, securing Confederate control of the area by taking <a href="Port%20Hudson%2C%20Louisiana">Port Hudson</a>, which helped halt the federal advance down the Mississippi River. Meanwhile, General <a href="Braxton%20Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a>, commanding the Army of Mississippi, was preparing an <a href="Confederate%20Heartland%20Offensive">invasion</a> of Kentucky, and Breckinridge was ordered to join him. Confederate leaders believed that Breckinridge's presence in the state could spur enlistments. Van Dorn was reluctant to lose command of Breckinridge and his men, and by the time he relented on October 15, Bragg was already retreating from the state after being defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Perryville">Battle of Perryville</a>. Breckinridge and his division of 7,000 men met Bragg at <a href="Murfreesboro%2C%20Tennessee">Murfreesboro, Tennessee</a>. With Kentucky solidly under Union control, Breckinridge's wife and children moved south and followed his troops as closely as was safely possible.

Bragg resented Breckinridge's close ties to Confederate commanders, particularly <a href="Joseph%20E.%20Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>, <a href="Wade%20Hampton%20III">Wade Hampton</a>, <a href="John%20B.%20Floyd">John B. Floyd</a>, and William Preston, all of whom were related to Breckinridge. Furthermore, he thought Breckinridge's late arrival for the Kentucky campaign had contributed to the lack of Confederate volunteers he found in the state. In December, Bragg ordered the execution of Kentucky Corporal <a href="Asa%20Lewis">Asa Lewis</a> after a <a href="court%20martial">court martial</a> had convicted him of <a href="desertion">desertion</a>. Lewis's enlistment had expired, but he continued to serve with the <a href="6th%20Kentucky%20Infantry">6th Kentucky Infantry</a> until his impoverished mother and siblings begged him to return home. Although Lewis claimed he was returning to the army at the time of his arrest, Bragg was insistent on reducing desertions by making him an example. After witnessing the execution, Breckinridge reportedly became nauseated and fell forward on his horse, requiring assistance from members of his staff. He protested Bragg's "military murder" and was barely able to prevent open mutiny by his Kentucky soldiers. Relations between Breckinridge and Bragg continued to deteriorate; Breckinridge's opinion that Bragg was incompetent was shared by many Confederate officers.

At Murfreesboro, Breckinridge's Division was assigned to Lieutenant General <a href="William%20J.%20Hardee">William J. Hardee</a>'s Corps and was stationed on the east side of the <a href="Stones%20River">Stones River</a>. When the Union <a href="Army%20of%20the%20Cumberland">Army of the Cumberland</a>, commanded by Major General <a href="William%20Rosecrans">William Rosecrans</a>, attacked on December 31, 1862, beginning the <a href="Battle%20of%20Stones%20River">Battle of Stones River</a>, Bragg's main force initially repelled the attack. Bragg ordered Breckinridge to reinforce him on the west side of the river, but Brigadier General <a href="John%20Pegram%20%28general%29">John Pegram</a>, who commanded a cavalry brigade, erroneously reported that a large Union force was advancing along the east bank, and Breckinridge was slow to comply with Bragg's order. When he finally crossed the river, his attacks were ineffective, and Bragg ordered him back across the river. By January 2, Union forces had taken a ridge that ran along the river; against Breckinridge's advice, Bragg ordered the 2nd Division to launch a near-suicidal attack on the federal position. Prior to the attack, Breckinridge wrote to Preston, "if [the attack] should result in disaster and I be among the killed, I want you to do justice to my memory and tell the people that I believed this attack to be very unwise and tried to prevent it."

Breckinridge's men initially broke the Union line and forced them across the river. Artillery on the opposite side of the river then opened fire on Breckinridge's men, and reinforcements for the fleeing Union troops arrived. In just over an hour, nearly one-third of Breckinridge's troops were killed, wounded, or captured. One anecdote holds that, as he rode among the survivors, he cried out repeatedly, "My poor Orphans! My poor Orphans," bringing recognition to the Orphan Brigade. Bragg's official report criticized the conduct of Breckinridge's division and assigned to Breckinridge most of the blame for the Confederate defeat. Breckinridge asserted to his superiors that Bragg's report "fails ... to do justice to the behavior of my Division"; he requested a court of inquiry, but the request was denied. Several Kentuckians under Breckinridge's command, who already blamed Bragg for the failed invasion of their native state, encouraged him to resign his commission and challenge Bragg to a duel.

In May 1863, Breckinridge was reassigned to Joseph E. Johnston, participating in the <a href="Battle%20of%20Jackson%2C%20Mississippi">Battle of Jackson</a> in an unsuccessful attempt to break the <a href="Siege%20of%20Vicksburg">Siege of Vicksburg</a>. Vicksburg fell to Grant's forces on July 4, and Breckinridge was returned to Bragg's command on August 28, 1863. After seeing no action on the first day of the <a href="Battle%20of%20Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a> in Georgia on September 19, he led a division of <a href="Daniel%20Harvey%20Hill">D.H. Hill</a>'s corps in an attack on the Union forces the next morning. The Confederate troops succeeded in breaking the Union line, but the main army, due at least in part to Bragg's hesitation, escaped back to Tennessee. Of Breckinridge's 3,769 men, 166 were killed in the battle; 909 were wounded and 165 were missing.

In late November, Breckinridge commanded one of Bragg's two corps during the Confederate defeat at the <a href="Battles%20for%20Chattanooga">Battles for Chattanooga</a>. Bragg ordered a significant number of Breckinridge's men to reinforce Hardee's corps, leaving him with insufficient forces to repel the combined attack of <a href="Joseph%20Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a> and <a href="George%20Henry%20Thomas">George Henry Thomas</a> on <a href="Battle%20of%20Missionary%20Ridge">Missionary Ridge</a>. His son, Cabell, was captured in the battle. He was later freed in a <a href="prisoner%20exchange">prisoner exchange</a>. In his official report, Bragg charged Breckinridge with drunkenness at Chattanooga and (retroactively) at Stones River. Historian <a href="Lowell%20H.%20Harrison">Lowell H. Harrison</a> noted that, while Breckinridge frequently drank whiskey, he was well known for being able to consume large amounts without getting drunk. Before submitting his own resignation, which was accepted, Bragg removed Breckinridge from command. It would be almost two years – on May 1, 1865 – before the two would reconcile.

On December 15, 1863, Breckinridge took leave in Richmond. Premature rumors of his death prompted "The New York Times" to print a quite vituperative obituary suggesting that Breckinridge had been a hypocrite for supporting states' rights, then abandoning his home state when it chose to remain in the Union. Confederate leaders were skeptical of Bragg's claims against Breckinridge, and in February 1864, <a href="President%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate President</a> Jefferson Davis assigned him to the <a href="Eastern%20Theater%20of%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">Eastern Theater</a> and put him in charge of the Trans-Allegheny Department (later known as the <a href="Department%20of%20East%20Tennessee%20and%20West%20Virginia">Department of East Tennessee and West Virginia</a>).

On May 5, General <a href="Robert%20E.%20Lee">Robert E. Lee</a>, commander of the <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a>, ordered Breckinridge to take command of a reconnaissance mission to scout the federal forces under <a href="Franz%20Sigel">Franz Sigel</a> near <a href="Winchester%2C%20Virginia">Winchester, Virginia</a> as part of the <a href="Valley%20Campaigns%20of%201864%23Lynchburg%20Campaign%20%28May%E2%80%93June%201864%29">Lynchburg Campaign</a>. With a force of about 4,800 men, including 261 cadets from the <a href="Virginia%20Military%20Institute">Virginia Military Institute</a>, he defeated Sigel's 6,300 men at the <a href="Battle%20of%20New%20Market">Battle of New Market</a> on May 15, driving them west across the <a href="Shenandoah%20River">Shenandoah River</a>. In doing so, Breckinridge's troops managed to protect Lee's flank, defend a crucial railroad juncture, and protect the valuable <a href="wheat">wheat</a> supply. Lee had suggested that Breckinridge invade Maryland, but he was unable to do so because floodwaters had made the <a href="Potomac%20River">Potomac River</a> virtually impassable. The victory was considered one of his best performances as a general. Since then, many in the South have viewed him as a "worthy successor" of the late <a href="Stonewall%20Jackson">Stonewall Jackson</a>. Breckinridge would draw more comparisons at the <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20Kernstown">Second Battle of Kernstown</a>, the scene of the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Kernstown">first fight</a> in <a href="Jackson%27s%20Valley%20Campaign">Jackson's Valley Campaign</a> two years earlier. In the Second Battle, which occurred on July 24, 13,000 Confederate troops commanded by Lt. Gen. <a href="Jubal%20Early">Jubal Early</a> attacked and defeated 10,000 Federal troops under the command of Brig. Gen. <a href="George%20Crook">George Crook</a>. The victory allowed the Confederates to resume their <a href="Valley%20Campaigns%20of%201864%23Early%27s%20Washington%20Raid%20and%20operations%20against%20the%20B%26amp%3BO%20Railroad%20%28June%E2%80%93August%201864%29">invasion</a> of the North. Shortly thereafter, Breckinridge's Division reinforced Lee's <a href="Army%20of%20Northern%20Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> and played an important role in halting Grant's advance at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Cold%20Harbor">Battle of Cold Harbor</a>. During the battle, his troops repulsed a powerful Union attack. Breckinridge was wounded when a cannonball struck his horse and he was pinned underneath. He was still unable to walk or ride when Lee ordered him to take command of the survivors of the Confederate defeat at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Piedmont">Battle of Piedmont</a>. Traveling by rail to <a href="Rockfish%20Gap">Rockfish Gap</a> on June 10, he marched his forces into the city of <a href="Lynchburg%2C%20Virginia">Lynchburg, Virginia</a>. He was joined there by General Early's troops, who arrived just in time to save the Confederate forces from an assault by Union forces under <a href="David%20Hunter">David Hunter</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Lynchburg">Battle of Lynchburg</a>.

After Early and Breckinridge (who was now able to ride a horse) chased Hunter more than sixty miles away from the city, Lee ordered them to clear the Union forces from the <a href="Shenandoah%20Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>, then cross into Maryland and probe the defenses of Washington, D.C. Union forces' only serious attempt to turn back <a href="Valley%20Campaigns%20of%201864">the expedition</a> came at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Monocacy">Battle of Monocacy</a> on July 9. Confederate troops were delayed, but ultimately prevailed and continued toward Washington. They were defeated at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Fort%20Stevens">Battle of Fort Stevens</a> on July 11–12, partially with reinforcements brought in by the United States Government with the time gained from the Battle of Monocacy. Since Lincoln was watching the fight from the ramparts of Fort Stevens, this marked only time in American history in which two former opponents in a presidential election faced one another across battle lines. Following the battle, Early decided to withdraw rather than assault the well-fortified federal capital. Early and Breckinridge were able to hold the Shenandoah Valley through July and August, but on September 19, 1864, <a href="Philip%20Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a> forced their retreat at the <a href="Third%20Battle%20of%20Winchester">Third Battle of Winchester</a>. Responding to General <a href="John%20Brown%20Gordon">John Brown Gordon</a>'s admonition to be careful in the fight, Breckinridge responded, "Well, general, there is little left for me if our cause is to fail."

After the death of <a href="John%20Hunt%20Morgan">John Hunt Morgan</a>, Breckinridge again took command of the Department of East Tennessee and West Virginia. He reorganized the department, which was in great disarray. On October 2, 1864 at the <a href="First%20Battle%20of%20Saltville">First Battle of Saltville</a>, his troops were able to protect critical Confederate <a href="saltern">salt works</a> from United States forces under <a href="Stephen%20G.%20Burbridge">Stephen G. Burbridge</a>, despite a lack of resources. The next morning, he discovered that soldiers under his command had begun killing about 100 wounded black Union soldiers of the <a href="5th%20United%20States%20Colored%20Cavalry">5th United States Colored Cavalry</a>. Hearing the gunfire, he rushed to stop the massacre. Brigadier General <a href="Felix%20Huston%20Robertson">Felix Huston Robertson</a> was suspected of involvement. General Lee instructed Breckinridge to "prefer charges against him and bring him to trial", but no trial ever took place.

In mid-November, Breckinridge led a raid into northeastern Tennessee, driving <a href="Alvan%20Cullem%20Gillem">Alvan Cullem Gillem</a>'s forces back to <a href="Knoxville%2C%20Tennessee">Knoxville</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Bull%27s%20Gap">Battle of Bull's Gap</a>. On December 17–18, he faced a two-pronged attack from Union cavalry under Major General <a href="George%20Stoneman">George Stoneman</a> at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Marion">Battle of Marion</a> in Virginia. Badly outnumbered on either flank, Breckinridge resisted Stoneman's forces until he ran low on ammunition. Stoneman's forces were able to damage Confederate salt works, lead mines, and railroads in the area, and destroy supply depots at <a href="Bristol%2C%20Virginia">Bristol</a> and Abingdon. Finally restocked with ammunition after three days, Breckinridge was able to drive Stoneman – whose men were now short of ammunition themselves – out of the area.

<a href="James%20A.%20Seddon">James A. Seddon</a> resigned his position as the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Secretary%20of%20War">Confederate Secretary of War</a> on January 19, 1865. On February 6, Davis appointed Breckinridge to the vacant position, partially to quiet growing opposition to his administration. Initially opposed by several members of the <a href="Congress%20of%20the%20Confederate%20States">Confederate Congress</a> because he had waited to join the Confederacy, he eventually gained their support by administrating his office more efficiently than his predecessors. With their support, he was able to expand the post's influence to include making officer assignments and promotion recommendations and advising field generals regarding strategy. His first act as secretary was to promote Robert E. Lee to general-in-chief of all Confederate forces. After Lee reported a critical shortage of food, clothing, and supplies among his troops, Breckinridge recommended the removal of <a href="Lucius%20B.%20Northrop">Lucius B. Northrop</a>, the Confederate <a href="Commissariat">commissary general</a>. Northrop's successor, <a href="Isaac%20M.%20St.%20John">Isaac M. St. John</a>, improved the flow of supplies to troops in the field.
By late February, Breckinridge concluded that the Confederate cause was hopeless. Delegating the day-to-day operations of his office to his assistant, <a href="John%20Archibald%20Campbell">John Archibald Campbell</a>, he began laying the groundwork for surrender. Davis desired to continue the fight, but Breckinridge urged, "This has been a magnificent epic. In God's name let it not terminate in farce." On April 2, Lee sent a telegram to Breckinridge informing him that he would have to withdraw from his position that night, and that this would necessitate the evacuation of Richmond. Ordering Campbell to organize the flight of the Confederate cabinet to <a href="Danville%2C%20Virginia">Danville, Virginia</a>, Breckinridge remained in the city to oversee the destruction of facilities and supplies to prevent their use by the invading federal forces. In the process, he ensured that the Confederate archives, both government and military, were captured intact by the Union forces, ensuring that a full account of the Confederate war effort would be preserved for history. Upon his exit from the city, he ordered that the bridges over the <a href="James%20River">James River</a> be burned. His son Clifton, then serving in the <a href="Confederate%20States%20Navy">Confederate Navy</a> at Richmond, resigned his post and joined his father as he moved southward to meet Davis.

After overseeing the transfer of Richmond, Breckinridge joined Lee's forces at <a href="Farmville%2C%20Virginia">Farmville, Virginia</a>, on the night of April 5 and remained there until April 7. He continued on to Danville, arriving on April 11 to discover that <a href="Battle%20of%20Appomattox%20Court%20House">Lee had surrendered</a> on April 9 and the Confederate cabinet had already fled to <a href="Greensboro%2C%20North%20Carolina">Greensboro, North Carolina</a>. Arriving in Greensboro on April 13, he advised the cabinet that the remaining Confederate armies should be surrendered; only Davis and Secretary of State <a href="Judah%20P.%20Benjamin">Judah P. Benjamin</a> disagreed. At <a href="Bennett%20Place">Bennett Place</a>, he assisted Joseph E. Johnston in his surrender negotiations with Major General <a href="William%20Tecumseh%20Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a>. Sherman later praised Breckinridge's negotiating skills, and the surrender terms agreed to were later rejected by Washington as too generous, forcing Sherman to offer the same terms as Grant had at Appomattox, which were accepted.

On April 18, Breckinridge heard from Sherman and Johnston of the <a href="assassination%20of%20Abraham%20Lincoln">assassination of Abraham Lincoln</a> four days earlier; the President had died in the <a href="Petersen%20House">Petersen House</a>, where Breckinridge briefly resided in late 1852 as a congressman. The Kentuckian was visibly devastated. Eyewitness accounts recall him to have said, "Gentlemen, the South has lost its best friend."

Breckinridge rode into <a href="Abbeville%2C%20South%20Carolina">Abbeville, South Carolina</a> on the morning of April 28. While there, Breckinridge and Brigadier General <a href="Basil%20W.%20Duke">Basil W. Duke</a> finally convinced Davis that further prosecution of the war was hopeless. Breckinridge was put in charge of the $150,000 in gold specie remaining in the Confederate treasury; traveling southward by rail toward <a href="Washington%2C%20Georgia">Washington, Georgia</a>, a group of soldiers in his military escort – unpaid for months – threatened to divide the gold among themselves before it could be captured by federal troops. Breckinridge convinced them to abandon their scheme after paying them their wages from the treasury, but some of them refused to escort Breckinridge and the bullion any further. Breckinridge's party arrived in Washington on May 4 and, after paying out several requisitions from the treasury, deposited the rest in banks there. He also composed a letter to his remaining deputies in which he disbanded the War Department.

On May 5, the same day that Davis officially dissolved the Confederate Government in Washington, Georgia, Breckinridge discharged most of the men escorting him, retaining only a small contingent of Kentuckians under the command of his cousin, <a href="William%20Campbell%20Preston%20Breckinridge">William Campbell Preston Breckinridge</a>. Feeling honor bound to protect Davis, he attempted to create a diversion that would allow him to escape. The next day, his party encountered a large Federal force; while his cousin negotiated with the force's commander, Breckinridge and a small detachment escaped. Riding southward across Georgia, they reached Milltown (now <a href="Lakeland%2C%20Georgia">Lakeland</a>) by May 11 and remained there for a few days. Learning of Davis's capture, he left Milltown with only a military aide, a personal servant, and his son Cabell. On May 15, 1865, in <a href="Madison%2C%20Florida">Madison, Florida</a>, he was joined by fellow fugitive <a href="John%20Taylor%20Wood">John Taylor Wood</a>, who had been a captain in the <a href="Confederate%20Navy">Confederate Navy</a>. Breckinridge and Wood decided to flee to the <a href="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, but because Cabell was allergic to mosquito bites, Breckinridge told him to surrender to the nearest federal officer.
At <a href="Gainesville%2C%20Florida">Gainesville, Florida</a>, the group found Confederate Colonel <a href="John%20Jackson%20Dickison">John Jackson Dickison</a>, who gave them a lifeboat he had taken from a captured federal gunboat. Traveling down the <a href="St.%20Johns%20River">St. Johns River</a>, they reached Fort Butler on May 29. From there, they continued on the St. Johns to Lake Harney where the boat was loaded on a wagon and hauled about 12 miles to Sand Point (today's Titusville) on the Indian River. They reached the river by May 31, but as they followed its course southward, they had to drag the boat across the river's <a href="mudflat">mudflat</a>s and <a href="Shoal">sandbars</a>. They stopped at the John C. Houston place on Elbow Creek (Melbourne), where their boat was brought ashore and caulked. When the repairs were completed, Colonel John Taylor Wood, again led the party south. Transferring the boat to the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> near <a href="Jupiter%2C%20Florida">Jupiter Inlet</a>, they continued along the Florida coast and landed near present-day <a href="Palm%20Beach%2C%20Florida">Palm Beach</a> on June 4. Strong winds prevented them from navigating the small craft out to sea, so they continued southward down the coast.

On June 5, the party was spotted by a federal steamer, but convinced the crew they were hunters scavenging the coast. Two days later, they encountered a larger boat with a mast and rigging; chasing it down, they disarmed the occupants and hijacked the craft. As compensation, they gave their old boat and twenty dollars in gold to the owners of the larger craft, and returned some of their weapons after the exchange was complete. With this more seaworthy craft, they decided to flee to <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>. Departing from <a href="Fort%20Dallas">Fort Dallas</a>, they survived an encounter with pirates, two significant storms, and a dangerous lack of provisions before arriving in the city of <a href="C%C3%A1rdenas%2C%20Cuba">Cárdenas</a> on June 11, 1865. A Kentuckian then living in the city recognized Breckinridge, introduced him to the locals, and served as his interpreter. The refugees were given food and stayed the night in a local hotel. The next morning, they traveled by rail to <a href="Havana">Havana</a>, where Breckinridge was offered a house. He declined the offer, choosing to travel with Charles J. Helm, a fellow Kentuckian who had been operating as a Confederate agent in the Caribbean, to Great Britain.
Arriving in Britain in late July, he consulted with former Confederate agents there and arranged communication with his wife, then in Canada. Re-crossing the Atlantic, he was reunited with his wife and all of his children except Clifton in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> on September 13, 1865. The family spent the winter in Toronto, living first in a hotel and then in a rented house. There were quite a number of other Confederate exiles in the city. It was enough, according to Mrs. Breckinridge, "to form quite a pleasant society among ourselves." The family moved to <a href="Niagara%20Falls%2C%20Ontario">Niagara</a> in May. In August, doctors advised Breckinridge's wife that the climate of France might benefit her ailing health. Cabell Breckinridge returned to the U.S. to engage in business ventures with his brother Clifton, and Mary, just 12 years old, was sent to live with relatives in New York. The remainder of the family journeyed to Europe, where the children attended school in <a href="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="Versailles%20%28city%29">Versailles</a>, and <a href="Vevey">Vevey</a>, <a href="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. From mid-1866 to early 1868, Breckinridge toured Europe – including visits to <a href="Germany">Germany</a>, <a href="Austria">Austria</a>, <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a>, <a href="Greece">Greece</a>, <a href="Syria">Syria</a>, <a href="Egypt">Egypt</a>, and the <a href="Holy%20Land">Holy Land</a>; because of her poor health, his wife remained in France until February 1868, when she joined him in <a href="Naples">Naples</a>, <a href="Italy">Italy</a>. During their tour of Italy, Breckinridge met with <a href="Pope%20Pius%20IX">Pope Pius IX</a> in <a href="Rome">Rome</a>, and also visited <a href="Pompeii">Pompeii</a>.

Desiring to return to the U.S. but still fearing capture, Breckinridge moved his family back to Niagara in June 1868. Within sight of the <a href="Canada%E2%80%93United%20States%20border">U.S. border</a>, he steadfastly refused to seek a <a href="clemency">pardon</a>, although 70 members of the Kentucky General Assembly had requested one on his behalf from President <a href="Andrew%20Johnson">Andrew Johnson</a> on February 10, 1866. On January 8, 1868, the <a href="Louisville%2C%20Kentucky">Louisville</a> City Council instructed the state's congressional delegation to seek assurance that Breckinridge would not be prosecuted on his return. James Beck, Breckinridge's old law partner, was then in Congress and wrote to him on December 11, 1868, that it appeared likely that Johnson would issue a general pardon for all former Confederates; he advised Breckinridge to return to the U.S. prior to the pardon being issued because he feared it might only apply to those in the country.

Johnson proclaimed amnesty for all former Confederates on December 25, 1868. Still in Canada, Breckinridge lingered for a few weeks to receive assurance that it still applied to him even though he had not been in the U.S. when it was issued. Departing Canada on February 10, 1869, he made several stops to visit family and friends along the route to Lexington, where he arrived on March 9. Although he resided in Kentucky for the rest of his life, he never bought a home there after the war, living first in hotels and then renting a home on West Second Street.
Many insurance companies in the south asked Breckinridge to join them in various capacities. In August 1868, he became manager of the Kentucky branch of Virginia's Piedmont Life Insurance Company (which soon became the Piedmont and Arlington Insurance Company). Washington College (now <a href="Washington%20and%20Lee%20University">Washington and Lee University</a>) offered him a professorship. He was urged to accept by former Confederate Colonel <a href="William%20Preston%20Johnston">William Preston Johnston</a>, who was already serving as a faculty member, but Breckinridge declined. He resumed his law practice, taking as a partner Robert A. Thornton, a 27-year-old former Confederate soldier. He served as general counsel for the proposed <a href="Cincinnati%2C%20New%20Orleans%20and%20Texas%20Pacific%20Railway">Cincinnati Southern Railway</a>, which would connect Cincinnati to Chattanooga via Lexington. Officials in Louisville tried to block the move, which would break the near-monopoly that the <a href="Louisville%20and%20Nashville%20Railroad">Louisville and Nashville Railroad</a> had on southern trade. On January 25, 1870, he presented his case to the House and Senate railroad committees and, although they rejected it at that time, they approved it two years later. Construction began in 1873.

Breckinridge's other railroad ventures were less successful. During his lifetime, he was unable to secure the construction of railroads to his real estate investments in and around Superior, Wisconsin. As president of the newly formed Elizabethtown, Lexington, and Big Sandy Railroad company, he secured financial backing from <a href="Collis%20Potter%20Huntington">Collis Potter Huntington</a> for a railroad connecting <a href="Elizabethtown%2C%20Kentucky">Elizabethtown</a> and Lexington to the <a href="Big%20Sandy%20River%20%28Ohio%20River%29">Big Sandy River</a> as part of a route linking those cities with the Atlantic Ocean. When Huntington invested in June 1871, he became president of the company, and Breckinridge became vice-president. A line from Lexington to <a href="Mount%20Sterling%2C%20Kentucky">Mount Sterling</a> was all that could be completed before the <a href="Panic%20of%201873">Panic of 1873</a> dried up the needed investment capital. The proposed line was finally completed in 1881.

Breckinridge refused all requests – including one made by President Ulysses S. Grant – to return to politics, insisting, "I no more feel the political excitements that marked the scenes of my former years than if I were an extinct volcano." Under the terms of section 3 of the <a href="Fourteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a>, a <a href="two-thirds%20majority">two-thirds</a> vote in each house of Congress would have been needed to allow him to hold office because he sided with the Confederacy. He never expressed interest in seeking such approval. Speaking as a private citizen in March 1870, he publicly denounced the actions of the <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. In 1872, he supported passage of a state statute which successfully legalized black testimony against whites in court.
By 1873, Breckinridge began to experience health problems which he referred to as "pleuro-pneumonia". Repeated surgeries and visits to the New York coast and the Virginia mountains did not improve his condition. In May 1875, he consulted surgeons <a href="Lewis%20Sayre">Lewis Sayre</a> and <a href="Samuel%20D.%20Gross">Samuel D. Gross</a>, who concluded that his ill health was caused by <a href="cirrhosis">cirrhosis</a> brought on by injuries to his liver suffered during the war. Of more immediate concern was the fluid that filled two-thirds of one of his lungs. On May 11, Sayre attempted to create an artificial opening through which the fluid could drain; although he had to stop before completing the operation, some of the fluid was drained, bringing a measure of relief. Assisted by Beck and Frank K. Hunt, Breckinridge completed his will. Sayre further alleviated Breckinridge's pain via another surgery on the morning of May 17, but by the afternoon, his condition rapidly worsened, and he died at approximately 5:45 p.m. at the age of 54. Basil Duke led the funeral procession to <a href="Lexington%20Cemetery">Lexington Cemetery</a> where Breckinridge's body was buried.

As a military commander, Breckinridge was highly respected. Fellow Confederate George M. Edgar, describing Breckinridge's performance, wrote:
On May 20, 1875, the "Louisville Courier Journal" declared that it was Breckinridge who was "truly representative of the rebellion as an actual force and its underlying causes." He was viewed poorly in the North. The premature "New York Times" 1863 obituary labelled "him one of the basest and wickedest of traitors."

Despite differences in spelling, the towns of <a href="Breckenridge%2C%20Minnesota">Breckenridge, Minnesota</a>, <a href="Breckenridge%2C%20Missouri">Breckenridge, Missouri</a>, <a href="Breckenridge%2C%20Texas">Breckenridge, Texas</a>, and <a href="Breckenridge%2C%20Colorado">Breckenridge, Colorado</a> were named in Breckinridge's honor. The Colorado town changed the spelling of its name when its namesake joined the Confederacy. <a href="Fort%20Breckinridge%2C%20Arizona%20Territory">Fort Breckinridge, Arizona Territory</a> (1860 to 1865), located at the confluence of the <a href="Aravaipa%20Creek">Aravaipa Creek</a> and the <a href="San%20Pedro%20River%20%28Arizona%29">San Pedro River</a>, was named in honor of the Vice President. During the Civil War, its name was changed to Fort Stanford in honor of California Governor <a href="Leland%20Stanford">Leland Stanford</a>, before being changed back to Fort Breckinridge. After the Civil War, the name was changed once again to Camp Grant. Between 1855 and 1862, the county now known as <a href="Lyon%20County%2C%20Kansas">Lyon County</a>, Kansas, was known as Breckinridge County.

Breckinridge was played by <a href="Jason%20Isaacs">Jason Isaacs</a> in the 2014 film "<a href="Field%20of%20Lost%20Shoes">Field of Lost Shoes</a>", which depicted the Battle of New Market.

A <a href="John%20C.%20Breckinridge%20Memorial">memorial to Breckinridge</a> was placed on the Fayette County Courthouse lawn in Lexington in 1887. The racially motivated <a href="Charleston%20church%20shooting">Charleston church shooting</a> in South Carolina in June 2015 reinvigorated demands for the removal of monuments dedicated to prominent pro-slavery and Confederate figures. In November 2015, a committee, the Urban County Arts Review Board's, voted to recommend removal of both the Breckinridge statue and the <a href="John%20Hunt%20Morgan">John Hunt Morgan</a> statue from the Courthouse grounds. Amy Murrell Taylor, an associate professor of history at the <a href="University%20of%20Kentucky">University of Kentucky</a>, claimed that the "statues are not and have never been neutral representations of the Civil War past but instead they are embodiments of a racially charged postwar interpretation of it."

The 777 is produced in two fuselage lengths . The original 777-200 variant entered commercial service in 1995, followed by the extended-range 777-200ER in 1997. The stretched 777-300, which is longer, followed in 1998. The initial 777-200, extended-range -200ER, and -300 versions are equipped with <a href="General%20Electric%20GE90">General Electric GE90</a>, <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW4000">Pratt & Whitney PW4000</a>, or <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Trent%20800">Rolls-Royce Trent 800</a> engines. They have since been collectively referred to as 777 Classics. The extended-range 777-300ER and ultra long-range 777-200LR variants entered service in 2004 and 2006 respectively, while the 777F, a <a href="Cargo%20aircraft">freighter</a> version, debuted in February 2009; these second-generation variants all feature high-output GE90 engines and extended <a href="Wingtip%20device%23Raked%20wingtip">raked wingtips</a>. The 777-200LR is one of the world's longest-range airliners, able to fly more than halfway around the globe and holds the record for the longest distance <a href="Non-stop%20flight">flown non-stop</a> by a <a href="commercial%20aircraft">commercial aircraft</a>. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of the third-generation of the 777, the <a href="Boeing%20777X">777X</a>, consisting of the 777-8 and 777-9 variants. The 777X features composite folding wings and GE9X engines plus further technologies developed for the <a href="Boeing%20787">Boeing 787</a>, and is scheduled to enter service by 2020.

The 777 first entered commercial service with <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> on June 7, 1995. The 777 has received more orders than any other wide-body airliner; , more than 60 customers had placed orders for 2,013 aircraft of all variants, with 1,584 delivered. The most common and successful variant is the 777-300ER with 799 delivered and 844 orders; <a href="Emirates%20%28airline%29">Emirates</a> operates the largest 777 fleet, with 163 passenger and freighter aircraft . The 777 has been involved in six <a href="hull%20loss">hull loss</a>es ; the <a href="Asiana%20Airlines%20Flight%20214">Asiana Airlines Flight 214</a> accident in July 2013 was its first fatal crash in 18 years of service, and the shootdown of <a href="Malaysia%20Airlines%20Flight%2017">Malaysia Airlines Flight 17</a> in July 2014 is its deadliest crash .

The 777 ranks as one of Boeing's best-selling models, making it the most-produced Boeing wide-body jet, surpassing the Boeing 747. Airlines have acquired the type as a comparatively <a href="Fuel%20efficiency">fuel-efficient</a> alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the <a href="Airbus%20A330">Airbus A330-300</a>, the <a href="Airbus%20A350%20XWB">Airbus A350 XWB</a>, and the out-of-production <a href="Airbus%20A340">A340</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20MD-11">McDonnell Douglas MD-11</a>. The <a href="Boeing%20787%20Dreamliner">787 Dreamliner</a>, which entered service in 2011, shares some design features with the 777.

In the early 1970s, the <a href="Boeing%20747">Boeing 747</a>, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10">McDonnell Douglas DC-10</a>, and the <a href="Lockheed%20L-1011%20TriStar">Lockheed L-1011 TriStar</a> became the first generation of <a href="Wide-body%20aircraft">wide-body passenger airliners</a> to enter service. In 1978, <a href="Boeing">Boeing</a> unveiled three new models: the twin-engine <a href="Boeing%20757">Boeing 757</a> to replace its <a href="Boeing%20727">727</a>, the twin-engine <a href="Boeing%20767">767</a> to challenge the <a href="Airbus%20A300">Airbus A300</a>, and a <a href="trijet">trijet</a> 777 concept to compete with the DC-10 and L-1011. The mid-size 757 and 767 launched to market success, due in part to 1980s' extended-range twin-engine operational performance standards (<a href="ETOPS">ETOPS</a>) regulations governing transoceanic twinjet operations. These regulations allowed twin-engine airliners to make ocean crossings at up to three hours' distance from emergency <a href="Diversion%20airport">diversionary airport</a>s. Under ETOPS rules, airlines began operating the 767 on long-distance overseas routes that did not require the capacity of larger airliners. The trijet 777 was later dropped, following marketing studies that favored the 757 and 767 variants. Boeing was left with a size and range gap in its product line between the <a href="Boeing%20767">767-300ER</a> and the <a href="Boeing%20747-400">747-400</a>.

By the late 1980s, DC-10 and L-1011 models were approaching retirement age, prompting manufacturers to develop replacement designs. McDonnell Douglas was working on the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20MD-11">MD-11</a>, a stretched and upgraded successor of the DC-10, while Airbus was developing its A330 and A340 series. In 1986, Boeing unveiled proposals for an enlarged 767, tentatively named 767-X, to target the replacement market for first-generation wide-bodies such as the DC-10, and to complement existing 767 and 747 models in the company lineup. The initial proposal featured a longer fuselage and larger wings than the existing 767, along with <a href="winglet">winglet</a>s. Later plans expanded the fuselage cross-section but retained the existing 767 <a href="Cockpit">flight deck</a>, nose, and other elements.

Airline customers were uninterested in the 767-X proposals, and instead wanted an even wider fuselage cross-section, fully flexible interior configurations, short- to intercontinental-range capability, and an <a href="operating%20cost">operating cost</a> lower than any 767 stretch. Airline planners' requirements for larger aircraft had become increasingly specific, adding to the heightened competition among aircraft manufacturers. By 1988, Boeing realized that the only answer was a new clean–sheet design, which became the 777 twinjet. The company opted for the twin-engine configuration given past design successes, projected engine developments, and reduced-cost benefits. On December 8, 1989, Boeing began issuing offers to airlines for the 777.

The design phase for the new twinjet was different from Boeing's previous commercial jetliners. For the first time, eight major airlines – <a href="All%20Nippon%20Airways">All Nippon Airways</a>, <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a>, <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a>, <a href="Cathay%20Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a>, <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>, <a href="Japan%20Airlines">Japan Airlines</a>, <a href="Qantas">Qantas</a>, and <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> – had a role in the development. This was a departure from industry practice, where manufacturers typically designed aircraft with minimal customer input. The eight airlines that contributed to the design process became known within Boeing as the "Working Together" group. At the first group meeting in January 1990, a 23-page questionnaire was distributed to the airlines, asking what each wanted in the design. By March 1990, Boeing and the airlines had decided upon a basic design configuration: a cabin cross-section close to the 747's, capacity up to 325 passengers, flexible interiors, a <a href="glass%20cockpit">glass cockpit</a>, <a href="fly-by-wire">fly-by-wire</a> controls, and 10 percent better <a href="Available%20seat%20miles">seat-mile costs</a> than the A330 and MD-11. Boeing selected its <a href="Boeing%20Everett%20Factory">Everett factory</a> in Washington, home of 747 production, as the 777's final assembly site.

On October 14, 1990, United Airlines became the 777's launch customer when it placed an order for 34 <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney">Pratt & Whitney</a>-powered aircraft valued at US$11 billion with <a href="Option%20%28aircraft%20purchasing%29">options</a> on an additional 34. The development phase coincided with United's replacement program for its aging DC-10s. United required that the new aircraft be capable of flying three different routes: Chicago to Hawaii, Chicago to Europe, and non-stop from <a href="Denver">Denver</a>, a <a href="hot%20and%20high">hot and high</a> airport, to Hawaii. ETOPS certification was also a priority for United, given the overwater portion of United's Hawaii routes. In January 1993, a team of United developers joined other airline teams and Boeing designers at the Everett factory. The 240 design teams, with up to 40 members each, addressed almost 1,500 design issues with individual aircraft components. The fuselage diameter was increased to suit Cathay Pacific, the baseline model grew longer for All Nippon Airways, and British Airways' input led to added built-in testing and interior flexibility, along with higher operating weight options.

The 777 was the first commercial aircraft designed entirely by computer. Each design drawing was created on a three-dimensional <a href="Computer-aided%20design">CAD</a> software system known as <a href="CATIA">CATIA</a>, sourced from <a href="Dassault%20Systemes">Dassault Systemes</a> and <a href="IBM">IBM</a>. This lets engineers assemble a virtual aircraft, in simulation, to check for interference and verify that the thousands of parts fit properly—thus reducing costly rework. Boeing developed its own high-performance visualization system, FlyThru, later called IVT (Integrated Visualization Tool) to support large-scale collaborative engineering design reviews, production illustrations, and other uses of the CAD data outside of engineering. Boeing was initially not convinced of <a href="CATIA">CATIA</a>'s abilities and built a physical <a href="mockup">mock-up</a> of the nose section to verify its results. The test was so successful that additional mock-ups were canceled.

The production process included substantial international content, an unprecedented level of global subcontracting for a Boeing jetliner, later exceeded by the 787. International contributors included <a href="Mitsubishi%20Heavy%20Industries">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</a> and <a href="Kawasaki%20Heavy%20Industries">Kawasaki Heavy Industries</a> (fuselage panels), <a href="Fuji%20Heavy%20Industries%2C%20Ltd.">Fuji Heavy Industries, Ltd.</a> (center wing section), <a href="Hawker%20de%20Havilland">Hawker de Havilland</a> (<a href="Elevator%20%28aircraft%29">elevators</a>), and <a href="Government%20Aircraft%20Factories">Aerospace Technologies of Australia</a> (<a href="Flight%20control%20surfaces%23Rudder">rudder</a>). An agreement between Boeing and the Japan Aircraft Development Corporation, representing Japanese aerospace contractors, made the latter risk-sharing partners for 20 percent of the entire development program. The initial 777-200 model was launched with propulsion options from three manufacturers, <a href="General%20Electric">General Electric</a>, <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney">Pratt & Whitney</a>, and <a href="Rolls-Royce%20plc">Rolls-Royce</a>, giving the airlines their choice of engines from competing firms. Each manufacturer agreed to develop an engine in the and higher <a href="Jet%20engine%23Thrust">thrust</a> class (a measure of jet engine output) for the world's largest twinjet.

To accommodate production of its new airliner, Boeing doubled the size of the Everett factory at the cost of nearly US$1.5 billion to provide space for two new <a href="assembly%20line">assembly line</a>s. New production methodologies were developed, including a turn machine that could rotate fuselage subassemblies 180 degrees, giving workers access to upper body sections. Major assembly of the first aircraft began on January 4, 1993. By the start of production, the program had amassed 118 firm orders, with options for 95 more from 10 airlines. Total investment in the program was estimated at over US$4 billion from Boeing, with an additional US$2 billion from suppliers.

On April 9, 1994, the first 777, line number WA001, was rolled out in a series of 15 ceremonies held during the day to accommodate the 100,000 invited guests. The first flight took place on June 12, 1994, under the command of chief test pilot John E. Cashman. This marked the start of an 11-month flight test program that was more extensive than testing for any previous Boeing model. Nine aircraft fitted with General Electric, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce engines were flight tested at locations ranging from the desert airfield at <a href="Edwards%20Air%20Force%20Base">Edwards Air Force Base</a> in California to frigid conditions in Alaska, mainly <a href="Fairbanks%20International%20Airport">Fairbanks International Airport</a>. To satisfy ETOPS requirements, eight 180-minute single-engine test flights were performed. The first aircraft built was used by Boeing's <a href="nondestructive%20testing">nondestructive testing</a> campaign from 1994 to 1996, and provided data for the -200ER and -300 programs. At the successful conclusion of flight testing, the 777 was awarded simultaneous airworthiness certification by the U.S. <a href="Federal%20Aviation%20Administration">Federal Aviation Administration</a> (FAA) and European <a href="Joint%20Aviation%20Authorities">Joint Aviation Authorities</a> (JAA) on April 19, 1995.
Boeing delivered the first 777 to United Airlines on May 15, 1995. The FAA awarded 180-minute ETOPS clearance ("<a href="ETOPS%23ETOPS%20extensions">ETOPS-180</a>") for the <a href="Pratt%20%26amp%3B%20Whitney%20PW4000">Pratt & Whitney PW4084</a>-engined aircraft on May 30, 1995, making it the first airliner to carry an ETOPS-180 rating at its entry into service. The first commercial flight took place on June 7, 1995, from <a href="London%20Heathrow%20Airport">London Heathrow Airport</a> to <a href="Washington%20Dulles%20International%20Airport">Dulles International Airport</a> near Washington, D.C. Longer ETOPS clearance of 207 minutes was approved in October 1996.

On November 12, 1995, Boeing delivered the first model with <a href="General%20Electric%20GE90">General Electric GE90</a>-77B engines to British Airways, which entered service five days later. Initial service was affected by <a href="gearbox">gearbox</a> bearing wear issues, which caused British Airways to temporarily withdraw its 777 fleet from <a href="transatlantic%20flight">transatlantic</a> service in 1997, returning to full service later that year. General Electric subsequently announced engine upgrades.

The first <a href="Rolls-Royce%20Trent%20800">Rolls-Royce Trent 877</a>-powered aircraft was delivered to <a href="Thai%20Airways%20International">Thai Airways International</a> on March 31, 1996, completing the introduction of the three powerplants initially developed for the airliner. Each engine-aircraft combination had secured ETOPS-180 certification from the point of entry into service. By June 1997, orders for the 777 numbered 323 from 25 airlines, including satisfied launch customers that had ordered additional aircraft. Operations performance data established the consistent capabilities of the twinjet over long-haul transoceanic routes, leading to additional sales. By 1998, the 777 fleet had approached 900,000 flight hours. Boeing states that the 777 fleet has a dispatch reliability (rate of departure from the gate with no more than 15 minutes delay due to technical issues) above 99 percent.

After the original model, Boeing developed an increased <a href="gross%20weight">gross weight</a> variant of the 777-200 with greater range and <a href="Payload%20%28air%20and%20space%20craft%29">payload</a> capability. Initially named 777-200IGW, the 777-200ER first flew on October 7, 1996, received FAA and JAA certification on January 17, 1997, and entered service with British Airways on February 9, 1997. Offering greater long-haul performance, the variant became the most widely ordered version of the aircraft through the early 2000s. On April 2, 1997, a <a href="Malaysia%20Airlines">Malaysia Airlines</a> -200ER named "Super Ranger" broke the <a href="great%20circle">great circle</a> "distance without landing" record for an airliner by flying eastward from <a href="Boeing%20Field">Boeing Field</a>, <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> to <a href="KLIA">Kuala Lumpur</a>, a distance of , in 21 hours and 23 minutes.

Following the introduction of the -200ER, Boeing turned its attention to a stretched version of the airliner. On October 16, 1997, the 777-300 made its first flight. At in length, the -300 became the longest airliner yet produced (until the <a href="Airbus%20A340">A340-600</a>), and had a 20 percent greater overall capacity than the standard length model. The -300 was awarded type certification simultaneously from the FAA and JAA on May 4, 1998, and entered service with launch customer Cathay Pacific on May 27, 1998.

The first generation of Boeing 777 models, the -200, -200ER, and -300 have since been known collectively known as Boeing 777 Classics.

From the program's start, Boeing had considered building <a href="Non-stop%20flight">ultra-long-range</a> variants. Early plans centered on a 777-100X proposal, a shortened variant of the -200 with reduced weight and increased range, similar to the <a href="Boeing%20747SP">747SP</a>. However, the -100X would have carried fewer passengers than the -200 while having similar operating costs, leading to a higher cost per seat. By the late 1990s, design plans shifted to longer-range versions of existing models. In March 1997, the Boeing board approved the 777-200X/300X specifications: 298 passengers in three classes over 8,600 nmi (15,900 km) for the 200X and with 355 passengers in a tri-class layout for the 300X, with design freeze planned in May 1998, 200X certification in August 2000, and introduction in September and in January 2001 for the 300X.

A more powerful engine in the thrust class of was required, leading to talks between Boeing and engine manufacturers. General Electric offered to develop the GE90-115B engine, while Rolls-Royce proposed developing the <a href="Rolls%20Royce%20Trent">Trent 8104</a> engine. In 1999, Boeing announced an agreement with General Electric, beating out rival proposals. Under the deal with General Electric, Boeing agreed to only offer GE90 engines on new 777 versions.

On February 29, 2000, Boeing launched its next-generation twinjet program, initially called 777-X, and began issuing offers to airlines. Development was slowed by an industry downturn during the early 2000s. The first model to emerge from the program, the 777-300ER, was launched with an order for ten aircraft from <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a>, along with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA (<a href="European%20Aviation%20Safety%20Agency">European Aviation Safety Agency</a>, successor to the JAA) certified the model on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.

The second long-range model, the 777-200LR, rolled out on February 15, 2005, and completed its first flight on March 8, 2005. The -200LR was certified by both the FAA and EASA on February 2, 2006, and the first delivery to <a href="Pakistan%20International%20Airlines">Pakistan International Airlines</a> occurred on February 26, 2006. On November 10, 2005, the first -200LR set a record for the longest non-stop flight of a passenger airliner by flying eastward from Hong Kong to London. Lasting 22 hours and 42 minutes, the flight surpassed the -200LR's standard design range and was logged in the "<a href="Guinness%20World%20Records">Guinness World Records</a>".

The production freighter model, the 777F, rolled out on May 23, 2008. The maiden flight of the 777F, which used the structural design and engine specifications of the -200LR along with fuel tanks derived from the -300ER, occurred on July 14, 2008. FAA and EASA type certification for the freighter was received on February 6, 2009, and the first delivery to launch customer Air France took place on February 19, 2009.

Initially second to the 747 as Boeing's most <a href="profit%20%28economics%29">profitable</a> jetliner, the 777 became the company's most lucrative model in the 2000s. Program sales accounted for an estimated US$400 million of Boeing's <a href="Earnings%20before%20taxes">pretax earnings</a> in 2000, US$50 million more than the 747. By 2004, the airliner accounted for the bulk of wide-body <a href="revenue">revenue</a>s for the Boeing Commercial Airplanes <a href="division%20%28business%29">division</a>. In 2007, orders for second-generation 777 models approached 350 aircraft, and in November of that year, Boeing announced that all production slots were sold out to 2012. The program backlog of 356 orders was valued at US$95 billion at <a href="list%20price">list price</a>s in 2008.
In 2010, Boeing announced plans to increase production from 5 aircraft per month to 7 aircraft per month by mid-2011, and 8.3 per month by early 2013. Complete assembly of each 777-300ER requires 49 days. In November 2011, assembly began on the 1,000th 777, a -300ER model for <a href="Emirates%20%28airline%29">Emirates</a>; which was rolled out in March 2012.

By April 2014, with cumulative sales surpassing those of the 747, the 777 became the best-selling wide-body airliner; at existing production rates, the aircraft was on track to become the most-delivered wide-body airliner by mid-2016.

In January 2016, Boeing confirmed plans to reduce the production rate of the 777 family from 8.3 per month to 7 per month in 2017 to help close the production gap between the 777 and 777X created by a lack of new orders. In 2018, assembling test 777-9 aircraft is expected to lower output to an effective rate of 5.5 per month. Boeing will drop 777 production to five per month in August 2017.

The smaller Boeing 787 was the first stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the <a href="Boeing%20Yellowstone%20Project">Boeing Yellowstone Project</a>. Reportedly, the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new aircraft family, Yellowstone 3, which would draw upon technologies from the 787.
By the late 2000s, the 777 was facing increased potential competition from Airbus' planned A350 XWB and internally from proposed 787 variants, both airliners that promise fuel efficiency improvements. As a consequence, the 777-300ER received an engine and aerodynamics improvement package for reduced drag and weight. In 2010, the variant further received a <a href="Maximum%20Zero-Fuel%20Weight">maximum zero-fuel weight</a> increase, equivalent to a higher payload of 20–25 passengers; its GE90-115B1 engines received a 1–2.5 percent thrust enhancement for increased takeoff weights at higher-altitude airports. More changes were targeted for late 2012, including possible extension of the <a href="wingspan">wingspan</a>, along with other major changes, including a composite wing, new powerplant, and different fuselage lengths. Emirates was reportedly working closely with Boeing on the project, possibly being the launch customer for new 777 versions. <a href="China%20Airlines">China Airlines</a> ordered ten 777-300ER aircraft to replace 747-400s on routes between <a href="Taipei">Taipei</a> and <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> and <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>, telling "Aviation Week and Space Technology" that the 777-300ER's per seat cost is about 20% lower than the 747's costs (varying due to fuel prices). Four of the 777 aircraft were already flying .

Boeing has worked with General Electric to offer a 2% improvement in fuel efficiency to new aircraft beginning in 2016. GE will improve the fan module and the high pressure compressor stage-1 <a href="blisk">blisk</a> in the GE-90-115 turbofan, as well as reduce clearances between the tips of the turbine blades and the shroud during cruise. These improvements, of which the latter is the most important and was derived from work to develop the <a href="Boeing%20787">787</a>, will, GE says, lower fuel burn by 0.5%. Boeing's wing modification will deliver the remainder. Boeing stated that every 1% improvement in the 777-300ER's fuel burn translates into being able to fly the aircraft another 75 nautical miles on the same load of fuel, or add ten passengers or 2,400 lb of cargo to a "load limited" flight.

In March 2015, additional details of the improvement package were published in "Aviation Week & Space Technology". The 777-300ER is to shed 1,800 lb. Boeing will replace the fuselage crown with tie rods and composite integration panels, similar to those used on the 787. New flight control software is to eliminate the need for the tail skid by keeping the tail off the runway surface regardless of the extent to which pilots command the elevators. Boeing is also redesigning the inboard flap fairings to reduce drag by reducing pressure on the underside of the wing. The outboard raked wingtip is to have a divergent trailing edge, described as a "poor man's airfoil" by Boeing; this originally developed for the <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20MD-12">McDonnell Douglas MD-12</a> project. Another change involves elevator trim bias. These changes are to increase fuel efficiency and allow airlines to add 14 additional seats to the airplane, increasing per seat fuel efficiency by 5%.

Mindful of the long time required to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve fuel efficiency, as well as lower prices for the existing product. , the backlog of undelivered 777s totals 278 aircraft, representing just under three years of current production at 8.3 aircraft per month, causing Boeing to ponder the 2018-2020 time frame. In January 2015, <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, normally costing around $150 million each but paid around $130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.

, Boeing lists prices for the 777-200ER, -200LR, 777F, and -300ER. The -200ER is the only Classic variant available.

Boeing introduced a number of advanced technologies with the 777 design, including fully digital <a href="Fly-by%20wire">fly-by-wire</a> controls, fully software-configurable <a href="avionics">avionics</a>, <a href="Honeywell">Honeywell</a> <a href="Liquid%20crystal%20display">LCD</a> glass cockpit flight displays, and the first use of a <a href="fiber%20optic">fiber optic</a> avionics network on a commercial airliner. Boeing made use of work done on the cancelled <a href="Boeing%207J7">Boeing 7J7</a> regional jet, which utilized similar versions of the chosen technologies. In 2003, Boeing began offering the option of cockpit <a href="electronic%20flight%20bag">electronic flight bag</a> computer displays. In 2013, Boeing announced that the upgraded 777X models would incorporate airframe, systems, and interior technologies from the 787.

In designing the 777 as its first fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional <a href="Yoke%20%28aircraft%29">control yokes</a> rather than change to <a href="Side-stick">sidestick</a> controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional <a href="Aircraft%20flight%20control%20system">yoke and rudder</a> controls, the cockpit features a simplified layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates <a href="flight%20envelope%20protection">flight envelope protection</a>, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent <a href="stall%20%28flight%29">stalls</a>, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.

The wings on the 777 feature a <a href="supercritical%20airfoil">supercritical airfoil</a> design that is swept back at 31.6 degrees and optimized for cruising at Mach 0.83 (revised after flight tests up to Mach 0.84). The wings are designed with increased thickness and a longer <a href="wingspan">span</a> than previous airliners, resulting in greater payload and range, improved takeoff performance, and a higher <a href="cruising%20altitude">cruising altitude</a>. The wings also serve as fuel storage, with longer-range models able to carry up to of fuel. This capacity allows the 777-200LR to operate ultra-long-distance, trans-polar routes such as <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> to <a href="Hong%20Kong">Hong Kong</a>. In 2013, a new wing made of <a href="composite%20material">composite material</a>s was introduced for the upgraded 777X, with a wider span and design features based on the 787's wings.

Unlike smaller airliners like the <a href="Boeing%20737">Boeing 737</a>, no current 777 wings have <a href="wingtip%20device">winglet</a>s; instead, the exceptionally long raked wings of the 777 serve the same drag-reducing function. Large <a href="folding%20wing">folding wing</a>tips, long, were offered when the 777 was first launched, to appeal to airlines who might use gates made to accommodate smaller aircraft, but no airline purchased this option. Folding wingtips reemerged as a design feature at the announcement of the upgraded 777X in 2013. Smaller folding wingtips of in length will allow 777X models to use the same airport gates and taxiways as earlier 777s. These smaller folding wingtips are less complex than those proposed for earlier 777s, and internally only affect the wiring needed for wingtip lights.
The <a href="airframe">airframe</a> incorporates the use of composite materials, which comprise nine percent of its original structural weight (all models outside the 777-8 and 777-9). Elements made from composite material include the cabin floor and rudder. The main fuselage cross-section is circular and tapers rearward into a blade-shaped tail cone with a port-facing <a href="auxiliary%20power%20unit">auxiliary power unit</a>. The aircraft also features the largest <a href="landing%20gear">landing gear</a> and the biggest tires ever used in a commercial jetliner. The six-wheel <a href="Bogie%23Bogie%20%28aircraft%29">bogies</a> are designed to spread the load of the aircraft over a wide area without requiring an additional centerline gear. This helps reduce weight and simplifies the aircraft's braking and hydraulic systems. Each tire of a 777-300ER six-wheel main landing gear can carry a load of , which is heavier than other wide-bodies such as the 747-400. The aircraft has triple redundant <a href="hydraulic">hydraulic</a> systems with only one system required for landing. A <a href="ram%20air%20turbine">ram air turbine</a> –a small retractable propeller which can provide emergency power– is also fitted in the <a href="wing%20root">wing root</a> <a href="Aircraft%20fairing">fairing</a>.

The original 777 interior, also known as the Boeing Signature Interior, features curved panels, larger <a href="Airliner%23Overhead%20bins">overhead bins</a>, and indirect lighting. Seating options range from four to six abreast in <a href="First%20class%20%28aviation%29">first class</a> up to 10 across in <a href="economy%20class">economy</a>. The 777's windows were the largest of any current commercial airliner until the 787, and measure by in size (all models outside the 777-8 and -9). The cabin also features "Flexibility Zones", which entails deliberate placement of water, electrical, <a href="pneumatic">pneumatic</a>, and other connection points throughout the interior space, allowing airlines to move seats, <a href="Galley%20%28kitchen%29">galleys</a>, and lavatories quickly and more easily when adjusting cabin arrangements. Several aircraft have also been fitted with <a href="VIP">VIP</a> interiors for non-airline use. Boeing designed a hydraulically damped toilet seat cover hinge that closes slowly.
In 2003, Boeing introduced overhead crew rests as an option on the 777. Located above the main cabin and connected via staircases, the forward flight crew rest contains two seats and two bunks, while the aft cabin crew rest features multiple bunks. The Signature Interior has since been adapted for other Boeing wide-body and narrow-body aircraft, including <a href="Boeing%20737%20Next%20Generation">737NG</a>, <a href="Boeing%20747-400">747-400</a>, <a href="Boeing%20757">757-300</a>, and newer <a href="Boeing%20767">767</a> models, including all <a href="767-400ER">767-400ER</a> models. The <a href="Boeing%20747-8">747-8</a> and 767-400ER have also adopted the larger, more rounded windows of the original 777.

In 2011, "Flight International" reported that Boeing is considering replacing the Signature Interior on the 777 with a new interior similar to that on the 787, as part of a move towards a "common cabin experience" across all Boeing platforms. With the launch of the 777X in 2013, Boeing confirmed that the aircraft would be receiving a new interior featuring 787 cabin elements and larger windows. Further details released in 2014 included re-sculpted cabin sidewalls for greater interior room, noise-dampening technology, and higher cabin humidity.

Boeing uses two characteristics – <a href="fuselage">fuselage</a> length and <a href="Range%20%28aircraft%29">range</a> – to define its 777 models. Passengers and cargo capacity varies by fuselage length: the 777-300 stretched the base 777-200 in 1998. Three range categories were defined: the A-market would cover domestic and regional operations, the B-market would cover routes from Europe to the US West coast and the C-market the longest transpacific routes. The A-market would be covered by a range, MTOW aircraft for 353 to 374 passengers powered by engines, followed by a B-market range for 286 passengers in three-class, with unit thrust and of MTOW, an <a href="A340">A340</a> competitor, basis of an A-market 409 to 434 passengers stretch, and eventually a C-market with engines.

When referring to different variants, the <a href="International%20Air%20Transport%20Association">International Air Transport Association</a> (IATA) code collapses the 777 model designator and the -200 or -300 variant designator to "772" or "773". The <a href="International%20Civil%20Aviation%20Organization">International Civil Aviation Organization</a> (ICAO) aircraft type designator system adds a preceding manufacturer letter for "B772" or "B773". Designations may append a range identifier like "B77W" for the 777-300ER by the ICAO, "77W" for the IATA. Other notations include "773ER" and "773B" for the -300ER.

The initial 777-200 made its maiden flight on June 12, 1994 and was first delivered to <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> on May 15, 1995. With a 545,000 lb (247,200 kg) MTOW and engines, it has a range of with 305 passengers in three-class. The -200 was aimed at U.S. <a href="Domestic%20airport">domestic airline</a>s. Nine different -200 customers have taken delivery of 88 aircraft, with 55 in airline service . The competing Airbus is the <a href="A330-300">A330-300</a>.

The B-market 777-200ER ("ER" for Extended Range), originally known as the 777-200IGW (increased <a href="gross%20weight">gross weight</a>), has additional fuel capacity and an increased <a href="maximum%20takeoff%20weight">MTOW</a> for <a href="transatlantic%20flight">transatlantic</a> routes. With a 658,000 lb (298.46 t) MTOW and engines, it has a range. It was delivered first to <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> on February 6, 1997. Thirty-three customers received 422 deliveries, with no unfilled orders .
, 338 examples of the -200ER are in airline service. It competed with the <a href="A340-300">A340-300</a>. Boeing proposes the <a href="787-10">787-10</a> to replace it. The value of a new -200ER rose from $110 million at service entry to $130 million in 2007; a 2007 model 777 was selling for $30 million ten years later, while the oldest ones had a value around $5–6 million, depending on the remaining engine time.
It could be delivered de-rated with reduced engine thrust for shorter routes to lower the MTOW, reduce purchase price and <a href="landing%20fee">landing fee</a>s (as 777-200 specifications) but can be re-rated to full standard. <a href="Singapore%20Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> ordered over half of its -200ERs de-rated.
A British Airways 777-200ER flew the fastest New York to London <a href="subsonic%20flight">subsonic flight</a> at 5 hours and 16 minutes in January 2015 due to strong tail winds. 

The 777-200LR ("LR" for Longer Range), the C-market model, entered service in 2006 as one of the longest-range commercial airliners. Boeing named it "Worldliner" as it can connect almost any two airports in the world, although it is subject to ETOPS restrictions. It holds the world record for the longest nonstop flight by a commercial airliner. It has a maximum design range of . The -200LR was intended for <a href="ultra%20long-haul">ultra long-haul</a> routes such as <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="Singapore">Singapore</a>.

Developed alongside the -300ER, the -200LR features an increased MTOW and three optional auxiliary fuel tanks in the rear cargo hold. Other new features include extended raked wingtips, redesigned main landing gear, and additional structural strengthening. As with the -300ER and 777F, the -200LR is equipped with wingtip extensions of 12.8 ft (3.90 m). The -200LR is powered by GE90-110B1 or GE90-115B turbofans. The first -200LR was delivered to <a href="Pakistan%20International%20Airlines">Pakistan International Airlines</a> on February 26, 2006. Eleven different -200LR customers took delivery of 59 aircraft, with no unfilled orders. Airlines operated 50 of the -200LR variant . Delta Air Lines and Emirates are the largest operators of the LR variant, each operating 10 aircraft. The closest competing aircraft from Airbus are the discontinued <a href="A340-500HGW">A340-500HGW</a> and the <a href="Airbus%20A350%20XWB%23A350-900ULR">A350-900ULR</a>.

Launched at the <a href="Paris%20Air%20Show">Paris Air Show</a> on June 26, 1995, its major assembly started in March 1997 and its body was joined on July 21, it was rolled-out on September 8 and made its first flight on October 16. The 777 was designed to be stretched by 20%: 60 extra seats to almost 370 in tri-class, 75 more to 451 in two classes, or up to 550 in all-economy like the <a href="Boeing%20747%23747SR">747SR</a> short-range variant. The stretch is done with in ten frames forward and in nine frames aft for a length, longer than the 747-400. It uses the -200IGW fuel capacity and engines with a MTOW.

It has ground maneuvering cameras for <a href="taxiing">taxiing</a> and a <a href="tailstrike">tailskid</a> to <a href="rotation%20%28aeronautics%29">rotate</a>, while the proposed MTOW -300X will need a semi-levered main gear. Its overwing fuselage section 44 was strengthened, with its skin thickness going from the -200's , and received a new evacuation door pair. Its <a href="operating%20empty%20weight">operating empty weight</a> with Rolls-Royce engines in typical tri-class layout is compared to for a similarly configured -200. Boeing wanted to deliver 170 -300s by 2006 and to produce 28 per year by 2002, to replace <a href="Boeing%20747%20Classic">Boeing 747 Classic</a>s, burning one-third less fuel with 40% lower maintenance costs.

With a 660,000 lb (299,370 kg) MTOW and engines, it has a range of with 368 passengers in three-class. Eight different customers have taken delivery of 60 aircraft of the variant, with 48 in airline service . The last -300 was delivered in 2006 while the longer-range -300ER started deliveries in 2004.

The 777-300ER ("ER" for Extended Range) is the B-market version of the -300. Its higher <a href="MTOW">MTOW</a> and increased fuel capacity permits a maximum range of with 396 passengers in a two-class seating arrangement. The 777-300ER features raked and extended wingtips, a strengthened fuselage and wings and a modified main landing gear. Its wings have an <a href="Aspect%20ratio%20%28aerodynamics%29">aspect ratio</a> of 9.0. It is powered by the <a href="General%20Electric%20GE90%23Variants">GE90-115B</a> turbofan, the world's most powerful jet engine with a maximum thrust of . Following flight testing, aerodynamic refinements have reduced fuel burn by an additional 1.4%. At , FL300, -59 °C and at a weight, it burns of fuel per hour, its <a href="operating%20empty%20weight">operating empty weight</a> is .
Since its launch, the -300ER has been a primary driver of the twinjet's sales past the rival A330/340 series. Its direct competitors have included the <a href="Airbus%20A340">Airbus A340</a>-600 and the <a href="A350-1000">A350-1000</a>. Using two engines produces a typical <a href="operating%20cost">operating cost</a> advantage of around 8–9% for the -300ER over the A340-600. Several airlines have acquired the -300ER as a 747-400 replacement amid rising fuel prices given its 20% fuel burn advantage. The -300ER has an operating cost of $44 per seat hour, compared to an <a href="Airbus%20A380">Airbus A380</a>'s roughly $50 per seat hour (hourly cost is about $26,000), and $90 per seat hour for a <a href="Boeing%20747-400">Boeing 747-400</a> .
The first -300ER was delivered to <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a> on April 29, 2004. The -300ER is the best-selling 777 variant, having surpassed the -200ER in orders in 2010 and deliveries in 2013. , 784 Boeing 777-300ER aircraft were in service. , -300ER deliveries to 45 different customers totalled 799, with 45 unfilled orders.
At its peak, a new 777-300ER was valued $170 million, falling to $150 million in 2019.
In July 2018, Boeing was studying a 777-300ER <a href="Cargo%20aircraft">freighter</a> conversion, targeted for the <a href="Volumetric%20weight">volumetric</a> market instead of the <a href="density">density</a> market served by the 777F.
After having considered a -200ER P2F program, Boeing hopes to conclude its study by fall as the <a href="777X">777X</a> replacing aging -300ERs from 2020 will generate <a href="feedstock">feedstock</a>. New-build 777-300ER freighters may maintain the delivery rate at five per month, to bridge the production gap until the 777X is delivered.

The 777 Freighter (777F) is an all-cargo version of the twinjet, and shares features with the -200LR; these include its airframe, engines, and fuel capacity. With a maximum payload of (similar to the of the <a href="Boeing%20747">Boeing 747-200F</a>), it has a range of 4,970 nmi (9,200 km). Greater range is possible if less cargo weight is carried.

As the aircraft promises improved operating economics compared to older freighters, airlines have viewed the 777F as a replacement for freighters such as the Boeing 747-200F, <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20DC-10">McDonnell Douglas MD-10</a> and <a href="McDonnell%20Douglas%20MD-11">McDonnell Douglas MD-11F</a>. The first 777F was delivered to Air France on February 19, 2009. , 154 freighters had been delivered to 17 different customers, with 59 unfilled orders. Operators had 140 of the 777F in service .

In the 2000s, Boeing began studying the conversion of 777-200ER and -200 passenger airliners into freighters, under the name 777 BCF (Boeing Converted Freighter). The company has been in discussion with several airline customers, including <a href="FedEx%20Express">FedEx Express</a>, <a href="UPS%20Airlines">UPS Airlines</a>, and <a href="GE%20Capital%20Aviation%20Services">GE Capital Aviation Services</a>, to provide launch orders for a 777 BCF program.

The 777X is to feature new <a href="General%20Electric%20GE9X">GE9X</a> engines, new <a href="composite%20material">composite</a> wings with <a href="Folding%20wing">folding wingtips</a>, it was launched in November 2013 with two variants: the 777-8 and the 777-9. The 777-8 provides seating for 365 passengers and has a range of while the 777-9 has seating for 414 passengers and a range of over . The -9 is expected to fly in the second quarter of 2019 with deliveries to begin one year later.

Versions of the 777 have been acquired by government and private customers. The main purpose has been for VIP transport, including as an <a href="Air%20transports%20of%20heads%20of%20state%20and%20government">air transport for heads of state</a>, although the aircraft has also been proposed for other military applications.


Boeing customers that have received the most 777s are Emirates, Singapore Airlines, United Airlines, <a href="International%20Lease%20Finance%20Corporation">ILFC</a>, and American Airlines. Emirates is the largest airline operator , and is the only customer to have operated all 777 variants produced, including the -200, -200ER, -200LR, -300, -300ER, and 777F. The 1,000th 777 off the production line, a -300ER set to be Emirates' 102nd 777, was unveiled at a factory ceremony in March 2012.

A total of 1,416 aircraft (all variants) were in airline service , with <a href="Emirates%20%28airline%29">Emirates</a> (163), <a href="United%20Airlines">United Airlines</a> (91), <a href="Air%20France">Air France</a> (70), <a href="Cathay%20Pacific">Cathay Pacific</a> (69), <a href="American%20Airlines">American Airlines</a> (67), <a href="Qatar%20Airways">Qatar Airways</a> (67), <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a> (58), <a href="All%20Nippon%20Airways">All Nippon Airways</a> (50), <a href="Singapore%20Airlines">Singapore Airlines</a> (46), and other operators with fewer aircraft of the type.

In 2017, 777 Classics are towards the end of their mainline service: with a -200 age ranging from three to 22 years, 43 Classic 777s or 7.5% of the fleet have been retired. Values of 777-200ERs have declined by 45% since January 2014, faster than Airbus A330s and Boeing 767s with 30%, due to the lack of a major <a href="Aftermarket%20%28merchandise%29">secondary market</a> but only a few <a href="budget%20carrier">budget</a>, <a href="air%20charter">air charter</a>s and <a href="ACMI%20lease">ACMI operator</a>s. In 2015, <a href="Richard%20H.%20Anderson%20%28businessman%29">Richard H. Anderson</a>, then <a href="Delta%20Air%20Lines">Delta Air Lines</a>' chairman and chief executive, said he had been offered 777-200s for less than $10 million. To keep them cost efficient, operators densify their 777s for about $10 million each, like <a href="Scoot">Scoot</a> with 402 seats in its dual-class -200s, or Cathay Pacific which switched the 3-3-3 economy layout of 777-300s to 3-4-3 to seat 396 on regional services.

The 777 surpassed 2,000 orders by the end of 2018.


, the 777 has been involved in 28 <a href="aviation%20accidents%20and%20incidents">aviation accidents and incidents</a>, including a total of seven <a href="hull-loss">hull-loss</a>es resulting in 541 fatalities along with three <a href="aircraft%20hijacking">hijackings</a>. The first fatality involving the twinjet occurred in a fire while an aircraft was being refueled at <a href="Denver%20International%20Airport">Denver International Airport</a> in the United States on September 5, 2001, during which a ground worker sustained fatal burns. The aircraft, operated by <a href="British%20Airways">British Airways</a>, suffered fire damage to the lower wing panels and engine housing; it was later repaired and returned to service.

The type's first hull-loss occurred on January 17, 2008, when a 777-200ER with Rolls-Royce Trent 895 engines, flying from Beijing to London as <a href="British%20Airways%20Flight%2038">British Airways Flight 38</a>, crash-landed approximately short of Heathrow Airport's runway 27L and slid onto the runway's <a href="Displaced%20threshold">threshold</a>. There were 47 injuries and no fatalities. The impact damaged the landing gear, <a href="wing%20root">wing root</a>s and engines. The aircraft was written off. The accident was attributed to <a href="ice%20crystals">ice crystals</a> suspended in the aircraft's fuel clogging the fuel-oil <a href="heat%20exchanger">heat exchanger</a> (FOHE). Two other minor momentary losses of <a href="Jet%20engine%23Thrust">thrust</a> with Trent 895 engines occurred later in 2008. Investigators found these were also caused by ice in the fuel clogging the FOHE. As a result, the heat exchanger was redesigned.

On July 29, 2011, a 777-200ER scheduled to operate as <a href="EgyptAir%20Flight%20667">EgyptAir Flight 667</a>, suffered a cockpit fire while parked at the gate at <a href="Cairo%20International%20Airport">Cairo International Airport</a> before its departure. The aircraft was evacuated with no injuries, and airport fire teams extinguished the fire. The aircraft sustained structural-, heat- and smoke damage, and was written off. Investigators focused on a possible short circuit between an electrical cable and a supply hose in the cockpit crew oxygen system.

On July 6, 2013, a 777-200ER operating as <a href="Asiana%20Airlines%20Flight%20214">Asiana Airlines Flight 214</a>, crashed while landing at <a href="San%20Francisco%20International%20Airport">San Francisco International Airport</a> after touching down short of the runway. The 307 surviving passengers and crew on board evacuated before fire destroyed the aircraft. Two passengers, who had not been wearing their seatbelts, were ejected from the aircraft during the crash and were killed.<ref name="NTSB/AAR-14/01"></ref> A third passenger died six days later as a result of injuries sustained during the crash. These were the first fatalities in a crash involving a 777 since its entry into service in 1995. The official accident investigation concluded in June 2014 that the pilots committed 20 to 30 minor to significant errors in their final approach, and that complexities of the automated controls contributed to the accident.

On March 8, 2014, a 777-200ER carrying 227 passengers and 12 crew, en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing as <a href="Malaysia%20Airlines%20Flight%20370">Malaysia Airlines Flight 370</a>, was reported missing. Air Traffic Control's last reported coordinates for the aircraft were over the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a> at . After the search for the aircraft began, Malaysia's prime minister announced on March 24, 2014 that after analysis of new satellite data it was now to be assumed "beyond reasonable doubt" that the aircraft had crashed in the Indian Ocean and there were no survivors. , the cause remains unknown, but the Malaysian Government declared it was an accident in January 2015. On July 29, 2015, an item later identified as a <a href="flaperon">flaperon</a> strongly suspected to be from the missing aircraft was found on the island of <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> in the western Indian Ocean.

The fifth hull-loss occurred on July 17, 2014, when a 777-200ER, bound for Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam as <a href="Malaysia%20Airlines%20Flight%2017">Malaysia Airlines Flight 17</a> (MH17), broke up in mid-air and crashed in the <a href="Donetsk%20Oblast">Donetsk</a> province in eastern Ukraine, after being hit by an anti-aircraft missile. All 298 people (283 passengers and 15 crew) on board were killed, making this the deadliest crash involving the Boeing 777. The incident was linked to the ongoing <a href="2014%20insurgency%20in%20Donbass">Donbass insurgency</a> in the region. The official accident report, released in October 2015, states that airliner was brought down by a <a href="Buk%20missile%20system">Buk missile</a> launched from territory held by pro-Russian separatists.

On September 8, 2015, a 777-200ER caught fire during its take-off at Las Vegas McCarran International Airport as <a href="British%20Airways%20Flight%202276">British Airways Flight 2276</a>, after one of its <a href="General%20Electric%20GE90">General Electric GE90-85B</a> engines suffered a serious <a href="uncontained%20engine%20failure">uncontained engine failure</a>. The take-off was aborted and all crew and passengers were evacuated with only minor injuries occurring. Investigators discovered that debris from inside the engine had punctured 'multiple' holes in the engine case.

On May 27, 2016, an engine caught fire on a 777-300 before it was due to take off as <a href="Korean%20Air%20Flight%202708">Korean Air Flight 2708</a> at Tokyo International Airport, commonly known as <a href="Haneda%20Airport">Haneda Airport</a>. Shortly before take-off, the Pratt & Whitney PW4000 engine caught fire. All 17 crew members and 302 passengers evacuated safely. Fire fighters put out the fire within an hour. The incident is under investigation.

On June 27, 2016, a 777-300ER suffered an oil leak in the right engine while en route from Singapore to Milan as <a href="Singapore%20Airlines%20Flight%20368">Singapore Airlines Flight 368</a>. It was diverted back to <a href="Singapore%20Changi%20Airport">Singapore Changi Airport</a> for an emergency landing. The right engine and wing caught fire during the landing roll and sustained serious fire damage. There were no injuries.

On August 3, 2016, the sixth hull-loss of the type occurred, when a 777-300 crashed while landing and caught fire at Dubai Airport at the end of its flight as <a href="Emirates%20Flight%20521">Emirates Flight 521</a>. The preliminary investigation indicated that the aircraft was attempting a landing during active wind shear conditions. The pilots initiated a go-around procedure shortly after the main wheels touched-down onto the runway, however the aircraft settled back onto the ground apparently due to late throttle application. As the undercarriage was in the process of being retracted, the aircraft landed on its rear underbody and engine <a href="nacelle">nacelle</a>s, resulting in the separation of one engine, loss of control and subsequent crash. There were no passenger casualties of the 300 people on board, however one airport fireman was killed fighting the fire. The aircraft's fuselage and right wing were badly damaged by the fire.

Harold Pinter

Harold Pinter (; 10 October 1930 – 24 December 2008) was a British playwright, screenwriter, director and actor. A <a href="List%20of%20Nobel%20laureates%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize</a>winner, Pinter was one of the most influential modern British dramatist with a writing career that spanned more than 50 years. His best-known plays include "<a href="The%20Birthday%20Party%20%28play%29">The Birthday Party</a>" (1957), "<a href="The%20Homecoming">The Homecoming</a>" (1964), and "<a href="Betrayal%20%28play%29">Betrayal</a>" (1978), each of which he adapted for the screen. His screenplay adaptations of others' works include "<a href="The%20Servant%20%281963%20film%29">The Servant</a>" (1963), "<a href="The%20Go-Between%20%281971%20film%29">The Go-Between</a>" (1971), "<a href="The%20French%20Lieutenant%27s%20Woman%20%28film%29">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>" (1981), "<a href="The%20Trial%20%281993%20film%29">The Trial</a>" (1993), and "<a href="Sleuth%20%282007%20film%29">Sleuth</a>" (2007). He also directed or acted in radio, stage, television, and film productions of his own and others' works.

Pinter was born and raised in <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Hackney">Hackney</a>, east London, and educated at <a href="Hackney%20Downs%20School">Hackney Downs School</a>. He was a sprinter and a keen cricket player, acting in school plays and writing poetry. He attended the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> but did not complete the course. He was fined for refusing <a href="national%20service">national service</a> as a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>. Subsequently, he continued training at the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Speech%20and%20Drama">Central School of Speech and Drama</a> and worked in repertory theatre in <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a> and England. In 1956 he married actress <a href="Vivien%20Merchant">Vivien Merchant</a> and had a son, Daniel, born in 1958. He left Merchant in 1975 and married author <a href="Antonia%20Fraser">Lady Antonia Fraser</a> in 1980.

Pinter's career as a playwright began with a production of "<a href="The%20Room%20%28play%29">The Room</a>" in 1957. His second play, "<a href="The%20Birthday%20Party%20%28play%29">The Birthday Party</a>", closed after eight performances, but was enthusiastically reviewed by critic <a href="Harold%20Hobson">Harold Hobson</a>. His early works were described by critics as "<a href="comedy%20of%20menace">comedy of menace</a>". Later plays such as "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%28play%29">No Man's Land</a>" (1975) and "<a href="Betrayal%20%28play%29">Betrayal</a>" (1978) became known as "memory plays". He appeared as an actor in productions of his own work on radio and film. He also undertook a number of roles in works by other writers. He directed nearly 50 productions for stage, theatre and screen. Pinter received over 50 awards, prizes, and other honours, including the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> in 2005 and the French <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a> in 2007.

Despite frail health after being diagnosed with <a href="esophageal%20cancer">oesophageal cancer</a> in December 2001, Pinter continued to act on stage and screen, last performing the title role of <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>'s one-act monologue "<a href="Krapp%27s%20Last%20Tape%23Harold%20Pinter">Krapp's Last Tape</a>", for the 50th anniversary season of the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court Theatre</a>, in October 2006. He died from <a href="liver%20cancer">liver cancer</a> on 24 December 2008.

Pinter was born on 10 October 1930, in <a href="Metropolitan%20Borough%20of%20Hackney">Hackney</a>, east London, the only child of British parents of Jewish <a href="Eastern%20Europe">Eastern Europe</a>an descent: his father, Hyman "Jack" Pinter (1902–1997) was a ladies' tailor; his mother, Frances (née Moskowitz; 1904–1992), a housewife. Pinter believed an aunt's erroneous view that the family was <a href="Sephardi%20Jews">Sephardic</a> and had fled the <a href="Spanish%20Inquisition">Spanish Inquisition</a>; thus, for his early poems, Pinter used the pseudonym "Pinta" and at other times used variations such as "da Pinto". Later research by <a href="Antonia%20Fraser">Lady Antonia Fraser</a>, Pinter's second wife, revealed the legend to be apocryphal; three of Pinter's grandparents came from Poland and the fourth from <a href="Odessa">Odessa</a>, so the family was <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazic</a>.

Pinter's family home in London is described by his official biographer <a href="Michael%20Billington%20%28critic%29">Michael Billington</a> as "a solid, red-brick, three-storey villa just off the noisy, bustling, traffic-ridden thoroughfare of the <a href="Lower%20Clapton">Lower Clapton</a> Road". In 1940 and 1941, after <a href="the%20Blitz">the Blitz</a>, Pinter was <a href="Evacuations%20of%20civilians%20in%20Britain%20during%20World%20War%20II">evacuated</a> from their house in London to <a href="Cornwall">Cornwall</a> and <a href="Reading%2C%20Berkshire">Reading</a>. Billington states that the "life-and-death intensity of daily experience" before and during the Blitz left Pinter with profound memories "of loneliness, bewilderment, separation and loss: themes that are in all his works."

Pinter discovered his social potential as a student at <a href="Hackney%20Downs%20School">Hackney Downs School</a>, a London <a href="grammar%20school">grammar school</a>, between 1944 and 1948. "Partly through the school and partly through the social life of Hackney Boys' Club ... he formed an almost sacerdotal belief in the power of male friendship. The friends he made in those days—most particularly <a href="Henry%20Woolf">Henry Woolf</a>, Michael (Mick) Goldstein and Morris (Moishe) Wernick—have always been a vital part of the emotional texture of his life." A major influence on Pinter was his inspirational English teacher Joseph Brearley, who directed him in school plays and with whom he took long walks, talking about literature. According to Billington, under Brearley's instruction, "Pinter shone at English, wrote for the school magazine and discovered a gift for acting." In 1947 and 1948, he played <a href="Romeo%20Montague">Romeo</a> and <a href="Macbeth%20%28Macbeth%29">Macbeth</a> in productions directed by Brearley.

At the age of 12, Pinter began writing poetry, and in spring 1947, his poetry was first published in the "Hackney Downs School Magazine". In 1950 his poetry was first published outside the school magazine, in "<a href="Poetry%20London">Poetry London</a>", some of it under the pseudonym "Harold Pinta".

Pinter was an atheist.

Pinter enjoyed running and broke the Hackney Downs School sprinting record.
He was a <a href="cricket">cricket</a> enthusiast, taking his bat with him when evacuated during the Blitz. In 1971, he told <a href="Mel%20Gussow">Mel Gussow</a>: "one of my main obsessions in life is the game of cricket—I play and watch and read about it all the time." He was chairman of the Gaieties Cricket Club, a supporter of <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire Cricket Club</a>, and devoted a section of his official website to the sport. One wall of his study was dominated by a portrait of himself as a young man playing cricket, which was described by <a href="Sarah%20Lyall">Sarah Lyall</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>": "The painted Mr. Pinter, poised to swing his bat, has a wicked glint in his eye; testosterone all but flies off the canvas." Pinter approved of the "urban and exacting idea of cricket as a bold theatre of aggression." After his death, several of his school contemporaries recalled his achievements in sports, especially cricket and running. The <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> memorial tribute included an essay on Pinter and cricket.

Other interests that Pinter mentioned to interviewers are family, love and sex, drinking, writing, and reading. According to Billington, "If the notion of male loyalty, competitive rivalry and fear of betrayal forms a constant thread in Pinter's work from "<a href="The%20Dwarfs%20%28novel%29">The Dwarfs</a>" onwards, its origins can be found in his teenage Hackney years. Pinter adores women, enjoys flirting with them, worships their resilience and strength. But, in his early work especially, they are often seen as disruptive influences on some pure and <a href="Platonic%20love">Platonic</a> ideal of male friendship: one of the most crucial of all Pinter's lost <a href="Garden%20of%20Eden">Edens</a>."

Beginning in late 1948, Pinter attended the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Dramatic%20Art">Royal Academy of Dramatic Art</a> for two terms, but hating the school, missed most of his classes, feigned a nervous breakdown, and dropped out in 1949. In 1948 he was called up for <a href="National%20service">National Service</a>. He was initially refused registration as a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a>, leading to his twice being prosecuted, and fined, for refusing to accept a medical examination, before his CO registration was ultimately agreed. He had a small part in the Christmas <a href="pantomime">pantomime</a> "<a href="Dick%20Whittington%20and%20His%20Cat">Dick Whittington and His Cat</a>" at the <a href="Chesterfield">Chesterfield</a> Hippodrome in 1949 to 1950. From January to July 1951, he attended the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Speech%20and%20Drama">Central School of Speech and Drama</a>.

From 1951 to 1952, he toured Ireland with the Anew McMaster repertory company, playing over a dozen roles. In 1952, he began acting in regional English repertory productions; from 1953 to 1954, he worked for the <a href="Donald%20Wolfit">Donald Wolfit</a> Company, at the King's Theatre, <a href="Hammersmith">Hammersmith</a>, performing eight roles. From 1954 until 1959, Pinter acted under the stage name David Baron. In all, Pinter played over 20 roles under that name. To supplement his income from acting, Pinter worked as a waiter, a postman, a bouncer, and a snow-clearer, meanwhile, according to Mark Batty, "harbouring ambitions as a poet and writer." In October 1989 Pinter recalled: "I was in English rep as an actor for about 12 years. My favourite roles were undoubtedly the sinister ones. They're something to get your teeth into." During that period, he also performed occasional roles in his own and others' works for radio, TV, and film, as he continued to do throughout his career.

From 1956 until 1980, Pinter was married to <a href="Vivien%20Merchant">Vivien Merchant</a>, an actress whom he met on tour, perhaps best known for her performance in the 1966 film "<a href="Alfie%20%281966%20film%29">Alfie</a>". Their son, Daniel, was born in 1958. Through the early 1970s, Merchant appeared in many of Pinter's works, including "<a href="The%20Homecoming">The Homecoming</a>" on stage (1965) and screen (1973), but the marriage was turbulent. For seven years, from 1962 to 1969, Pinter was engaged in a clandestine affair with BBC-TV presenter and journalist <a href="Joan%20Bakewell">Joan Bakewell</a>, which inspired his 1978 play "<a href="Betrayal%20%28play%29">Betrayal</a>", and also throughout that period and beyond he had an affair with an American socialite, whom he nicknamed "Cleopatra". This relationship was another secret he kept from both his wife and Bakewell. Initially, "Betrayal" was thought to be a response to his later affair with historian <a href="Antonia%20Fraser">Antonia Fraser</a>, the wife of <a href="Hugh%20Fraser%20%28British%20politician%29">Hugh Fraser</a>, and Pinter's "marital crack-up".

Pinter and Merchant had both met Fraser in 1969, when all three worked together on a <a href="National%20Gallery%20%28London%29">National Gallery</a> programme about <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>; several years later, on 8–9 January 1975, Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved. That meeting initiated their five-year extramarital love affair. After hiding the relationship from Merchant for two and a half months, on 21 March 1975, Pinter finally told her "I've met somebody". After that, "Life in Hanover Terrace gradually became impossible", and Pinter moved out of their house on 28 April 1975, five days after the première of "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%28play%29">No Man's Land</a>".

In mid-August 1977, after Pinter and Fraser had spent two years living in borrowed and rented quarters, they moved into her former family home in <a href="Holland%20Park">Holland Park</a>, where Pinter began writing "Betrayal". He reworked it later, while on holiday at the <a href="Grand%20Hotel%20Eastbourne">Grand Hotel</a>, in <a href="Eastbourne">Eastbourne</a>, in early January 1978. After the Frasers' divorce had become final in 1977 and the Pinters' in 1980, Pinter married Fraser on 27 November 1980. Because of a two-week delay in Merchant's signing the divorce papers, however, the reception had to precede the actual ceremony, originally scheduled to occur on his 50th birthday. Vivien Merchant died of acute alcoholism in the first week of October 1982, at the age of 53. Billington writes that Pinter "did everything possible to support" her and regretted that he ultimately became estranged from their son, Daniel, after their separation, Pinter's remarriage, and Merchant's death.

A reclusive gifted musician and writer, Daniel changed his surname from Pinter to Brand, the maiden name of his maternal grandmother, before Pinter and Fraser became romantically involved; while according to Fraser, his father couldn't understand it, she says that she could: "Pinter is such a distinctive name that he must have got tired of being asked, 'Any relation? Michael Billington wrote that Pinter saw Daniel's name change as "a largely pragmatic move on Daniel's part designed to keep the press ... at bay." Fraser told Billington that Daniel "was very nice to me at a time when it would have been only too easy for him to have turned on me ... simply because he had been the sole focus of his father's love and now manifestly wasn't." Still unreconciled at the time of his father's death, Daniel Brand did not attend Pinter's funeral.

Billington observes that "The break-up with Vivien and the new life with Antonia was to have a profound effect on Pinter's personality and his work," though he adds that Fraser herself did not claim to have influence over Pinter or his writing. In her own contemporaneous diary entry dated 15 January 1993, Fraser described herself more as Pinter's literary midwife. Indeed, she told Billington that "other people [such as <a href="Peggy%20Ashcroft">Peggy Ashcroft</a>, among others] had a shaping influence on [Pinter's] politics" and attributed changes in his writing and political views to a change from "an unhappy, complicated personal life ... to a happy, uncomplicated personal life", so that "a side of Harold which had always been there was somehow released. I think you can see that in his work after "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%28play%29">No Man's Land</a>" [1975], which was a very bleak play."

Pinter was content in his second marriage and enjoyed family life with his six adult stepchildren and 17 step-grandchildren. Even after battling cancer for several years, he considered himself "a very lucky man in every respect". <a href="Sarah%20Lyall">Sarah Lyall</a> notes in her 2007 interview with Pinter in "<a href="The%20New%20York%20Times">The New York Times</a>" that his "latest work, a slim pamphlet called "Six Poems for A.," comprises poems written over 32 years, with "A" of course being Lady Antonia. The first of the poems was written in Paris, where she and Mr. Pinter traveled soon after they met. More than three decades later the two are rarely apart, and Mr. Pinter turns soft, even cozy, when he talks about his wife." In that interview Pinter "acknowledged that his plays—full of infidelity, cruelty, inhumanity, the lot—seem at odds with his domestic contentment. 'How can you write a happy play?' he said. 'Drama is about conflict and degrees of perturbation, disarray. I've never been able to write a happy play, but I've been able to enjoy a happy life. After his death, Fraser told "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>": "He was a great man, and it was a privilege to live with him for over 33 years. He will never be forgotten."

In 1948–49, when he was 18, Pinter opposed the politics of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>, leading to his decision to become a <a href="conscientious%20objector">conscientious objector</a> and to refuse to comply with <a href="Conscription%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">National Service</a> in the British military. However, he told interviewers that, if he had been old enough at the time, he would have fought against the <a href="Nazism">Nazis</a> in <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. He seemed to express ambivalence, both indifference and hostility, towards political structures and politicians in his Fall 1966 "<a href="The%20Paris%20Review">Paris Review</a>" interview conducted by <a href="Larry%20Bensky">Lawrence M. Bensky</a>. Yet, he had been an early member of the <a href="Campaign%20for%20Nuclear%20Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> and also had supported the British <a href="Anti-Apartheid%20Movement">Anti-Apartheid Movement</a> (1959–1994), participating in British artists' refusal to permit professional productions of their work in South Africa in 1963 and in subsequent related campaigns. In "A Play and Its Politics", a 1985 interview with Nicholas Hern, Pinter described his earlier plays retrospectively from the perspective of the politics of power and the dynamics of oppression.

In his last 25 years, Pinter increasingly focused his essays, interviews and public appearances directly on political issues. He was an officer in <a href="International%20PEN">International PEN</a>, travelling with American playwright <a href="Arthur%20Miller">Arthur Miller</a> to <a href="Turkey">Turkey</a> in 1985 on a mission co-sponsored with a <a href="Helsinki%20Watch">Helsinki Watch</a> committee to investigate and protest against the torture of imprisoned writers. There he met victims of political oppression and their families. Pinter's experiences in Turkey and his knowledge of the Turkish suppression of the <a href="Kurdish%20language">Kurdish language</a> inspired his 1988 play "<a href="Mountain%20Language">Mountain Language</a>." He was also an active member of the <a href="Cuba%20Solidarity%20Campaign">Cuba Solidarity Campaign</a>, an organisation that "campaigns in the UK against the US blockade of <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>". In 2001 Pinter joined the International Committee to Defend Slobodan Milošević (ICDSM), which appealed for a fair trial and for the freedom of <a href="Slobodan%20Milo%C5%A1evi%C4%87">Slobodan Milošević</a>, signing a related "Artists' Appeal for Milošević" in 2004.

Pinter strongly opposed the 1991 <a href="Gulf%20War">Gulf War</a>, the 1999 <a href="NATO">NATO</a> bombing campaign in <a href="Yugoslavia">Yugoslavia</a> during the <a href="Kosovo%20War">Kosovo War</a>, the United States' 2001 <a href="War%20in%20Afghanistan%20%282001%E2%80%93present%29">War in Afghanistan</a>, and the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">2003 Invasion of Iraq</a>. Among his provocative political statements, Pinter called Prime Minister <a href="Tony%20Blair">Tony Blair</a> a "deluded idiot" and compared the administration of President <a href="George%20W.%20Bush">George W. Bush</a> to <a href="Nazi%20Germany">Nazi Germany</a>. He stated that the United States "was charging towards world domination while the American public and Britain's '<a href="mass-murder">mass-murder</a>ing' prime minister sat back and watched." He was very active in the <a href="Peace%20movement">antiwar movement</a> in the United Kingdom, speaking at rallies held by the <a href="Stop%20the%20War%20Coalition">Stop the War Coalition</a> and frequently criticising American aggression, as when he asked rhetorically, in his acceptance speech for the <a href="Wilfred%20Owen">Wilfred Owen</a> Award for Poetry on 18 March 2007: "What would Wilfred Owen make of the <a href="2003%20invasion%20of%20Iraq">invasion of Iraq</a>? A bandit act, an act of blatant <a href="state%20terrorism">state terrorism</a>, demonstrating absolute contempt for the conception of <a href="international%20law">international law</a>."

Harold Pinter earned a reputation for being notoriously pugnacious, enigmatic, taciturn, terse, prickly, explosive and forbidding. Pinter's blunt political statements, and the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature, elicited strong criticism and even, at times, provoked ridicule and personal attacks. The historian <a href="Geoffrey%20Alderman">Geoffrey Alderman</a>, author of the official history of Hackney Downs School, expressed his own "Jewish View" of Harold Pinter: "Whatever his merit as a writer, actor and director, on an ethical plane Harold Pinter seems to me to have been intensely flawed, and his moral compass deeply fractured." <a href="David%20Edgar%20%28playwright%29">David Edgar</a>, writing in "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>", defended Pinter against what he termed Pinter's "being berated by the belligerati" like <a href="Johann%20Hari">Johann Hari</a>, who felt that he did not "deserve" to win the Nobel Prize. Later Pinter continued to campaign against the Iraq War and on behalf of other political causes that he supported. As Alderman points out, for example, Pinter signed the mission statement of <a href="Jews%20for%20Justice%20for%20Palestinians">Jews for Justice for Palestinians</a> in 2005 and its full-page advertisement, "What Is Israel Doing? A Call by Jews in Britain", published in "<a href="The%20Times">The Times</a>" on 6 July 2006, and he was a patron of the <a href="Palestine%20Festival%20of%20Literature">Palestine Festival of Literature</a>.

Pinter's acting career spanned over 50 years and, although he often played <a href="villain">villain</a>s, included a wide range of roles on stage and in radio, film, and television. In addition to roles in radio and television adaptations of his own plays and dramatic sketches, early in his screenwriting career he made several cameo appearances in films based on his own screenplays; for example, as a society man in "<a href="The%20Servant%20%281963%20film%29">The Servant</a>" (1963) and as Mr. Bell in "<a href="Accident%20%281967%20film%29">Accident</a>" (1967), both directed by <a href="Joseph%20Losey">Joseph Losey</a>; and as a bookshop customer in his later film "<a href="Turtle%20Diary">Turtle Diary</a>" (1985), starring <a href="Michael%20Gambon">Michael Gambon</a>, <a href="Glenda%20Jackson">Glenda Jackson</a>, and <a href="Ben%20Kingsley">Ben Kingsley</a>.

Pinter's notable film and television roles included the corrupt lawyer Saul Abrahams, opposite <a href="Peter%20O%27Toole">Peter O'Toole</a>, in <a href="BBC%20Television">BBC TV</a>'s "<a href="Rogue%20Male%20%281976%20film%29">Rogue Male</a>" (1976), a remake of the 1941 <a href="film%20noir">film noir</a> "<a href="Man%20Hunt%20%281941%20film%29">Man Hunt</a>", released on DVD in 2002; and a drunk Irish journalist in "<a href="Langrishe%2C%20Go%20Down%20%28film%29">Langrishe, Go Down</a>" (starring <a href="Judi%20Dench">Judi Dench</a> and <a href="Jeremy%20Irons">Jeremy Irons</a>) distributed on <a href="BBC%20Two">BBC Two</a> in 1978 and released in movie theatres in 2002. Pinter's later film roles included the criminal Sam Ross in "Mojo" (1997), written and directed by <a href="Jez%20Butterworth">Jez Butterworth</a>, based on Butterworth's <a href="Mojo%20%28play%29">play of the same name</a>; Sir Thomas Bertram (his most substantial feature-film role) in "<a href="Mansfield%20Park%20%28film%29">Mansfield Park</a>" (1998), a character that Pinter described as "a very civilised man ... a man of great sensibility but in fact, he's upholding and sustaining a totally brutal system [the slave trade] from which he derives his money"; and Uncle Benny, opposite <a href="Pierce%20Brosnan">Pierce Brosnan</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20Rush">Geoffrey Rush</a>, in "<a href="The%20Tailor%20of%20Panama">The Tailor of Panama</a>" (2001). In <a href="Television%20movie">television films</a>, he played Mr. Bearing, the father of <a href="ovarian%20cancer">ovarian cancer</a> patient Vivian Bearing, played by <a href="Emma%20Thompson">Emma Thompson</a> in <a href="Mike%20Nichols">Mike Nichols</a>'s <a href="HBO">HBO</a> film of the <a href="Pulitzer%20Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>-winning play "<a href="Wit%20%28film%29">Wit</a>" (2001); and the Director opposite <a href="John%20Gielgud">John Gielgud</a> (Gielgud's last role) and <a href="Rebecca%20Pidgeon">Rebecca Pidgeon</a> in "<a href="Catastrophe%20%28play%29">Catastrophe</a>", by <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>, directed by <a href="David%20Mamet">David Mamet</a> as part of "Beckett on Film" (2001).

Pinter began to direct more frequently during the 1970s, becoming an associate director of the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a> (NT) in 1973. He directed almost 50 productions of his own and others' plays for stage, film, and television, including 10 productions of works by <a href="Simon%20Gray">Simon Gray</a>: the stage and/or film premières of "<a href="Butley%20%28film%29">Butley</a>" (stage, 1971; film, 1974), "<a href="Otherwise%20Engaged">Otherwise Engaged</a>" (1975), "The Rear Column" (stage, 1978; TV, 1980), "Close of Play" (NT, 1979), "<a href="Quartermaine%27s%20Terms">Quartermaine's Terms</a>" (1981), "Life Support" (1997), "The Late Middle Classes" (1999), and "The Old Masters" (2004). Several of those productions starred <a href="Alan%20Bates">Alan Bates</a> (1934–2003), who originated the stage and screen roles of not only Butley but also Mick in Pinter's first major commercial success, "<a href="The%20Caretaker">The Caretaker</a>" (stage, 1960; film, 1964); and in Pinter's double-bill produced at the <a href="Lyric%20Hammersmith">Lyric Hammersmith</a> in 1984, he played Nicolas in "<a href="One%20for%20the%20Road%20%28Harold%20Pinter%20play%29">One for the Road</a>" and the cab driver in "<a href="Victoria%20Station%20%28play%29">Victoria Station</a>". Among over 35 plays that Pinter directed were "Next of Kin" (1974), by <a href="John%20Hopkins%20%28writer%29">John Hopkins</a>; "<a href="Blithe%20Spirit%20%28play%29">Blithe Spirit</a>" (1976), by <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a>; "<a href="The%20Innocents%20%28play%29">The Innocents</a>" (1976), by <a href="William%20Archibald%20%28playwright%29">William Archibald</a>; "Circe and Bravo" (1986), by <a href="Donald%20Freed">Donald Freed</a>; "<a href="Taking%20Sides%20%28play%29">Taking Sides</a>" (1995), by <a href="Ronald%20Harwood">Ronald Harwood</a>; and "<a href="Twelve%20Angry%20Men%20%28play%29">Twelve Angry Men</a>" (1996), by <a href="Reginald%20Rose">Reginald Rose</a>.

Pinter was the author of 29 plays and 15 dramatic sketches and the co-author of two works for stage and radio. He was considered to have been one of the most influential modern British dramatists, Along with the 1967 <a href="Tony%20Award%20for%20Best%20Play">Tony Award for Best Play</a> for "The Homecoming" and several other American awards and award nominations, he and his plays received many awards in the UK and elsewhere throughout the world. His style has entered the English language as an adjective, "<a href="Characteristics%20of%20Harold%20Pinter%27s%20work%23Pinteresque">Pinteresque</a>", although Pinter himself disliked the term and found it meaningless.

Pinter's first play, "<a href="The%20Room%20%28play%29">The Room</a>", written and first performed in 1957, was a student production at the <a href="University%20of%20Bristol">University of Bristol</a>, directed by his good friend, actor <a href="Henry%20Woolf">Henry Woolf</a>, who also originated the role of Mr. Kidd (which he reprised in 2001 and 2007). After Pinter mentioned that he had an idea for a play, Woolf asked him to write it so that he could direct it to fulfill a requirement for his postgraduate work. Pinter wrote it in three days. The production was described by Billington as "a staggeringly confident debut which attracted the attention of a young producer, <a href="Michael%20Codron">Michael Codron</a>, who decided to present Pinter's next play, "<a href="The%20Birthday%20Party%20%28play%29">The Birthday Party</a>", at the <a href="Lyric%20Hammersmith">Lyric Hammersmith</a>, in 1958."

Written in 1957 and produced in 1958, Pinter's second play, "The Birthday Party", one of his best-known works, was initially both a commercial and critical disaster, despite an enthusiastic review in "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>" by its influential drama critic <a href="Harold%20Hobson">Harold Hobson</a>, which appeared only after the production had closed and could not be reprieved. Critical accounts often quote Hobson:

Pinter himself and later critics generally credited Hobson as bolstering him and perhaps even rescuing his career.

In a review published in 1958, borrowing from the subtitle of "The Lunatic View: A Comedy of Menace", a play by <a href="David%20Campton">David Campton</a>, critic <a href="Irving%20Wardle">Irving Wardle</a> called Pinter's early plays "<a href="comedy%20of%20menace">comedy of menace</a>"—a label that people have applied repeatedly to his work. Such plays begin with an apparently innocent situation that becomes both threatening and "<a href="Absurdism">absurd</a>" as Pinter's characters behave in ways often perceived as inexplicable by his audiences and one another. Pinter acknowledges the influence of <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>, particularly on his early work; they became friends, sending each other drafts of their works in progress for comments.

Pinter wrote "<a href="The%20Hothouse">The Hothouse</a>" in 1958, which he shelved for over 20 years (See "Overtly political plays and sketches" below). Next he wrote "<a href="The%20Dumb%20Waiter">The Dumb Waiter</a>" (1959), which premièred in Germany and was then produced in a <a href="double%20bill">double bill</a> with "The Room" at the <a href="Hampstead%20Theatre">Hampstead Theatre Club</a>, in London, in 1960. It was then not produced often until the 1980s, and it has been revived more frequently since 2000, including the <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End</a> <a href="Trafalgar%20Studios">Trafalgar Studios</a> production in 2007. The first production of "<a href="The%20Caretaker">The Caretaker</a>", at the <a href="Arts%20Theatre">Arts Theatre Club</a>, in London, in 1960, established Pinter's theatrical reputation. The play transferred to the <a href="Duchess%20Theatre">Duchess Theatre</a> in May 1960 and ran for 444 performances, receiving an <a href="Evening%20Standard%20Award">Evening Standard Award</a> for best play of 1960. Large radio and television audiences for his one-act play "<a href="A%20Night%20Out%20%28play%29">A Night Out</a>", along with the popularity of his revue sketches, propelled him to further critical attention. In 1964, "The Birthday Party" was revived both on television (with Pinter himself in the role of Goldberg) and on stage (directed by Pinter at the <a href="Aldwych%20Theatre">Aldwych Theatre</a>) and was well received.

By the time Peter Hall's London production of "The Homecoming" (1964) reached <a href="Broadway%20theatre">Broadway</a> in 1967, Pinter had become a celebrity playwright, and the play garnered four <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>s, among other awards. During this period, Pinter also wrote the radio play "<a href="A%20Slight%20Ache">A Slight Ache</a>", first broadcast on the <a href="BBC%20Third%20Programme">BBC Third Programme</a> in 1959 and then adapted to the stage and performed at the <a href="Arts%20Theatre">Arts Theatre Club</a> in 1961. "A Night Out" (1960) was broadcast to a large audience on <a href="Associated%20British%20Corporation">Associated British Corporation</a>'s television show "<a href="Armchair%20Theatre">Armchair Theatre</a>", after being transmitted on BBC Radio 3, also in 1960. His play "Night School" was first televised in 1960 on <a href="Associated%20Rediffusion">Associated Rediffusion</a>. "<a href="The%20Collection%20%28play%29">The Collection</a>" premièred at the <a href="Aldwych%20Theatre">Aldwych Theatre</a> in 1962, and "<a href="The%20Dwarfs">The Dwarfs</a>", adapted from Pinter's then unpublished novel of the same title, was first broadcast on radio in 1960, then adapted for the stage (also at the Arts Theatre Club) in a double bill with "<a href="The%20Lover%20%28play%29">The Lover</a>", which was then televised on Associated Rediffusion in 1963; and "<a href="Tea%20Party%20%28play%29">Tea Party</a>", a play that Pinter developed from his 1963 short story, first broadcast on <a href="BBC%20TV">BBC TV</a> in 1965.

Working as both a screenwriter and as a playwright, Pinter composed a script called "" (1966), for a trilogy of films to be contributed by <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>, <a href="Eug%C3%A8ne%20Ionesco">Eugène Ionesco</a>, and Pinter, of which only Beckett's film, titled "<a href="Film%20%28film%29">Film</a>", was actually produced. Then Pinter turned his unfilmed script into a television play, which was produced as "<a href="The%20Basement%20%28play%29">The Basement</a>", both on <a href="BBC%202">BBC 2</a> and also on stage in 1968.

From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, Pinter wrote a series of plays and sketches that explore complex ambiguities, elegiac mysteries, comic vagaries, and other "quicksand-like" characteristics of <a href="memory">memory</a> and which critics sometimes classify as Pinter's "<a href="memory%20play">memory play</a>s". These include "<a href="Landscape%20%28play%29">Landscape</a>" (1968), "<a href="Silence%20%28play%29">Silence</a>" (1969), "<a href="Night%20%28sketch%29">Night</a>" (1969), "<a href="Old%20Times">Old Times</a>" (1971), "<a href="No%20Man%27s%20Land%20%28play%29">No Man's Land</a>" (1975), "The Proust Screenplay" (1977), "<a href="Betrayal%20%28play%29">Betrayal</a>" (1978), "<a href="Family%20Voices">Family Voices</a>" (1981), "<a href="Victoria%20Station%20%28play%29">Victoria Station</a>" (1982), and "<a href="A%20Kind%20of%20Alaska">A Kind of Alaska</a>" (1982). Some of Pinter's later plays, including "Party Time" (1991), "<a href="Moonlight%20%28play%29">Moonlight</a>" (1993), "<a href="Ashes%20to%20Ashes%20%28play%29">Ashes to Ashes</a>" (1996), and "<a href="Celebration%20%28play%29">Celebration</a>" (2000), draw upon some features of his "memory" <a href="dramaturgy">dramaturgy</a> in their focus on the past in the present, but they have personal and political resonances and other tonal differences from these earlier memory plays.

Following a three-year period of creative drought in the early 1980s after his marriage to Antonia Fraser and the death of Vivien Merchant, Pinter's plays tended to become shorter and more overtly political, serving as critiques of <a href="oppression">oppression</a>, <a href="torture">torture</a>, and other abuses of <a href="human%20rights">human rights</a>, linked by the apparent "invulnerability of power." Just before this hiatus, in 1979, Pinter re-discovered his manuscript of "<a href="The%20Hothouse">The Hothouse</a>", which he had written in 1958 but had set aside; he revised it and then directed its first production himself at <a href="Hampstead%20Theatre">Hampstead Theatre</a> in London, in 1980. Like his plays of the 1980s, "The Hothouse" concerns authoritarianism and the abuses of power politics, but it is also a comedy, like his earlier <a href="Comedy%20of%20menace">comedies of menace</a>. Pinter played the major role of Roote in a 1995 revival at the <a href="Minerva%20Theatre%2C%20Chichester">Minerva Theatre, Chichester</a>.

Pinter's brief dramatic sketch "Precisely" (1983) is a duologue between two bureaucrats exploring the absurd power politics of mutual nuclear annihilation and <a href="Deterrence%20theory">deterrence</a>. His first overtly political one-act play is "<a href="One%20for%20the%20Road%20%28Harold%20Pinter%20play%29">One for the Road</a>" (1984). In 1985 Pinter stated that whereas his earlier plays presented metaphors for power and powerlessness, the later ones present literal realities of power and its abuse. Pinter's "political theater dramatizes the interplay and conflict of the opposing poles of involvement and disengagement." "<a href="Mountain%20Language">Mountain Language</a>" (1988) is about the Turkish suppression of the <a href="Kurdish%20language">Kurdish language</a>. The dramatic sketch "The New World Order" (1991) provides what Robert Cushman, writing in "<a href="The%20Independent">The Independent</a>" described as "10 nerve wracking minutes" of two men threatening to torture a third man who is blindfolded, gagged and bound in a chair; Pinter directed the British première at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court Theatre Upstairs</a>, where it opened on 9 July 1991, and the production then transferred to Washington, D.C., where it was revived in 1994. Pinter's longer <a href="political%20satire">political satire</a> "Party Time" (1991) premièred at the <a href="Almeida%20Theatre">Almeida Theatre</a> in London, in a double-bill with "Mountain Language". Pinter adapted it as a screenplay for television in 1992, directing that production, first broadcast in the UK on <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> on 17 November 1992.

Intertwining political and personal concerns, his next full-length plays, "<a href="Moonlight%20%28play%29">Moonlight</a>" (1993) and "<a href="Ashes%20to%20Ashes%20%28play%29">Ashes to Ashes</a>" (1996) are set in domestic households and focus on dying and death; in their personal conversations in "Ashes to Ashes", Devlin and Rebecca allude to unspecified atrocities relating to the <a href="The%20Holocaust">Holocaust</a>. After experiencing the deaths of first his mother (1992) and then his father (1997), again merging the personal and the political, Pinter wrote the poems "Death" (1997) and "The Disappeared" (1998).

Pinter's last stage play, "<a href="Celebration%20%28play%29">Celebration</a>" (2000), is a social <a href="satire">satire</a> set in an opulent restaurant, which lampoons <a href="The%20Ivy">The Ivy</a>, a fashionable venue in London's <a href="West%20End%20theatre">West End theatre</a> district, and its patrons who "have just come from performances of either the ballet or the opera. Not that they can remember a darn thing about what they saw, including the titles. [These] gilded, foul-mouthed souls are just as myopic when it comes to their own table mates (and for that matter, their food), with conversations that usually connect only on the surface, if there." On its surface the play may appear to have fewer overtly political resonances than some of the plays from the 1980s and 1990s; but its central male characters, brothers named Lambert and Matt, are members of the elite (like the men in charge in "Party Time"), who describe themselves as "peaceful strategy consultants [because] we don't carry guns." At the next table, Russell, a banker, describes himself as a "totally disordered personality ... a psychopath," while Lambert "vows to be reincarnated as '[a] more civilised, [a] gentler person, [a] nicer person'." These characters' deceptively smooth exteriors mask their extreme viciousness. "Celebration" evokes familiar <a href="Characteristics%20of%20Harold%20Pinter%27s%20work%23Pinteresque">Pinteresque</a> political contexts: "The ritzy loudmouths in 'Celebration' ... and the quieter working-class mumblers of 'The Room' ... have everything in common beneath the surface". "Money remains in the service of entrenched power, and the brothers in the play are 'strategy consultants' whose jobs involve force and violence ... It is tempting but inaccurate to equate the comic power inversions of the social behavior in "Celebration" with lasting change in larger political structures", according to Grimes, for whom the play indicates Pinter's pessimism about the possibility of changing the status quo. Yet, as the Waiter's often comically unbelievable reminiscences about his grandfather demonstrate in "Celebration", Pinter's final stage plays also extend some <a href="expressionism">expressionistic</a> aspects of his earlier "memory plays", while harking back to his "comedies of menace", as illustrated in the characters and in the Waiter's final speech:
During 2000–2001, there were also simultaneous productions of "<a href="Remembrance%20of%20Things%20Past%20%28play%29">Remembrance of Things Past</a>", Pinter's stage adaptation of his unpublished "Proust Screenplay", written in collaboration with and directed by <a href="Di%20Trevis">Di Trevis</a>, at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a>, and a revival of "<a href="The%20Caretaker">The Caretaker</a>" directed by <a href="Patrick%20Marber">Patrick Marber</a> and starring <a href="Michael%20Gambon">Michael Gambon</a>, <a href="Rupert%20Graves">Rupert Graves</a>, and <a href="Douglas%20Hodge">Douglas Hodge</a>, at the <a href="Comedy%20Theatre">Comedy Theatre</a>.

Like "Celebration", Pinter's penultimate sketch, "Press Conference" (2002), "invokes both torture and the fragile, circumscribed existence of dissent". In its première in the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">National Theatre</a>'s two-part production of "Sketches", despite undergoing chemotherapy at the time, Pinter played the ruthless Minister willing to murder little children for the benefit of "The State".

Pinter composed 27 screenplays and film scripts for cinema and television, many of which were filmed, or adapted as stage plays. His fame as a screenwriter began with his three screenplays written for films directed by <a href="Joseph%20Losey">Joseph Losey</a>, leading to their close friendship: "<a href="The%20Servant%20%281963%20film%29">The Servant</a>" (1963), based on the novel by <a href="Robin%20Maugham">Robin Maugham</a>; "<a href="Accident%20%281967%20film%29">Accident</a>" (1967), adapted from the novel by <a href="Nicholas%20Mosley%2C%203rd%20Baron%20Ravensdale">Nicholas Mosley</a>; and "<a href="The%20Go-Between%20%281971%20film%29">The Go-Between</a>" (1971), based on the novel by <a href="L.%20P.%20Hartley">L. P. Hartley</a>. Films based on Pinter's adaptations of his own stage plays are: "<a href="The%20Caretaker%23Film%20adaptation">The Caretaker</a>" (1963), directed by <a href="Clive%20Donner">Clive Donner</a>; "<a href="The%20Birthday%20Party%20%28film%29">The Birthday Party</a>" (1968), directed by <a href="William%20Friedkin">William Friedkin</a>; "<a href="The%20Homecoming%20%28film%29">The Homecoming</a>" (1973), directed by Peter Hall; and "<a href="Betrayal%20%281983%20film%29">Betrayal</a>" (1983), directed by <a href="David%20Jones%20%28director%29">David Jones</a>.

Pinter also adapted other writers' novels to screenplays, including "<a href="The%20Pumpkin%20Eater">The Pumpkin Eater</a>" (1964), based on the novel by <a href="Penelope%20Mortimer">Penelope Mortimer</a>, directed by <a href="Jack%20Clayton">Jack Clayton</a>; "<a href="The%20Quiller%20Memorandum">The Quiller Memorandum</a>" (1966), from the 1965 spy novel "The Berlin Memorandum", by <a href="Elleston%20Trevor">Elleston Trevor</a>, directed by <a href="Michael%20Anderson%20%28director%29">Michael Anderson</a>; "<a href="The%20Last%20Tycoon%20%281976%20film%29">The Last Tycoon</a>" (1976), from the unfinished novel by <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, directed by <a href="Elia%20Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>; "<a href="The%20French%20Lieutenant%27s%20Woman%20%28film%29">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>" (1981), from the novel by <a href="John%20Fowles">John Fowles</a>, directed by <a href="Karel%20Reisz">Karel Reisz</a>; "<a href="Turtle%20Diary">Turtle Diary</a>" (1985), based on the novel by <a href="Russell%20Hoban">Russell Hoban</a>; "The Heat of the Day" (1988), a television film, from the 1949 novel by <a href="Elizabeth%20Bowen">Elizabeth Bowen</a>; "<a href="The%20Comfort%20of%20Strangers%20%28film%29">The Comfort of Strangers</a>" (1990), from the novel by <a href="Ian%20McEwan">Ian McEwan</a>, directed by <a href="Paul%20Schrader">Paul Schrader</a>; and "<a href="The%20Trial%20%281993%20film%29">The Trial</a>" (1993), from the novel by <a href="Franz%20Kafka">Franz Kafka</a>, directed by David Jones.

His commissioned screenplays of others' works for the films "<a href="The%20Handmaid%27s%20Tale%20%28film%29">The Handmaid's Tale</a>" (1990), "<a href="The%20Remains%20of%20the%20Day%20%28film%29">The Remains of the Day</a>" (1990), and "<a href="Lolita%20%281997%20film%29">Lolita</a>" (1997), remain unpublished and in the case of the latter two films, uncredited, though several scenes from or aspects of his scripts were used in these finished films. His screenplays "<a href="Remembrance%20of%20Things%20Past%20%28play%29">The Proust Screenplay</a>" (1972), "Victory" (1982), and "<a href="The%20Dreaming%20Child%20%28screenplay%20by%20Harold%20Pinter%29">The Dreaming Child</a>" (1997) and his unpublished screenplay "<a href="The%20Tragedy%20of%20King%20Lear%20%28screenplay%20by%20Harold%20Pinter%29">The Tragedy of King Lear</a>" (2000) have not been filmed. A section of Pinter's "Proust Screenplay" was, however, released as the 1984 film "<a href="In%20Search%20of%20Lost%20Time%23Adaptations">Swann in Love</a>" ("Un amour de Swann"), directed by <a href="Volker%20Schl%C3%B6ndorff">Volker Schlöndorff</a>, and it was also adapted by <a href="Michael%20Bakewell">Michael Bakewell</a> as a two-hour radio drama broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a> in 1995, before Pinter and director Di Trevis collaborated to adapt it for the 2000 National Theatre production.

Pinter's last filmed screenplay was an adaptation of the 1970 <a href="Tony%20Award">Tony Award</a>-winning play "<a href="Sleuth%20%28play%29">Sleuth</a>", by <a href="Anthony%20Shaffer%20%28writer%29">Anthony Shaffer</a>, which was commissioned by <a href="Jude%20Law">Jude Law</a>, one of the film's producers. It is the basis for the 2007 film "<a href="Sleuth%20%282007%20film%29">Sleuth</a>", directed by <a href="Kenneth%20Branagh">Kenneth Branagh</a>. Pinter's screenplays for "<a href="The%20French%20Lieutenant%27s%20Woman%20%28film%29">The French Lieutenant's Woman</a>" and "Betrayal" were nominated for <a href="Academy%20Award">Academy Award</a>s in 1981 and 1983, respectively.

From 16 to 31 July 2001, a Harold Pinter Festival celebrating his work, curated by <a href="Michael%20Colgan%20%28theatre%20director%29">Michael Colgan</a>, artistic director of the <a href="Gate%20Theatre">Gate Theatre</a>, <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, was held as part of the annual Lincoln Center Festival at <a href="Lincoln%20Center%20for%20the%20Performing%20Arts">Lincoln Center</a> in New York City. Pinter participated both as an actor, as Nicolas in "One for the Road", and as a director of a double bill pairing his last play, "Celebration", with his first play, "The Room". As part of a two-week "Harold Pinter Homage" at the World Leaders Festival of Creative Genius, held from 24 September to 30 October 2001, at the Harbourfront Centre, in Toronto, Canada, Pinter presented a dramatic reading of "Celebration" (2000) and also participated in a public interview as part of the <a href="Culture%20in%20Toronto%23Literature">International Festival of Authors</a>.

In December 2001, Pinter was diagnosed with <a href="oesophageal%20cancer">oesophageal cancer</a>, for which, in 2002, he underwent an operation and <a href="chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a>. During the course of his treatment, he directed a production of his play "No Man's Land", and wrote and performed in a new sketch, "Press Conference", for a production of his dramatic sketches at the National Theatre, and from 2002 on he was increasingly active in political causes, writing and presenting politically charged poetry, essays, speeches, as well as involved in developing his final two screenplay adaptations, "The Tragedy of King Lear" and "Sleuth", whose drafts are in the British Library's <a href="Harold%20Pinter%20Archive">Harold Pinter Archive</a> (Add MS 88880/2).

From 9 to 25 January 2003, the Manitoba Theatre Centre, in <a href="Manitoba">Manitoba</a>, Canada, held a nearly month-long "PinterFest", in which over 130 performances of twelve of Pinter's plays were performed by a dozen different theatre companies. Productions during the Festival included: "The Hothouse", "Night School", "The Lover", "The Dumb Waiter", "The Homecoming", "The Birthday Party", "Monologue", "One for the Road", "The Caretaker", "Ashes to Ashes", "Celebration", and "No Man's Land".

In 2005, Pinter stated that he had stopped writing plays and that he would be devoting his efforts more to his political <a href="activism">activism</a> and writing poetry: "I think I've written 29 plays. I think it's enough for me ... My energies are going in different directions—over the last few years I've made a number of political speeches at various locations and ceremonies ... I'm using a lot of energy more specifically about political states of affairs, which I think are very, very worrying as things stand." Some of this later poetry included "The 'Special Relationship'", "Laughter", and "The Watcher".

From 2005, Pinter suffered ill health, including a rare skin disease called <a href="pemphigus">pemphigus</a> and "a form of <a href="Sepsis">septicaemia</a> that afflict[ed] his feet and made it difficult for him to walk." Yet, he completed his screenplay for the film of "Sleuth" in 2005. His last dramatic work for radio, "<a href="Voices%20%28radio%20play%29">Voices</a>" (2005), a collaboration with composer <a href="James%20Clarke%20%28composer%29">James Clarke</a>, adapting selected works by Pinter to music, premièred on <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a> on his 75th birthday on 10 October 2005. Three days later, it was announced that he had won the 2005 Nobel Prize in Literature.

In an interview with Pinter in 2006, conducted by critic Michael Billington as part of the cultural programme of the <a href="2006%20Winter%20Olympics">2006 Winter Olympics</a> in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy, Pinter confirmed that he would continue to write poetry but not plays. In response, the audience shouted "No" in unison, urging him to keep writing. Along with the international symposium on Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, curated by Billington, the 2006 <a href="Europe%20Theatre%20Prize">Europe Theatre Prize</a> theatrical events celebrating Pinter included new productions (in French) of "Precisely" (1983), "One for the Road" (1984), "Mountain Language" (1988), "The New World Order" (1991), "Party Time" (1991), and "Press Conference" (2002) (French versions by Jean Pavans); and "Pinter Plays, Poetry & Prose", an evening of dramatic readings, directed by <a href="Alan%20Stanford">Alan Stanford</a>, of the <a href="Gate%20Theatre">Gate Theatre</a>, <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>. In June 2006, the <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">British Academy of Film and Television Arts</a> (BAFTA) hosted a celebration of Pinter's films curated by his friend, the playwright <a href="David%20Hare%20%28playwright%29">David Hare</a>. Hare introduced the selection of film clips by saying: "To jump back into the world of Pinter's movies ... is to remind yourself of a literate mainstream cinema, focused as much as <a href="Ingmar%20Bergman">Bergman</a>'s is on the human face, in which tension is maintained by a carefully crafted mix of image and dialogue."

After returning to London from the <a href="Edinburgh%20International%20Book%20Festival">Edinburgh International Book Festival</a>, in September 2006, Pinter began rehearsing for his performance of the role of <a href="Krapp%27s%20Last%20Tape%23Characters">Krapp</a> in <a href="Samuel%20Beckett">Samuel Beckett</a>'s one-act <a href="monologue">monologue</a> "<a href="Krapp%27s%20Last%20Tape">Krapp's Last Tape</a>", which he performed from a motorised wheelchair in a limited run the following month at the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court Theatre</a> to sold-out audiences and "ecstatic" critical reviews. The production ran for only nine performances, as part of the 50th-anniversary celebration season of the <a href="Royal%20Court%20Theatre">Royal Court Theatre</a>; it sold out within minutes of the opening of the box office and tickets commanded large sums from <a href="ticket%20resale">ticket resellers</a>. One performance was filmed and broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Four">BBC Four</a> on 21 June 2007, and also screened later, as part of the memorial PEN Tribute to Pinter, in New York, on 2 May 2009.

In October and November 2006, <a href="Sheffield%20Theatres">Sheffield Theatres</a> hosted . It featured productions of seven of Pinter's plays: "The Caretaker", "Voices", "No Man's Land", "Family Voices", "Tea Party", "The Room", "One for the Road", and "The Dumb Waiter"; and films (most his screenplays; some in which Pinter appears as an actor).

In February and March 2007, a 50th anniversary of "The Dumb Waiter", was produced at the <a href="Trafalgar%20Studios">Trafalgar Studios</a>. Later in February 2007, <a href="John%20Crowley%20%28director%29">John Crowley</a>'s film version of Pinter's play "Celebration" (2000) was shown on "<a href="More4">More4</a>" (<a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a>, UK). On 18 March 2007, <a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a> broadcast a new radio production of "The Homecoming", directed by <a href="Thea%20Sharrock">Thea Sharrock</a> and produced by Martin J. Smith, with Pinter performing the role of Max (for the first time; he had previously played Lenny on stage in 1964). A revival of "The Hothouse" opened at the National Theatre, in London, in July 2007, concurrently with a revival of "Betrayal" at the <a href="Donmar%20Warehouse">Donmar Warehouse</a>, directed by <a href="Roger%20Michell">Roger Michell</a>.
Revivals in 2008 included the 40th-anniversary production of the American première of "The Homecoming" on Broadway, directed by <a href="Daniel%20J.%20Sullivan">Daniel J. Sullivan</a>. From 8 to 24 May 2008, the <a href="Lyric%20Hammersmith">Lyric Hammersmith</a> celebrated the 50th anniversary of "The Birthday Party" with a revival and related events, including a gala performance and reception hosted by Harold Pinter on 19 May 2008, exactly 50 years after its London première there.

The final revival during Pinter's lifetime was a production of "No Man's Land", directed by <a href="Rupert%20Goold">Rupert Goold</a>, opening at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in August 2008, and then transferring to the <a href="Duke%20of%20York%27s%20Theatre">Duke of York's Theatre</a>, London, where it played until 3 January 2009. On the Monday before Christmas 2008, Pinter was admitted to <a href="Hammersmith%20Hospital">Hammersmith Hospital</a>, where he died on Christmas Eve from liver cancer. On 26 December 2008, when "No Man's Land" reopened at the Duke of York's, the actors paid tribute to Pinter from the stage, with Michael Gambon reading Hirst's monologue about his "photograph album" from Act Two that Pinter had asked him to read at his funeral, ending with a standing ovation from the audience, many of whom were in tears:

Pinter's funeral was a private, half-hour secular ceremony conducted at the graveside at <a href="Kensal%20Green%20Cemetery">Kensal Green Cemetery</a>, 31 December 2008. The eight readings selected in advance by Pinter included passages from seven of his own writings and from the story "<a href="The%20Dead%20%28short%20story%29">The Dead</a>", by <a href="James%20Joyce">James Joyce</a>, which was read by actress <a href="Penelope%20Wilton">Penelope Wilton</a>. <a href="Michael%20Gambon">Michael Gambon</a> read the "photo album" speech from "No Man's Land" and three other readings, including Pinter's poem "Death" (1997). Other readings honoured Pinter's widow and his love of cricket. The ceremony was attended by many notable theatre people, including <a href="Tom%20Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>, but not by Pinter's son, Daniel Brand. At its end, Pinter's widow, Antonia Fraser, stepped forward to his grave and quoted from <a href="Horatio%20%28character%29">Horatio</a>'s speech after the death of <a href="Prince%20Hamlet">Hamlet</a>: "Goodnight, sweet prince, / And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest."

The night before Pinter's burial, theatre marquees on Broadway dimmed their lights for a minute in tribute, and on the final night of "No Man's Land" at the Duke of York's Theatre on 3 January 2009, all of the <a href="Ambassador%20Theatre%20Group">Ambassador Theatre Group</a> in the West End dimmed their lights for an hour to honour the playwright. 

<a href="Diane%20Abbott">Diane Abbott</a>, the <a href="Member%20of%20Parliament%20%28UK%29">Member of Parliament</a> for <a href="Hackney%20North%20and%20Stoke%20Newington%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">Hackney North & Stoke Newington</a> proposed an <a href="early%20day%20motion">early day motion</a> in the <a href="House%20of%20Commons%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">House of Commons</a> to support a residents' campaign to restore the Clapton Cinematograph Theatre, established in <a href="Lower%20Clapton">Lower Clapton Road</a> in 1910, and to turn it into a memorial to Pinter "to honour this Hackney boy turned literary great." On 2 May 2009, a free public memorial tribute was held at <a href="CUNY%20Graduate%20Center">The Graduate Center</a> of The <a href="City%20University%20of%20New%20York">City University of New York</a>. It was part of the 5th Annual <a href="PEN%20World%20Voices">PEN World Voices Festival</a> of International Literature, taking place in New York City. Another memorial celebration, held in the Olivier Theatre, at the <a href="Royal%20National%20Theatre">Royal National Theatre</a>, in London, on the evening of 7 June 2009, consisted of excerpts and readings from Pinter's writings by nearly three dozen actors, many of whom were his friends and associates, including: <a href="Eileen%20Atkins">Eileen Atkins</a>, <a href="David%20Bradley%20%28English%20actor%29">David Bradley</a>, <a href="Colin%20Firth">Colin Firth</a>, <a href="Henry%20Goodman">Henry Goodman</a>, <a href="Sheila%20Hancock">Sheila Hancock</a>, <a href="Alan%20Rickman">Alan Rickman</a>, <a href="Penelope%20Wilton">Penelope Wilton</a>, <a href="Susan%20Wooldridge">Susan Wooldridge</a>, and <a href="Henry%20Woolf">Henry Woolf</a>; and a troupe of students from the <a href="London%20Academy%20of%20Music%20and%20Dramatic%20Art">London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art</a>, directed by Ian Rickson.

On 16 June 2009, Antonia Fraser officially opened a commemorative room at the <a href="Hackney%20Empire">Hackney Empire</a>. The theatre also established a writer's residency in Pinter's name. Most of issue number 28 of <a href="Craig%20Raine">Craig Raine</a>'s Arts Tri-Quarterly "<a href="Aret%C3%A9">Areté</a>" was devoted to pieces remembering Pinter, beginning with Pinter's 1987 unpublished love poem dedicated "To Antonia" and his poem "Paris", written in 1975 (the year in which he and Fraser began living together), followed by brief memoirs by some of Pinter's associates and friends, including <a href="Patrick%20Marber">Patrick Marber</a>, <a href="Nina%20Raine">Nina Raine</a>, <a href="Tom%20Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>, <a href="Peter%20Nichols">Peter Nichols</a>, <a href="Susanna%20Gross">Susanna Gross</a>, <a href="Richard%20Eyre">Richard Eyre</a>, and David Hare.

A memorial cricket match at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a> between the Gaieties Cricket Club and the Lord's Taverners, followed by performances of Pinter's poems and excerpts from his plays, took place on 27 September 2009.

In 2009, <a href="English%20PEN">English PEN</a> established the <a href="PEN/Pinter%20Prize">PEN Pinter Prize</a>, which is awarded annually to a British writer or a writer resident in Britain who, in the words of Pinter's Nobel speech, casts an 'unflinching, unswerving' gaze upon the world, and shows a 'fierce intellectual determination ... to define the real truth of our lives and our societies'. The prize is shared with an international writer of courage. The inaugural winners of the prize were <a href="Tony%20Harrison">Tony Harrison</a> and the Burmese poet and comedian <a href="Zarganar">Maung Thura (a.k.a. Zarganar)</a>.

In January 2011 "Being Harold Pinter", a theatrical collage of excerpts from Pinter's dramatic works, his Nobel Lecture, and letters of Belarusian prisoners, created and performed by the <a href="Belarus%20Free%20Theatre">Belarus Free Theatre</a>, evoked a great deal of attention in the <a href="public%20media">public media</a>. The Free Theatre's members had to be smuggled out of <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>, owing to a government crackdown on dissident artists, to perform their production in a two-week sold-out engagement at <a href="La%20MaMa">La MaMa</a> in New York as part of the 2011 <a href="Under%20the%20Radar%20Festival">Under the Radar Festival</a>. In an additional sold-out benefit performance at the <a href="Public%20Theater">Public Theater</a>, co-hosted by playwrights <a href="Tony%20Kushner">Tony Kushner</a> and <a href="Tom%20Stoppard">Tom Stoppard</a>, the prisoner's letters were read by ten guest performers: <a href="Mandy%20Patinkin">Mandy Patinkin</a>, <a href="Kevin%20Kline">Kevin Kline</a>, <a href="Olympia%20Dukakis">Olympia Dukakis</a>, <a href="Lily%20Rabe">Lily Rabe</a>, <a href="Linda%20Emond">Linda Emond</a>, <a href="Josh%20Hamilton%20%28actor%29">Josh Hamilton</a>, <a href="Stephen%20Spinella">Stephen Spinella</a>, <a href="Lou%20Reed">Lou Reed</a>, <a href="Laurie%20Anderson">Laurie Anderson</a>, and <a href="Philip%20Seymour%20Hoffman">Philip Seymour Hoffman</a>. In solidarity with the Belarus Free Theatre, collaborations of actors and theatre companies joined in offering additional benefit readings of "Being Harold Pinter" across the United States.

In September 2011, British Theatre owners, <a href="Ambassador%20Theatre%20Group">Ambassador Theatre Group</a> (ATG) announced it was renaming its "Comedy Theatre", Panton Street, London to become "The <a href="Harold%20Pinter%20Theatre">Harold Pinter Theatre</a>". <a href="Howard%20Panter">Howard Panter</a>, Joint CEO and Creative Director of ATG told the <a href="BBC">BBC</a>, "The work of Pinter has become an integral part of the history of the Comedy Theatre. The re-naming of one of our most successful West End theatres is a fitting tribute to a man who made such a mark on British theatre who, over his 50 year career, became recognised as one of the most influential modern British dramatists."

An Honorary Associate of the <a href="National%20Secular%20Society">National Secular Society</a>, a Fellow of the <a href="Royal%20Society%20of%20Literature">Royal Society of Literature</a>, and an Honorary Fellow of the <a href="Modern%20Language%20Association">Modern Language Association of America</a> (1970), Pinter was appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> in 1966 and became a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Companions%20of%20Honour">Companion of Honour</a> in 2002, having declined a knighthood in 1996. In 1995, he accepted the <a href="David%20Cohen%20Prize">David Cohen Prize</a>, in recognition of a lifetime of literary achievement. In 1996, he received a <a href="Laurence%20Olivier%20Awards">Laurence Olivier Special Award</a> for lifetime achievement in the theatre. In 1997 he became a <a href="British%20Academy%20of%20Film%20and%20Television%20Arts">BAFTA</a> Fellow. He received the World Leaders Award for "Creative Genius" as the subject of a week-long "Homage" in Toronto, in October 2001. In 2004, he received the <a href="Wilfred%20Owen">Wilfred Owen</a> Award for Poetry for his "lifelong contribution to literature, 'and specifically for his collection of poetry entitled "War", published in 2003'". In March 2006, he was awarded the <a href="Europe%20Theatre%20Prize">Europe Theatre Prize</a> in recognition of lifetime achievements pertaining to drama and theatre. In conjunction with that award, the critic Michael Billington coordinated an international conference on Pinter: Passion, Poetry, Politics, including scholars and critics from Europe and the Americas, held in <a href="Turin">Turin</a>, Italy, from 10 to 14 March 2006.

In October 2008, the <a href="Central%20School%20of%20Speech%20and%20Drama">Central School of Speech and Drama</a> announced that Pinter had agreed to become its president and awarded him an <a href="Honorary%20title%20%28academic%29">honorary fellowship</a> at its graduation ceremony. On his appointment, Pinter commented: "I was a student at Central in 1950–51. I enjoyed my time there very much and I am delighted to become president of a remarkable institution." But he had to receive that honorary degree, his 20th, in absentia owing to ill health. His presidency of the school was brief; he died just two weeks after the graduation ceremony, on 24 December 2008.

On 13 October 2005, the <a href="Swedish%20Academy">Swedish Academy</a> announced that it had decided to award the <a href="Nobel%20Prize%20in%20Literature">Nobel Prize in Literature</a> for that year to Pinter, who "in his plays uncovers the precipice under everyday prattle and forces entry into oppression's closed rooms". Its selection instigated some public controversy and criticism relating both to <a href="Characteristics%20of%20Harold%20Pinter%27s%20work">characteristics of Pinter's work</a> and to his politics. When interviewed that day about his reaction to the announcement, Pinter said: "I was told today that one of the Sky channels said this morning that 'Harold Pinter is dead.' Then they changed their mind and said, 'No, he's won the Nobel prize.' So I've risen from the dead." The <a href="Nobel%20Prize">Nobel Prize</a> Awards Ceremony and related events throughout Scandinavia took place in December 2005. After the Academy notified Pinter of his award, he had planned to travel to <a href="Stockholm">Stockholm</a> to present his Nobel Lecture in person. In November, however, his doctor sent him to hospital and barred such travel, after a serious infection was diagnosed. Pinter's publisher, Stephen Page of <a href="Faber%20and%20Faber">Faber and Faber</a>, accepted the Nobel Diploma and Nobel Medal at the Awards Ceremony in his place.

Although still being treated in hospital, Pinter videotaped his Nobel Lecture, "Art, Truth and Politics", at a <a href="Channel%204">Channel 4</a> studio. It was projected on three large screens at the Swedish Academy on the evening of 7 December 2005, and transmitted on <a href="More%204">More 4</a> that same evening in the UK. The 46-minute lecture was introduced on television by David Hare. Later, the text and streaming video formats (without Hare's introduction) were posted on the Nobel Prize and Swedish Academy official websites. It has since been released as a DVD.

Pinter quoted Father John Metcalf speaking to <a href="Raymond%20G.%20H.%20Seitz">Raymond Seitz</a>, then Minister at the US Embassy in London, "My parishioners [in <a href="Nicaragua">Nicaragua</a>] built a school, a health centre, a cultural centre. We have lived in peace. A few months ago a <a href="Contras">Contra</a> force attacked the parish. They destroyed everything: the school, the health centre, the cultural centre. They raped nurses and teachers, slaughtered doctors, in the most brutal manner. They behaved like savages. Please demand that the US government withdraw its support from this shocking terrorist activity." Seitz responded, "Let me tell you something. In war, innocent people always suffer." Pinter called the US invasion of Iraq "an arbitrary military action inspired by a series of lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public", and condemned the British government for its cooperation.

Pinter's lecture has been widely distributed by print and online media and has provoked much commentary and debate, with some commentators accusing Pinter of "anti-Americanism". In his Nobel Lecture, however, Pinter emphasises that he criticises policies and practices of American administrations (and those who voted for them), not all American citizens, many of whom he recognises as "demonstrably sickened, shamed and angered by their government's actions".

On 18 January 2007, French Prime Minister <a href="Dominique%20de%20Villepin">Dominique de Villepin</a> presented Pinter with France's highest civil honour, the <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Légion d'honneur</a>, at a ceremony at the French embassy in London. De Villepin praised Pinter's poem "American Football" (1991) stating: "With its violence and its cruelty, it is for me one of the most accurate images of war, one of the most telling metaphors of the temptation of imperialism and violence." In response, Pinter praised France's opposition to the war in Iraq. M. de Villepin concluded: "The poet stands still and observes what doesn't deserve other men's attention. Poetry teaches us how to live and you, Harold Pinter, teach us how to live." He said that Pinter received the award particularly "because in seeking to capture all the facets of the human spirit, [Pinter's] works respond to the aspirations of the French public, and its taste for an understanding of man and of what is truly universal". Lawrence Pollard observed that "the award for the great playwright underlines how much Mr Pinter is admired in countries like France as a model of the uncompromising radical intellectual".

Some scholars and critics challenge the validity of Pinter's critiques of what he terms "the modes of thinking of those in power" or dissent from his retrospective viewpoints on his own work. In 1985, Pinter recalled that his early act of conscientious objection resulted from being "terribly disturbed as a young man by the Cold War. And McCarthyism ... A profound hypocrisy. 'They' the monsters, 'we' the good. In 1948, the Russian suppression of Eastern Europe was an obvious and brutal fact, but I felt very strongly then and feel as strongly now that we have an obligation to subject our own actions and attitudes to an equivalent critical and moral scrutiny." Scholars agree that Pinter's dramatic rendering of power relations results from this scrutiny.

Pinter's aversion to any censorship by "the authorities" is epitomised in Petey's line at the end of "The Birthday Party". As the broken-down and reconstituted Stanley is being carted off by the figures of authority Goldberg and McCann, Petey calls after him, "Stan, don't let them tell you what to do!" Pinter told Gussow in 1988, "I've lived that line all my damn life. Never more than now." The example of Pinter's stalwart opposition to what he termed "the modes of thinking of those in power"—the "brick wall" of the "minds" perpetuating the "status quo"—infused the "vast political pessimism" that some academic critics may perceive in his artistic work, its "drowning landscape" of harsh contemporary realities, with some residual "hope for restoring the dignity of man."

As Pinter's long-time friend David Jones reminded analytically inclined scholars and dramatic critics, Pinter was one of the "great comic writers": His dramatic conflicts present serious implications for his characters and his audiences, leading to sustained inquiry about "the point" of his work and multiple "critical strategies" for developing interpretations and stylistic analyses of it.

Pinter's unpublished manuscripts and letters to and from him are held in the Harold Pinter Archive in the Modern Literary Manuscripts division of the <a href="British%20Library">British Library</a>. Smaller collections of Pinter manuscripts are in the <a href="Harry%20Ransom%20Humanities%20Research%20Center">Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center</a>, the <a href="University%20of%20Texas%20at%20Austin">University of Texas at Austin</a>; <a href="Indiana%20University%20%28Bloomington%29">The Lilly Library</a>, <a href="Indiana%20University%20%28Bloomington%29">Indiana University at Bloomington</a>; the Mandeville Special Collections Library, Geisel Library, at the <a href="University%20of%20California%2C%20San%20Diego">University of California, San Diego</a>; the <a href="British%20Film%20Institute">British Film Institute</a>, in London; and the Margaret Herrick Library, <a href="Pickford%20Center%20for%20Motion%20Picture%20Study">Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study</a>, the <a href="Academy%20of%20Motion%20Picture%20Arts%20and%20Sciences">Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences</a>, <a href="Beverly%20Hills%2C%20California">Beverly Hills, California</a>.
