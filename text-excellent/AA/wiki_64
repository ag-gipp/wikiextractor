Josephine Butler

Josephine Elizabeth Butler (' Grey; 13 April 1828 – 30 December 1906) was an English <a href="feminism">feminist</a> and <a href="social%20reform">social reform</a>er in the <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a>. She campaigned for <a href="women%27s%20suffrage">women's suffrage</a>, the right of women to better education, the end of <a href="coverture">coverture</a> in British law, the abolition of <a href="child%20prostitution">child prostitution</a>, and an end to <a href="human%20trafficking">human trafficking</a> of young women and children into European <a href="prostitution">prostitution</a>.

Grey grew up in a well-to-do and politically connected <a href="progressivism">progressive</a> family which helped develop in her a strong social conscience and firmly held religious ideals. She married <a href="George%20Butler%20%281819%E2%80%931890%29">George Butler</a>, an <a href="Anglicanism%23Anglican%20divines">Anglican divine</a> and schoolmaster, and the couple had four children, the last of whom, Eva, died falling from a banister. The death was a turning point for Butler, and she focused her feelings on helping others, starting with the inhabitants of a local <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a>. She began to campaign for women's rights in British law. In 1869 she became involved in the campaign to repeal the <a href="Contagious%20Diseases%20Acts">Contagious Diseases Acts</a>, legislation that attempted to control the spread of venereal diseases—particularly in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>—through the forced medical examination of prostitutes, a process she described as surgical or steel rape. The campaign achieved its final success in 1886 with the repeal of the Acts. Butler also formed the <a href="International%20Abolitionist%20Federation">International Abolitionist Federation</a>, a Europe-wide organisation to combat similar systems on the continent.

While investigating the effect of the Acts, Butler had been appalled that some of the prostitutes were as young as 12, and that there was a <a href="Human%20trafficking">slave trade</a> of young women and children from England to the continent for the purpose of prostitution. A campaign to combat the trafficking led to the removal from office of the head of the Belgian "", and the trial and imprisonment of his deputy and 12 brothel owners, who were all involved in the trade. Butler fought child prostitution with help from the campaigning editor of "<a href="The%20Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">The Pall Mall Gazette</a>", <a href="William%20Thomas%20Stead">William Thomas Stead</a>, who <a href="Eliza%20Armstrong%20case">purchased a 13-year-old girl</a> from her mother for £5. The subsequent outcry led to the <a href="Criminal%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201885">Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885</a> which raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 and brought in measures to stop children becoming prostitutes. Her final campaign was in the late-1890s, against the Contagious Diseases Acts which continued to be implemented in the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a>.

Butler <a href="Josephine%20Butler%20bibliography">wrote more than 90 books and pamphlets</a> over the course of her career, most of which were in support of her campaigning, although she also produced biographies of <a href="John%20Grey%20%28land%20agent%29">her father</a>, her husband and <a href="Catherine%20of%20Siena">Catherine of Siena</a>. Butler's <a href="Christian%20feminism">Christian feminism</a> is celebrated by the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> with a <a href="Lesser%20Festival">Lesser Festival</a>, and by representations of her in the <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> windows of <a href="Liverpool%20Cathedral">Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral</a> and <a href="St%20Olave%20Hart%20Street">St Olave's Church</a> in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>. Her name appears on the Reformers Memorial in <a href="Kensal%20Green%20Cemetery">Kensal Green Cemetery</a>, London, and <a href="Durham%20University">Durham University</a> named <a href="Josephine%20Butler%20College%2C%20Durham">one of their colleges</a> after her. Her campaign strategies changed the way feminist and suffragists conducted future struggles, and her work brought into the political milieu groups of people that had never been active before. After her death in 1906 the feminist intellectual <a href="Millicent%20Fawcett">Millicent Fawcett</a> hailed her as "the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century".

Josephine Grey was born on 13 April 1828 at <a href="Milfield">Milfield</a>, <a href="Northumberland">Northumberland</a>. She was the fourth daughter and seventh child of Hannah ("" Annett) and <a href="John%20Grey%20%28land%20agent%29">John Grey</a>, a land agent and agricultural expert, who was a cousin of the reformist British <a href="Prime%20Minister%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>, <a href="Charles%20Grey%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Grey">Lord Grey</a>. In 1833 John was appointed manager of the Greenwich Hospital Estates in Dilston, near <a href="Corbridge">Corbridge</a>, Northumberland, and the family moved to the area, where John acted as Lord Grey's chief political agent in Northumberland. In this role John promoted his cousin's political opinions locally, including support for <a href="Catholic%20emancipation">Catholic emancipation</a>, the <a href="Abolitionism%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">abolition of slavery</a>, the repeal of the <a href="Corn%20Laws">Corn Laws</a> and reform of the <a href="English%20Poor%20Laws">poor laws</a>. Josephine was taught at home before completing her schooling at a <a href="boarding%20school">boarding school</a> in <a href="Newcastle%20upon%20Tyne">Newcastle upon Tyne</a> which she attended for two years.

John treated his children equally within the home. He educated them in politics and social issues and exposed them to various politically important visitors. John's political work and ideology had a strong influence on his daughter, as did the religious teaching she received from her mother; the family background and the circles in which she moved formed a strong social conscience and a staunch religious faith.

At about the age of 17 Grey went through a religious crisis, which probably stemmed from an incident in which she discovered the body of a suicide while out riding. She became disenchanted with her weekly church attendance, describing the local vicar as "an honest man in the pulpit ... [who] taught us loyally all that he probably himself knew about God, but whose words did not even touch the fringe of my soul's deep discontent". Following her crisis, Grey did not identify with any single strand of Christianity, and remained critical of the <a href="Anglicanism">Anglican church</a>. She later wrote that she "imbibed from childhood the widest ideas of vital Christianity, only it "was" Christianity. I have not much sympathy with the "Church". She began to speak directly to God in her prayers:

In mid-1847 Grey visited her brother in <a href="County%20Laois">County Laois</a>, Ireland. It was at the height of the <a href="Great%20Famine%20%28Ireland%29">Great Famine</a> and the first time she had come into contact with widespread suffering among the poor; she was deeply affected by her experiences and later recalled that "As a young girl, I had no conception of the full meaning of the misery I saw around me, yet it printed itself upon my brain and memory."

By 1850 Grey had grown close to <a href="George%20Butler%20%281819%E2%80%931890%29">George Butler</a>, a <a href="Fellow%23Oxford%2C%20Cambridge%20and%20Dublin">Fellow</a> of <a href="Exeter%20College%2C%20Oxford">Exeter College, Oxford</a>, whom she had met at several of the <a href="Ball%20%28dance%20party%29">balls</a> hosted around <a href="County%20Durham">County Durham</a>. By October that year George was sending her self-penned poems; the couple were engaged in January 1851 and married in January 1852. The Butlers set up home at 124, <a href="High%20Street%2C%20Oxford">High Street, Oxford</a>. George was a scholar and cleric and shared with his wife a commitment to <a href="liberal%20reforms">liberal reforms</a> and a love of Italian culture. The couple also both had a strong Christian belief and Josephine Butler later wrote of her husband that they often "prayed together that a holy revolution might come about and that the Kingdom of God might be established on the earth".

In November 1852 the Butlers had a son, George Grey Butler, followed by a second, Arthur Stanley—known as Stanley—in May 1854. Butler's later memories of Oxford were of a closeted and <a href="Misogyny">misogynist</a> community lacking in family life; she was often the only female at social gatherings and would listen in anger to what her biographer Judith Walkowitz describes as "the open acceptance of the double standard by the gentlemen of the university". Butler was offended by a discussion regarding the publication in 1853 of <a href="Elizabeth%20Gaskell">Elizabeth Gaskell</a>'s novel "<a href="Ruth%20%28novel%29">Ruth</a>" in which the heroine is seduced by a man of means and subsequently abandoned. Butler saw that the male conversationalists considered it natural that a "moral lapse in a woman was spoken of as an immensely worse thing than in a man"; she decided not to voice her feelings on the point but "to speak little with men, but much with God". As a more practical measure she—and George—began to help many of the <a href="fallen%20woman">fallen woman</a> of Oxford and invited some to live in their house. One case in which they were involved concerned a young woman serving a prison sentence at <a href="Newgate%20Prison">Newgate Prison</a>. She had been seduced by a <a href="university%20don">university don</a> who had subsequently abandoned her; the woman had murdered her baby in despair. The Butlers contacted the governor of Newgate to arrange for her to stay in their house at the end of her sentence.
In 1856 Butler's health began to suffer from Oxford's damp atmosphere, which exacerbated a long-standing lesion on her lung; her doctor informed her that to remain in Oxford could be fatal. As an immediate step George purchased a house in <a href="Clifton%2C%20Bristol">Clifton</a>, near <a href="Bristol">Bristol</a>, where their third son, Charles, was born in 1857. The same year, as a longer-term measure, George took the position of vice-principal at <a href="Cheltenham%20College">Cheltenham College</a> and they moved to a local house. They continued their support for liberal causes, including that of the Italian nationalist <a href="Giuseppe%20Garibaldi">Giuseppe Garibaldi</a>, although their sympathy for the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a> side in the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> led to social ostracism; Butler considered that the resultant feeling of social isolation "was often painful ... but the discipline was useful".

In May 1859 Butler gave birth to her final child, a daughter, Evangeline Mary, known as Eva. In August 1864 Eva fell from the top-floor banister onto the stone floor of the hallway in her home; she died three hours later. Butler was distraught at the loss and had disturbed sleep for several years; she was unable to write about the circumstances until 30 years later. The subsequent inquest gave a verdict of <a href="accidental%20death">accidental death</a>.

In October 1864 Stanley contracted <a href="diphtheria">diphtheria</a> while Butler was still grieving for Eva. She was suffering from depression and was in poor health. After the worst of Stanley's ailment passed, Butler decided to take him to <a href="Naples">Naples</a> for them both to rest and recuperate. The ship in which they travelled down the west coast of Italy faced rough weather, and Butler had a physical breakdown on board from which she nearly died.

In January 1866 George was appointed headmaster of <a href="Liverpool%20College">Liverpool College</a>, and the family moved to premises in the <a href="Dingle%2C%20Liverpool">Dingle</a> area. Despite the new surroundings, Butler continued to mourn for Eva but focused her feelings on helping others; she later wrote that she "became possessed with an irresistible urge to go forth and find some pain keener than my own, to meet with people more unhappy than myself. ... It was not difficult to find misery in Liverpool." She made regular visits to the <a href="workhouse">workhouse</a> at Brownlow Hill, an institution that could hold 5,000 individuals. She would sit with the women in the cellars—many of whom were prisoners—and pick <a href="oakum">oakum</a> with them, while discussing the Bible or praying with them.

Just as they had done in Cheltenham, the Butlers began providing shelter in their own home for some of the women, often prostitutes in the terminal stages of <a href="venereal%20disease">venereal disease</a>. It soon became clear that there were more women in need than they could provide for, so Butler set up a hostel, with funds from local men of means. By Easter 1867 she had established a second, larger home, in which more appropriate work was provided, such as sewing and the manufacture of envelopes; the "Industrial Home", as she called it, was funded by the workhouse committee and local merchants.

Butler campaigned for women's rights, including <a href="Women%27s%20suffrage">the right to the vote</a> and to have a better education. In 1866 she was a signatory on a petition to amend the <a href="Reform%20Act%201867">Reform Bill</a> to widen the <a href="Suffrage">franchise</a> to include women. The petition, which was supported by the <a href="Member%20of%20parliament%23United%20Kingdom">MP</a> and philosopher <a href="John%20Stuart%20Mill">John Stuart Mill</a>, was ignored and the bill became law.

Butler considered the Liverpool hostels a stop-gap; women would continue to struggle to find employment until they had been better educated. In 1867, with the <a href="suffragist">suffragist</a> <a href="Anne%20Clough">Anne Clough</a>, she established the <a href="North%20of%20England%20Council%20for%20Promoting%20the%20Higher%20Education%20of%20Women">North of England Council for Promoting the Higher Education of Women</a>, which aimed to raise the status of governesses and female teachers to that of a <a href="profession">profession</a>; She served as its president until 1873. A series of lectures, initially in towns in the north of England, began under <a href="James%20Stuart%20%28scientist%29">James Stuart</a>, a Fellow of <a href="Trinity%20College%2C%20Cambridge">Trinity College, Cambridge</a>. Although it was thought thirty students would sign up, three hundred joined. In 1868 Butler published "The Education and Employment of Women", her first pamphlet, in which she argued for access to <a href="higher%20education">higher education</a> for women, and more equal access to a wider range of jobs. It was the first of <a href="Josephine%20Butler%20bibliography">90 books and pamphlets</a> she wrote. That May she petitioned the <a href="Senate%20House%20%28University%20of%20Cambridge%29">senate</a> of the <a href="University%20of%20Cambridge">University of Cambridge</a> to provide examinations for women; the Cambridge Higher Examination for women was introduced the following year. Jordan notes that "much of the credit for this should go to Anne Clough, but ... Butler played a very influential part ... of the campaign."

At the time British law relating to marriage was based on the legal doctrine of <a href="coverture">coverture</a>, in which a woman's legal rights and obligations were subsumed by those of her husband upon their matrimony. By law a woman had no separate legal existence, and all her property became her husband's; divorce initiated by a woman was difficult and complicated. In April 1868 Butler and fellow suffragist <a href="Elizabeth%20Clarke%20Wolstenholme%20Elmy">Elizabeth Wolstenholme</a> set up and became joint secretaries of the Married Women's Property Committee to pressure parliament into changing the law. Butler remained on the committee until the campaign was successful, with the passing into law of the <a href="Married%20Women%27s%20Property%20Act%201882">Married Women's Property Act 1882</a>.

In 1869 Butler became aware of the <a href="Contagious%20Diseases%20Acts">Contagious Diseases Acts</a>. They had been introduced in 1864, 1866 and 1869 to regulate prostitution in an attempt to control the spread of venereal diseases, particularly in the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a> and <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a>. The Acts authorised the police to detain women in specific areas considered to be prostitutes—no evidence was needed, other than the police officer's word. If a magistrate agreed, women were given genital examinations. If women were suffering from sexually transmitted diseases, they were held in a <a href="lock%20hospital">lock hospital</a> until the condition was cured. If they refused to be examined or hospitalised they could be imprisoned, often with <a href="hard%20labour">hard labour</a>.

Units of plain-clothed policemen specialised in arresting suspected prostitutes; according to Jordan, the officers were "hated for their surveillance and harassment of prostitutes and working-class women ... who they treated with little regard for their legal rights". Women who were subjected to the examination found their names and reputations affected and, according to the historian Hilary Cashman, "the Acts had the effect of turning them to prostitution by barring respectable ways of life to them".

In September 1869 Wolstenholme met Butler in Bristol to discuss what could be done about the Acts. The National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts was founded that October, but excluded women from its membership. In response, Wolstenholme and Butler formed the <a href="Ladies%20National%20Association%20for%20the%20Repeal%20of%20the%20Contagious%20Diseases%20Acts">Ladies National Association for the Repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts</a> (LNA) before the end of the year. The organisation published a "Ladies Manifesto", which stated that the Acts were discriminatory on grounds of both sex and class; the Acts, it was claimed:

On 31 December 1869 the Ladies National Association published a statement in "<a href="The%20Daily%20News%20%28UK%29">The Daily News</a>" that it had "been formed for the purposes of obtaining the repeal of these obnoxious Acts". Among the 124 signatories were the social theorist <a href="Harriet%20Martineau">Harriet Martineau</a> and the social reformer <a href="Florence%20Nightingale">Florence Nightingale</a>.

Butler toured Britain in 1870, travelling 3,700 miles to attend 99 meetings in the course of the year. She focused her attention on working-class family men, the majority of whom were outraged at the description Butler gave of the examination women were forced to undergo; she called the process surgical or steel rape. Although she persuaded many members of her audiences, she faced significant opposition, which put her in danger. At one meeting <a href="Procuring%20%28prostitution%29">pimps</a> threw cow dung at her; at another, the windows of her hotel were smashed, while at a third, threats were made to burn down the building where she was hosting a meeting.

At the <a href="Colchester%20by-election%2C%201870">1870 Colchester parliamentary by-election</a> the LNA fielded a candidate against the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28UK%29">Liberal Party</a> candidate <a href="Henry%20Knight%20Storks">Sir Henry Storks</a>, a supporter of the Acts, who had implemented a similar regime when he commanded the British army in Malta. Butler held several local meetings during the campaign; during one, she was chased by a group of <a href="brothel">brothel</a> owners. The presence of the LNA candidate split the Liberal vote and allowed the <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative Party</a> candidate to win the seat; Butler considered that "it proved to be somewhat of a turning-point in the history of our crusade". Because of Stork's loss at the by-election the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a>, <a href="Henry%20Bruce%2C%201st%20Baron%20Aberdare">Henry Bruce</a>, announced a <a href="Royal%20Commission">Royal Commission</a> to examine the situation. One <a href="Member%20of%20parliament">MP</a> told Butler that

The commission began work in early January 1871 and spent six months taking evidence. After Butler testified on 18 March, a member of the committee, Liberal MP <a href="Peter%20Rylands">Peter Rylands</a>, stated: "I am not accustomed to religious phraseology, but I cannot give you an idea of the effect produced except by saying that the spirit of God was there". Nevertheless, the commission's report defended the one-sided nature of the legislation, saying "... there is no comparison to be made between prostitutes and the men who consort with them. With the one sex the offence is committed as a matter of gain; with the other it is an irregular indulgence of a natural impulse." The report accepted the findings that the sexual health of men in the 18 areas covered by the Acts had improved. In relation to the compulsory examinations, the commission was swayed by the descriptions of "steel rape", and suggested it should be voluntary not compulsory. The commission heard significant evidence that many prostitutes were as young as 12 and recommended that the <a href="age%20of%20consent">age of consent</a> should be raised from 12 to 14. Bruce took no action on the recommendations for six months.

In February 1872 Bruce proposed a bill that took some of the commission's recommendations, but widened the geographical scope from the 18 military centres to the whole of the UK. Although the LNA's initial stance was to accept some of the bill's clauses and try and change others, Butler rejected it in its entirety and published "The New Era", a 56-page pamphlet attacking the legislation; the pamphlet was re-published in serial form in "The Shield". It was the first split in the repeal movement and she lost many personal supporters because of her stance. The bill faced too much opposition from the parliamentary supporters of the Contagious Diseases Acts, and was withdrawn.

Two months after the withdrawal of Bruce's bill, a <a href="ministerial%20by-election">ministerial by-election</a> <a href="Pontefract%20by-election%2C%201872">in Pontefract in 1872</a> gave the LNA an opportunity for further action. Although they did not field a candidate, Butler attended meetings <a href="Pontefract">in the town</a>. At one LNA meeting the floor of the room had been liberally sprinkled with <a href="cayenne%20pepper">cayenne pepper</a> by her opponents, making speaking difficult. After it was cleared away, her opponents set bales of straw alight in a storeroom below, which led to smoke rising through the floorboards; two members of the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police%20Service">Metropolitan Police</a>—specially drafted into the town for the by-election—looked on but took no action. Although the incumbent Liberal candidate, <a href="Hugh%20Childers">Hugh Childers</a>, was returned, there were heavy abstentions, and his vote was reduced by around 150 (from an electorate of 2,000). In December 1872 Butler met the Prime Minister, <a href="William%20Ewart%20Gladstone">William Gladstone</a>, when he visited Liverpool College. Although he supported the aims of the LNA, he was politically unable to back the LNA publicly, and had supported Bruce's bill.

The <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201874">fall of the Liberal government in 1874</a>, and its replacement with <a href="Benjamin%20Disraeli">Benjamin Disraeli</a>'s <a href="Second%20Disraeli%20ministry">Conservative administration</a> meant that the repeal campaign stalled; Butler called it a "year of discouragement" when there was "deep depression in the work". Although the LNA kept up the pressure, progress in persuading Liberal MPs to oppose the Contagious Diseases Acts was slow, and the government was implacable in its support of the measures.

At a meeting of regional LNA branches in May, one speech focused on legislation in Europe; the meeting resolved to correspond with sister organisations on the continent. At the start of December 1874 Butler left for Paris and a tour that covered France, Italy and Switzerland, where she met with local pressure groups and civic authorities. She encountered strong support from feminist groups, but hostility from the authorities. She returned from her travels at the end of February 1875.

As a result of her experiences, in March 1875 Butler formed the British and Continental Federation for the Abolition of Prostitution (later renamed the <a href="International%20Abolitionist%20Federation">International Abolitionist Federation</a>), an organisation that campaigned against state regulation of prostitution and for "the abolition of female slavery and the elevation of public morality among men". The Liberal MP <a href="James%20Stansfeld">James Stansfeld</a>—who wished to repeal the Acts—became the federation's first general secretary; Butler and her friend, the Liberal MP <a href="Henry%20Wilson%20%28Holmfirth%20MP%29">Henry Wilson</a>, became joint secretaries.

In 1878 Josephine wrote a biography of <a href="Catherine%20of%20Siena">Catherine of Siena</a>, which Glen Petrie—her biographer—thought was probably her best work; Walkowitz considers the work provided a "historical justification for her own political activism". Another biographer, Helen Mathers, believes that "in emphasising that she and Catherine were born to be leaders, of both men and women, ... [Butler] made a profound contribution to feminism".

Butler became aware of the <a href="Human%20trafficking">slave trade</a> of young women and children from England to mainland Europe in 1879. Young girls were considered "fair game", according to Mathers, as the law allowed them to become prostitutes at the age of 13. After playing a minor role in starting an investigation into an accusation of trafficking, Butler became active in the campaign in May 1880, and wrote to "The Shield" that "the official houses of prostitution in Brussels are crowded with English minor girls", and that in one house "there are immured little children, English girls of from twelve to fifteen years of age ... stolen, kidnapped, betrayed, got from English country villages by every artifice and sold to these human shambles". She visited Brussels where she met the mayor and local councillors and made allegations against the head of the Belgian ' and his deputy as to their involvement in the trade. After the meeting she was contacted by a detective who confirmed that the senior members of the ' were guilty of collusion with brothel keepers. She returned home and filed a deposition containing a copy of the statement from the detective and sent them to the ' (Chief Prosecutor) and the British Home Secretary. Following an investigation in Belgium, the head of the ' was removed from office, and his deputy was put on trial alongside 12 brothel owners; all were imprisoned for their roles in the trade.

The <a href="United%20Kingdom%20general%20election%2C%201880">1880 general election</a> had removed Disraeli's Conservative party from office; they were replaced by <a href="Second%20Gladstone%20ministry">Gladstone's second ministry</a> containing a high proportion of MPs who wanted to repeal the Acts. As Prime Minister, Gladstone had the power to nominate candidates to vacant positions within the Church and, in June 1882, he offered George Butler the position of <a href="Canon%20%28priest%29">canon</a> of <a href="Winchester%20Cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</a>. George had been considering retirement, but he and Josephine were concerned about their finances, as much of their income had been spent on the LNA and other causes Josephine supported. George accepted the appointment, and they moved into a <a href="grace%20and%20favour">grace and favour</a> home near the cathedral. Josephine Butler set up another hostel for women near their home.

Political pressure from Liberal <a href="backbencher">backbencher</a>s, particularly <a href="Joseph%20Chamberlain">Joseph Chamberlain</a> and <a href="Charles%20Henry%20Hopwood">Charles Hopwood</a>, led to increasing opposition to the Acts. In February 1883 Hopwood tabled a resolution in parliament: "That this House disapproves of the compulsory examination of women under the Contagious Diseases Acts", which was debated in April. MPs voted by a majority of 72 to suspend the inspections; three years later the Acts were formally repealed.

In 1885 Butler met <a href="Florence%20Eleanor%20Soper">Florence Soper Booth</a>, the daughter-in-law of <a href="William%20Booth">William Booth</a>, who founded <a href="the%20Salvation%20Army">the Salvation Army</a>. The meeting led to Butler's involvement in the campaign to expose <a href="child%20prostitution">child prostitution</a> in Britain and its associated trade. Along with Booth, <a href="Benjamin%20Scott">Benjamin Scott</a> the <a href="Chamberlain%20of%20London">City Chamberlain</a> and several supporters from the LNA, she persuaded the campaigning editor of "<a href="The%20Pall%20Mall%20Gazette">The Pall Mall Gazette</a>", <a href="William%20Thomas%20Stead">William Thomas Stead</a>, to help their cause.

Stead considered the best way to prove that the purchase of young girls for prostitution took place in London, was to buy a girl himself. Butler introduced him to a former prostitute and brothel owner who was staying in her hostel. In a slum in <a href="Marylebone">Marylebone</a>, Stead <a href="Eliza%20Armstrong%20case">purchased a 13-year-old girl</a> from her mother for £5, and took her to France. In July 1885 Stead began the publication of a series of articles entitled "<a href="The%20Maiden%20Tribute%20of%20Modern%20Babylon">The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon</a>", exposing the extent of child prostitution in London. In the first article—which covered six pages of the "Gazette"—Stead recounted an interview he had with <a href="Howard%20Vincent">Howard Vincent</a>, the head of the <a href="Criminal%20Investigation%20Department">Criminal Investigation Department</a>:

On 16 July—ten days after the article was published—Butler gave a speech at a meeting at London's <a href="Exeter%20Hall">Exeter Hall</a> calling for increased protection for the young and the raising of the age of consent. The following day she and George left for a holiday in Switzerland and France. While they were away, a moribund parliamentary bill from 1883 dealing with the age of consent was re-debated by MPs; the <a href="Criminal%20Law%20Amendment%20Act%201885">Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885</a> was passed on 14 August 1885. The Act raised the age of consent from 13 to 16 years of age, while the procurement of girls for prostitution by administering drugs, intimidation or fraud was made a criminal offence, as was the abduction of a girl under 18 for purposes of carnal knowledge. The police investigated Stead's purchase, and Butler was forced to cut her holiday short to return for questioning. Although she avoided all charges, Stead was imprisoned for three months.

The passing of the Criminal Law Amendment Act led to the formation of purity societies, such as the <a href="White%20Cross%20Army">White Cross Army</a>, whose aims were to force the closure of brothels through prosecution. The societies widened their remit to suppress what they considered indecent literature—including information on birth control—and the entertainment provided by the <a href="music%20hall">music hall</a>s. Butler warned against the purity societies because of their "fatuous belief that you can oblige human beings to be moral by force, and in so doing that you may in some way promote social purity". Her warnings went unheeded by other suffragists, and some, such as <a href="Millicent%20Fawcett">Millicent Fawcett</a>—who was later Butler's biographer—continued to combine their activities in the feminist movement with the work for the purity societies.

Although the Contagious Diseases Acts had been repealed in the UK, the equivalent legislation was active in the <a href="British%20Raj">British Raj</a> in India, where prostitutes near the British <a href="cantonment">cantonment</a>s were subjected to regular forced examinations. The relevant law was contained in the Special Cantonments Acts which had been put on to a practical footing by Major-General <a href="Edward%20Chapman%20%28British%20Army%20officer%29">Edward Chapman</a>, who issued <a href="General%20order">standing orders</a> for the inspection of prostitutes, and the provision of "a sufficient number of women, to take care that they are sufficiently attractive, to provide them with proper houses".

Butler began a new campaign to have the legislation repealed, comparing the girls to slaves. After the campaign put pressure on MPs, the widespread publication of Chapman's orders led to what Mathers describes as "outrage across Britain". In June 1888 the House of Commons passed a unanimous resolution repealing the legislation, and the Indian government was ordered to cancel the Acts. To circumvent the order, the <a href="India%20Office">India Office</a> advised the <a href="Viceroy%20of%20India">Viceroy of India</a> to instigate new legislation ensuring that prostitutes suspected of carrying contagious diseases had to undergo an examination or face expulsion from the cantonment.

Towards the end of the 1880s George's health began to decline, and Butler spent increasing time looking after him. They holidayed in Naples in 1889, but George contracted <a href="influenza">influenza</a> in the <a href="1889%E2%80%9390%20flu%20pandemic">1889–90 pandemic</a>. They returned to Britain but George died on 14 March 1890; Butler suspended campaigning in the aftermath of his death. Soon after, she left Winchester, and moved to a house in <a href="Wimbledon%2C%20London">Wimbledon, London</a>, which she shared with her eldest son and his wife.

Butler, at 62, felt she was too old to travel to India, but two American supporters visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Butler spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.

Although many of Butler's friends and supporters of shared causes spoke out against <a href="British%20Empire">British Imperial Policy</a>, Butler did not. She wrote that because of the work Britain had undertaken in making <a href="slavery">slavery</a> illegal, "[w]ith all her faults, looked at from God's point of view, England is the best, and the "least" guilty of the nations". During the <a href="Second%20Boer%20War">Second Boer War</a> (1899–1902), Butler published "Native Races and the War" (1900), in which she supported British action and its imperialist policy. In the book she took a strong line against the casual <a href="racism">racism</a> inherent in her countrymen's dealings with foreigners, writing:

From 1901 Butler began to withdraw from public life, resigning her positions in the campaign organisations and spending more time with her family. In 1903 she moved to <a href="Wooler">Wooler</a> in Northumberland, to live near her eldest son. On 30 December 1906 she died at home and was buried in the nearby village of <a href="Kirknewton%2C%20Northumberland">Kirknewton</a>.

In 1907 Josephine Butler's name was added to the south side of the Reformers' Memorial in <a href="Kensal%20Green%20Cemetery">Kensal Green Cemetery</a>, London. The memorial was erected for those "who had defied custom and interest for the sake of conscience and public good". She is celebrated in the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> with a <a href="Lesser%20Festival">Lesser Festival</a> on 30 May, and represented in a <a href="stained%20glass">stained glass</a> window in Liverpool's <a href="Liverpool%20Cathedral">Anglican Cathedral</a>, <a href="All%20Saints%27%20Church%2C%20Cambridge">All Saints' Church, Cambridge</a> and <a href="St%20Olave%20Hart%20Street">St Olave's Church</a> in the <a href="City%20of%20London">City of London</a>.

Her connections to Liverpool were memorialised in a more secular fashion. A building in the Faculty of Business and Law at <a href="Liverpool%20John%20Moores%20University">Liverpool John Moores University</a> was named "Josephine Butler House". The building, originally the first Radium Institute in the UK, in the Cultural Quarter in <a href="Hope%20Street%2C%20Liverpool">Hope Street</a>, was built in 1867 and demolished in 2013 when the site became a car park and subsequently student housing which opened in 2015.

In 1915 the LNA merged with the International Abolitionist Federation to form the Association of Moral and Social Hygiene, which changed its name to the Josephine Butler Society in 1953. As at 2017 the society still operates; it campaigns for the protection of prostitutes and provides "protection for women and children who are criminally detained, violently abused or exploited by others who profit from their prostitution".

In 2005 <a href="Durham%20University">Durham University</a> named <a href="Josephine%20Butler%20College%2C%20Durham">Josephine Butler College</a> after her, reflecting her and George's connection to the area and the university. The <a href="Women%27s%20Library">Women's Library</a>, at the <a href="London%20School%20of%20Economics">London School of Economics</a>, holds a number of collections related to Butler. They include papers from the Ladies' National Association; more than 2,500 letters in the Josephine Butler Letter Collection; and the Josephine Butler Society Library consisting of books and pamphlets collected by the society. In 2001 <a href="English%20Heritage">English Heritage</a> placed a <a href="blue%20plaque">blue plaque</a> on her former residence in Wimbledon; her former house in Cheltenham was demolished in the 1970s, but in 2002 the Cheltenham Civic Society placed a plaque on the building which now occupies the site.

Butler was not only <a href="Christian%20feminism">a staunch feminist but a passionate Christian</a>, whose favourite phrase was "God and one woman make a majority". Although staunchly liberal, she felt constant tensions between her liberal and feminist philosophies. According to the feminist historian <a href="Barbara%20Caine">Barbara Caine</a>, "Liberalism provided the framework for Butler's whole social and political approach. It was an integral part of her feminism", although it was in conflict with the liberal approach to sexuality and desire. Butler resolved the conflict through her religion.

According to Walkowitz, Butler "pushed liberal feminism in new directions, developing theories and methods of political agitation that directly affected future campaigns for the emancipation of women". She developed new approaches to campaigning and moved the debate beyond discussions in middle-class houses to the public forum, bringing into the political debate women who had never been involved before. Butler's campaigning, says Walkowitz, "not only reshaped gender, class, and sexual subjectivities in late Victorian Britain but also informed national political history and state-building".

Numerous historians consider the success of the campaign to repeal the Contagious Diseases Acts to be a milestone in the <a href="History%20of%20feminism">history of female emancipation</a>. According to the political historian Margaret Hamilton, the campaign showed that "attitudes toward women were changing". The feminist scholar <a href="Sheila%20Jeffreys">Sheila Jeffreys</a> says that Butler is "one of the bravest and most imaginative feminists in history", while Fawcett wrote that she was "convinced that ... [Butler] should take the rank of the most distinguished Englishwoman of the nineteenth century". Her unnamed obituarist in "The Daily News" considered that Butler's name

Styracosaurus

Styracosaurus ( ; meaning "spiked lizard" from the <a href="Ancient%20Greek">Ancient Greek</a> "styrax/στύραξ" "spike at the butt-end of a spear-shaft" and "sauros/" "lizard") is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> <a href="ceratopsia">ceratopsia</a>n <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> from the <a href="Cretaceous">Cretaceous</a> <a href="Period%20%28geology%29">Period</a> (<a href="Campanian">Campanian</a> <a href="faunal%20stage">stage</a>), about 75.5 to 75 <a href="million%20years%20ago">million years ago</a>. It had four to six long parietal spikes extending from its <a href="neck%20frill">neck frill</a>, a smaller jugal horn on each of its cheeks, and a single horn protruding from its nose, which may have been up to long and wide. The function or functions of the horns and frills have been debated for many years.

"Styracosaurus" was a relatively large dinosaur, reaching lengths of and weighing nearly 3 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s. It stood about tall. "Styracosaurus" possessed four short legs and a bulky body. Its tail was rather short. The skull had a beak and shearing cheek teeth arranged in continuous dental batteries, suggesting that the animal sliced up plants. Like other ceratopsians, this dinosaur may have been a <a href="herd%20animal">herd animal</a>, travelling in large groups, as suggested by <a href="bone%20bed">bonebed</a>s.

Named by <a href="Lawrence%20Lambe">Lawrence Lambe</a> in 1913, "Styracosaurus" is a member of the <a href="Centrosaurinae">Centrosaurinae</a>. One <a href="species">species</a>, "S. albertensis", is currently assigned to "Styracosaurus". Another species, "S. ovatus", named in 1930 by <a href="Charles%20Gilmore">Charles Gilmore</a> was reassigned to a new genus, "<a href="Rubeosaurus">Rubeosaurus</a>", by Andrew McDonald and <a href="John%20R.%20Horner">Jack Horner</a> in 2010.

Individuals of the genus "Styracosaurus" were approximately long as adults and weighed around 2.7 tonnes. The skull was massive, with a large <a href="naris">nostril</a>, a tall straight nose horn, and a parietosquamosal frill (a <a href="neck%20frill">neck frill</a>) crowned with at least four large spikes. Each of the four longest frill spines was comparable in length to the nose horn, at long. The nasal horn was estimated by Lambe at long in the <a href="holotype">type</a> specimen, but the tip had not been preserved. Based on other nasal horn cores from "Styracosaurus" and "<a href="Centrosaurus">Centrosaurus</a>", this horn may have come to a more rounded point at around half of that length.

Aside from the large nasal horn and four long frill spikes, the cranial ornamentation was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like projections and knobs at the <a href="anatomical%20terms%20of%20location">posterior</a> margin of the frill, similar to but smaller than those in "Centrosaurus". Others had less prominent tabs. Some, like the type individual, had a third pair of long frill spikes. Others had much smaller projections, and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults. Like most ceratopsids, "Styracosaurus" had large <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestrae</a> (skull openings) in its frill. The front of the mouth had a toothless beak.

The bulky body of "Styracosaurus" resembled that of a <a href="rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>. It had powerful shoulders which may have been useful in intraspecies combat. "Styracosaurus" had a relatively short tail. Each toe bore a hooflike <a href="ungual">ungual</a> which was sheathed in horn.

Various limb positions have been proposed for "Styracosaurus" and ceratopsids in general, including forelegs which were held underneath the body, or, alternatively, held in a sprawling position. The most recent work has put forward an intermediate crouched position as most likely.

The first <a href="fossil">fossil</a> remains of "Styracosaurus" were collected in <a href="Alberta">Alberta</a>, Canada by <a href="Charles%20Mortram%20Sternberg">C.M. Sternberg</a> (from an area now known as <a href="Dinosaur%20Provincial%20Park">Dinosaur Provincial Park</a>, in a <a href="geological%20formation">formation</a> now called the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a>) and named by <a href="Lawrence%20Lambe">Lawrence Lambe</a> in 1913. This quarry was revisited in 1935 by a <a href="Royal%20Ontario%20Museum">Royal Ontario Museum</a> crew who found the missing lower jaws and most of the skeleton. These fossils indicate that "S. albertensis" was around 5.5 to 5.8 meters in length and stood about 1.65 meters high at the hips. An unusual feature of this first skull is that the smallest frill spike on the left side is partially overlapped at its base by the next spike. It appears that the frill suffered a break at this point in life and was shortened by about . The normal shape of this area is unknown because the corresponding area of the right side of the frill was not recovered.

<a href="Barnum%20Brown">Barnum Brown</a> and crew, working for the <a href="American%20Museum%20of%20Natural%20History">American Museum of Natural History</a> in New York, collected a nearly complete articulated skeleton with a partial skull in 1915. These fossils were also found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, near <a href="Steveville%2C%20Alberta">Steveville</a>, Alberta. Brown and <a href="Erich%20Maren%20Schlaikjer">Erich Maren Schlaikjer</a> compared the finds, and, though they allowed that both specimens were from the same general locality and geological formation, they considered the specimen sufficiently distinct from the <a href="holotype">holotype</a> to warrant erecting a new species, and described the fossils as "Styracosaurus parksi", named in honor of <a href="William%20Parks%20%28paleontologist%29">William Parks</a>. Among the differences between the specimens cited by Brown and Schlaikjer were a <a href="jugal">cheekbone</a> quite different from that of "S. albertensis", and smaller <a href="tail">tail</a> <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>e. "S. parksi" also had a more robust jaw, a shorter <a href="dentary">dentary</a>, and the frill differed in shape from that of the type species. However, much of the skull consisted of plaster reconstruction, and the original 1937 paper did not illustrate the actual skull bones. It is now accepted as a specimen of "S. albertensis".

In the summer of 2006, <a href="Darren%20Tanke">Darren Tanke</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Tyrrell%20Museum%20of%20Palaeontology">Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology</a> in <a href="Drumheller">Drumheller</a>, Alberta relocated the long lost "S. parksi" site. Pieces of the skull, evidently abandoned by the 1915 crew, were found in the quarry. These were collected and it is hoped more pieces will be found, perhaps enough to warrant a redescription of the skull and test whether "S. albertensis" and "S. parksi" are the same. The Tyrrell Museum has also collected several partial "Styracosaurus" skulls. At least one confirmed bonebed (bonebed 42) in Dinosaur Provincial Park has also been explored (other proposed "Styracosaurus" bonebeds instead have fossils from a mix of animals, and nondiagnostic ceratopsian remains). Bonebed 42 is known to contain numerous pieces of skulls such as horncores, jaws and frill pieces.

A third species, "S. ovatus", from the <a href="Two%20Medicine%20Formation">Two Medicine Formation</a> of <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, was described by <a href="Charles%20W.%20Gilmore">Gilmore</a> in 1930. The fossil material is limited, with the best being a portion of the <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a> of the frill, but one unusual feature is that the pair of spikes closest to the midline converge towards the midline, rather than away from it as in "S. albertensis". There also may only have been two sets of spikes on each side of the frill, instead of three. The spikes are much shorter than in "S. albertensis", with the longest only long. A 2010 review of styracosaur skull remains by Ryan, Holmes, and Russell found it to be a distinct species, and in 2010 McDonald and Horner placed it in its own genus, "<a href="Rubeosaurus">Rubeosaurus</a>".

Several other species which were assigned to "Styracosaurus" have since been assigned to other genera. "S. sphenocerus", described by <a href="Edward%20Drinker%20Cope">Edward Drinker Cope</a> in 1890 as a species of "<a href="Monoclonius">Monoclonius</a>" and based on a <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal bone</a> with a broken "Styracosaurus"-like straight nose horn, was attributed to "Styracosaurus" in 1915. "S. makeli", mentioned informally by amateur <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a>s Stephen and Sylvia Czerkas in 1990 in a caption to an illustration, is an early name for "Einiosaurus". "S. borealis" is an early informal name for "S. parksi".

"Styracosaurus" is a member of the <a href="Centrosaurinae">Centrosaurinae</a>. Other members of the <a href="clade">clade</a> include "<a href="Centrosaurus">Centrosaurus</a>" (from which the group takes its name), "<a href="Pachyrhinosaurus">Pachyrhinosaurus</a>", "<a href="Avaceratops">Avaceratops</a>", "<a href="Einiosaurus">Einiosaurus</a>", "<a href="Albertaceratops">Albertaceratops</a>", "<a href="Achelousaurus">Achelousaurus</a>", "<a href="Brachyceratops">Brachyceratops</a>", and "<a href="Monoclonius">Monoclonius</a>", although these last two are <a href="nomen%20dubium">dubious</a>. Because of the variation between species and even individual specimens of centrosaurines, there has been much debate over which genera and species are valid, particularly whether "Centrosaurus" and/or "Monoclonius" are valid genera, undiagnosable, or possibly members of the opposite sex. In 1996, <a href="Peter%20Dodson">Peter Dodson</a> found enough variation between "Centrosaurus", "Styracosaurus", and "Monoclonius" to warrant separate genera, and that "Styracosaurus" resembled "Centrosaurus" more closely than either resembled "Monoclonius". Dodson also believed one species of "Monoclonius", "M. nasicornis", may actually have been a female "Styracosaurus". However, most other researchers have not accepted "Monoclonius nasicornis" as a female "Styracosaurus", instead regarding it as a synonym of "Centrosaurus apertus". While <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a> has been proposed for an earlier ceratopsian, "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a>", there is no firm evidence for sexual dimorphism in any ceratopsid.

The <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> depicted below represents a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba "et al." (2017):

The evolutionary origins of "Styracosaurus" were not understood for many years because fossil evidence for early ceratopsians was sparse. The discovery of "<a href="Protoceratops">Protoceratops</a>", in 1922, shed light on early ceratopsid relationships, but several decades passed before additional finds filled in more of the blanks. Fresh discoveries in the late 1990s and 2000s, including "<a href="Zuniceratops">Zuniceratops</a>", the earliest known ceratopsian with brow horns, and "<a href="Yinlong">Yinlong</a>", the first known <a href="Jurassic">Jurassic</a> ceratopsian, indicate what the ancestors of "Styracosaurus" may have looked like. These new discoveries have been important in illuminating the origins of horned dinosaurs in general, and suggest that the group originated during the Jurassic in Asia, with the appearance of true horned ceratopsians occurring by the beginning of the late Cretaceous in North America.

Goodwin and colleagues proposed in 1992 that "Styracosaurus" was part of the lineage leading to "<a href="Einiosaurus">Einiosaurus</a>", "<a href="Achelousaurus">Achelousaurus</a>" and "<a href="Pachyrhinosaurus">Pachyrhinosaurus</a>". This was based on a series of fossil skulls from the <a href="Two%20Medicine%20Formation">Two Medicine Formation</a> of Montana. The position of "Styracosaurus" in this lineage is now equivocal, as the remains that were thought to represent "Styracosaurus" have been transferred to the genus "Rubeosaurus".

"Styracosaurus" is known from a higher position in the formation (relating specifically to its own genus) than the closely related "<a href="Centrosaurus">Centrosaurus</a>", suggesting that "Styracosaurus" displaced "Centrosaurus" as the environment changed over time and/or dimension. It has been suggested that "Styracosaurus albertensis" is a direct descendant of "Centrosaurus" ("C. apertus" or "C. nasicornis"), and that it in turn evolved directly into the slightly later species "Rubeosaurus ovatus". Subtle changes can be traced in the arrangement of the horns through this lineage, leading from "Rubeosaurus" to "<a href="Einiosaurus">Einiosaurus</a>", to "<a href="Achelousaurus">Achelousaurus</a>" and "<a href="Pachyrhinosaurus">Pachyrhinosaurus</a>". However, the lineage may not be a simple, straight line, as a pachyrhinosaur-like species has been reported from the same time and place as "Styracosaurus albertensis".

"Styracosaurus" and other horned dinosaurs are often depicted in popular culture as <a href="herd">herd</a> animals. A bonebed composed of "Styracosaurus" remains is known from the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> of Alberta, about halfway up the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of <a href="river">river</a> deposits. The mass deaths may have been a result of otherwise non-herding animals congregating around a waterhole in a period of drought, with evidence suggesting the environment may have been seasonal and semiarid.

<a href="Paleontologist">Paleontologist</a>s <a href="Gregory%20Paul">Gregory Paul</a> and Per Christiansen of the Zoological Museum of the <a href="University%20of%20Copenhagen">University of Copenhagen</a> in Denmark proposed that large ceratopsians such as "Styracosaurus" were able to run faster than an <a href="elephant">elephant</a>, based on possible ceratopsian <a href="fossil%20trackway">trackways</a> which did not exhibit signs of sprawling forelimbs.

Styracosaurs were <a href="herbivore">herbivorous</a> dinosaurs; they probably fed mostly on low growth because of the position of the head. They may, however, have been able to knock down taller <a href="plant">plant</a>s with their horns, <a href="beak">beak</a>, and bulk. The <a href="jaw">jaw</a>s were tipped with a deep, narrow beak, believed to have been better at grasping and plucking than biting.

Ceratopsid teeth, including those of "Styracosaurus", were arranged in groups called batteries. Older teeth on top were continually replaced by the teeth underneath them. Unlike <a href="hadrosaurid">hadrosaurid</a>s, which also had dental batteries, ceratopsid teeth sliced but did not grind. Some scientists have suggested that ceratopsids like "Styracosaurus" ate <a href="Arecaceae">palms</a> and <a href="cycad">cycad</a>s, while others have suggested <a href="fern">fern</a>s. Dodson has proposed that Late Cretaceous ceratopsians may have knocked down <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a> trees and then sheared off leaves and twigs.

The large nasal horns and frills of "Styracosaurus" are among the most distinctive facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function has been the subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered.

Early in the 20th century, paleontologist <a href="R.%20S.%20Lull">R. S. Lull</a> proposed that the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for "Styracosaurus", the spikes would have given it a formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of "Styracosaurus" and "Chasmosaurus", but did not subscribe to the idea that they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, found no evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.

It was long believed that ceratopsians like "Styracosaurus" used their frills and horns in defence against the large predatory dinosaurs of the time. Although pitting, holes, lesions, and other damage on ceratopsid skulls are often attributed to horn damage in combat, a 2006 study found no evidence for horn thrust injuries causing these forms of damage (for example, there is no evidence of infection or healing). Instead, non-pathological bone <a href="resorption">resorption</a>, or unknown bone diseases, are suggested as causes.

However, a newer study compared incidence rates of skull lesions in "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>" and "<a href="Centrosaurus">Centrosaurus</a>" and showed that these were consistent with "Triceratops" using its horns in combat and the frill being adapted as a protective structure, while lower pathology rates in "Centrosaurus" may indicate visual rather than physical use of cranial ornamentation, or a form of combat focused on the body rather than the head; as "Centrosaurus" was more closely related to "Styracosaurus" and both genera had long nasal horns, the results for this genus would be more applicable for "Styracosaurus". The researchers also concluded that the damage found on the specimens in the study was often too localized to be caused by bone disease.

The large frill on "Styracosaurus" and related genera also may have helped to increase body area to <a href="thermoregulation">regulate body temperature</a>, like the ears of the modern <a href="elephant">elephant</a>. A similar theory has been proposed regarding the plates of "<a href="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a>", although this use alone would not account for the bizarre and extravagant variation seen in different members of the <a href="Ceratopsidae">Ceratopsidae</a>. This observation is highly suggestive of what is now believed to be the primary function, display.

The theory of frill use in sexual display was first proposed in 1961 by Davitashvili. This theory has gained increasing acceptance. Evidence that visual display was important, either in courtship or in other social behavior, can be seen in the fact that horned dinosaurs differ markedly in their adornments, making each species highly distinctive. Also, modern living creatures with such displays of horns and adornments use them in similar behavior. The use of the exaggerated structures in dinosaurs as species identification has been questioned, as no such function exists in modern species.

"Styracosaurus" is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation, and was a member of a diverse and well-documented <a href="fauna">fauna</a> of prehistoric animals that included horned relatives such as "<a href="Centrosaurus">Centrosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Chasmosaurus">Chasmosaurus</a>", duckbills such as "<a href="Prosaurolophus">Prosaurolophus</a>", "<a href="Lambeosaurus">Lambeosaurus</a>", "<a href="Gryposaurus">Gryposaurus</a>", "<a href="Corythosaurus">Corythosaurus</a>", and "<a href="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a>", <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a>s "<a href="Gorgosaurus">Gorgosaurus</a>", "<a href="Daspletosaurus">Daspletosaurus</a>", and <a href="ankylosauria">armored</a> "<a href="Edmontonia">Edmontonia</a>" and "<a href="Euoplocephalus">Euoplocephalus</a>".

The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of <a href="river">river</a>s and <a href="floodplain">floodplain</a>s that became more <a href="swamp">swamp</a>y and influenced by <a href="ocean">marine</a> conditions over time as the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a> <a href="transgression%20%28geology%29">transgressed</a> westward. The <a href="climate">climate</a> was warmer than present-day Alberta, without <a href="frost">frost</a>, but with wetter and drier seasons. <a href="Conifer">Conifer</a>s were apparently the dominant <a href="forest%20canopy">canopy</a> plants, with an <a href="understory">understory</a> of <a href="fern">fern</a>s, <a href="tree%20fern">tree fern</a>s, and <a href="angiosperm">angiosperm</a>s.

Achelousaurus ( ) is a <a href="genus">genus</a> of <a href="Centrosaurinae">centrosaurine</a> <a href="ceratopsid">ceratopsid</a> <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a> that lived during the <a href="Late%20Cretaceous">Late Cretaceous Period</a> of what is now <a href="North%20America">North America</a>, about 74.2 million years ago. The first fossils of "Achelousaurus" were collected in <a href="Montana">Montana</a> in 1987, by a team led by <a href="Jack%20Horner%20%28paleontologist%29">Jack Horner</a>, with more finds made in 1989. In 1994, Achelousaurus horneri was described and named by <a href="Scott%20D.%20Sampson">Scott D. Sampson</a>; the generic name means "<a href="Achelous">Achelous</a> lizard", in reference to a Greek mythological figure, and the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific name</a> refers to Horner. The genus is known from a few specimens consisting mainly of skull material from individuals, ranging from juveniles to adults.

A large <a href="centrosaurine">centrosaurine</a>, "Achelousaurus" was about long, with a weight of about . As a ceratopsian, it walked on all fours, had a short tail and a large head with a hooked beak. It had a bony neck-frill at the rear of the skull, which sported a pair of long spikes, which curved towards the outside. Adult "Achelousaurus" had rough bosses (roundish protuberances) above the eyes and on the snout where other centrosaurines often had horns in the same positions. These bosses were covered by a thick layer of <a href="keratin">keratin</a>, but their exact shape in life is uncertain. According to some scientists the bosses were used in fights, with the animals butting each other's heads, and for display.

Within the <a href="Ceratopsia">Ceratopsia</a>, "Achelousaurus" lies within the <a href="clade">clade</a> <a href="Pachyrostra">Pachyrostra</a> (or "thick-snouts"). It has been suggested that it was the direct descendant of the similar genus "<a href="Einiosaurus">Einiosaurus</a>" (which has spikes but no bosses) and the direct ancestor of "<a href="Pachyrhinosaurus">Pachyrhinosaurus</a>" (which has larger bosses). The first two genera would be <a href="transitional%20forms">transitional forms</a>, evolving through <a href="anagenesis">anagenesis</a> from "<a href="Styracosaurus">Styracosaurus</a>". There has been debate about this theory, with later discoveries showing that "Achelousaurus" is closely related to "Pachyrhinosaurus" in the group <a href="Pachyrhinosaurini">Pachyrhinosaurini</a>. "Achelousaurus" is known from the <a href="Two%20Medicine%20Formation">Two Medicine Formation</a> and lived in the island continent of <a href="Laramidia">Laramidia</a>. As a ceratopsian, "Achelousaurus" would have been a herbivore and it appears to have had a high <a href="metabolic%20rate">metabolic rate</a>, though lower than that of modern mammals and birds.

All known "Achelousaurus" specimens were recovered from the <a href="Two%20Medicine%20Formation">Two Medicine Formation</a> in <a href="Glacier%20County">Glacier County</a>, Montana during excavations conducted by the <a href="Museum%20of%20the%20Rockies">Museum of the Rockies</a>, which still houses the specimens. The discoveries came about by an accidental chain of events. In the spring of 1985, <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a> <a href="Jack%20Horner%20%28paleontologist%29">John "Jack" R. Horner</a> was informed that he would no longer be allowed to exploit the <a href="Willow%20Creek%20%28Montana%29">Willow Creek</a> site, where he had studied the "<a href="Maiasaura">Maiasaura</a>" <a href="Egg%20Mountain">Egg Mountain</a> nesting colony for six years. Having already made extensive arrangements for a new field season, he was suddenly forced to seek an alternative site. Horner had always been intrigued by the field diaries of <a href="Charles%20Whitney%20Gilmore">Charles Whitney Gilmore</a> who had reported the discovery of dinosaur eggs at Landslide Butte in 1928, but never published on them. In this locality, Gilmore had employed <a href="George%20Fryer%20Sternberg">George Fryer Sternberg</a> to excavate skeletons of the horned dinosaurs "<a href="Brachyceratops">Brachyceratops</a>" and "<a href="Styracosaurus%20ovatus">Styracosaurus ovatus</a>". That summer, Horner obtained the permission of the <a href="Blackfeet%20Indian%20Tribal%20Council">Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council</a> to prospect for fossils on Landslide Butte, which is part of the <a href="Blackfeet%20Indian%20Reservation">Blackfeet Indian Reservation</a>; it was the first paleontological investigation at that location since the 1920s. In August 1985, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered a rich fossil site on the land of the farmer Ricky Reagan, which was called the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and contained fossils of horned dinosaurs. On 20 June 1986, Horner and Makela returned to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and resumed work on the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry, which proved to contain, apart from eggs, more than a dozen skeletons of a horned dinosaur later named "Einiosaurus". In August 1986, at a nearby site – the Canyon Bone Bed on the land of Gloria Sundquist, east of the <a href="Milk%20River%20%28Alberta%E2%80%93Montana%29">Milk River</a> – Horner's team discovered another "Einiosaurus" bone bed. Part of the discoveries made on this occasion was an additional horned dinosaur skull, specimen MOR 492, that later would be referred to (i.e., formally assigned to) "<a href="Rubeosaurus">Rubeosaurus</a>", the genus name in 2010 given to "Styracosaurus ovatus".

During the field season of 1987 (early July), volunteer Sidney M. Hostetter located another horned dinosaur skull near the Canyon Bone Bed, specimen MOR 485. By the end of August, it had been secured and was driven on a <a href="grain%20truck">grain truck</a> to the Museum of the Rockies in <a href="Bozeman">Bozeman</a>. On 23 June 1988, another site was discovered in the vicinity – the Blacktail Creek North. In the summer of 1989, graduate student <a href="Scott%20D.%20Sampson">Scott D. Sampson</a> joined the team, wanting to study the function of the frill display structures in horned dinosaurs. At the end of June 1989, Horner, his son Jason and his head preparator Carrie Ancell discovered horned dinosaur specimen MOR 591 near the Blacktail Creek.

It was initially assumed that all the horned dinosaur material recovered by the expeditions could be assigned to a single "styracosaur" species distinct from "<a href="Styracosaurus%20albertensis">Styracosaurus albertensis</a>", as the fossils represented a limited geological time period, then estimated at about half a million years. <a href="Raymond%20R.%20Rogers">Raymond Robert Rogers</a>, who was studying the <a href="stratigraphy">stratigraphy</a> of the bone beds, referred to it as a "Styracosaurus" sp. (of undetermined species) in 1989. "Styracosaurus ovatus" – though sometimes considered an invalid "<a href="nomen%20dubium">nomen dubium</a>" – had already been found in the area by G. F. Sternberg and was an obvious candidate. But also the possibility was taken into account that the finds were of a species new to science. This species was informally named "Styracosaurus makeli" in honor of Bob Makela, who had died in a traffic accident just days before the discovery of specimen MOR 485. In 1990, this name, as an invalid "<a href="nomen%20nudum">nomen nudum</a>", appeared in a photo caption in a book by Stephen Czerkas.

Horner, an expert on the <a href="Hadrosauridae">Hadrosauridae</a> family, had less affinity for other kinds of dinosaurs. In 1987 and 1989, horned dinosaur specialist <a href="Peter%20Dodson">Peter Dodson</a> was invited to investigate the new <a href="ceratopsian">ceratopsian</a> finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate "Styracosaurus ovatus", to be distinguished from "Styracosaurus albertensis".

Meanwhile, Horner had come to a more complex view of the situation. He still thought that the fossil material had been part of a single population but concluded that this had developed over time as a <a href="chronospecies">chronospecies</a> evolving into a series of subsequent <a href="taxon">taxa</a>. In 1992, Horner, David Varricchio and Mark Goodwin published an article in "<a href="Nature%20%28journal%29">Nature</a>" based on the six-year field study of sediments and dinosaurs from Montana. They proposed that the expeditions had uncovered three "<a href="transitional%20taxa">transitional taxa</a>" spanning the gap between the already known "Styracosaurus" and "<a href="Pachyrhinosaurus">Pachyrhinosaurus</a>". For the moment, they declined to name these taxa. The oldest form was indicated as "Transitional Taxon A", mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came "Taxon B" – the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. The youngest was "Taxon C", represented by skull MOR 485 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek.

Sampson had continued his studies of the material since 1989. In 1994, in a talk during the annual meeting of the <a href="Society%20of%20Vertebrate%20Paleontology">Society of Vertebrate Paleontology</a>, he named "Taxon C" as a new genus and species, "Achelousaurus horneri". Although an <a href="Abstract%20%28summary%29">abstract</a> was published containing a sufficient description, it did not identify a <a href="holotype">holotype</a>, a name-bearing specimen. In 1995, in a subsequent article, Sampson indicated specimen MOR 485 as the holotype specimen of "Achelousaurus horneri". The generic name consists of the words "Achelous", the name of a <a href="Greek%20mythological">Greek mythological</a> figure, and "saurus", which is <a href="Latinized%20Greek">Latinized Greek</a> for lizard. <a href="Achelous">Achelous</a> (Ἀχελῷος) is a Greek river deity and a <a href="shapeshifting">shapeshifter</a> who was able to transform himself into anything. During a fight with <a href="Herakles">Hercules</a>, the mythical hero, Achelous took the form of a bull, but lost the battle when one of his horns was removed. This allusion is a reference to the supposedly transitional traits of the dinosaur and the characteristic loss of horns through <a href="ontogenetic">ontogenetic</a> and <a href="phylogenetic">phylogenetic</a> development, and thus through individual change and evolution. Dodson, in 1996, praised the generic name for being original and intelligent. The specific name honors Jack Horner, for his research on the dinosaurs of the Two Medicine Formation in Montana. Sampson also named "Taxon B" as the genus "Einiosaurus" in the same article wherein "Achelousaurus" was described. He stated that paleontologists needed to be cautious when naming new ceratopsian genera because their intraspecific variation (i.e., variation within a species) might be mistaken for interspecific differences (between species). Until 1995, only one new genus of centrosaurine dinosaur had been named since "Pachyrhinosaurus" in 1950, namely "<a href="Avaceratops">Avaceratops</a>" in 1986. "Achelousaurus" thus holds particular importance for being one of the few ceratopsid genera named in the late twentieth century.

The holotype specimen MOR 485 was collected by Hostetter and Ray Rogers from the Landslide Butte Field Area about northwest of <a href="Cut%20Bank%2C%20Montana">Cut Bank</a>. In 1995 Sampson described it as the partial skull of an adult animal including the <a href="nasal%20bone">nasal</a> and <a href="supraorbital%20ridge">supraorbital</a> (region above the eye socket) bosses (roundish protuberances instead of horns), and the <a href="parietal%20bone">parietal bone</a>s. Additionally, MOR 485 preserves some bones of the skull rear and sides, which in 2009 were listed by Tracy L. Ford as a right <a href="squamosal%20bone">squamosal bone</a>, the left squamosal, both <a href="maxilla">maxilla</a>e, both <a href="lacrimal%20bone">lacrimal bone</a>s, both <a href="quadrate%20bone">quadrate bone</a>s, both <a href="palatine%20bone">palatine bone</a>s, the <a href="braincase">braincase</a> and the basioccipital bone. In 2015, Leonardo Maiorino reported that as part of the same specimen a fragmentary lower jaw has been catalogued as MOR 485-7-12-87-4. A right squamosal bone from another adult individual was recovered from the same Canyon Bone Bed site as MOR 485 (and catalogued under the same number), but only reported in 2010. Two other specimens were collected on the Blacktail Creek, to the south of Cut Bank and referred to "Achelousaurus" by Sampson in 1995. Specimen MOR 591 is a partial skull and an about 60% complete skeleton of a sub-adult specimen that includes the vertebral column, pelvis, <a href="sacrum">sacrum</a> and a <a href="femur">femur</a>. It also includes lower jaws, catalogued as MOR 591-7-15-89-1. Both skull and lower jaws are nearly complete, only lacking the braincase and <a href="occiput">occipital region</a>. MOR 591 is smaller than the holotype with a skull base length of about . Specimen MOR 571 includes a partial skull and lower jaws with associated ribs and vertebrae of an adult. The skull only consists of the parietals, and the lower jaws are limited to their upper rear bones, the <a href="surangular">surangular</a>s and <a href="articular">articular</a>s. A fifth specimen is MOR 456.1, a subadult. None of the specimens were of an advanced individual age. According to Andrew McDonald and colleagues, the "Achelousaurus" finds represented single individuals, not bone beds.

In addition to fossils that have been unequivocally assigned to "Achelousaurus", some other material has been found of which the identity is uncertain. A <a href="centrosaurine">centrosaurine</a> ceratopsid specimen with bosses from the <a href="Dinosaur%20Park%20Formation">Dinosaur Park Formation</a> (specimen TMP 2002.76.1) found in 1996 was suggested to belong to a new taxon in 2006, but may instead belong to "Achelousaurus" or "Pachyrhinosaurus". Since it is missing the parietal bones, which are used to <a href="Diagnosis%20%28taxonomy%29">diagnose</a> centrosaurines, it is not possible to assign it to any genus with confidence. In 2006, it was also proposed that "<a href="Monoclonius%20lowei">Monoclonius lowei</a>", a dubious species based on a skull (specimen CMN 8790) from the Dinosaur Park Formation, could be a sub-adult specimen of " Styracosaurus", "Achelousaurus" or "Einiosaurus", with which it is roughly contemporaneous. In addition, some indeterminate specimens from the Two Medicine Formation – such as fragmentary skull MOR 464 or snout MOR 449 – may belong to "Achelousaurus" or the two other roughly contemporary ceratopsids "Einiosaurus" and "Rubeosaurus".

"Achelousaurus" is estimated to have been long with a weight of . The skull of an adult individual (holotype specimen MOR 485) was estimated to have been long. This puts it in the same size-range as other members of the <a href="Centrosaurinae">Centrosaurinae</a> subgroup of <a href="ceratopsians">ceratopsians</a> that lived during the <a href="Campanian%20age">Campanian age</a>. It was about as large as its close relative "Einiosaurus", but with a much heavier build. "Achelousaurus" approached the robustness of one of the largest and most heavily built horned dinosaurs known – "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>".

As a ceratopsid, "Achelousaurus" would have been a <a href="quadrupedal">quadrupedal</a> animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, downwards swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. "Achelousaurus" had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone).

In 1995, when describing the species, Sampson gave a formal list of four <a href="autapomorphy">traits that distinguish</a> "Achelousaurus" from its centrosaurine relatives. First, adult individuals have nasal bones with a boss on top that is relatively small and thin, and heavily covered with pits; secondly, adult individuals do not have true horns above the eye sockets but relatively large bosses with high ridges; thirdly, not yet fully grown individuals, or subadults, have true horncores (the bony part of the horns) above the eye sockets with the inward facing surface being <a href="wikt%3Aconcave">concave</a>; and fourth, the parietal bones of the neck shield have a single pair of curved spikes sticking out from the rear margin to behind and to the outside.

Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson pointed out additional differences with two very closely related forms. The frill spikes of "Achelousaurus" are more outwards oriented than the spikes of "Einiosaurus", which are medially curved; the spikes of "Achelousaurus" are nevertheless less directed to the outside than the comparable spikes of "Pachyrhinosaurus". "Achelousaurus" also differs from "Pachyrhinosaurus" in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear. Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish "Achelousaurus" from other members of the Centrosaurinae.

Horned dinosaurs mainly differ from each other in their horns, which are located on the snout and above the eyes, and in the large skull frill, which covers the neck like a shield. "Achelousaurus" exhibited the build of <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> ("advanced") centrosaurines, which are typified by short brow horns or bosses, combined with elaborate frill spikes. The general frill proportions are typically centrosaurine, with a wide rounded squamosal bone at the side, which expanded towards the rear. It also shares the typical frill curvature with a top surface that is <a href="wikt%3Aconvex">convex</a> from side to side and concave from front to rear.

Adult "Achelousaurus" skulls had a rugose, heavily pitted boss on the snout or nasal region, where many other ceratopsids had a horn. Such a boss is often called "pachyostotic", i.e. consisting of thickened bone. But describing it as a thick "boss" can be misleading: in fact it forms a wide depression with a thin bone floor and irregular excavations, though it is less depressed than with "Pachyrhinosaurus". The nasal boss covered about two-thirds of the top surface of the nasal bones. The boss was similar to that seen in the related genus "Pachyrhinosaurus", though narrower, shorter, and less high. It covered 27% of the total skull length, was 30% longer than the nostril-eye socket distance and was about twice as long as the eye socket. Its rear edge did not reach the level of the eye socket. The nasal boss extended forward, where it fused onto the nasal and <a href="premaxilla%20bone">premaxilla bone</a>s (of the upper jaw) at the front of the snout, though the nasal bone itself did not fuse with the premaxilla. The boss of specimen MOR 485 furthermore had an excavation (or cavity) at its front end. The horn core that formed the boss may have developed by either becoming procurved (i.e. bent forward) during growth, like the horn of the related "Einiosaurus", until it fused onto the nasal bone; or from a simple, erect horn, which later extended its base forward over the snout region, as in "Pachyrhinosaurus". The nasal bone formed the top of a large bony nostril. From the rear edge of that nostril a sharp process stuck out to the front. The snout was – compared to that of "Einiosaurus" – relatively wide at the level of the rear nostrils. The lacrimal bone, in front of the eye socket, was thickened, mainly on the inner surface while the outer surface was featureless apart from a crater-like excavation.

Adult skulls also possess large, rugose, and oval bosses on the <a href="Supraorbital%20ridge">supraorbital</a> region above the eyes, instead of the horns of other ceratopsids. The supraorbital bosses extended from the <a href="postorbital%20bone">postorbital bone</a> forward to incorporate the triangular <a href="palpebral">palpebral</a> and <a href="prefrontal%20bones">prefrontal bones</a>, and had high transverse ridges around the middle, which were thick at their base and thin towards their top. The palpebral bones strongly stood out, forming an "antorbital buttress". The fused prefrontals did not reach the nasal boss, forming a distinctive transverse saddle-shaped groove separating the nasal boss from the supraorbital bosses. This groove extended backwards, separating the supraorbital bosses from each other and forming a T-shape in top view. These bosses were similar to those of "Pachyrhinosaurus", but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities. The long and low supraorbital horncores of the sub-adult specimen MOR 591 were similar to those of sub-adult "Einiosaurus" and "Pachyrhinosaurus". They had a concave surface on the inner side as with "Pachyrhinosaurus"; ridges on the postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses.

The skull roof of "Achelousaurus" had a midline cavity, with an opening at the top called the frontal <a href="fontanelle">fontanelle</a>, a feature found in all ceratopsids, which have a "double" skull roof formed by the frontal bones folding towards each other between the brow horn bases. This cavity formed <a href="sinuses">sinuses</a> that extended below the supraorbital bosses, which were therefore relatively thin internally, being thick from the outside to the cavity roof. This cavity appears to have partially closed over as an animal aged, with only the rear part of the fontanelle being open in the adult specimen MOR 485.

Like that of all other ceratopsids, the skull of "Achelousaurus" had a parietosquamosal frill or "neck shield", which was formed by the parietal bones at the rear and the squamosal bones at the sides. The parietal is one of the main bones used to distinguish centrosaurine taxa from each other and resolve relationships between them, whereas the squamosal is very similar across taxa. In "Achelousaurus", the squamosal bone was much shorter than the parietal. Of its inner margin the rear portion formed a step in relation to the front part, with the suture between the squamosal and the parietal showing a kink to behind at the level of the rear <a href="supratemporal%20fenestra">supratemporal fenestra</a>, a typical centrosaurine trait. The squamosal and the <a href="jugal%20bone">jugal bone</a>, by touching each other, excluded the <a href="quadratojugal">quadratojugal</a> from the edge of the lateral <a href="temporal%20fenestra">temporal fenestra</a>, i.e. the opening at the rear of the skull side.

The frill of "Achelousaurus" had two conspicuous large spikes that were directed backwards and curved to the sides away from each other. During the 1990s, it was increasingly understood that such spikes on the parietals were not random growths but specific traits that could be used to determine the evolution of horned dinosaurs, if only it could be analyzed how they corresponded among species. Sampson, in the paper describing "Achelousaurus" in 1995, therefore introduced a generalized numbering system for such parietal processes, counting them from the midline to the side of the frill. This was applied to the Centrosaurinae as a whole in 1997. The large spikes of "Achelousaurus" correspond to "Process 3" spikes of other centrosaurines and were similar to those of "Einiosaurus", though curved more to the sides, similar to "Pachyrhinosaurus". They were shorter and thinner than the corresponding spikes of "Styracosaurus". Between these spikes, on both sides of the central frill notch, were two small tab-like processes ("Process 2") that were directed towards the midline. Innermost "Process 1" spikes, as present in "<a href="Centrosaurus">Centrosaurus</a>", are lacking with "Achelousaurus". The frill had two large paired openings, the parietal fenestrae, with a midline parietal bar between them. A linear row of rounded swellings ran along the top of the parietal bar, which may be <a href="Homology%20%28biology%29">homologous</a> to the spikes and horns in the same area of some "Pachyrhinosaurus" specimens. A row of relatively small processes ran along the parietal shield margin from the "Process 3" spikes outwards. These lower processes appear to have been capped by epoccipitals, bones that lined the frills of ceratopsids. In "Achelousaurus" these epoccipitals, which start as separate skin <a href="ossification">ossification</a>s or <a href="osteoderm">osteoderm</a>s, fuse with the underlying frill bone to form spikes, at least in the third position.

The bosses on the skull of "Achelousaurus" may have been covered in a <a href="keratinous">keratinous</a> sheath in life, but their shape in a living animal is uncertain. In 2009, the paleontologist Tobin L. Hieronymus and colleagues examined correlations between skull morphology, horn, and skin features of modern horned animals, and examined the skull of centrosaurine dinosaurs for the same correlates. They proposed that the rugose bosses of "Achelousaurus" and "Pachyrhinosaurus" were covered by thick pads of cornified (or keratinized) skin, similar to the boss of modern <a href="muskoxen">muskoxen</a> ("Ovibos moschatus"). The nasal horncore of adult "Achelousaurus" had an upward slant and its upper surface had correlates for a thick <a href="epidermal">epidermal</a> (outer layer of skin) pad that graded into correlates for a cornified sheath on the sides. A thick pad of epidermis may have grown from the V-shaped pitted notch at the tip of the nasal horncore. The growth direction of the nasal pad would have been towards the front. The supraorbital bosses may have had a thick pad of epidermis, which grew at a sideways angle similar to the curved horncores of "<a href="Coronosaurus">Coronosaurus</a>", as indicated by the orientation of the "fins" or ridges on the bosses. That the supraorbital bosses lacked a <a href="Sulcus%20%28morphology%29">sulcus</a> (or furrow) at their bases indicates that their horn pads stopped at the wrinkled edges of the bosses. The pitting might indicate a softer growing layer connecting the hard inner bone with the hard horn sheath. In addition, correlates for a <a href="rostral%20scale">rostral scale</a> in front of the nasal boss and scale rows along the parietal midline and supraorbital-squamosal region were identified.

In 1992, the study by Horner tried to account for the fact that within a limited geological period of time (about half a million years) there had been a quick <a href="Ecological%20succession">succession</a> of animal communities in the upper Two Medicine Formation. Normally, this would be interpreted as a series of invasions, with the new animal types replacing the old ones. But Horner noted that the newer forms often had a strong similarity to the previous types. This suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action: the later <a href="fauna">fauna</a> was basically the old one but at a more evolved stage. The various types found were not distinct species but <a href="transitional%20form">transitional form</a>s developed within a process of <a href="anagenesis">anagenesis</a>. This conformed to the assumption, prevalent at the time, that a species should last about two to three million years. A further indication, according to Horner, was the failure to identify true <a href="autapomorphies">autapomorphies</a> – unique traits that prove a taxon is a separate species. The fossils instead showed a gradual change from <a href="Basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> (or ancestral) into more derived characters.

The horned dinosaurs discovered by Horner exemplified this phenomenon. In the lowest layers of the Two Medicine Formation, below the overlaying <a href="Bearpaw%20Formation">Bearpaw Formation</a>, "Transitional Taxon A" was present. It seemed to be identical to "Styracosaurus albertensis", only differing from it in the possession of just a single pair of parietal spikes. The middle layers, below the Bearpaw, contained "Transitional Taxon B" that also had a single spike pair but differed in the form of its nasal horn that curved to the front over the anterior branches of the nasal bones. In the upper strata, below the Bearpaw, "Transitional Taxon C" had been excavated. It too had a spike pair but now the nasal horn was fused with the front branches. The upper surface of the horn was elevated and very rough. The orbital horns showed coarse ridges. Today, "Taxon A" has been named "Rubeosaurus", "Taxon B" has become "Einiosaurus", while "Taxon C" is "Achelousaurus". In 1992, Horner et al. did not name these as species for the explicit reason that the entire evolutionary sequence was seen as representing a grade of transitional ceratopsians between "Styracosaurus albertensis", known from the <a href="Judith%20River%20Formation">Judith River Formation</a>, and the derived, hornless "Pachyrhinosaurus" from the <a href="Horseshoe%20Canyon%20Formation">Horseshoe Canyon Formation</a>, which had the spike pair and bosses on the nose and above the eyes, as well as additional frill ornamentation. In 1997, Horner referred to the three taxa as "centrosaurine 1.", "centrosaurine 2." and "centrosaurine 3.".

Horner thought he had found the mechanism driving this evolution, elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated Landslide Butte. The animals were living on a narrow strip on the east-coast of Laramidia, bordering the <a href="Western%20Interior%20Seaway">Western Interior Seaway</a> and constrained in the west by the high <a href="Laramide%20orogeny">proto-Rocky Mountains</a>. During the <a href="Bearpaw%20Formation">Bearpaw Transgression</a> sea levels were rising, steadily reducing the width of their coastal habitat from about to . This led to stronger <a href="selection%20pressure">selection pressure</a>s, the severest for "Achelousaurus" that lived during the phase that the coastal strip was at its narrowest. The lower number of individuals that the smaller habitat could have sustained constituted a <a href="population%20bottleneck">population bottleneck</a>, making rapid evolution possible. Increased <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> would have induced changes in the sexual ornamentation such as spikes, horns and bosses. A reduced environmental stress by lower sea levels on the other hand, would be typified by <a href="adaptive%20radiation">adaptive radiation</a>. That sexual selection had indeed been the main mechanism would be proven by the fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar: they all had two frill spikes, a small nasal horn pointing to the front, and orbital horns in the form of slightly elevated knobs. Only in the adult phase did they begin to differ. According to Horner, this also showed that the populations were very closely related.

Horner did not perform an exact <a href="cladistic%20analysis">cladistic analysis</a> determining the relationship between the three populations. Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies the lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is the most likely. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. Such a tree would, as a consequence of the method used, never show a direct ancestor-descendant relationship. Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this. Such a transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, <a href="cladogenesis">cladogenesis</a>, could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process.

Basing himself on revised data, Sampson in 1995 estimated that the layers investigated represented a longer period of time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's "Brachyceratops" quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the "Einiosaurus" beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed <a href="speciation">speciation</a> took place, with the populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, which might have been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian.

In 1996, Dodson raised two objections to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, the possession of just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with "Styracosaurus albertensis". This suggested to him that the "Einiosaurus"-"Achelousaurus" lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" were a case of <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.

In 2010, Horner admitted that specimen TMP 2002.76.1 seemed to indicate that "Achelousaurus" was not descended from "Einiosaurus", as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But he stressed that even if the lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled "Einiosaurus". Furthermore, it might still be possible that "Einiosaurus" was a direct descendant of "Rubeosaurus". Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea.

The process of anagenesis was confirmed by John Wilson and Jack Scannella in 2016, who studied the ontogenetic changes in horned dinosaurs. They compared a small "Einiosaurus" specimen, MOR 456 8-8-87-1, with "Achelousaurus" specimen MOR 591. Both proved to be quite similar, with the main differences being a longer face in MOR 456 8-8-87-1, and a sharper supraorbital horncore in MOR 591. They concluded that "Achelousaurus" was likely the direct descendant of "Einiosaurus". The more adult "Einiosaurus" individuals approached the "Achelousaurus" morphology. The differences between the two taxa would have been caused by <a href="heterochrony">heterochrony</a> – differential changes in the speed the various traits developed during the lifetime of an individual.

In 1995, Sampson formally placed "Achelousaurus" in the <a href="Ceratopsidae">Ceratopsidae</a>, more precisely the Centrosaurinae. In all analyses, "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" are part of the clade Pachyrhinosaurini. By definition, "Achelousaurus" is a member of the clade <a href="Pachyrostra">Pachyrostra</a> (or "thick-snouts"), in which it is united with "Pachyrhinosaurus". In 2010, <a href="Gregory%20S.%20Paul">Gregory S. Paul</a> assigned "A. horneri" to the genus "Centrosaurus", as "C. horneri". This has found no acceptance among other researchers, with subsequent <a href="taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomic</a> assessments invariably keeping the generic name "Achelousaurus".

Sampson felt, in 1995, that there was not enough evidence to conclude that "Achelousaurus" was a direct descendant of "Einiosaurus". Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a <a href="phylogeny">phylogeny</a>. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein "Achelousaurus" split off between "Einiosaurus" and "Pachyrhinosaurus", as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, "Styracosaurus albertensis" could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a <a href="sister%20species">sister species</a> of "Centrosaurus" in Sampson's analysis.

Subsequent studies have sought to determine the precise relationships within this part of the evolutionary tree, with conflicting results regarding the question whether "Styracosaurus albertensis", "Rubeosaurus" or "Einiosaurus" might have been in the direct line of ascent to "Achelousaurus". In 2005, an analysis by Michael Ryan and Anthony Russell found "Styracosaurus" more closely related to "Achelousaurus" than to "Centrosaurus". This was confirmed by analyses by Ryan in 2007, Nicholas Longrich in 2010, and Xu et al. in 2010. But the same year Horner and Andrew T. McDonald moved "Styracosaurus ovatus" to its own genus, "Rubeosaurus", finding it a sister species of "Einiosaurus", while "Styracosaurus albertensis" was again located on the "Centrosaurus" branch. In 2011, a subsequent study by Andrew T. McDonald in this respect replicated the outcome of his previous one, as did a publication by Andre Farke et al. In 2017, J.P. Wilson and Ryan further complicated the issue, concluding that MOR 492 ("Taxon A") was not referable to "Rubeosaurus" and announcing that yet another genus would be named for it.

Before "Achelousaurus" was described, "Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis" had been considered a solitary form among centrosaurines, set apart from them by its unusual bosses. "Achelousaurus" gave evolutionary context to the Canadian species, while expanding the temporal and geographical range for what came to be seen as "pachyrhinosaurs". In all analyses, "Achelousaurus" and "Pachyrhinosaurus" were <a href="sister%20group">sister group</a>s. In 2008, another closely related species was named, "Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai". In that study, the term "Pachyrhinosaurs" was used for the clade consisting of "Achelousaurus" and "Pachyrhinosaurus". When "Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum" was described in 2012, the clade name Pachyrostra was coined, uniting the two genera; "Achelousaurus" is the basalmost pachyrostran. Shared derived traits (or <a href="synapomorphies">synapomorphies</a>) of the group are an enlarged nasal ornamentation and a change of the nasal and brow horns into bosses. At the end of the Campanian, there seems to have been a trend of pachyrostrans replacing other centrosaurines. Also in 2012, the clade Pachyrhinosaurini was named, consisting of species more closely related to "Pachyrhinosaurus" or "Achelousaurus" than to "Centrosaurus". Apart from "Einiosaurus" and "Rubeosaurus", this included "<a href="Sinoceratops">Sinoceratops</a>" and "<a href="Xenoceratops">Xenoceratops</a>", according to a 2013 study.

Cladistic analyses develop gradually, reflecting new discoveries and insights. Their results can be shown in a <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a>, with the relationships found ordered in an evolutionary tree. The cladogram below, in which "Xenoceratops" and "Sinoceratops" are not pachyrhinosaurins, shows the phylogenetic position of "Achelousaurus" in a cladogram from a study by Chiba "et al." (2017).

"Achelousaurus" is known from the Two Medicine Formation, which preserves coastal sediments dating from the Campanian stage of the Late <a href="Cretaceous%20Period">Cretaceous Period</a>, between 83 and 74 million years ago. "Achelousaurus" specimens are found in the highest levels of the formation, probably closer to the end of that timeframe, 74 million years ago.

The Two Medicine Formation is typified by a warm <a href="semiarid%20climate">semiarid climate</a>. Its layers were deposed on the east coast of the Laramidia island continent (which consisted of western North America). The high <a href="cordillera">cordillera</a> in the west, combined with predominantly western winds, would have caused a <a href="rain%20shadow">rain shadow</a>, limiting annual rainfall. Rain would mainly have fallen during the summer, when <a href="convection%20cell">convection storms</a> flooded the landscape. The climate would thus also have been very seasonal, with a long dry season and a short wet season. Vegetation would have been sparse and little varied. In such conditions, horned dinosaurs would have been dependent on <a href="oxbow%20lake">oxbow lake</a>s for a continuous supply of water and food – the main river channels tending to run dry earlier – and perished in them during severe droughts when the animals concentrated around the last watering holes, causing <a href="bone%20beds">bone beds</a> to form. The brown <a href="paleosol">paleosol</a> in which the horned dinosaurs were found – a mixture of clay and <a href="Carbonization">coalified</a> wood fragments – resembles that of modern seasonally dry swamps. The surrounding vegetation might have consisted of about high conifer trees. "Achelousaurus" ate much smaller plants, though: a 2013 study determined that ceratopsid herbivores on Laramidia were restricted to feeding on vegetation with a height of or lower.

More or less contemporary dinosaur genera of the area included "<a href="Prosaurolophus">Prosaurolophus</a>", "<a href="Scolosaurus">Scolosaurus</a>", "<a href="Hypacrosaurus">Hypacrosaurus</a>", "Einiosaurus" and <a href="tyrannosaurid">tyrannosaurid</a>s of uncertain classification. As proven by tooth marks, horned dinosaur fossils in the Landslide Butte Field Area had been scavenged by a large <a href="theropod">theropod</a> predator, which Rogers suggested were "<a href="Albertosaurus">Albertosaurus</a>".

The exact composition of the fauna "Achelousaurus" was part of is uncertain, as its fossils have not been discovered in direct association with other taxa. Its intermediate anagenetic position suggests that "Achelousaurus" shared its habitat with forms roughly found in the middle or at the end of the time range of its formation. As with horned dinosaurs, Horner assumed he had found transitional taxa in other dinosaur groups of the Two Medicine Formation. One of these was a form in between "<a href="Lambeosaurus">Lambeosaurus</a>" and "Hypacrosaurus"; in 1994 he would name it "Hypacrosaurus stebingeri". Today, "Hypacrosaurus stebingeri" is no longer seen as having evolved through anagenesis because autapomorphies of the species have been identified. Horner saw some <a href="pachycephalosaur">pachycephalosaur</a> skulls as indicative for a taxon in between "<a href="Stegoceras">Stegoceras</a>" and "<a href="Pachycephalosaurus">Pachycephalosaurus</a>"; these have not been consistently referred to a new genus. Finally, Horner thought there was a taxon present that was transitional between "<a href="Daspletosaurus">Daspletosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a>". In 2017, tyrannosaurid remains from the Two Medicine Formation were named as a new species of "Daspletosaurus": "Daspletosaurus horneri". The 2017 study considered it plausible that "D. horneri" was a direct descendant of "D. torosus" in a process of anagenesis, but rejected the possibility that "D. horneri" was the ancestor of "Tyrannosaurus".

Other ceratopsians from the Two Medicine Formation include "Einiosaurus" and "Rubeosaurus". In addition, remains of other indeterminate and dubious centrosaurines, including "Brachyceratops", are known from the formation and though they may represent younger stages of the three valid genera, this is not possible to demonstrate. Whereas Horner assumed that "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" were separate in time, in 2010 Donald M. Henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or <a href="sympatric">sympatric</a> and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been <a href="niche%20partitioning">niche partitioning</a>. The skull of "Achelousaurus" was more than twice as strong than that of "Einiosaurus" in its bending strength and <a href="Torsion%20%28mechanics%29">torsion resistance</a>. This might have indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition. The bite strength of "Achelousaurus", measured as an <a href="ultimate%20tensile%20strength">ultimate tensile strength</a>, was 30.5 <a href="newton%20%28unit%29">newton</a>s per square meter (N/m²) at the maxillary tooth row and 18 N/m² at the beak.

The indeterminate specimen TMP 2002.76.1 is from the Dinosaur Park Formation and, if it belongs to "Achelousaurus", the genus would be the stratigraphically oldest known pachyrhinosaurine taxon. "Achelousaurus" would then also be the only Campanian ceratopsid known from more than one formation. Both animals occur right below the marine <a href="shales">shales</a> of the Bearpaw Formation, but due to longitudinal differences, TMP 2002.76.1 is about 500,000 years older than the "Achelousaurus" fossils from the Two Medicine Formation.

In 1995, Sampson noted that earlier studies had found that the horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a function in <a href="intraspecific%20display">intraspecific display</a> and combat, and that these features would therefore have resulted from <a href="sexual%20selection">sexual selection</a> for successful mating. Likewise, in 1997 Horner concluded that such ornamentation was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well-equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits, conferring a reproduction benefit. Dodson thought that in the Centrosaurinae in general the display value of the frill had been reduced compared to the nasal and supraorbital ornamentation. Sampson in 1995 rejected the possibility that the difference in skull ornamentation between "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" represented <a href="sexual%20dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, for three reasons. Firstly, the extensive "Einiosaurus" bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses, as would have been expected if one of the sexes had them. Secondly, "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" are found in strata of a different age. Thirdly, in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually only one of the sexes shows exaggerated <a href="Secondary%20sex%20characteristic">secondary sexual characters</a>. "Einiosaurus" and "Achelousaurus" however, each have developed a distinct set of such traits.

Hieronymus, in 2009, concluded that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights similar to those of members of the <a href="Caprinae">Caprinae</a> <a href="subfamily">subfamily</a>. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head-butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would only have engaged this way after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for <a href="species%20recognition">species recognition</a> as this was already guaranteed by the innate species-specific display rituals preceding a real – instead of a ritual – fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a <a href="social%20selection">social selection</a> in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds.

Previously it had been suggested that the fusion of the first three neck vertebrae, such as seen in the mature specimen MOR 571, might have been a <a href="paleopathology">paleopathology</a>, an instance of the disease <a href="spondyloarthropathy">spondyloarthropathy</a>, but in 1997 it was concluded that it was more likely a normal <a href="ontogenetic">ontogenetic</a> trait, the vertebrae growing together to form a so-called "syncervical" to support the heavy head. All three main known specimens have syncervicals consisting of three fused neck vertebrae; the trait could have been inherited from a smaller ancestor using a stiffer neck for burrowing or food acquisition.

It has often been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, due to the large number of known bone beds containing multiple members of the same ceratopsian species. In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians. Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in herds that had been killed by drought or disease. Dodson concluded that the fact that the "Achelousaurus" bone beds were monospecific (containing only one species) confirmed the existence of herds.

There has long been debate about the <a href="thermoregulation">thermoregulation</a> of dinosaurs, centered around whether they were <a href="ectotherms">ectotherms</a> ("cold-blooded") or <a href="endotherms">endotherms</a> ("warm-blooded"). Mammals and birds are <a href="homeothermic">homeothermic</a> endotherms, which generate their own body heat and have a high <a href="metabolism">metabolism</a>, whereas reptiles are <a href="heterothermic">heterothermic</a> ectotherms, which receive their body heat from their surroundings. A 1996 study examined the <a href="oxygen%20isotopes">oxygen isotopes</a> from bone <a href="phosphates">phosphates</a> of animals from the Two Medicine Formation, including the juvenile "Achelousaurus" specimen MOR 591. <a href="%CE%B418O">δO</a> values of phosphate in vertebrate bones depend on the δO values in their body water and the temperature when the bones were deposited, making it possible to measure fluctuations in temperature for each bone of an individual when they were deposited. The study analyzed seasonal variations in the body temperature and differences in temperature between skeletal regions, to determine whether the dinosaurs maintained their temperature seasonally. A <a href="varanid">varanid</a> lizard fossil sampled for the study showed isotopic variation consistent with it being an heterothermic ectotherm. The variation of the dinosaurs, including "Achelousaurus", was consistent with them being homeothermic endotherms. The metabolic rate of these dinosaurs was likely not as high as that of modern mammals and birds, and they may have been intermediate endotherms.

Rwandan Civil War

The Rwandan Civil War was a conflict between the <a href="Rwandan%20Armed%20Forces">Rwandan Armed Forces</a>, representing the government of <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, and the rebel <a href="Rwandan%20Patriotic%20Front">Rwandan Patriotic Front</a> (RPF). The war, which lasted from 1990 to 1994, arose from the long-running dispute between the <a href="Hutu">Hutu</a> and <a href="Tutsi">Tutsi</a> groups within the Rwandan population. A <a href="Rwandan%20Revolution">1959–1962 revolution</a> had replaced the <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Rwanda">Tutsi monarchy</a> with a Hutu-led republic, forcing more than 336,000 Tutsi to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. A group of these refugees in <a href="Uganda">Uganda</a> founded the RPF which, under the leadership of <a href="Fred%20Rwigyema">Fred Rwigyema</a> and <a href="Paul%20Kagame">Paul Kagame</a>, became a battle-ready army by the late 1980s.

The war began on 1 October 1990, when the RPF invaded north-eastern Rwanda, advancing into the country. They suffered a major setback when Rwigyema was killed in action on the second day. The Rwandan Army, assisted by troops from France, gained the upper hand and the RPF were largely defeated by the end of October. Kagame, who had been in the United States during the invasion, returned to take command. He withdrew troops to the <a href="Virunga%20mountains">Virunga mountains</a> for several months before attacking again. The RPF began a <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla war</a>, which continued until mid-1992 with neither side able to gain the upper hand. A series of protests forced Rwandan President <a href="Juv%C3%A9nal%20Habyarimana">Juvénal Habyarimana</a> to begin peace negotiations with the RPF and domestic opposition parties. Despite disruption and killings by <a href="Hutu%20Power">Hutu Power</a>, a group of extremists opposed to any deal, and a fresh RPF offensive in early 1993, the negotiations were successfully concluded with the signing of the <a href="Arusha%20Accords%20%28Rwanda%29">Arusha Accords</a> in August 1993.

An uneasy peace followed, during which the terms of the accords were gradually implemented. RPF troops were deployed to a compound in Kigali and the peace-keeping <a href="United%20Nations%20Assistance%20Mission%20for%20Rwanda">United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda</a> (UNAMIR) was sent to the country. But the Hutu Power movement was steadily gaining influence and planned a "final solution" to exterminate the Tutsi. This plan was put into action following the <a href="Assassination%20of%20Juv%C3%A9nal%20Habyarimana%20and%20Cyprien%20Ntaryamira">assassination of President Habyarimana</a> on 6 April 1994. Over the course of about 100 days, between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed in the <a href="Rwandan%20genocide">Rwandan genocide</a>. The RPF quickly resumed the civil war. They captured territory steadily, encircling cities and cutting off supply routes. By mid-June they had surrounded the capital, <a href="Kigali">Kigali</a>, and on 4 July they seized it. The war ended later that month when the RPF captured the last territory held by the interim government, forcing the government and "genocidaires" into <a href="Zaire">Zaire</a>.

The victorious RPF assumed control of the country, with Paul Kagame as "de facto" leader. Kagame served as <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Rwanda">vice-president</a> from 1994 and as president from 2000, winning elections in <a href="Rwandan%20presidential%20election%2C%202003">2003</a>, <a href="Rwandan%20presidential%20election%2C%202010">2010</a> and <a href="Rwandan%20presidential%20election%2C%202017">2017</a>. The RPF began a programme of rebuilding the infrastructure and economy of the country, bringing genocide perpetrators to trial, and promoting reconciliation between Hutu and Tutsi. In 1996 the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched an offensive against refugee camps in Zaire, home to exiled leaders of the former regime and millions of Hutu refugees. This action started the <a href="First%20Congo%20War">First Congo War</a>, which removed long-time dictator President <a href="Mobutu%20Sese%20Seko">Mobutu Sese Seko</a> from power. As of 2019, Kagame and the RPF remain the dominant political force in Rwanda.

The earliest inhabitants of what is now <a href="Rwanda">Rwanda</a> were the <a href="Great%20Lakes%20Twa">Twa</a>, <a href="indigenous%20peoples">aboriginal</a> <a href="Pygmy%20peoples">pygmy</a> hunter-gatherers who settled in the area between 8000 BC and 3000 BC and remain in Rwanda today. Between 700 BC and 1500 AD, <a href="Bantu%20peoples">Bantu</a> groups migrated into the region and began to clear forest land for agriculture. The forest-dwelling Twa lost much of their land and moved to the slopes of mountains. Historians have several theories regarding the Bantu migrations. One theory is that the first settlers were <a href="Hutu">Hutu</a>, and the <a href="Tutsi">Tutsi</a> migrated later and formed a distinct racial group, possibly originating from the <a href="Horn%20of%20Africa">Horn of Africa</a>. An alternative theory is that the migration was slow and steady, with incoming groups integrating into rather than conquering the existing society. Under this theory the Hutu and Tutsi are a later class, rather than a racial, distinction.

The population coalesced, first into <a href="Clans%20of%20Rwanda">clans</a> ("ubwoko") and by 1700 into around eight kingdoms. The <a href="Kingdom%20of%20Rwanda">Kingdom of Rwanda</a>, ruled by the Tutsi Nyiginya clan, became dominant from the mid-eighteenth century, expanding through conquest and assimilation. It achieved its greatest extent under the reign of <a href="Kigeli%20IV%20of%20Rwanda">Kigeli Rwabugiri</a> in 1853–1895. Rwabugiri expanded the kingdom west and north, and initiated administrative reforms which caused a rift to grow between the Hutu and Tutsi populations. These included "uburetwa", a system of forced labour which Hutu had to perform to regain access to land seized from them, and "<a href="ubuhake">ubuhake</a>", under which Tutsi patrons ceded cattle to Hutu or Tutsi clients in exchange for economic and personal service. Rwanda and neighbouring <a href="Burundi">Burundi</a> were assigned to Germany by the <a href="Berlin%20Conference%20%281884%29">Berlin Conference</a> of 1884, and Germany established a presence in 1897 with the formation of an alliance with the King. German policy was to rule through the Rwandan monarchy, enabling colonisation with fewer European troops. The colonists favoured the Tutsi over the Hutu when assigning administrative roles, believing them to be migrants from Ethiopia and racially superior. The Rwandan King welcomed the Germans, and used their military strength to reinforce his rule and expand the kingdom. <a href="East%20African%20Campaign%20%28World%20War%20I%29">Belgian forces took control of Rwanda and Burundi</a> during World War I, and from 1926 began a policy of more direct colonial rule. The Belgian administration, in conjunction with Catholic clerics, modernised the local economy. They also increased taxes and imposed forced labour on the population. Tutsi supremacy remained, reinforced by Belgium's enthusiastic support of the monarchy, leaving the Hutu disenfranchised. In 1935, Belgium introduced identity cards classifying each individual as Tutsi, Hutu, Twa or Naturalised. It had previously been possible for wealthy Hutu to become honorary Tutsi, but the identity cards prevented further movement between the groups.

After 1945 a Hutu counter-elite developed, demanding the transfer of power from Tutsi to Hutu. The Tutsi leadership responded by trying to negotiate a speedy independence on their terms but found the Belgians no longer supported them. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church, with prominent conservative figures in the early Rwandan church replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these a greater proportion were <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemish</a> rather than <a href="Walloons">Walloon</a> Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu. In November 1959 the Hutu began a series of riots and arson attacks on Tutsi homes, following false rumours of the death of a Hutu sub-chief in an assault by Tutsi activists. Violence quickly spread across the whole country, beginning the <a href="Rwandan%20Revolution">Rwandan Revolution</a>. The King and Tutsi politicians launched a counter-attack in an attempt to seize power and ostracise the Hutu and Belgians, but were thwarted by Belgian Colonel <a href="Guy%20Logiest">Guy Logiest</a>, who was brought in by the colonial Governor. Logiest re-established law and order and began a programme of overt promotion and protection of the Hutu elite. He replaced many Tutsi chiefs with Hutu and effectively forced <a href="Kigeli%20V%20of%20Rwanda">King Kigeli V</a> into exile.

Logiest and Hutu leader <a href="Gr%C3%A9goire%20Kayibanda">Grégoire Kayibanda</a> declared the country an autonomous republic in 1961 and it became independent in 1962. More than 336,000 Tutsi left Rwanda by 1964 to escape the Hutu purges, mostly to the neighbouring countries of Burundi, Uganda, <a href="Tanzania">Tanzania</a> and Zaire. Many of the Tutsi exiles lived as refugees in their host countries, and sought to return to Rwanda. Some supported the new Rwandan Government, but others formed armed groups and launched attacks on Rwanda, the largest of which advanced close to Kigali in 1963. These groups were known in <a href="Kinyarwanda">Kinyarwanda</a> as the "inyenzi" (cockroaches). Historians do not know the origin of this term – it is possible the rebels coined it themselves, the name reflecting the fact that they generally attacked at night. The "inyenzi" label resurfaced in the 1990s as a highly derogatory term for the Tutsi, used by Hutu hardliners to dehumanise them. The "inyenzi" attacks of the 1960s were poorly equipped and organised and the government defeated them. The last significant attack was made in desperation from Burundi in December 1963 but failed due to bad planning and lack of equipment. The government responded to this attack with the slaughter of an estimated 10,000 Tutsi within Rwanda.

Kayibanda presided over a Hutu republic for the next decade, imposing an autocratic rule similar to the pre-revolution feudal monarchy. In 1973 Hutu army officer <a href="Juv%C3%A9nal%20Habyarimana">Juvénal Habyarimana</a> toppled Kayibanda in <a href="1973%20Rwandan%20coup%20d%27%C3%A9tat">a coup</a>. He founded the <a href="National%20Republican%20Movement%20for%20Democracy%20and%20Development">National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development</a> (MRND) party in 1975, and promulgated a new constitution following a <a href="Rwandan%20constitutional%20referendum%2C%201978">1978 referendum</a>, making the country a <a href="one-party%20state">one-party state</a> in which every citizen had to belong to the MRND. Anti-Tutsi discrimination continued under Habyarimana but the country enjoyed greater economic prosperity and reduced anti-Tutsi violence. A coffee price collapse in the late 1980s caused a loss of income for Rwanda's wealthy elite, precipitating a political fight for power and access to <a href="foreign%20aid">foreign aid</a> receipts. The family of first lady <a href="Agathe%20Habyarimana">Agathe Habyarimana</a>, known as the "<a href="akazu">akazu</a>", were the principal winners in this fight. The family had a more respected lineage than that of the President, having ruled one of the independent states near <a href="Gisenyi">Gisenyi</a> in the nineteenth century. Habyarimana therefore relied on them in controlling the population of the north-west. The "akazu" exploited this to their advantage, and Habyarimana was increasingly unable to rule without them. The economic situation forced Habyarimana to greatly reduce the <a href="national%20budget">national budget</a>, which led to civil unrest. On the advice of French president <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Mitterrand">François Mitterrand</a>, Habyarimana declared a commitment to <a href="Multi-party%20system">multi-party politics</a> but took no action to bring this about. Student protests followed and by late 1990 the country was in crisis.

The organisation which became the <a href="Rwandan%20Patriotic%20Front">Rwandan Patriotic Front</a> (RPF) was founded in 1979 in Uganda. It was initially known as the Rwandan Refugees Welfare Association and then from 1980 as the Rwandan Alliance for National Unity (RANU). It formed in response to persecution and discrimination against the Tutsi refugees by the regime of Ugandan President <a href="Milton%20Obote">Milton Obote</a>. Obote accused the Rwandans of collaboration with his predecessor, <a href="Idi%20Amin">Idi Amin</a>, including occupying the homes and stealing the cattle of Ugandans who had fled from Amin. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees <a href="Fred%20Rwigyema">Fred Rwigyema</a> and <a href="Paul%20Kagame">Paul Kagame</a> had joined <a href="Yoweri%20Museveni">Yoweri Museveni</a>'s rebel <a href="Front%20for%20National%20Salvation">Front for National Salvation</a> (FRONASA). Museveni <a href="Uganda%E2%80%93Tanzania%20War">fought alongside Obote</a> to defeat Amin in 1979 but withdrew from the government following Obote's disputed victory in the <a href="Ugandan%20general%20election%2C%201980">1980 general election</a>. With Rwigyema and Kagame he formed a new rebel army, the <a href="National%20Resistance%20Army">National Resistance Army</a> (NRA). The NRA's goal was to overthrow Obote's government, in what became known as the <a href="Ugandan%20Bush%20War">Ugandan Bush War</a>. President Obote remained hostile to the Rwandan refugees throughout his presidency and RANU was forced into exile in 1981, relocating to <a href="Nairobi">Nairobi</a> in Kenya. In 1982, with the authority of Obote, local district councils in the <a href="Ankole">Ankole</a> region issued notices requiring refugees to be evicted from their homes and settled in camps. These evictions were violently implemented by Ankole youth militia. Many displaced Rwandans attempted to cross the border to Rwanda, but the Habyarimana regime confined them to isolated camps and closed the border to prevent further migration. Faced with the threat of statelessness, many more Tutsi refugees in Uganda chose to join Museveni's NRA.

In 1986 the NRA captured Kampala with a force of 14,000 soldiers, including 500 Rwandans, and formed a new government. After Museveni was inaugurated as president he appointed Kagame and Rwigyema as senior officers in the new Ugandan army. The experience of the Bush War inspired Rwigyema and Kagame to consider an attack against Rwanda, with the goal of allowing the refugees to return home. As well as fulfilling their army duties, the pair began building a covert network of Rwandan Tutsi refugees within the army's ranks, intended as the nucleus for such an attack. With the pro-refugee Museveni in power, RANU was able to move back to Kampala. At its 1987 convention it renamed itself to the Rwandan Patriotic Front and it too committed to returning the refugees to Rwanda by any means possible. In 1988 a leadership crisis within the RPF prompted Fred Rwigyema to intervene in the organisation and take control, replacing <a href="Peter%20Bayingana">Peter Bayingana</a> as RPF president. Kagame and other senior members of Rwigyema's Rwandan entourage within the NRA also joined, Kagame assuming the vice-presidency. Bayingana remained as the other vice-president but resented the loss of the leadership. Bayingana and his supporters attempted to start the war with an invasion in late 1989 without the support of Rwigyema, but this was quickly repelled by the Rwandan Army.

Rwandan President Habyarimana was aware of the increasing number of Tutsi exiles in the Ugandan Army and made representations to President Museveni on the matter. At the same time many native Ugandans and <a href="Baganda">Baganda</a> officers in the NRA began criticising Museveni over his appointment of Rwandan refugees to senior positions. He therefore demoted Kagame and Rwigyema in 1989. They remained "de facto" senior officers but the change in official status, and the possibility that they might lose access to the resources of the Ugandan military, caused them to accelerate their plans to invade Rwanda. In 1990 a dispute in south-western Uganda between Ugandan ranch owners and squatters on their land, many of whom were Rwandans, led to a wider debate on indigeneity and eventually to the explicit labelling of all Rwandan refugees as non-citizens. Realising the precariousness of their own positions, the opportunity afforded by both the renewed drive of refugees to leave Uganda, and the instability on the Rwandan domestic scene, Rwigyema and Kagame decided in mid-1990 to effect their invasion plans immediately. It is likely that President Museveni knew of the planned invasion but did not explicitly support it. In mid-1990 Museveni ordered Rwigyema to attend an officer training course at the <a href="Command%20and%20General%20Staff%20College">Command and General Staff College</a> in <a href="Fort%20Leavenworth">Fort Leavenworth</a> in the United States, and was also planning overseas deployments for other senior Rwandans in the army. This may have been a tactic to reduce the threat of an RPF invasion of Rwanda. After two days of discussion Rwigyema persuaded Museveni that following years of army duty he needed a break and was allowed to remain in Uganda. Museveni then ordered Kagame to attend instead. The RPF leadership allowed him to go, to avoid suspicion, even though it meant his missing the beginning of the war.

On 1 October 1990 fifty RPF rebels deserted their Ugandan Army posts and crossed the border from Uganda into Rwanda, killing a Rwandan customs guard at the Kagitumba border post and forcing others to flee. They were followed by hundreds more rebels, dressed in the uniforms of the <a href="Uganda%20People%27s%20Defence%20Force">Ugandan national army</a> and carrying stolen Ugandan weaponry, including <a href="machine%20gun">machine gun</a>s, <a href="autocannon">autocannon</a>s, <a href="mortar%20%28weapon%29">mortars</a>, and Soviet <a href="BM-21%20Grad">BM-21 multiple rocket launchers</a>. According to RPF estimates, around 2,500 of the Ugandan Army's 4,000 Rwandan soldiers took part in the invasion, accompanied by 800 civilians, including medical staff and messengers. Both President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and President Habyarimana of Rwanda were in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a> attending the United Nations <a href="World%20Summit%20for%20Children">World Summit for Children</a>. In the first few days of fighting, the RPF advanced south to <a href="Gabiro">Gabiro</a>. Their <a href="Rwandan%20Armed%20Forces">Rwandan Armed Forces</a> opponents, fighting for Habyarimana's government, were numerically superior, with 5,200 soldiers, and possessed armoured cars and helicopters supplied by France, but the RPF benefited from the element of surprise. The Ugandan government set up roadblocks across the west of Uganda, to prevent further desertions and to block the rebels from returning to Uganda.

On 2 October the RPF leader Fred Rwigyema was shot in the head and killed. The exact circumstances of Rwigyema's death are disputed; the official line of Kagame's government, and the version mentioned by historian <a href="G%C3%A9rard%20Prunier">Gérard Prunier</a> in his 1995 book on the subject, was that Rwigyema was killed by a stray bullet. In his 2009 book "Africa's World War", Prunier states that Rwigyema was killed by his subcommander Peter Bayingana, following an argument over tactics. According to this account, Rwigyema was conscious of the need to move slowly and attempt to win over the Hutu in Rwanda before assaulting Kigali, whereas Bayingana and fellow subcommander <a href="Chris%20Bunyenyezi">Chris Bunyenyezi</a> wished to strike hard and fast, to achieve power as soon as possible. The argument boiled over, causing Bayingana to shoot Rwigyema dead. Another senior RPF officer, <a href="Stephen%20Nduguta">Stephen Nduguta</a>, witnessed this shooting and informed President Museveni; Museveni sent his brother <a href="Salim%20Saleh">Salim Saleh</a> to investigate, and Saleh ordered Bayingana and Bunyenyezi's arrest and eventual execution.

When news of the RPF offensive broke, Habyarimana requested assistance from France in fighting the invasion. The French president's son, <a href="Jean-Christophe%20Mitterrand">Jean-Christophe Mitterrand</a>, was head of the government's Africa Cell and promised to send troops. On the night of 4 October, gunfire was heard in Kigali in a mysterious attack, which was attributed to RPF commandos. The attack was most likely staged by the Rwandan authorities, seeking to convince the French that the regime was in imminent danger. As a result, 600 French soldiers arrived in Rwanda the following day, twice as many as initially pledged. The French operation was code-named <a href="Op%C3%A9ration%20Noro%C3%AEt">Noroît</a> and its official purpose was to protect French nationals. In reality the mission was to support Habyarimana's regime and the French parachute companies immediately set up positions blocking the RPF advance to the capital and <a href="Kigali%20International%20Airport">Kigali International Airport</a>. Belgium and Zaire also sent troops to Kigali in early October. The Belgian troops were deployed primarily to defend the country's citizens living in Rwanda but after a few days it became clear that they were not in danger. Instead, the deployment created a political controversy as news reached Brussels of arbitrary arrests and massacres by the Habyarimana regime and its failure to deal with the underlying causes of the war. Faced with a growing domestic dispute over the issue, and no with no obvious prospect of achieving peace, the Belgian government withdrew its troops by the beginning of November. Belgium provided no further military support to the Habyarimana government. Zairian President <a href="Mobutu%20Sese%20Seko">Mobutu Sese Seko</a>'s contribution was to send several hundred troops of the elite <a href="Special%20Presidential%20Division">Special Presidential Division</a> (DSP). Unlike the French, the Zairian troops went straight to the front line and began fighting the RPF, but their discipline was poor. The Zairian soldiers raped Rwandan civilians in the north of the country and looted their homes, prompting Habyarimana to expel them back to Zaire within a week of their arrival. With French assistance, and benefiting from the loss of RPF morale after Rwigyema's death, the Rwandan Army enjoyed a major tactical advantage. By the end of October they had regained all the ground taken by the RPF and pushed the rebels all the way back to the Ugandan border. Many soldiers deserted; some crossed back into Uganda and others went into hiding in the <a href="Akagera%20National%20Park">Akagera National Park</a>. Habyarimana accused the Ugandan Government of supplying the RPF, establishing a "rear command" for the group in <a href="Kampala">Kampala</a>, and "flagging off" the invasion. The Rwandan Government announced on 30 October that the war was over.

The Rwandan Government used the attack on Kigali on 4 October as the pretext for the arbitrary arrest of more than 8,000 mostly Tutsi political opponents. Tutsi were increasingly viewed with suspicion; <a href="Radio%20Rwanda">Radio Rwanda</a> aired incitement to ethnic hatred and a pogrom was organised on 11 October in a commune in <a href="Gisenyi%20Province">Gisenyi Province</a>, killing 383 Tutsi. It was the first time in nearly twenty years that massacres against Tutsi were perpetrated, as anti-Tutsi violence under the Habyarimana regime had been low level only up to that point.

Paul Kagame was still in the United States at the time of the outbreak of war, attending the military training course in Fort Leavenworth. He and Rwigyema had been in frequent contact by telephone throughout his stay in Kansas, planning the final details for the October invasion. At the end of September Kagame informed the college that he was leaving the course, and was settling his affairs ready to return to Africa as the invasion began. The college allowed him to leave with several textbooks, which he later used in planning tactics for the war. When Kagame learned of Rwigyema's death on 5 October, he departed immediately to take command of the RPF troops. He flew through <a href="London">London</a> and <a href="Addis%20Ababa">Addis Ababa</a> to <a href="Entebbe%20International%20Airport">Entebbe Airport</a>, where he was given safe passage by a friend in the Ugandan secret service; the police considered arresting him, but with Museveni out of the country and no specific orders, they allowed him to pass. Ugandan associates drove Kagame to the border and he crossed into Rwanda early on 15 October.

The RPF were in disarray by the time Kagame arrived, with troop morale very low. He later described his arrival as one of the worst experiences of his life; the troops lacked organisation following Rwigyema's death and were demoralised after their losses in the war. Kagame was well known to the RPF troops, many of whom had fought with him in the Ugandan Army, and they welcomed his arrival in the field. He spent the following weeks gathering intelligence with senior officers. By the end of October, with the RPF forced back to the Ugandan border, Kagame decided it was futile to continue fighting. He therefore withdrew most of the army from north-eastern Rwanda, moving them to the <a href="Virunga%20mountains">Virunga mountains</a>. Kagame knew that the rugged terrain of the Virungas offered protection from attacks, even if the RPF's position was discovered. The march west took almost a week during which the soldiers crossed the border into Uganda several times, with the permission of President Museveni, taking advantage of personal friendships between the RPF soldiers and their ex-colleagues in the Ugandan Army.

Meanwhile, some RPF soldiers remained as a <a href="Decoy%23Military%20decoy">decoy</a> to carry out small-scale attacks on the Rwandan Army, who remained unaware of the Front's relocation. The reorientation towards <a href="guerrilla%20warfare">guerrilla warfare</a> began with a raid on a Rwandan customs post across the border from <a href="Katuna">Katuna</a>. Following the attack, the Rwandan Government accused Uganda of deliberately sheltering the RPF. The RPF's new tactics inflicted heavy casualties on the Rwandan Army, which reacted by shelling Ugandan territory. Ugandan civilians were killed and a significant amount of damage to property was incurred, and there were reports of Rwandan troops crossing the border to loot and abduct locals.

Conditions in the Virungas were very harsh for the RPF. At an altitude of almost , there was no ready availability of food or supplies and, lacking warm clothing, several soldiers froze to death or lost limbs in the <a href="Alpine%20climate">high-altitude cold climate</a>. Kagame spent the next two months reorganising the army, without carrying out any military operations. <a href="Alexis%20Kanyarengwe">Alexis Kanyarengwe</a>, a Hutu colonel who had worked with Habyarimana but had fallen out with him and gone into exile, joined the RPF and was appointed chairman of the organisation. Another Hutu, <a href="Seth%20Sendashonga">Seth Sendashonga</a>, became the RPF's liaison with Rwandan opposition parties. Most of the other senior recruits at the time were Ugandan-based Tutsi. Personnel numbers grew steadily, volunteers coming from the exile communities in Burundi, Zaire and other countries. Kagame maintained tight discipline in his army, enforcing a regimented training routine, as well as a large set of rules for soldier conduct. Soldiers were expected to pay for goods purchased in the community, refrain from alcohol and drugs, and to establish a good reputation for the RPF amongst the local population. The RPF punished personnel who broke these rules, sometimes with beatings, while more serious offences such as murder, rape, and desertion, were punishable by death.

The RPF carried out a major fundraising programme, spearheaded by Financial Commissioner <a href="Aloisia%20Inyumba">Aloisia Inyumba</a> in Kampala. They received donations from Tutsi exiles around the world, as well as from businessmen within Rwanda who had fallen out with the government. The sums involved were not enormous but, with tight financial discipline and a leadership willing to lead frugal lives, the RPF was able to grow its operational capability. It obtained its weapons and ammunition from a variety of sources, including the open market, taking advantage of a surplus of weaponry at the end of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>. It is likely they also received weaponry from officers in the Ugandan Army; according to Gérard Prunier, Ugandans who had fought with Kagame in the Bush War remained loyal to him and secretly passed weaponry to the RPF. Museveni likely knew of this but was able to claim ignorance when dealing with the international community. Museveni later said that "faced with [a] "fait accompli" situation by our Rwandan brothers," Uganda went "to help the RPF, materially, so that they are not defeated because that would have been detrimental to the Tutsi people of Rwanda and would not have been good for Uganda's stability." Journalist Justus Muhanguzi Kampe reported that the taking of military equipment by deserted of Tutsi members of the Ugandan Army meant that the national arsenal "nearly got depleted"; he suspected that the war "must have had a tremendous financial impact on the Ugandan government, especially Uganda's military budget," costing the country "trillions of shillings".

After three months of regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to fight again. The target for the first attack was the northern city of <a href="Ruhengeri">Ruhengeri</a>, south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, as well as his wife and her powerful family, came from the north-west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence and Kagame hoped this would destabilise the government.

During the night of 22 January, seven hundred RPF fighters descended from the mountains into hidden locations around the city, assisted by RPF sympathisers living in the area. They attacked on the morning of 23 January. The Rwandan forces were taken by surprise and were mostly unable to defend against the invasion. The Rwandan Police and army succeeded in briefly repelling the invasion in areas around their stations, killing large numbers of rebel fighters in the process. It is likely the Rwandan Army forces were assisted by French troops, as the French Government later rewarded around fifteen French paratroopers for having taken part in the rearguard. By noon, the defending forces were defeated and the RPF held the whole city. Most of the civilian population fled.

One of the principal RPF targets in Ruhengeri was the prison, which was Rwanda's largest. When he learnt of the invasion the warden, <a href="Charles%20Uwihoreye">Charles Uwihoreye</a>, telephoned the government in Kigali to request instructions. He spoke to Colonel <a href="Elie%20Sagatwa">Elie Sagatwa</a>, one of the "akazu", who ordered him to kill every inmate in the prison to avoid escape and defections during the fighting. He also wanted to prevent high-profile political prisoners and former insiders from sharing secret information with the RPF. Uwihoreye refused to obey, even after Sagatwa called him and repeated the order, having confirmed it with the president. Eventually, the RPF stormed the buildings and the prisoners were liberated. Several prisoners were recruited into the RPF, including <a href="Th%C3%A9oneste%20Lizinde">Théoneste Lizinde</a>, a former close ally of President Habyarimana, who had been arrested following a failed coup attempt in 1980.

The RPF forces held Ruhengeri through the afternoon of 23 January, before withdrawing into the mountains for the night. The raid undermined the Rwandan Government's claims that the RPF had been ejected from the country and had been reduced to conducting guerrilla operations from Uganda. The government sent troops to the city the following day and a <a href="state%20of%20emergency">state of emergency</a> was declared, with strict curfews in Ruhengeri and the surrounding area. The RPF raided the city almost every night for several months, fighting with Rwandan army forces, and the country was back at war for the first time since the October invasion.

Following the action in Ruhengeri the RPF again began to wage guerrilla war. The Rwandan Army massed troops across the north of the country, occupying key positions and shelling RPF hideouts in the Virunga mountains, but the mountainous terrain prevented them from launching an all-out assault. Paul Kagame's troops attacked the Rwandan Army forces repeatedly and frequently, keen to ensure that the diplomatic and psychological effect of the RPF's resurgence was not lost. Kagame employed tactics such as attacking simultaneously in up to ten locations across the north of the country, to prevent his opponents from concentrating their force in any one place. This low intensity war continued for many months, both sides launching successful attacks on the other, and neither able to gain the upper hand in the war. The RPF made some territorial gains including capturing the border town of <a href="Gatuna">Gatuna</a>. This was significant as it blocked Rwanda's access to the port of <a href="Mombasa">Mombasa</a> via the <a href="Northern%20Corridor">Northern Corridor</a>, forcing all trade to go through Tanzania via the longer and costlier <a href="Central%20Corridor%20%28Africa%29">Central Corridor</a>. By late 1991 the RPF controlled 5% of Rwanda, setting up its new headquarters in an abandoned tea factory near <a href="Mulindi">Mulindi</a>, Byumba province. Many Hutu civilians in areas captured by the RPF fled to government-held areas, creating a large population of <a href="internally%20displaced%20persons">internally displaced persons</a> in the country.

The renewed warfare had two effects in Rwanda. The first was a resurgence of violence against Tutsi still in the country. Hutu activists killed up to 1,000 Tutsi in attacks authorised by local officials, starting with the slaughter of 30–60 <a href="Bagogwe">Bagogwe</a> Tutsi pastoralists near <a href="Kinigi">Kinigi</a> and then moving south and west to Ruhengeri and Gisenyi. These attacks continued until June 1991, when the government introduced measures to allow potential victims to move to safer areas such as Kigali. The "akazu" also began a major propaganda campaign, broadcasting and publishing material designed to persuade the Hutu population that the Tutsi were a separate and alien people, non-Christians seeking to re-establish the old Rwandan feudal monarchy with the final goal of enslaving the Hutu. This included the <a href="Hutu%20Ten%20Commandments">Hutu Ten Commandments</a>, a set of "rules" published in the "<a href="Kangura">Kangura</a>" magazine, mandating Hutu supremacy in all aspects of Rwandan life. In response the RPF opened its own propaganda radio station, <a href="Radio%20Muhabura">Radio Muhabura</a>, which broadcast from Uganda into Rwanda. This was never hugely popular but gained listenership during 1992 and 1993.

The second development was that President Habyarimana announced that he was introducing multi-party politics into the country, following intense pressure from the international community, including his most loyal ally France. Habyarimana had originally promised this in mid-1990, and opposition groups had formed in the months since, including the <a href="Republican%20Democratic%20Movement">Republican Democratic Movement</a> (MDR), <a href="Social%20Democratic%20Party%20%28Rwanda%29">Social Democratic Party</a> (PSD) and the <a href="Liberal%20Party%20%28Rwanda%29">Liberal Party</a> (PL), but the one-party state law had remained in place. In mid-1991 Habyarimana officially allowed multi-party politics to begin, a change that saw a plethora of new parties come into existence. Many had manifestos which favoured full democracy and rapprochement with the RPF, but these were quite ineffective and had no political influence. The older opposition groups registered themselves as official parties and the country was notionally moving towards a multi-party inclusive cabinet with proper representation, but progress was continually hampered by the regime. The last opposition party to form was the <a href="Coalition%20for%20the%20Defence%20of%20the%20Republic">Coalition for the Defence of the Republic</a> (CDR), which was more hardline Hutu than Habyarimana's own party and had close links to the "akazu".

Progress remained slow in 1991 and 1992. A cabinet set up in October 1991 contained almost no opposition, and the administrative hierarchy across the country only recognised the authority of Habyarimana's National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development party. Another one-party cabinet was announced in January 1992 which prompted large scale protests in Kigali, forcing Habyarimana to make real concessions. He announced his intention to negotiate with the RPF, and formed a multi-party cabinet in April. This was still dominated by Habyarimana's party, but with opposition figures in some key positions. The opposition members of this cabinet met with the RPF, and negotiated a ceasefire. In July 1992 the rebels agreed to stop fighting, and the parties began peace negotiations in the Tanzanian city of <a href="Arusha">Arusha</a>.

The peace process was complicated by the fact that four distinct groups were involved, each with its own agenda. The Hutu hardliners, centred around the family of Agathe Habyarimana, were represented by the CDR as well as extremists within the president's own MRND party. The second group was the official opposition, which excluded the CDR. They had much more democratic and conciliatory aims but were also deeply suspicious of the RPF, whom they saw as trying to upset the "democratic" policy of Hutu rule established in the 1959 revolution. The third group was the RPF. Paul Kagame engaged with the peace process against the advice of some of his senior officers, in the knowledge that many of those on the other side of the table were hardliners who were not sincerely interested in negotiations. He feared that shunning the opportunity for peace would weaken the RPF politically and lose them international goodwill. Finally there was the group representing President Habyarimana himself, who sought primarily to hold on to his power in whatever form he could. This meant publicly striving for a middle ground compromise solution, but privately obstructing the process and trying to delay change to the status quo for as long as possible. Habyarimana recognised the danger posed to him by the radical Hutu faction and attempted in mid-1992 to remove them from senior army positions. This effort was only partially successful; "akazu" affiliates <a href="Augustin%20Ndindiliyimana">Augustin Ndindiliyimana</a> and <a href="Th%C3%A9oneste%20Bagosora">Théoneste Bagosora</a> remained in influential posts, providing them with a link to power.

The delegates at the negotiations in Arusha made some progress in the latter half of 1992, despite wrangling between Habyarimana and hardline members of his party that compromised the government officials' negotiating power. In August the parties agreed a "pluralistic transitional government", which would include the RPF. The CDR and hardline faction of the MRND reacted violently to this. Feeling sidelined by the developing Arusha process, they began killing Tutsi civilians in the <a href="Kibuye%2C%20Rwanda">Kibuye</a> area; 85 were killed, and 500 homes burnt. Historian Gérard Prunier names late 1992 as the time when the idea of a genocidal "final solution" to kill every Tutsi in Rwanda was first mooted. Hardliners were busy setting up parallel institutions within the official organs of state, including the army, from which they hoped to effect a move away from the more conciliatory tone adopted by Habyarimana and the moderate opposition. Their goal was to take over from Habyarimana's government as the perceived source of power in the country amongst the Hutu masses, to maintain the line that the RPF and Tutsi more generally were a threat to Hutu freedoms, and to find a way to thwart any agreement negotiated in Arusha.

The situation deteriorated in early 1993 when the teams in Arusha signed a full power-sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF and other major opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until free and fair elections could be held. The agreement reflected the balance of power at the time; Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition, and the RPF all accepted it, but the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary <a href="Mathieu%20Ngirumpatse">Mathieu Ngirumpatse</a> announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger killing spree than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole north-west of Rwanda and lasted for six days; many houses were burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed.

Paul Kagame responded by pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six-month cease-fire. The RPF cited the CDR and MRND-hardliner violence as its reason for this, but according to foreign policy scholar <a href="Bruce%20D.%20Jones">Bruce D. Jones</a> the offensive may actually have been intended primarily to increase the rebels' bargaining power at the peace talks. The next subject for the negotiations was the proportion of troops and officers to be allocated to each side in the new unified army. By demonstrating its military power in the field, through a successful offensive against the Rwandan Government forces, the RPF was able to secure an increased percentage of troops in the agreement.

The RPF began its offensive on 8 February, fighting southwards from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met by weak resistance from the Rwandan Army forces. The likely reason was a significant deterioration in morale and military experience within the government forces. The impact of the long-running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the <a href="Rwandan%20franc">Rwandan franc</a>, had left the government struggling to pay its soldiers regularly. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one-year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.

The RPF advance continued unchecked in February, its forces moving steadily south and gaining territory without opposition. They took Ruhengeri on the first day of fighting, and later the city of <a href="Byumba">Byumba</a>. Local Hutu civilians fled "en masse" from the areas the RPF were taking, most of them ending up in refugee camps on the outskirts of Kigali. The civilian cost of the offensive is unclear; according to André Guichaoua several thousand were killed, while Prunier labelled the RPF killing as "small-scale". This violence alienated the rebels from their potential allies in the democratic Rwandan opposition parties.

When it became clear that the Rwandan Army was losing ground to the RPF, Habyarimana requested urgent assistance from France. Fearing that the RPF could soon be in a position to seize Kigali, the French immediately dispatched 150 troops to Rwanda, along with arms and ammunition, to bolster the Rwandan Army forces. A further 250 French soldiers were sent on 20 February. The arrival of French troops in Kigali significantly changed the military situation on the ground. The RPF now found themselves under attack, French shells bombarding them as they advanced southwards.

By 20 February the RPF had advanced to within of the capital, <a href="Kigali">Kigali</a>, and many observers believed an assault on the city was imminent. The assault did not take place, and the RPF instead declared a cease-fire. Whether or not the RPF intended to advance on the capital is unknown. Kagame later stated that his aim at this point was to inflict as much damage as possible on Rwandan Army forces, capture their weapons, and gain ground slowly, but not to attack the capital or seek to end the war with an outright RPF victory. Kagame told journalist and author <a href="Stephen%20Kinzer">Stephen Kinzer</a> that such a victory would have ended international goodwill towards the RPF and led to charges that the war had simply been a bid to replace the Hutu state with a Tutsi one. The increased presence of French troops and the fierce loyalty of the Hutu population to the government meant that an invasion of Kigali would not have been achieved with the same ease that the RPF had conquered the north. Fighting for the capital would have been a much more difficult and dangerous operation. Several of Kagame's senior officers urged him to go for outright victory but he overruled them. By the end of the February war over one million civilians, mostly Hutu, had left their homes in the country's largest exodus to date.

The RPF cease-fire was followed by two days of negotiations in the Ugandan capital <a href="Kampala">Kampala</a>, attended by RPF leader Paul Kagame, and involving President Museveni and representatives of European nations. The Europeans insisted that RPF forces withdraw to the zone they had held before the February offensive. Kagame responded that he would only agree to this if the Rwandan army were forbidden from re-entering the newly conquered territory. Following a threat by Kagame to resume fighting and potentially take even more territory, the two sides reached a compromise deal. This entailed the RPF withdrawing to its pre-February territory, but also mandated the setting up of a demilitarised zone between the RPF area and the rest of the country. The deal was significant because it marked a formal concession by Habyarimana's regime of the northern zone to the rebels, recognising the RPF hold on that territory. There were many within the RPF senior command who felt that Kagame had ceded too much, because the deal meant not only withdrawal to the pre-February boundaries, but also a promise not to encroach on the demilitarised zone. This therefore ended RPF ambitions of capturing more territory. Kagame used the authority he had accumulated through his successful leadership of the RPF to override these concerns, and the parties returned once more to the negotiating table in Arusha.

Despite the agreement and ongoing negotiations President Habyarimana, supported by the French Government, spent the subsequent months forging a "common front" against the RPF. This included members of his own party and the CDR and also factions from each of the other opposition parties in the power-sharing coalition. At the same time other members of the same parties issued a statement, in conjunction with the RPF, in which they condemned French involvement in the country and called for the Arusha process to be respected in full. The hardline factions within the parties became known as <a href="Hutu%20Power">Hutu Power</a>, a movement which transcended party politics. Apart from the CDR there was no party that was exclusively part of the Power movement. Instead almost every party was split into "moderate" and "Power" wings, with members of both camps claiming to represent the legitimate leadership of that party. Even the ruling party contained a Power wing, consisting of those who opposed Habyarimana's intention to sign a peace deal. Several radical youth militia groups emerged, attached to the Power wings of the parties; these included the "<a href="Interahamwe">Interahamwe</a>", which was attached to the ruling party, and the CDR's "<a href="Impuzamugambi">Impuzamugambi</a>". The youth militia began actively carrying out massacres across the country. The army trained the militias, sometimes in conjunction with the French, who were unaware of the fact that the training they provided was being used to perpetrate the mass killings.

By June President Habyarimana had come to view Hutu Power, rather than the mainstream opposition, as the biggest threat to his leadership. This led him to change tactics and engage fully with the Arusha peace process, giving it the impetus it needed to draw to a completion. According to Prunier this support was more symbolic than genuine. Habyarimana believed that he could maintain power more easily through a combination of limited concessions to the opposition and RPF than he could if Hutu Power were allowed to disrupt the peace process. The negotiation of troop numbers was protracted and difficult; twice the talks almost collapsed. The Rwandan Government wanted to allocate only 15% of the officer corps to the RPF, reflecting the proportion of Tutsi in the country, while the RPF was arguing for a 50/50 split. The RPF were in a superior position following their successful February campaign and were backed in their demands by Tanzania, which was chairing the talks. The government eventually agreed to their demands. As well as 50% of the officer corps, the RPF was allocated up to 40% of the non-command troops. The deal also mandated large-scale demobilisation; of the 35,000 Rwandan Army and 20,000 RPF soldiers at the time of the accords, only 19,000 would be drafted into the new national army. With all details agreed the <a href="Arusha%20Accords%20%28Rwanda%29">Arusha Accords</a> were finally signed on 4 August 1993 at a formal ceremony attended by President Habyarimana as well as heads of state from neighbouring countries.

An uneasy peace was once again entered into, which would last until 7 April of the following year. The agreement called for a United Nations <a href="peacekeeping">peacekeeping</a> force; this was titled the <a href="United%20Nations%20Assistance%20Mission%20for%20Rwanda">United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda</a> (UNAMIR), and was in place in Rwanda by October 1993 under the command of Canadian General <a href="Rom%C3%A9o%20Dallaire">Roméo Dallaire</a>. Another stipulation of the agreement was that the RPF would station diplomats in Kigali at the "Conseil national de développement" (CND), now known as the <a href="Chamber%20of%20Deputies%20%28Rwanda%29">Chamber of Deputies</a>, Rwanda's Parliament building. These men were protected by 600–1,000 RPF soldiers, who arrived in Kigali through UNAMIR's <a href="Operation%20Clean%20Corridor">Operation Clean Corridor</a> in December 1993. Meanwhile, the Hutu Power wings of the various parties were beginning plans for a genocide. The President of Burundi, <a href="Melchior%20Ndadaye">Melchior Ndadaye</a>, who had been elected in June as the country's first ever Hutu president, was assassinated by extremist Tutsi army officers in October 1993. The assassination reinforced the notion among Hutus that the Tutsi were their enemy and could not be trusted. The CDR and the Power wings of the other parties realised they could use this situation to their advantage. The idea of a "final solution", which had first been suggested in 1992 but had remained a fringe viewpoint, was now top of their agenda.

The cease-fire ended abruptly on 6 April 1994 when President Habyarimana's plane <a href="Assassination%20of%20Juv%C3%A9nal%20Habyarimana%20and%20Cyprien%20Ntaryamira">was shot down</a> near <a href="Kigali%20Airport">Kigali Airport</a>, killing both Habyarimana and the new <a href="List%20of%20Presidents%20of%20Burundi">President of Burundi</a>, <a href="Cyprien%20Ntaryamira">Cyprien Ntaryamira</a>. The pair were returning home from a regional summit in <a href="Dar%20es%20Salaam">Dar es Salaam</a> at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania, had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying the implementation of the Arusha accords. The attackers remain unknown. Prunier, in his book written shortly after the incident, concluded that it was most likely a coup carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge <a href="Jean-Louis%20Brugui%C3%A8re">Jean-Louis Bruguière</a> and in 2008 by Spanish judge <a href="Fernando%20Andreu">Fernando Andreu</a>. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible. At the end of 2010 the French Government ordered a more thorough judicial inquiry, which employed ballistics experts. This report reaffirmed the initial theory that Hutu extremists assassinated Habyarimana.

The shooting down of the plane served as the catalyst for the <a href="Rwandan%20genocide">Rwandan genocide</a>, which began within a few hours. A crisis committee was formed by the military, headed by Colonel Théoneste Bagosora, which refused to recognise Prime Minister <a href="Agathe%20Uwilingiyimana">Agathe Uwilingiyimana</a> as leader, even though she was legally next in the line of political succession. UN commander General Dallaire labelled this a coup and insisted that Uwilingiyimana be placed in charge, but Bagosora refused. The Presidential Guard killed Uwilingiyimana and her husband during the night, along with ten Belgian soldiers charged with her protection and other prominent moderate politicians and journalists. The crisis committee appointed an interim government, still effectively controlled by Bagosora, which began ordering the systematic killing of huge numbers of Tutsi, as well as some politically moderate Hutu, through well-planned attacks. Over the course of approximately 100 days between 500,000 and 1,000,000 were killed.

On 7 April, as the genocide started, RPF commander Paul Kagame warned the interim government and the United Nations peacekeepers that he would resume the civil war if the killing did not stop. The next day Rwandan Army forces attacked the national parliament building from several directions but RPF troops stationed there successfully fought back. The RPF then crossed the demilitarised zone from their territory in the north and began an attack on three fronts, leaving their opponents unsure of their true intentions or whether an assault on Kigali was imminent. Kagame refused to talk to the interim government, believing that it was just a cover for Bagosora's rule and not committed to ending the genocide. Over the next few days the RPF moved steadily south through the eastern part of the country, capturing Gabiro and large areas of the countryside to the north and east of Kigali. Their unit stationed in Kigali was isolated from the rest of their forces but a unit of young soldiers successfully crossed government-held territory to link up with them. They avoided attacking Kigali or Byumba at this stage but conducted manoeuvres designed to encircle the cities and cut off supply routes. The RPF also allowed Tutsi refugees from Uganda to settle behind the front line in the RPF controlled areas.

In April there were numerous attempts by the United Nations forces to establish a cease-fire, but Kagame insisted each time that the RPF would not stop fighting unless the killings stopped. In late April the RPF secured the whole of the Tanzanian border area and began to move west from Kibungo, to the south of Kigali. They encountered little resistance except around Kigali and Ruhengeri. By 16 May they had cut the road between Kigali and <a href="Gitarama">Gitarama</a>, the temporary home of the interim government, and by 13 June had taken Gitarama itself. The taking of Gitarama followed an unsuccessful attempt by the Rwandan Army forces to reopen the road. The interim government was forced to relocate to Gisenyi in the far north-west. As well as fighting the war Kagame recruited heavily at this time to expand the RPF. The new recruits included Tutsi survivors of the genocide and Rwandan Tutsi refugees who had been living in Burundi, but they were less well trained and disciplined than the earlier recruits.

In late June 1994 France launched "<a href="Op%C3%A9ration%20Turquoise">Opération Turquoise</a>", a UN-mandated mission to create safe humanitarian areas for <a href="displaced%20person">displaced person</a>s, <a href="refugee">refugee</a>s, and civilians in danger. From bases in the Zairian cities of <a href="Goma">Goma</a> and <a href="Bukavu">Bukavu</a>, the French entered south-western Rwanda and established the "Turquoise" zone, within the <a href="Cyangugu">Cyangugu</a>–Kibuye–<a href="Gikongoro">Gikongoro</a> triangle, an area occupying approximately a fifth of Rwanda. Radio France International estimates that "Turquoise" saved around 15,000 lives, but with the genocide coming to an end and the RPF's ascendancy, many Rwandans interpreted "Turquoise" as a mission to protect Hutu from the RPF, including some who had participated in the genocide. The French remained hostile to the RPF and their presence held up the RPF's advance in the south-west of the country. "Opération Turquoise" remained in Rwanda until 21 August 1994.

Having completed the encirclement of Kigali, the RPF spent the latter half of June fighting for the capital. The Rwandan Army forces had superior manpower and weapons, but the RPF steadily gained territory and conducted raids to rescue civilians from behind enemy lines. According to Dallaire, this success was due to Kagame's being a "master of psychological warfare"; he exploited the fact that the Rwandan Army were concentrating on the genocide rather than the fight for Kigali and exploited the government's loss of morale as it lost territory. The RPF finally defeated the Rwandan Army in Kigali on 4 July and on 18 July took Gisenyi and the rest of the north-west, forcing the interim government into Zaire. This RPF victory ended the genocide as well as the civil war. At the end of July 1994 Kagame's forces held the whole of Rwanda except for the "Turquoise" zone in the south-west. The date of the fall of Kigali, 4 July, was later designated <a href="Liberation%20Day">Liberation Day</a> by the RPF and is commemorated as <a href="Public%20holidays%20in%20Rwanda">a public holiday in Rwanda</a>.

The UN peacekeeping force, UNAMIR, was in Rwanda during the genocide, but its <a href="Chapter%20VI%20of%20the%20United%20Nations%20Charter">Chapter VI mandate</a> rendered it powerless to intervene militarily. Efforts by General Dallaire to broker peace were unsuccessful, and most of UNAMIR's Rwandan staff were killed in the early days of the genocide, severely limiting its ability to operate. Its most significant contribution was to provide refuge for thousands of Tutsi and moderate Hutu at its headquarters in <a href="Amahoro%20Stadium">Amahoro Stadium</a>, as well as other secure UN sites, and to assist with the evacuation of foreign nationals. The Belgian Government, which had been one of the largest troop contributors to UNAMIR, pulled out in mid-April following the deaths of its ten soldiers protecting Prime Minister Uwilingiliyimana. In mid-May the UN conceded that "acts of genocide may have been committed", and agreed to reinforcement. The new soldiers started arriving in June, and following the end of the genocide in July they stayed to maintain security and stability, until the termination of their mission in 1996. Fifteen UN soldiers were killed in Rwanda between April and July 1994, including the ten Belgians, three Ghanaians, an Uruguayan, and Senegalese <a href="Mbaye%20Diagne">Mbaye Diagne</a> who risked his life repeatedly to save Rwandans.

The victorious RPF assumed control of Rwanda following the genocide, and as of 2019 remain the dominant political force in the country. They formed a government loosely based on the Arusha Accords, but when Habyarimana's party was outlawed, the RPF took over the government positions allocated to it in the accords. The military wing of the RPF was renamed as the <a href="Rwandan%20Patriotic%20Army">Rwandan Patriotic Army</a> (RPA) and became the national army. Paul Kagame assumed the dual roles of <a href="Vice%20President%20of%20Rwanda">Vice-President of Rwanda</a> and <a href="Minister%20of%20Defence%20%28Rwanda%29">Minister of Defence</a>; <a href="Pasteur%20Bizimungu">Pasteur Bizimungu</a>, a Hutu who had been a civil servant under Habyarimana before fleeing to join the RPF, was appointed president. Bizimungu and his cabinet had some control over domestic affairs but Kagame remained commander-in-chief of the army and "de facto" ruler of the country.

Rwandan's infrastructure and economy suffered greatly during the genocide. Many buildings were uninhabitable and the former regime had taken all currency and moveable assets when they fled the country. Human resources were severely depleted, with over of the population having fled or been killed. Many of the remainder were traumatised: most had lost relatives, witnessed killings, or participated in the genocide. The long-term effects of <a href="Rape%20during%20the%20Rwandan%20genocide">war rape</a> included social isolation, <a href="sexually%20transmitted%20diseases">sexually transmitted diseases</a> and unwanted pregnancies and babies, some women resorting to <a href="self-induced%20abortion">self-induced abortion</a>s. The army, led by Paul Kagame, maintained law and order while the government began the work of rebuilding the country's institutions and infrastructure.

<a href="Non-governmental%20organisation">Non-governmental organisation</a>s began to move back into the country but the international community did not provide significant assistance to the new regime. Most <a href="Aid">international aid</a> was routed to the refugee camps which had formed in Zaire following the exodus of Hutu from Rwanda. Kagame strove to portray the government as inclusive and not Tutsi-dominated. He directed removal of ethnicity from citizens' national identity cards and the government began a policy of downplaying the distinctions between Hutu, Tutsi, and Twa.

During the genocide and in the months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting the genocide. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda, who had lost family or friends and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. <a href="Human%20Rights%20Watch">Human Rights Watch</a>, as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings. In an interview with Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The killings gained international attention after the 1995 <a href="Kibeho%20massacre">Kibeho massacre</a>, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in <a href="Butare%20Province">Butare Province</a>. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed; the Rwandan Government claimed that the death toll was 338.

Paul Kagame took over the presidency from Pasteur Bizimungu in 2000 and began a large-scale national development drive, launching <a href="Vision%202020%20%28Rwanda%29">a programme</a> to develop Rwanda as a <a href="middle%20income%20country">middle income country</a> by 2020. The country began developing strongly on key indicators, including the <a href="human%20development%20index">human development index</a>, health care, and education. Annual growth between 2004 and 2010 averaged per year, the poverty rate reduced from 57% to 45% between 2006 and 2011, and <a href="life%20expectancy">life expectancy</a> rose from 46.6 years in 2000 to 64.3 years in 2018. A period of reconciliation began as well as the establishment of courts for trying genocide suspects. These included the <a href="International%20Criminal%20Tribunal%20for%20Rwanda">International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda</a> (ICTR) and "<a href="Gacaca">Gacaca</a>", a traditional village court system reintroduced to handle the large caseloads involved.

Following the RPF victory, approximately two million Hutu fled to refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Zaire, fearing RPF reprisals for the Rwandan genocide. The camps were crowded and squalid and tens of thousands of refugees died in disease epidemics, including <a href="cholera">cholera</a> and <a href="dysentery">dysentery</a>. They were set up by the <a href="United%20Nations%20High%20Commissioner%20for%20Refugees">United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees</a> (UNHCR) but were effectively controlled by the army and government of the former Hutu regime, including many leaders of the genocide, who began to rearm in a bid to return to power in Rwanda.

By late 1996, Hutu militants from the camps were launching regular cross-border incursions and the RPF-led Rwandan Government launched a counter-offensive. Rwanda provided troops and military training to the <a href="Banyamulenge">Banyamulenge</a>, a Tutsi group in the Zairian <a href="South%20Kivu">South Kivu</a> province, helping them to defeat Zairian security forces. Rwandan forces, the Banyamulenge, and other Zairian Tutsi, then attacked the refugee camps, targeting the Hutu militia. These attacks caused hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee; many returned to Rwanda despite the presence of the RPF, while others ventured further west into Zaire. The refugees fleeing further into Zaire were relentlessly pursued by the RPA under the cover of the <a href="Alliance%20of%20Democratic%20Forces%20for%20the%20Liberation%20of%20Congo">AFDL</a> rebellion, killing an estimated 232,000 people. The defeated forces of the former regime continued a cross-border insurgency campaign, supported initially by the predominantly Hutu population of Rwanda's north-western provinces. By 1999 a programme of propaganda and Hutu integration into the <a href="Rwandan%20Defence%20Forces">national army</a> succeeded in bringing the Hutu to the government side and the insurgency was defeated.

As well as dismantling the refugee camps, Kagame began planning a war to remove Mobutu. Mobutu had supported the "genocidaires" based in the camps and was also accused of allowing attacks on Tutsi people within Zaire. The Rwandan and Ugandan governments supported an alliance of four rebel groups headed by <a href="Laurent-D%C3%A9sir%C3%A9%20Kabila">Laurent-Désiré Kabila</a>, which began waging the <a href="First%20Congo%20War">First Congo War</a>. The rebels quickly took control of North and South Kivu provinces and then advanced west, gaining territory from the poorly organised and demotivated Zairian army with little fighting. They controlled the whole country by May 1997. Mobutu fled into exile and the country was renamed <a href="Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%20Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a> (DRC). Rwanda fell out with the new Congolese regime in 1998 and Kagame supported a fresh rebellion, leading to the <a href="Second%20Congo%20War">Second Congo War</a>. This lasted until 2003 and caused millions of deaths and severe damage. A 2010 United Nations report accused the Rwandan Army of wide-scale human rights violations and crimes against humanity during the two Congo wars, charges denied by the Rwandan Government.

In 2015 the Rwandan government paid reparations to Uganda for damage inflicted during the civil war to border regions.

Shoe polish

Shoe polish (or boot polish) is a waxy <a href="paste%20%28rheology%29">paste</a>, <a href="cream%20%28pharmaceutical%29">cream</a>, or liquid used to polish, <a href="polishing">shine</a>, and <a href="waterproofing">waterproof</a> <a href="leather">leather</a> <a href="shoe">shoe</a>s or <a href="boot">boot</a>s to extend the <a href="footwear">footwear</a>'s life, and restore, maintain and improve their appearance.

Shoe polish can be classified into three types: wax, cream-emulsion, and liquid. Each differs in detailed composition but all consist of a mixture of waxes, solvent, and dyes. 

Waxes, organic solvents, and dyes compose this type of polish. Waxes are 20–40% of the material. Natural waxes include <a href="carnauba">carnauba</a> and <a href="montan">montan</a> as well as synthetic waxes. The composition is determined by a balance of hardness and polishing properties after solvent has evaporated. Solvents are selected to match the waxes. About 70% of shoe polish is solvent. A variety of solvents are used including <a href="naphtha">naphtha</a>. <a href="Turpentine">Turpentine</a>, although more expensive, is favored for its "shoe polish odor". Dyes make up the final 2–3% of the polish. A traditional dye is <a href="nigrosine">nigrosine</a>, but other dyes (including <a href="azo%20dye">azo dye</a>s) and pigments are used for oxblood, cordovan, and brown polishes. 

Owing to its high content of volatile solvents, wax-based shoe polish hardens after application, while retaining its gloss. Poorly blended polishes are known to suffer from <a href="bloom%20%28phase%29">blooming</a>, evidenced by the appearance of a white coating of <a href="stearin">stearin</a> on the polish surface.

These polishes may have a gelatinous consistency. They are composed of the usual three components waxes, liquid vehicle, and dyes. Unlike wax-based shoe polishes, cream-emulsions contain water and/or oil plus a solvent (either naphtha, turpentine or Stoddard Solution), so the liquid content is high. Emulsifiers and surfactants are required. These include ammonia, <a href="morpholine">morpholine</a> and various ethoxylated surfactants such as <a href="polysorbate%2080">polysorbate 80</a>. The waxes are often some mixture of <a href="carnauba%20wax">carnauba wax</a>, <a href="beeswax">beeswax</a>, <a href="montan%20wax">montan wax</a> and its oxidized derivatives, and paraffin waxes.

Liquid shoe polish is sold in a squeezable <a href="plastic%20bottle">plastic bottle</a>, with a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content. Liquid shoe polish is a complex mixture. Polyethylene wax emulsion is a major component. Various polymers, typically acrylates, are the next major component, conferring gloss and holding the dyes in suspension. Resins and <a href="casein">casein</a> are selected to ensure adhesion to the leather. Fatty phosphate esters, emulsifiers, and glycols are also used. Pigments include <a href="titanium%20dioxide">titanium dioxide</a> for whites and iron oxides for browns. Although liquid polish can put a fast shine on shoes, many experts warn against its long-term use because it can cause the leather to dry out and crack.

The process for producing shoe polish is straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around <a href="USD">$</a>600,000 (as of 2005).

Shoe polish is manufactured in large thermostated, stirred reactors. Steps are taken to ensure that volatile solvents do not evaporate. Typically, low-melting paraffin wax is melted, followed by the higher melting waxes, and finally the colorant-stearate mixture. The molten mass is added to warm solvent before being dispensed. Wax-based shoe polish is traditionally packaged in flat, round, 60-gram (2-ounce) <a href="Tin%20can">tins</a>, usually with an easy-open facility. The traditional flat, round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes. When dried due to solvent loss or other reasons, the hardened wax pulls away from the walls of the container giving what is known as a "rattler".

From medieval times, <a href="dubbin">dubbin</a>, a waxy product, was used to soften and waterproof leather; but it did not impart shine. It was made from natural <a href="wax">wax</a>, <a href="oil">oil</a>, <a href="soda%20ash">soda ash</a> and <a href="tallow">tallow</a>. As leather with a high natural veneer became popular in the 18th century, a high glossy finish became important, particularly on shoes and boots. In most cases, homemade polishes were used to provide this finish, often with <a href="lanolin">lanolin</a> or <a href="beeswax">beeswax</a> as a base.

In the late 18th and early 19th century many forms of shoe polish became available, yet were rarely referred to as "shoe polish" or "boot polish". Instead, they were often called "blacking", especially when mixed with <a href="lampblack">lampblack</a>, or still were referred to as dubbin. Tallow, an animal by-product, was used to manufacture a simple form of shoe polish at this time. <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a>, where 82% of the processed meat consumed in the United States was processed in the <a href="Union%20Stock%20Yards">stock yards</a>, became a major shoe polish producing area.

In <a href="London">London</a> the Warren brothers, Thomas and Jonathan, started making blacking around 1795–98, initially in partnership and then with competing companies. Jonathan Warren's Blacking company is noted as the first employer of the young <a href="Charles%20Dickens">Charles Dickens</a> aged 12 in 1823. The competitor to the Warren companies in London is the <a href="Charles%20Day%20%28boot%20blacking%20manufacturer%29">Day</a> & Martin company formed in 1801.

Details of the operation of Day & Martin in 1842 reveal that the blacking they produced was in two forms, bottled liquid, and a thick paste which was available in either small wide-mouthed stone tubs, slabs wrapped in oiled paper, or in "circular tin-boxes, about three inches in diameter, and half or three-quarters of an inch thick". Tinned blacking paste was at this time exclusively for army use. The text states, "Yet, as the soldier’s boots or shoes must to some extent emulate the brightness and glitter of the boots of those who pay for battles instead of fighting them, a portable blacking apparatus is provided." This confirms the tins as polish rather than dubbin.

In 1832, James S. Mason of Philadelphia began the commercial production of shoe blacking and inks. In 1851, James S. Mason & Co. constructed a building at 138/140 Front St. where ultimately ten million boxes were produced annually, to hold tins of blacking produced by two hundred employees. Later, tins of blacking were labeled as Mason Shoe Polish. This business ceased operation in 1919 and the building was razed in 1973.

Other early leather preserving products included the Irish brand "Punch", which was first made in 1851. In 1889, an English man by the name of William Edward Wren, started making shoe polishes and <a href="dubbin">dubbin</a> under the brand name <a href="Wren%27s%20%28shoe%20polish%29">Wren's</a>. In just 3 years, he won the “First in the Field – First Award Leather Trades Exhibition 1892″ award which was awarded by the Leather Trades Exhibition held in Northampton, the centre of Britain’s boot making industry. This signified the importance and prestige of the exhibition in the trade and was a recognition of <a href="Wren%27s%20Super%20Wax%20Shoe%20Polish">Wren's</a> quality. In 1890 the Kroner Brothers established EOS, a shoe polish factory in Berlin, which serviced the Prussian military. It finally closed in 1934 when the Nazis forbade Jews to operate a business. The German brand, <a href="Werner%20%26amp%3B%20Mertz%23Brands">Erdal</a>, went on sale in 1901.

Prior to 1906, shoe polish was not well known as a purchasable product, nor was it particularly sophisticated. While sales were not especially high, a few brands, like "Nugget", were available in the UK during the 19th century. The practice of shining people’s shoes gradually caught on and soon many <a href="shoeshiner">shoeshine boys</a> in city streets were offering shoe shines using a basic form of shoe polish along with a polishing cloth.

The first shoe polish to resemble the modern varieties (aimed primarily at inducing shine) were the British and British Commonwealth brands like Cherry Blossom, <a href="Kiwi%20%28shoe%20polish%29">Kiwi</a>, and <a href="Wren%27s%20%28shoe%20polish%29">Wren's</a>. An advertisement published in March 1947 by <a href="Wren%27s%20%28shoe%20polish%29">Wren's</a> claimed that William Wren originated the first wax polish in 1889. As the advertisement was endorsed with the Royal Warrant, its claim would be deemed creditable. However, the most well known brand was <a href="Kiwi%20%28shoe%20polish%29">Kiwi</a>; Scottish <a href="expatriate">expatriate</a>s William Ramsay and Hamilton McKellan began making "boot polish" in a small factory in 1904 in <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a>, Australia. Their formula was a major improvement on previous brands. It preserved shoe leather, made it shine, and restored colour. By the time Kiwi Dark Tan was released in 1908, it incorporated agents that added suppleness and water resistance. Black and a range of colors became available, and exports to Britain, continental Europe, and New Zealand began, although the polish is now made in the Far East. Previously owned by the <a href="Sara%20Lee%20Corporation">Sara Lee Corporation</a> since 1984, Kiwi was sold in 2011 to <a href="SC%20Johnson">SC Johnson</a>.

Ramsay named the shoe polish after the <a href="kiwi">kiwi</a>, the <a href="national%20bird">national bird</a> of <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a>; Ramsay's wife, Annie Elizabeth Meek Ramsay, was a native of <a href="Oamaru">Oamaru</a>, New Zealand. It has been suggested that, at a time when several symbols were weakly associated with New Zealand, the eventual spread of Kiwi shoe polish around the world enhanced the kiwi's popular appeal and promoted it at the expense of the others.

A rival brand in the early years was "Cobra Boot Polish", based in <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. Cobra was noted for a series of cartoon advertisements in "<a href="The%20Bulletin%20%28Australian%20periodical%29">The Sydney Bulletin</a>", starting in 1909, using a character called "Chunder Loo of Akim Foo." "Chunder" is Australian <a href="slang">slang</a> for <a href="vomiting">vomit</a>, and possibly originated through the <a href="rhyming%20slang">rhyming slang</a> of "Chunder Loo" and spew (another <a href="slang">slang</a> word for vomit).

At the end of the 19th century, leather shoes and boots became affordable to the masses, and with the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the demand for large numbers of polished army boots led to a need in the <a href="marketing">market</a> for a product that would allow boots to be polished quickly, efficiently and easily. The polish was also used to shine leather <a href="belt%20%28clothing%29">belts</a>, handgun <a href="holster">holster</a>s, and <a href="horse%20tack">horse tack</a>. This demand led to a rapid increase in the sales of shoe and boot polish. The popularity of Kiwi shoe polish spread throughout the <a href="Commonwealth%20of%20Nations">British Commonwealth</a> and the United States. Rival brands began to emerge, including "<a href="Shinola%20%28shoe%20polish%29">Shinola</a>" and "Cavalier" (United States), "Cherry Blossom" (United Kingdom), "Parwa" (India), "Jean Bart" (France), and many others. Advertising became more prominent; many shoe polish brands used fictional figures or historical characters to spread awareness of their products. In the German documentary of 1927 "", a scene focuses on shoe shining with a polish called Nigrin sporting the face of a black person.
Shoe manufacturing improvements in the mid-19th century allowed for factories to produce large numbers of shoes made of leather, and later synthetic materials. This increase in leather shoe production continued well into the 20th century and led to a surge in the number of retail shoe stores in the industrialized world, and subsequently a call for shoe polish by footwear consumers.

Shoe polish was to be found just about everywhere <a href="Allies%20of%20World%20War%20II">Allied</a> troops ventured. American <a href="war%20correspondent">war correspondent</a> Walter Graeber wrote for "<a href="Time%20%28magazine%29">TIME</a>" magazine from the <a href="Tobruk">Tobruk</a> trenches in 1942 that "old tins of British-made Kiwi polish lay side by side with empty bottles of Chianti." A story indicative of the rise in global significance of shoe polish is told by Jean (Gertrude) Williams, a New Zealander who lived in Japan during the Allied occupation straight after World War II. American soldiers were then finding the dullness of their boots and shoes to be a handicap when trying to win the affections of Japanese women. U.S. military footwear of the time was produced in brown leather with the rough side out.

When the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces arrived in Japan—all with boots polished to a degree not known in the U.S. forces—the <a href="GI%20%28term%29">G.I.s</a> were more conscious than ever of their feet. The secret was found to rest not only in spit and polish, but in the superior Australian boot polish, a commodity which was soon exchanged with the Americans on a fluctuating basis of so many packets of cigarettes for one can of Kiwi boot polish.

Soldiers returning from the war continued to use the product, leading to a further surge in its popularity. While Kiwi shoe polish was what business historian <a href="Alfred%20D.%20Chandler%2C%20Jr.">Alfred D. Chandler, Jr.</a> would call a "first mover", Kiwi did not open a manufacturing plant in the US until after World War II. Prior to this, Cavalier Shoe Polish, founded by James Lobell, had operated in the US since 1913. The sales paradigm of Cavalier polish was to have footwear professionals sell Cavalier's high-end shoe polish to the shoe-buying public. A few years after World War II, Kiwi opened a manufacturing plant in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, making only black, brown, and neutral shoe polish in tins. Kiwi purchased Cavalier in 1961, and continued to manufacture products under the name until the year 2000.

Shoe polish products are low-value items that are infrequently purchased, as a single can might last several months for even the most frequent user. Consumer demand is <a href="Elasticity%20%28economics%29">inelastic</a> and largely insensitive to price change, while sales volumes are generally low. In the shoe polish market as a whole, some 26% of turnover is accounted for by pastes, 24% by creams, 23% by aerosols, and 13% by liquids. In recent years, the demand for shoe polish products has either been static or declined; one reason is the gradual replacement of formal footwear with <a href="Sneaker%20%28footwear%29">sneakers</a> for everyday use.

There are numerous branded products available, as well as generic <a href="store%20brand">store brand</a>s. There are two chief areas of shoe polish sales: to the general public, and to specialists and trade, such as shoe repairers, and <a href="Shoemaking">cobblers</a>. The sales percentages between the two outlets are roughly comparable. The best selling, low-cost brands are produced by these companies: Kiwi, Tana, and Johnson, and Reckitt & Colman. Approximately 60 million units are sold annually. Other leading brands include Kelly's, <a href="Shinola%20%28brand%29">Shinola</a>, Lincoln Shoe Polish, Meltonian, Angelus, Woly, Salamander, Collonil and Cherry Blossom. 

Kiwi was acquired by the American company <a href="Sara%20Lee%20%28corporation%29">Sara Lee</a> following its purchase of Reckitt and Colman in 1991 and Knomark with its brand <a href="Esquire%20Shoe%20Polish">Esquire Shoe Polish</a> in 1987. The <a href="Federal%20Trade%20Commission">Federal Trade Commission</a> ruled that Sara Lee had to divest its ownership of these companies in 1994 to prevent it from becoming a <a href="monopoly">monopoly</a>. Since this ruling, Sara Lee has been prevented from acquiring any further assets or firms associated with chemical shoe care products in the United States without prior approval. The <a href="Competition%20Commission">Competition Commission</a> in the United Kingdom investigated the potential monopoly of Sara Lee in the shoe care industry. 

In recent years, there has been a rise in popularity of high-end shoe polishes, such as Saphir made by Avel and Boot Black made by Columbus.

Shoe polish is applied to the shoe using a <a href="Textile">rag</a>, <a href="cloth">cloth</a>, <a href="brush">brush</a>, or with bare fingers. Shoe polish is not a cleaning product: it is suited for clean and dry shoes. A vigorous rubbing action to apply the polish evenly on the boot, followed by further buffing with a clean dry cloth or brush, usually provides good results. Another technique, known as "spit-polishing" or <a href="bull%20polishing">bull polishing</a>, involves gently rubbing polish into the leather with a cloth and a drop of water or <a href="Saliva">spit</a>. This action achieves the mirror-like, high-gloss finish sometimes known as a "spit shine" or "bull" which is especially valued in military organizations. Despite the term, saliva is less commonly used as the vehicle or diluent with polish than is water. Polishes containing <a href="carnauba%20wax">carnauba wax</a> can be used as a protective coating to extend the life and look of a leather shoe.

Shoe polish may be purchased pre-soaked into a hard sponge, which can be used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an "applicator". 

Many products are closely related to shoe polish, but not strictly considered as such. Other chemical products may be used to clean and shine shoes—in particular whiteners for white shoes, and a variety of sprays and <a href="aerosol%20spray">aerosols</a> for cleaning and waterproofing <a href="suede">suede</a> shoes. A banana peel can also be used to effectively shine shoes, but it is not recommended.

Although shoe polish is primarily intended for leather shoes, some brands specify that it may be used on non-porous materials, such as <a href="Polyvinyl%20chloride">vinyl</a>. The polish is generally the same colour as the shoes it will be used upon, or it may be "neutral", lacking any intrinsic colour.

Shoe polish is such a niche market that its environmental impact is negligible. Solvent evaporation is one issue. Dyes and pigments with "severe carcinogenic profiles" have been removed from most formulations.

DJ AM

Adam Michael Goldstein (March 30, 1973 – August 28, 2009), known professionally as DJ AM, was an American <a href="disc%20jockey">disc jockey</a> (DJ). Born in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, Goldstein became interested in <a href="Disc%20jockey">deejaying</a> as a child after watching <a href="Herbie%20Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a> perform his 1983 single "<a href="Rockit%20%28song%29">Rockit</a>". Goldstein developed a drug addiction as a teenager and was sent to the controversial rehabilitation center <a href="Straight%2C%20Incorporated">Straight, Incorporated</a>. After he left the center, his drug problems became worse; he was addicted to <a href="crack%20cocaine">crack cocaine</a> for several years in his early twenties. After he attempted suicide in 1997, Goldstein became sober and later <a href="Twelve-step%20program%23Sponsorship">sponsored</a> other addicts through <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a>.

Goldstein began deejaying in clubs in Los Angeles and joined the band <a href="Crazy%20Town">Crazy Town</a> in 1999. He left the group in 2001 and focused on a career as a solo DJ. After he began dating <a href="Nicole%20Richie">Nicole Richie</a> in 2003, his career skyrocketed. In 2006, he accepted a $1 million contract to perform weekly at <a href="Caesars%20Palace">Caesars Palace</a> on the Las Vegas strip and was also charging upwards of $10,000 for private events. In 2008 Goldstein and <a href="Travis%20Barker">Travis Barker</a> formed the duo <a href="TRV%24DJAM">TRV$DJAM</a>. Barker and Goldstein were the only two survivors of the <a href="2008%20South%20Carolina%20Learjet%2060%20crash">2008 South Carolina Learjet 60 crash</a>, which killed the other four people on board.

Goldstein appeared as himself in several television series, contributed mixes to and portrayed a playable character in the video game "<a href="DJ%20Hero">DJ Hero</a>", and filmed a cameo appearance for "<a href="Iron%20Man%202">Iron Man 2</a>". Goldstein hosted the 2009 <a href="MTV">MTV</a> drug intervention series "<a href="Gone%20Too%20Far%20%28TV%20series%29">Gone Too Far</a>", and he appeared to be struggling with his addiction during filming. On August 28, 2009, he was found dead in his New York City apartment from a drug overdose. The DJ AM Memorial Fund, an organization designed to help people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory by his sister, and "Iron Man 2", which was released in 2010, was dedicated to him.

Adam Michael Goldstein was born on March 30, 1973, in <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. His parents, Andrea and Herbert – both of whom were Jewish – had been unable to conceive children naturally, and they had adopted Goldstein's older sister Lara a year before his birth. Goldstein's mother left her husband temporarily after she caught him having <a href="extramarital%20sex">extramarital sex</a> with <a href="Sex%20between%20men">another man</a>. During this time she had an affair herself, and she found out she was pregnant with Adam after returning to her husband. While heavily pregnant, she discovered her husband had been <a href="Adultery">adulterous</a> a second time, and then she angrily disclosed to him that he was not the biological father of her baby.

Goldstein stated that his father had verbally abused him. As an adult, he realized that this was likely due to resentment that Goldstein was not his biological son. Goldstein witnessed his father openly using <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a> and <a href="marijuana">marijuana</a> throughout his childhood. Goldstein said he began overeating as a way of dealing with anger and depression, becoming <a href="obese">obese</a> by the age of 10. He also began experimenting with alcohol when he was 11.

After watching <a href="Herbie%20Hancock">Herbie Hancock</a> perform "<a href="Rockit%20%28song%29">Rockit</a>" with <a href="Grand%20Mixer%20DXT">Grand Mixer DXT</a> at the <a href="26th%20Annual%20Grammy%20Awards">26th Annual Grammy Awards</a> in 1984, Goldstein became obsessed with deejaying, and realized that it was what he wanted to do for a career. He attended the <a href="Quakers">Quaker</a> school <a href="Friends%27%20Central">Friends' Central</a>. When he was 14, Herbert was incarcerated for committing bank fraud, and his mother subsequently moved to Los Angeles with Goldstein and his sister.

In Los Angeles, Goldstein associated with a crowd of heavy drug users. At 16, he approached his mother and asked for help with his drug problems. She arranged for him to attend <a href="Straight%2C%20Incorporated">Straight, Incorporated</a>, a drug rehabilitation center that was later revealed to abuse patients. Goldstein disclosed that he was physically assaulted and spat on by staff while there. At one point, he escaped from the facility, but was arrested and brought back after being recognized at <a href="Knott%27s%20Berry%20Farm">Knott's Berry Farm</a>. While he was in rehab, his mother visited him and disclosed that Herbert was not his biological father, was <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a>, and was dying from <a href="HIV/AIDS">HIV/AIDS</a>. Goldstein said that after he received this news he "exploded," attacking one of his counselors. He was eventually indicted and dismissed from rehab for his treatment of younger patients shortly before his 18th birthday. Herbert died the following year.

After leaving rehab, Goldstein began attending <a href="rave">rave</a>s and experimenting with <a href="MDMA">MDMA</a> and <a href="nitrous%20oxide">nitrous oxide</a>. He also started deejaying; he broke into a friend's home while he was away for the weekend to practice on his <a href="Turntablism">turntables</a> and eventually went on to practice freestyle deejaying every day for a whole summer. Goldstein started using <a href="crack%20cocaine">crack cocaine</a> by the age of 20. He said that taking the drug and deejaying were "about all he did" for the next four years of his life. He would often disappear from friends and family for days at a time. In 1997, he attempted suicide; the gun jammed in his mouth as he pulled the trigger. Shortly afterwards, a friend encouraged Goldstein to become sober. He began attending <a href="Alcoholics%20Anonymous">Alcoholics Anonymous</a> (AA) meetings, avoided his friends who still took drugs, and dedicated himself to working as a DJ. Goldstein relapsed after 90 days, but subsequently restarted and completed the program. People who complete the AA program are encouraged to <a href="Twelve-step%20program%23Sponsorship">sponsor</a> other addicts through the recovery process; Goldstein became a sponsor for several people.

Goldstein's stage name, "DJ AM", stands for his first and middle names, Adam Michael. After playing for his friends and at private parties for some time, Goldstein got his first paying job as a DJ at an unlicensed club in Los Angeles at the age of 21, where he earned $40 and a six-pack of beer for a night's work. He worked there for two years. A visiting <a href="Promoter%20%28entertainment%29">promoter</a>, impressed with Goldstein's performance, offered him a deejaying job at the Hollywood club The Dragonfly. Goldstein met <a href="Shifty%20Shellshock">Shifty Shellshock</a> through the nightclub scene, and he was asked to join the rap/rock group <a href="Crazy%20Town">Crazy Town</a> in 1999. He contributed to their 2000 hit "<a href="Butterfly%20%28Crazy%20Town%20song%29">Butterfly</a>", which reached number one in several countries. According to bandmates Shellshock and <a href="Epic%20Mazur">Epic Mazur</a>, Goldstein was the group's only sober member. He quit in 2001 to escape the drug-related dysfunction plaguing the group.

Goldstein's weight problems became progressively worse, despite years of dieting; in 2003, he weighed and underwent <a href="gastric%20bypass%20surgery">gastric bypass surgery</a>. The surgery was effective, and he lost more than within a year. After he began dating actress <a href="Nicole%20Richie">Nicole Richie</a> in 2003, Goldstein's DJ career skyrocketed. "<a href="Us%20Weekly">Us Weekly</a>" editor <a href="Janice%20Min">Janice Min</a> said that he was talented, but that the thing that set him apart from other deejays was that he dated Richie.

As a result of the relationship, Goldstein appeared in a 2005 episode of "<a href="Punk%27d">Punk'd</a>", where Richie was the subject of a practical joke, and that same year he featured in an episode of "<a href="The%20Simple%20Life">The Simple Life</a>", a reality TV show focusing on Richie and <a href="Paris%20Hilton">Paris Hilton</a>. Goldstein and Richie announced their engagement in February 2005, but broke up in late 2006. Goldstein was a guest DJ on an episode of "<a href="The%20Ellen%20DeGeneres%20Show">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a>" in May 2006. He was an avid <a href="sneakerhead">sneakerhead</a>, owning more than 1,000 pairs of sneakers by 2007. This led to him being offered a <a href="Cameo%20appearance">cameo</a> as himself purchasing a pair in the 2006 TV series "<a href="Entourage%20%28U.S.%20TV%20series%29">Entourage</a>" episode "<a href="What%20About%20Bob%3F%20%28Entourage%29">What About Bob?</a>". That same year, Goldstein also began working at <a href="Caesars%20Palace">Caesars Palace</a>, becoming the resident DJ of their nightclub Pure. He was contracted to the club for the year for $1 million, which was considered to be an unprecedented amount for a DJ at the time. By 2007, he was also being paid between $10,000 and $25,000 per event as a solo DJ. Goldstein <a href="Scratching">scratched</a> on albums for <a href="Papa%20Roach">Papa Roach</a>, <a href="Will%20Smith">Will Smith</a> and <a href="Babyface%20%28musician%29">Babyface</a>. He played at private events for celebrities including <a href="Jennifer%20Lopez">Jennifer Lopez</a>, <a href="Ben%20Stiller">Ben Stiller</a> and <a href="Leonardo%20DiCaprio">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. Goldstein dated singer <a href="Mandy%20Moore">Mandy Moore</a> for two months in 2007 and remained close friends with her after separating. Later in 2007, he was romantically involved with model <a href="Jessica%20Stam">Jessica Stam</a>.

In June 2008, Goldstein and <a href="Travis%20Barker">Travis Barker</a> began collaborating under the name <a href="TRV%24DJAM">TRV$DJAM</a>. They performed at the <a href="2008%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2008 MTV Video Music Awards</a> on September 7, 2008. On September 19, after performing at a college event, he and Barker were aboard a <a href="Learjet%2060">Learjet 60</a> when it crashed upon takeoff in <a href="Columbia%2C%20South%20Carolina">Columbia, South Carolina</a>. The crash killed both crew members and the other two passengers, a security guard and Barker's assistant, critically injuring Goldstein and Barker. Goldstein suffered <a href="Burn%23By%20depth">third-degree burns</a> to his arm and parts of his head. Both he and Barker were transported to the Joseph M. Still Burn Center in <a href="Augusta%2C%20Georgia">Augusta, Georgia</a>. Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence on the part of the pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for damages for <a href="pain%20and%20suffering">pain and suffering</a>, mental anguish, disfigurement and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.

In December 2008, <a href="MTV">MTV</a> reported that DJ AM would be making his first appearance with Barker since the two survived the plane crash. The duo performed at <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Nation">New Year's Nation</a>'s Los Angeles 2008 New Year's Eve Party. That same month it was reported that Goldstein had split from Moore and was dating model Haley Wood. In April 2009, Goldstein left his position at Caesars Palace to become <a href="Rain%20Nightclub">Rain Nightclub</a>'s regular Friday night DJ in the <a href="Palms%20Casino%20Resort">Palms Casino Resort</a>, <a href="Las%20Vegas%20Valley">Las Vegas</a>.

Goldstein filmed a cameo for the movie "<a href="Iron%20Man%202">Iron Man 2</a>" in June 2009, appearing as himself deejaying at the birthday party of <a href="Iron%20Man">Tony Stark</a> (played by <a href="Robert%20Downey%20Jr.">Robert Downey Jr.</a>). <a href="Jon%20Favreau">Jon Favreau</a>, the film's director, said that he was a fan of Goldstein; the cameo was supposed to be filmed in one day but the crew and Downey Jr. took a liking to Goldstein and his stay on set extended to approximately one week. He set up turntables and gave Favreau tips on how to DJ in between takes. Goldstein was involved with <a href="Activision">Activision</a>'s "<a href="DJ%20Hero">DJ Hero</a>" video game, contributing original mixes to and also appearing as a <a href="Player%20character">playable character</a>. Goldstein and Barker performed at an <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> event promoting the game in 2009.

Goldstein was the host of "<a href="Gone%20Too%20Far%20%28TV%20series%29">Gone Too Far</a>", a drug intervention reality show for MTV. He had approached MTV in mid-2008, pitching the idea of a reality show that focused on his life to <a href="Tony%20DiSanto">Tony DiSanto</a>. DiSanto said that such shows were declining in popularity, and instead suggested a drug intervention show to which Goldstein agreed. The show was still in pre-production when Goldstein was injured in the plane crash. Following the crash, the show's producer Cheryl Sirulnick said she assumed the show would not go ahead, but Goldstein insisted on continuing. Eight episodes were filmed; three days before his death, Goldstein <a href="twitter">tweeted</a> that filming had been completed.

In an interview with "<a href="Glamour%20%28magazine%29">Glamour</a>" in 2008, Goldstein said that while he had been sober for nine years, he had to remind himself every day that he was still a drug addict, saying: "At any given moment, I'm five seconds away from walking up to someone, grabbing their drink out of their hand and downing it. And if I do that, within a week, tops, I'll be smoking crack." Following the plane crash, Goldstein was prescribed painkillers and anti-anxiety medication. Celebrity doctor <a href="Drew%20Pinsky">Drew Pinsky</a> said it was those prescriptions which opened the "floodgates" to Goldstein's relapse. A friend of his reached the same conclusion, saying: "I think the plane crash killed him, it just took a year for it to do it." As a result of the plane crash, Goldstein developed a fear of flying, and continued taking anxiety medication to help deal with the regular flights his lifestyle required.

Goldstein was struggling with his former addiction during the filming of "Gone Too Far". He held a crack-pipe during one episode. BJ Hickman, an intervention expert who appeared in two episodes, noticed Goldstein "had a moment" holding the crack pipe, and later felt the need to call his sponsor. Goldstein later said of the experience: "I realized my palms were sweaty and I was like, wait a minute, this is not smart for me to be holding this." In another episode, a police officer shows Goldstein confiscated drugs, including a bag of crack cocaine. Shortly thereafter, Goldstein leaves the building, informing the camera crew that he felt so tempted to consume the drugs that it was not safe for him to remain there.

In the weeks before his death, Goldstein's behavior had been erratic and he had been missing appointments. His manager and sponsor were both so concerned that they flew to New York to visit him two days before his death. Goldstein refused to see his manager, but allowed his sponsor into his apartment, consuming pills and smoking crack cocaine in front of him. He promised to check himself into a rehabilitation center following his scheduled gig at Rain Nightclub in Las Vegas that Friday. When he missed his flight and would not return phone calls, friends brought the police to his apartment.

Goldstein was found dead in his New York City apartment on August 28, 2009. <a href="Drug%20paraphernalia">Drug paraphernalia</a>, including a crack pipe and a bag of crack, were found nearby. The New York medical examiner subsequently determined that Goldstein's death was an accident caused by "acute intoxication" from a combination of cocaine, <a href="oxycodone">oxycodone</a>, <a href="hydrocodone">hydrocodone</a>, <a href="lorazepam">lorazepam</a>, <a href="clonazepam">clonazepam</a>, <a href="alprazolam">alprazolam</a>, <a href="diphenhydramine">diphenhydramine</a> and <a href="levamisole">levamisole</a>. Haley Wood denied rumors that an alleged recent separation from Goldstein had contributed to his relapse, saying that the couple had still been together at the time.

After a memorial service, Goldstein was interred at <a href="Hillside%20Memorial%20Park%20Cemetery">Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery</a>, a <a href="Jewish%20cemetery">Jewish cemetery</a> in Los Angeles, on September 2, 2009. The following day, a memorial was held at the <a href="Hollywood%20Palladium">Hollywood Palladium</a>. Among the hundreds of attendees were Nicole Richie, Travis Barker, <a href="Lindsay%20Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>, <a href="Samantha%20Ronson">Samantha Ronson</a>, <a href="Eric%20Dane">Eric Dane</a>, <a href="Rebecca%20Gayheart">Rebecca Gayheart</a>, <a href="Scott%20Caan">Scott Caan</a> and <a href="DJ%20Jazzy%20Jeff">DJ Jazzy Jeff</a>. Wood made an emotional speech at the service, describing Goldstein as her soulmate.

The scheduled debut air date for "Gone Too Far" had been October 5, 2009. After Goldstein's death, DiSanto acknowledged the possibility that placing Goldstein near other addicts helped contribute to his relapse. After debating whether to air the show in the wake of his death, MTV decided to debut it on October 12. His family stated: "It is our hope through airing this show that people will get to see the side of Adam that we knew and loved. The decision to air the show has been difficult, but we do this with the profound belief that it will inspire others to seek help". Favreau also consulted people close to Goldstein about whether the footage of him in "Iron Man 2" should still be used; they agreed unanimously it should remain. Favreau said that following his death, "there was never any doubt" the film would be dedicated to him.

The DJ AM Memorial Fund, an organization designed to help people struggling with drug addiction, was launched in his memory. In November 2009, 800 pairs of Goldstein's sneakers were listed on <a href="eBay">eBay</a> to raise funds for the organization. In August 2010, the fund made a donation to the Los Angeles' Phoenix House Academy to help rehab patients develop musical talents. Goldstein's sister Lara, who founded the fund, died from cancer in May 2011. In August 2011, several DJs paid tribute to Goldstein at the Vanity Nightclub in the Las Vegas <a href="Hard%20Rock%20Hotel%20and%20Casino%20%28Las%20Vegas%29">Hard Rock Casino</a>, helping raise money for the fund. In May 2012, the eighth annual <a href="MusiCares">MusiCares</a> benefit concert featured a special presentation commemorating the launch of the DJ AM Memorial Fund. Goldstein's mother, in conjunction with the fund, was reported to be assisting MusiCares in providing recovery services to addicts. <a href="Moby">Moby</a> deejayed at the event in tribute to Goldstein.

Goldstein posthumously won DJ of the Year at the 2009 <a href="BET%20Hip%20Hop%20Awards">BET Hip Hop Awards</a>. In October 2009 he was depicted in the "<a href="South%20Park">South Park</a>" episode "<a href="Dead%20Celebrities">Dead Celebrities</a>", along with other celebrities who died in mid-2009. <a href="Eminem">Eminem</a>, who nearly died from a <a href="methadone">methadone</a> overdose in late 2007, paid tribute to Goldstein on the 2010 song "Talkin' 2 Myself", rapping: "Rest in peace to DJ AM/'cause I know what it's like/I struggle with this shit every single day." On the cover of the 2011 Blink-182 album, "<a href="Neighborhoods%20%28Blink-182%20album%29">Neighborhoods</a>", "DJ AM" can be seen written on one of the buildings, as a memorial. <a href="Wolfgang%20Gartner">Wolfgang Gartner</a> and <a href="will.i.am">will.i.am</a> pay tribute to DJ AM in their 2011 single "Forever," which includes a moment of silence for him. <a href="Macklemore">Macklemore</a> mentions DJ AM in his 2016 song "Drug Dealer," along with several other notable deaths from drug use.

Footage of Goldstein and several other celebrities are featured in the documentary films "Downtown Calling" (2009), and "Electric Daisy Carnival Experience" (2011). A documentary film about Goldstein titled "As I AM: The Life and Times of DJ AM", was announced at the EDMbiz Conference on June 20, 2013. The film was directed by <a href="Kevin%20Kerslake">Kevin Kerslake</a> and released in April 2015. Dennis Harvey of "<a href="Variety%20%28magazine%29">Variety</a>" called it an entertaining documentary, but thought, "there are some notable gaps left in the pic's posthumous understanding of DJ AM ... as its flashy surface doesn't always help us to understand the pure artistic soul he's depicted as here."

What You Waiting For?

"What You Waiting For?" is a song by American singer <a href="Gwen%20Stefani">Gwen Stefani</a> from her debut solo studio album, "<a href="Love.%20Angel.%20Music.%20Baby.">Love. Angel. Music. Baby.</a>" (2004). Written by Stefani and <a href="Linda%20Perry">Linda Perry</a>, the song is the album's opening track and was released as Stefani's debut solo single. "What You Waiting For?" details Stefani's lack of inspiration, fear of producing the album, as well as her reaction to pressures exerted by her record label. It is primarily an <a href="electropop">electropop</a> song and introduces Stefani's four back-up dancers, the <a href="Harajuku%20Girls">Harajuku Girls</a>, who had a major input into the album's production.

"What You Waiting For?" was released as the album's lead single; according to Stefani, as an "explanation for doing the record". The song was well received by critics, and was frequently cited as a highlight of the album. The single was commercially successful, topping the chart in Australia and reaching the top 10 in several countries. It was certified gold in the United States, and was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female Pop Vocal Performance</a> at the <a href="47th%20Grammy%20Awards">47th Grammy Awards</a>. The song has been remixed a number of times, and was covered by the <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="Franz%20Ferdinand%20%28band%29">Franz Ferdinand</a> and singer <a href="Marina%20and%20the%20Diamonds">Marina and the Diamonds</a>.

During the night of the <a href="45th%20Grammy%20Awards">2003 Grammy Awards</a>, Perry forced Stefani into a <a href="chokehold">chokehold</a>, and demanded that they were "gonna write songs together!", to which Stefani reluctantly agreed. Soon after, Stefani finished the <a href="Rock%20Steady%20Tour">Rock Steady Tour</a> with her band <a href="No%20Doubt">No Doubt</a>, and took a call from her label, who informed her that Perry was in a studio ready to collaborate, and that Perry "only [had] five days out of the whole year to work with [her]." Stefani has since admitted that she was frustrated by not being able to see her husband <a href="Gavin%20Rossdale">Gavin Rossdale</a>, and was intimidated at the thought of collaboration, in particular with Perry, who she did not feel was qualified to write <a href="dance%20music">dance music</a>. Stefani was exhausted by the recently completed tour, and shortly afterwards suffered an emotional breakdown, which she spent in bed crying.

During their first day of work, the two wrote a song titled "Fine by You", which Stefani later described as "a stupid love song, but really good". Perry remarked that the song "wasn't right", and the track was excluded from the album. The session was unproductive, due in part to Stefani's self-consciousness and <a href="writer%27s%20block">writer's block</a>, and she at one stage broke down in tears in the studio. Stefani has since admitted that writing songs without her band members felt "humiliating and intimidating even if they're sweet and excited, because you're drowning in their creativity".

That night, Perry began work on another track, which she played for Stefani the next day to motivate her. Stefani was impressed with the track, and Perry asked her, "What are you waiting for?" According to Perry, Stefani took the question as a dare, replying, "You're totally challenging me, right?" The two began writing lyrics for the <a href="New%20wave%20music">new wave</a>-styled song based on Stefani's writer's block and fears about making a solo record, and it grew into "What You Waiting For?"

Stefani came up with the idea of the <a href="Harajuku%20Girls">Harajuku Girls</a> while writing the song. Stefani first saw the women of <a href="Harajuku">Harajuku</a>, known for their unique style drawing from <a href="Gothic%20Lolita">Gothic Lolita</a> and <a href="cyberpunk">cyberpunk</a> fashion, in 1996 and had admired them since. She decided to mention them in the line "You Harajuku Girls, damn you got some wicked style", and the concept grew into a running theme on "Love. Angel. Music. Baby.", which went as far as to feature one song named after and dedicated to them.

"What You Waiting For?" combines the genres of <a href="electropop">electropop</a>, <a href="new%20wave%20music">new wave</a>, <a href="dance-rock">dance-rock</a>, and <a href="funk">funk</a>, and was composed in <a href="time%20signature">common time</a> and in the key of <a href="G%20minor">G minor</a>. It is written in <a href="verse-chorus%20form">verse-chorus form</a>, and its instrumentation derives from the <a href="guitar">guitar</a> and <a href="electronic%20keyboard">electronic keyboard</a>. The song opens with an emotional <a href="piano">piano</a> solo as a tribute to Stefani's time with No Doubt. The verse begins at only 60 <a href="tempo">beats per minute</a> and gradually slows, mixed with sounds of applause from the audience. A beat set at 138 BPM begins, and Stefani repeats the phrase "tick-tock", commonly interpreted as a reference to her maternal clock and the pressures she felt about producing the album.

Stefani creates an argument between lyrical personas by alternating her <a href="vocal%20range">vocal range</a> and <a href="narrative%20mode">point of view</a>. Stefani's vocal range spans two <a href="octave">octave</a>s in the song, from G to G. In a <a href="melody">melody</a> similar to that of <a href="Weezer">Weezer</a>'s "<a href="Hash%20Pipe">Hash Pipe</a>", one side of Stefani's personality sings in a higher range in the <a href="first-person%20narrative">first person</a>, and the other, more confident personality sings lower in the <a href="second-person%20narrative">second person</a>. During the verses, the more nervous personality discusses her concerns about leaving No Doubt for a solo career as well as the ephemeral success of female singers in the <a href="music%20industry">music industry</a>. The <a href="refrain">chorus</a> is a boost of confidence for her and continues the song's time motif with the lines "Look at your watch now/You're still a super hot female". Backed by perfect octave <a href="dyad%20%28music%29">dyads</a>, Stefani sings a verse about her excitement for her future, and the two personalities merge into one during the <a href="coda%20%28music%29">coda</a>.

"What You Waiting For?" received positive reviews from critics. Nick Sylvester of "<a href="Pitchfork%20%28website%29">Pitchfork</a>" gave the song a strong review, rating it four and a half stars, and labeled it "fucking great". The website went on to rank the song 16th on its list of the Top 50 Singles of 2004. RJ Smith of "<a href="Blender%20%28magazine%29">Blender</a>" noted the song's new wave influence by stating that it could start a revival of <a href="Missing%20Persons%20%28band%29">Missing Persons</a>, and Amy Linden of "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>" compared the "giddy, <a href="yodeling">yodeling</a> vocals" to those of <a href="Lene%20Lovich">Lene Lovich</a>'s 1981 song "New Toy". Jason Damas from "<a href="PopMatters">PopMatters</a>" was mixed on the song, calling the opening "awkward" and the refrain "ridiculously dumb", but arguing that the song "is so frivolous and stupid that it winds up being brilliant; it pretends to be nothing more than party <a href="bubblegum%20pop">bubblegum</a> and achieves its artistic criteria beautifully." "<a href="Slant%20Magazine">Slant Magazine</a>"s Sal Cinquemani agreed, stating that "it's this impishness that helps make 'What You Waiting For' one of the hottest 'arrival' songs of all time". Richard Smirke of <a href="Playlouder">Playlouder</a> found the track's production "crisp" and "edgy", and Jennifer Nine of "<a href="Dotmusic">Dotmusic</a>" called the song "itchily irresistible". Jemma Volp-Fletcher, writing for <a href="Contactmusic.com">Contactmusic.com</a>, rated the song nine out of 10, commenting that it has "irresistible commercial pull and a melody to die for" and that the track "makes the most of her unmistakable vocal and reflects that off-the-wall Stefani personality perfectly." Natasha Tripney from "<a href="musicOMH">musicOMH</a>" gave the song a negative review, stating that "it'll become one of those tracks that's irritatingly catchy—but on this initial listening, Ms Stefani's debut solo effort is just plain irritating."

Many reviewers considered the track one of the album's highlights. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" critic <a href="David%20Browne%20%28journalist%29">David Browne</a> gave "Love. Angel. Music. Baby." a C+ rating but called the track "one of the album's undeniable highs". In its review of the album, Nick Sylvester of "Pitchfork" believed that "we can't expect 12 more cuts as personal or urgent as debut single 'What You Waiting For'", while naming it "one of the best <a href="electro%20%28music%29">electro</a> songs this year". Lisa Haines of <a href="BBC%20Music">BBC Music</a> stated that it "stands out as the best track on the album for the way it pits storming beats against enthusiastic lyrics" and compared the song to <a href="Goldfrapp">Goldfrapp</a>'s 2003 single "<a href="Strict%20Machine">Strict Machine</a>". Eric Greenwood of "Drawer B", who felt that the album "fails on every level", also commented that "if this album had even two more songs this immediate and catchy, then I'd stick my neck out for it, but, sadly, it's the only song worth listening to." In 2009, "<a href="The%20Daily%20Telegraph">The Daily Telegraph</a>" listed the song at number 82 on their list "100 songs that defined the Noughties."

In the United States, "What You Waiting For?" debuted at number 93 on the <a href="Billboard%20Hot%20100">"Billboard" Hot 100</a> on the issue dated October 16, 2004. It reached a peak of number 47 on November 27, 2004 and remained on the chart for a total of 20 weeks. The song topped the <a href="Hot%20Dance%20Club%20Songs">Hot Dance Club Play</a> chart, but only had moderate success on the pop charts, reaching number 17 on the <a href="Mainstream%20Top%2040%20%28Pop%20Songs%29">Mainstream Top 40</a> and number 24 on the <a href="Hot%20Adult%20Top%2040%20Tracks">Adult Top 40</a>. The song was certified gold by the <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">Recording Industry Association of America</a> (RIAA) on February 25, 2005. Additionally, it was nominated for <a href="Grammy%20Award%20for%20Best%20Female%20Pop%20Vocal%20Performance">Best Female Pop Vocal Performance</a> at the <a href="47th%20Grammy%20Awards">2005 Grammy Awards</a>, but lost to <a href="Norah%20Jones">Norah Jones</a>' "<a href="Sunrise%20%28Norah%20Jones%20song%29">Sunrise</a>".

Elsewhere, the song's reception was stronger. In Canada, it debuted in the top 40 on the <a href="Canadian%20Singles%20Chart">Canadian Singles Chart</a> before reaching number 24 in late January 2005. In the United Kingdom, "What You Waiting For?" debuted and peaked at number four on the <a href="UK%20Singles%20Chart">UK Singles Chart</a> and remained on the chart for 15 weeks. The single performed well across most of the rest of Europe, reaching the top five in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Ireland, Italy, and Norway, and the top 10 in Austria, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

In Australia, "What You Waiting For?" debuted atop the <a href="ARIA%20Charts">ARIA Singles Chart</a> on November 14, 2004 and stayed there for two weeks. It remained within the top three through January 17, 2005 and dropped off the chart after 15 weeks. In 2014, the single was certified double platinum by the <a href="Australian%20Recording%20Industry%20Association">Australian Recording Industry Association</a> (ARIA). The song reached number three on New Zealand's <a href="Official%20New%20Zealand%20Music%20Chart">RIANZ Singles Chart</a> and spent four months on the chart.

The song's music video was directed by <a href="Francis%20Lawrence">Francis Lawrence</a> and produced by Caleb Dewart of DNA Inc. The video deals directly with the lyrics' theme of Stefani's search for inspiration in songwriting. It opens with a lengthy non-musical section in which Stefani arrives in <a href="Los%20Angeles">Los Angeles</a> off of No Doubt's Rock Steady Tour. She receives several calls from Interscope label head <a href="Jimmy%20Iovine">Jimmy Iovine</a>, who attempts to push her forward with her solo debut project, but she replies that she is tired and uninspired. After a failed studio attempt, Stefani sees a flyer advertising help for writer's block. Upon arrival she is asked to fill out a suspicious questionnaire, where the camera pans to the questions which will be important. She is then told that she will be billed when she is finished. She asks for clarification only to discover that she is already back in the studio by herself. When Stefani picks up an oversized pocket watch from the piano, a rabbit knick-knack that she had previously seen jumps across the room. She throws the watch at the knick-knack, causing her to fall back on her chair and find herself transported to a fantasy world based on "<a href="Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a>" and "<a href="Through%20the%20Looking-Glass">Through the Looking-Glass</a>".

Stefani portrays several characters from the books, including <a href="Alice%20%28Alice%27s%20Adventures%20in%20Wonderland%29">Alice</a>, the <a href="White%20Queen%20%28Through%20the%20Looking-Glass%29">White Queen</a>, and the <a href="Red%20Queen%20%28Through%20the%20Looking-Glass%29">Red Queen</a>, in dresses by British-Gibraltarian fashion designer <a href="John%20Galliano">John Galliano</a>. The video frequently cuts to Stefani back in the studio to show her singing and performing in semi-synchronization with her actions within her fantasy world. As this transpires the song is recording itself. Stefani ultimately rediscovers her confidence, and her full awareness is transported back to the ordinary reality of the studio just as she dances in front of her four giggling <a href="Harajuku%20Girls">Harajuku Girls</a>. She then is presented with her bill by the consultant as a wooden chair topples to the floor.

There are four versions of the video. The full, long version is one minute longer than the "<a href="Making%20the%20Video">Making the Video</a>" version, while the cut version omits the scenes in which she leaves the airport and is sleepy and in which she fills out the questionnaire. The short version begins with Stefani practicing on the piano and her finding the watch just seconds after that. Her being billed is not shown in this version, so the video ends with the Harajuku Girls laughing at her performance.

The music video was well received by many reviewers. Sam Bloch from <a href="Stylus%20Magazine">Stylus Magazine</a> referred to it as a <a href="short%20film">short film</a>, comparing it to "<a href="Michael%20Jackson%27s%20Thriller%20%28music%20video%29">Michael Jackson's Thriller</a>", and commented, "I sigh with admiration and wish every video was this alive." The video debuted on <a href="MTV">MTV</a>'s "<a href="Total%20Request%20Live">Total Request Live</a>" on October 19, 2004 at number 11. The following month it reached the top of the chart and was there for three non-consecutive days, remaining over five weeks on the program. At the <a href="2005%20MTV%20Video%20Music%20Awards">2005 MTV Video Music Awards</a>, the video won the award for <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Art%20Direction">Best Art Direction</a> and was nominated for <a href="MTV%20Video%20Music%20Award%20for%20Best%20Editing">Best Editing</a>. In Canada, it only reached number 11 on the <a href="MuchMusic">MuchMusic</a>'s "<a href="Countdown%20%28MuchMusic%29">Countdown</a>", though it remained on the chart for eight weeks. At the 2005 <a href="MuchMusic%20Video%20Awards">MuchMusic Video Awards</a>, the video was nominated for Best International Video but lost to <a href="Usher%20%28entertainer%29">Usher</a>'s "<a href="Caught%20Up%20%28Usher%20song%29">Caught Up</a>". It won the award for Best Dressed Video at the first <a href="MTV%20Australia%20Video%20Music%20Awards%202005">MTV Australia Video Music Awards</a>, and was also nominated for Video of the Year and Best Pop Video.

<a href="Stuart%20Price">Stuart Price</a> (also known as Jacques Lu Cont) made the most well-known <a href="remix">remix</a> of the song, titled the Thin White Duke Mix, which was included on the <a href="Compact%20Disc%20single">CD single</a>. The track, over eight minutes long, is carried by a <a href="ostinato">guitar riff</a> and occasional <a href="tubular%20bell">chimes</a>. The remix received positive reviews from music critics. Aaron Mandel of Pitchfork labeled it "outstanding", and John M. Cunningham of Stylus Magazine stated that it "endowed [the song] with a sense of grandeur". DJ InVincible from <a href="About.com">About.com</a> viewed the remix as "moody and a bit hypnotic", commenting that it is "best suited for early-evening sets". <a href="Armand%20Van%20Helden">Armand Van Helden</a> created two remixes, the Armand Van Helden Remix and the Armand Van Helden Dub, which use only some of the original vocals and a new <a href="bassline">bassline</a> constructed with <a href="synthesizer">synthesizer</a>s and some <a href="electric%20guitar">electric guitar</a>. <a href="Felix%20da%20Housecat">Felix da Housecat</a> created the Rude Ho Mix, which uses more <a href="bass%20guitar">bass guitar</a> and leaves out the original <a href="backing%20vocalist">background vocals</a> by Mimi Parker until the final verse.

<a href="Alex%20Kapranos">Alex Kapranos</a>, guitarist and lead singer of Scottish <a href="indie%20rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="Franz%20Ferdinand%20%28band%29">Franz Ferdinand</a>, wore a Gwen Stefani pin on a <a href="Members%20Only%20%28fashion%20brand%29">Members Only</a> jacket as a tribute to "What You Waiting For?". In December 2005, the band performed a <a href="cover%20version">cover version</a> of the song on <a href="Live%20Lounge">Live Lounge</a>, a segment of "<a href="The%20Jo%20Whiley%20Show">The Jo Whiley Show</a>" on <a href="BBC%20Radio%201">BBC Radio 1</a>. The cover includes the chorus from <a href="Billy%20Idol">Billy Idol</a>'s 1983 song "<a href="White%20Wedding%20%28song%29">White Wedding</a>". In October 2006, the song was released as a part of the "<a href="Radio%201%27s%20Live%20Lounge">Radio 1's Live Lounge</a>" compilation, and the cover received mixed reviews. Jack Foley from IndieLondon called the track "completely insane", stating that it "really has to be heard to be believed." "<a href="The%20Guardian">The Guardian</a>"s Dorian Lynskey found the cover smug, adding that "one of Alex Kapranos's eyebrows [is] raised so high that it practically vacates his head."

Welsh <a href="indie%20pop">indie pop</a> singer <a href="Marina%20and%20the%20Diamonds">Marina and the Diamonds</a> covered "What You Waiting For?" during some of her early live performances in 2009. Mary Bellamy of <a href="Drowned%20in%20Sound">Drowned in Sound</a> referred to her debut album "<a href="The%20Family%20Jewels%20%28Marina%20and%20the%20Diamonds%20album%29">The Family Jewels</a>" (2010) as "an extended album length re-write" of "What You Waiting For?".

USS Orizaba

USS "Orizaba" (ID-1536/AP-24) was a <a href="transport%20ship">transport ship</a> for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a> in both <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a> and <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>. She was the sister ship of but the two were not part of a <a href="ship%20class">ship class</a>. In her varied career, she was also known as USAT "Orizaba in service for the <a href="United%20States%20Army">United States Army</a>, and as SS "Orizaba in interwar civilian service for the <a href="Ward%20Line">Ward Line</a>, and as "Duque de Caxias" (U-11) as an auxiliary in the <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian Navy</a> after World War II.

"Orizaba" made 15 <a href="transatlantic%20crossing">transatlantic voyages</a> for the navy carrying troops to and from Europe in World War I with the second-shortest average in-port turnaround time of all navy transports. The ship was turned over to the <a href="United%20States%20Department%20of%20War">War Department</a> in 1919 for use as army transport USAT "Orizaba". After her service in World War I ended, "Orizaba" reverted to the Ward Line, her previous owners. The ship was briefly engaged in transatlantic service to Spain and then engaged in New York–Cuba–Mexico service until 1939, when the ship was chartered to <a href="United%20States%20Lines">United States Lines</a>. While "Orizaba" was in her Ward Line service, American poet <a href="Hart%20Crane">Hart Crane</a> leapt to his death from the rear deck of the liner off Florida in April 1932.

In World War II the ship was requisitioned by the <a href="War%20Shipping%20Administration">War Shipping Administration</a> and again assigned to the War Department as USAT "Orizaba". After completing one voyage as an Army transport, the ship was transferred to the U.S. Navy, where she was re-commissioned as USS "Orizaba" (AP-24). The ship made several transatlantic runs, was damaged in an air attack in the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Sicily">Allied invasion of Sicily</a>, and made trips to South America. The transport also served in the <a href="Pacific%20War">Pacific Theatre</a>, making several transpacific voyages, and one to the <a href="Aleutian%20Islands">Aleutians</a>.

In June 1945, "Orizaba" was transferred under <a href="Lend-Lease">Lend-Lease</a> to the Brazilian Navy where she served as "Duque de Caxias" (U-11). In August 1945, "Duque de Caxis" carried parts of the <a href="Brazilian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Brazilian Expeditionary Force</a> from <a href="Naples">Naples</a> back to <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. The ship was badly damaged by a fire in 1947, but was repaired and remained in service. Permanently transferred to Brazil in 1953, "Duque de Caxias" was decommissioned in 1959 and scrapped in 1963.

"Orizaba" was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of . She had a depth of and a draft of . Propulsion was four steam turbines of 1,908 <a href="nominal%20horsepower">nhp</a> driving twin screw propellers through single reduction gearing. She was fitted with of refrigerated cargo space. The refrigerant was <a href="brine">brine</a> and insulation was by means of <a href="cork%20%28material%29">cork</a>.

"Orizaba"—named after the town of <a href="Orizaba%2C%20Veracruz">Orizaba, Veracruz</a>, Mexico—was laid down for the <a href="Ward%20Line">Ward Line</a> by <a href="William%20Cramp%20%26amp%3B%20Sons">William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company</a> of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> and launched in February 1917. In mid-1917 the <a href="United%20States%20Shipping%20Board">United States Shipping Board</a> (USSB) commandeered and received title to all private shipbuilding projects in progress, including the still-incomplete "Orizaba" and her sister ship "Siboney". Plans for both ships were modified for troop-carrying duties. Upon "Orizaba"’s completion, the USSB delivered her to the US Navy for transport duty on 11 April 1918, and she was commissioned as USS "Orizaba" (ID-1536) on 27 May.
Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, "Orizaba" carried over 15,000 troops in six convoy trips to France before the end of <a href="World%20War%20I">World War I</a>. In one such voyage, "Orizaba"’s <a href="executive%20officer">executive officer</a>, ordnance expert <a href="William%20Price%20Williamson">William Price Williamson</a>, worked closely with <a href="Commander%20%28United%20States%29">Commander</a> Richard Drace White—"Orizaba"’s commanding officer, himself an ordnance expert—to develop a workable <a href="depth%20charge">depth charge</a> launcher which would provide the transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines. Williamson set about modifying a <a href="Lyle%20gun">Lyle gun</a> into a depth charge launcher, and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another test with an increased propellant charge the following day, a defective fuse exploded the depth charge prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors. White, four other officers, and twenty-two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast.

Four days later on 21 August at 08:30, "Orizaba", traveling with "Siboney", spotted a submarine in the act of submerging. "Orizaba" attempted to ram the sub and dropped depth charges, but there was no indication that the attack was successful.

In December 1918, she was temporarily assigned to assist the French government in repatriating French, <a href="Belgian">Belgian</a>, and Italian prisoners of war. Detached from that duty on 10 January 1919, she joined the <a href="Cruiser%20and%20Transport%20Force">Cruiser and Transport Force</a> at <a href="Brest%2C%20France">Brest</a>, and in nine voyages returned over 31,700 troops to the United States. After the completion of transport duty service in the summer of 1919, she was decommissioned on 4 September and subsequently turned over to the <a href="United%20States%20Army">Army</a> for further transport service as USAT "Orizaba". The boat served in that capacity until returned to the Ward Line in 1920.

According to the Statistical Department of the US Navy, "Orizaba" had the second-shortest average in-port turnaround time out of 37 US Navy transports used in World War I. The ship completed 15 round trips with an average turn-around time of just over 30 days per trip, while the overall Navy average was 39.8 days.

After "Orizaba" and "Siboney" were reacquired by the <a href="Ward%20Line">Ward Line</a>, "Orizaba" was registered as a merchant vessel. Her <a href="port%20of%20registry">port of registry</a> was <a href="New%20York%20City">New York</a>, and United States Official Number 216294 and <a href="Code%20Letters">Code Letters</a> LJKM were allocated to her. "Orizaba" and "Siboney" were placed in transatlantic service on New York–Cuba–Spain routes in 1920, with "Orizaba" calling at <a href="A%20Coru%C3%B1a">Corunna</a>, <a href="Santander%2C%20Cantabria">Santander</a>, and <a href="Bilbao">Bilbao</a> in Spain. The two ships accommodated 306 first-class, 60 second-class, and 64 third-class passengers, with each ship making several trips on the route, but a lack of passengers (along with the grounding of "Siboney" at <a href="Vigo">Vigo</a> in September 1920) led to the abandonment of the route.

By October 1921, "Orizaba" was placed in New York–Cuba–Mexico service, where business thrived, in part because of <a href="Prohibition%20in%20the%20United%20States">Prohibition in the United States</a>. Ward Line cruises to Havana were one of the quickest and least expensive ways to what one author called "alcohol-enriched vacations". Three years later, the ship underwent a major refit that, among other things, lengthened her funnels. A typical voyage at this time sailed from New York and called at <a href="Nassau%2C%20Bahamas">Nassau</a>, Havana, <a href="Progreso%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Progreso</a>, <a href="Veracruz%2C%20Veracruz">Veracruz</a> and <a href="Tampico%2C%20Tamaulipas">Tampico</a>.

By the early 1930s, "Orizaba"’s typical route had remained virtually the same, though Nassau and Tampico were dropped as ports of call. It was in this period that American poet <a href="Hart%20Crane">Hart Crane</a> leapt to his death from "Orizaba". At around noon on 27 April 1932, while the ship was headed to New York—some north of Havana and off the Florida coast—Crane, clad in pajamas and overcoat, climbed the rail at the stern of the ship and plunged into the ocean. The captain of "Orizaba" immediately stopped the ship and launched four lifeboats that searched in vain for two hours, but no trace of the poet was ever found. Before he jumped, Crane had been drinking and, the night before, had been the victim of violence after a unwanted pick-up attempt of a crewman ended with a severe beating.
In 1934, "Orizaba" was allocated the Code Letters WECX. In April 1934, American actress <a href="Katharine%20Hepburn">Katharine Hepburn</a> sailed from New York on "Orizaba", eventually ending up in <a href="M%C3%A9rida%2C%20Yucat%C3%A1n">Mérida, Yucatán</a>. After her arrival there on 22 April, she filed for divorce from businessman <a href="Ludlow%20Ogden%20Smith">Ludlow ("Luddy") Ogden Smith</a>, whom she had married in December 1928. After the divorce was finalized she and her travel companion, Laura Harding, planned to spend a week in Havana and return to New York on the Ward Line ship . Other notable passengers on "Orizaba" in the 1930s included Ecuadorean diplomat <a href="Gonzalo%20Zaldumbide">Gonzalo Zaldumbide</a> and Cuban president <a href="Fulgencio%20Batista">Fulgencio Batista</a>. Zaldumbide, the Ecuadorean <a href="Minister%20%28diplomacy%29">Minister</a> to the United States, sailed to Mexico for his new posting as Minister to Mexico in August 1932. In February 1939, "Orizaba" carried Cuban leader Fulgencio Batista back to Havana after a two-week goodwill visit to Mexico.

Beginning in the mid-1930s, "Orizaba" often carried gold and silver bars from Veracruz to New York for the <a href="Federal%20Reserve%20Bank%20of%20New%20York">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a>, <a href="Chase%20National%20Bank">Chase National Bank</a>, or for later transshipment to London. In October 1933 three <a href="short%20ton">short ton</a>s (2.7 <a href="tonne">tonne</a>s) of gold bars and coins were shipped on "Orizaba" for eventual delivery to London, prompting some to believe that gold was being smuggled into Mexico to take advantage of its policy of not charging <a href="Duty%20%28economics%29">duties</a> on gold. In July 1934 "Orizaba" brought in 16 cases of Mexican gold, and in January 1935, 20 cases; in both instances, for delivery to Chase National Bank. Twice in 1935, the Ward liner delivered over 1,000 bars of silver for the Federal Reserve Bank, bringing 1,390 bars in March, and 1,933 bars in July. Mexico was not the only place from which "Orizaba" delivered precious metals. In March 1934, she delivered 12 cases of gold—consisting of 84 bars, and worth $1,624,000—from Havana for Chase.

In mid-1939, "Orizaba" was chartered to <a href="United%20States%20Lines">United States Lines</a> as one of five ships added to increase what was perceived as a slow rate of return of US citizens fleeing war-torn Europe. In September, the ship was diverted to <a href="Galway">Galway</a> to pick up American survivors of , torpedoed by <a href="German%20submarine%20U-30%20%281936%29">"U-30"</a> on 3 September; "Orizaba" returned with 240 of the survivors later that month. After completing evacuation service, the ship was laid up in New York in the summer of 1940, and subsequently purchased by the <a href="United%20States%20Maritime%20Commission">Maritime Commission</a> on behalf of the Army on 27 February 1941.

After her reacquisition by the War Department, "Orizaba" completed one round trip to the <a href="Panama%20Canal%20Zone">Panama Canal Zone</a>. On her return she put in for a refit by the <a href="Bethlehem%20Steel%20Company">Bethlehem Steel Company</a> at New York. After she was transferred to the Navy on 4 June 1941, she was commissioned as "Orizaba" (AP-24) on 15 June 1941.

Following several months of coastal operations, "Orizaba", now armed with two <a href="5%26quot%3B/38%20caliber%20gun"> guns</a> and four <a href="3%26quot%3B/50%20caliber%20gun"> guns</a>, departed New York in April 1942 on the first transatlantic run of her Second World War. Sailing via <a href="Iceland">Iceland</a>, she steamed to <a href="England">England</a>, <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, <a href="Recife">Recife</a>, and <a href="Norfolk%2C%20Virginia">Norfolk</a>, <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, from which she got underway for <a href="Bermuda">Bermuda</a> and <a href="Puerto%20Rico">Puerto Rico</a>. Returning to Norfolk in January 1943, she plied the <a href="East%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">eastern seaboard</a> for a month, then took up transatlantic duties again. Until July she traversed the ocean to <a href="Oran">Oran</a>, <a href="Algeria">Algeria</a>, carrying troops over and prisoners of war back to New York.

On 5 July she left Oran in <a href="Task%20Force">Task Force (TF)</a> 81. The next day, she rendezvoused with TF 85 and on 9 July stood off <a href="Gela">Gela</a>, Sicily, disembarking troops into landing craft. On 11 July, she sustained slight damage in an enemy air attack and retired to Algeria the next day with casualties and prisoners on board. She returned to Sicily at the end of the month to discharge troops and cargo at <a href="Palermo">Palermo</a> and then, on the night of 1 August, weighed anchor and stood out for home.

Arriving at New York on 22 August 1943, she underwent an overhaul, then took on runs to Brazil and the <a href="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>. At the end of the year she left the east coast, passed through the <a href="Panama%20Canal">Panama Canal</a>, and sailed on to the southwestern Pacific. After calls at Samoa, <a href="Noum%C3%A9a">Nouméa</a>, <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>, and <a href="Milne%20Bay">Milne Bay</a>, she returned to the <a href="West%20Coast%20of%20the%20United%20States">west coast</a> in March 1944, only to leave again for another central Pacific run. Back at San Francisco in June, she underwent repairs; completed a run to the Marshalls and <a href="Mariana%20Islands">Marianas</a>; and then sailed north to the <a href="Aleutians">Aleutians</a>. Completing her northern run at <a href="Seattle%2C%20Washington">Seattle, Washington</a>, on 1 December, she carried men and supplies to Hawaii, then returned to San Francisco, later sailing to <a href="New%20Guinea">New Guinea</a>, the Philippines, and <a href="Ulithi">Ulithi</a> to add men and <a href="materiel">materiel</a> to forces gathering for the <a href="Battle%20of%20Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a>.

From Ulithi, "Orizaba" sailed east, passed through the Panama Canal again, and, as the battle for Okinawa raged, arrived at <a href="Tampa%2C%20Florida">Tampa, Florida</a>. Decommissioned on 23 April, she underwent an overhaul and on 16 July 1945 she was transferred to Brazil under the terms of Lend-Lease. The ship was permanently transferred to Brazil in June 1953 and struck from the US <a href="Naval%20Vessel%20Register">Naval Vessel Register</a> on 20 July of that same year. "Orizaba" received one <a href="battle%20star">battle star</a> for her US Navy service in World War II.

Assuming control of the vessel at Tampa on 16 July 1945, the <a href="Brazilian%20Navy">Brazilian Navy</a> renamed the veteran transport "Duque de Caxias" (U-11), the second ship of that navy named in honor of <a href="Lu%C3%ADs%20Alves%20de%20Lima%20e%20Silva%2C%20Duke%20of%20Caxias">Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias</a>, the patron of the <a href="Brazilian%20Army">Brazilian Army</a>.

"Duque de Caxias" headed to <a href="Naples">Naples</a> and on 28 August 1945 left there with elements of the returning <a href="Brazilian%20Expeditionary%20Force">Brazilian Expeditionary Force</a>. The ship arrived at <a href="Rio%20de%20Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> for the first time on 17 September 1945. The ship then loaded American military stores from US bases in Brazil and sailed for New York, arriving on 10 November 1945, with plans to repatriate wounded Brazilian soldiers who had been recuperating in the US.

On 31 July 1947, a day after sailing from Rio de Janeiro for Europe, oil spilled on the ship’s boilers, causing an engine-room fire that quickly spread through the first class cabins and killed 27. The ship was towed from its position off <a href="Cabo%20Frio">Cabo Frio</a> into Rio de Janeiro on 1 August 1947. The ship had been carrying 1,060 passengers bound for <a href="Lisbon">Lisbon</a>, Naples, and <a href="Marseille">Marseille</a>, along with 500 crew members, and had been scheduled to carry Italian refugees on its return voyage.

In 1953, "Duque de Caxias" was converted into a <a href="training%20ship">training ship</a>, and in August of that year began a European and Mediterranean training cruise, which included a 12-day visit to New York in March 1954 as part of its homeward leg. The ship visited the United States again in December 1955, with <a href="midshipman">midshipmen</a> aboard who were touring the <a href="United%20States%20Naval%20Academy">United States Naval Academy</a> and who were honored at a cocktail party by the Brazilian Ambassador, João Carlos Muniz, at the Brazilian Embassy in <a href="Washington%2C%20D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> In October the following year, "Duque de Caxias" called at Philadelphia, and the new Brazilian Ambassador <a href="Ernani%20do%20Amaral%20Peixoto">Ernani do Amaral Peixoto</a>—also an Admiral in the Brazilian Navy—and his wife sponsored a tea dance in honor of Captain Antonio Andrade, other officers of the ship, and the midshipmen aboard the ship; Peixoto had traveled to Philadelphia to greet Andrade, a former <a href="naval%20attach%C3%A9">naval attaché</a> at the embassy. The ship was <a href="Ship%20decommissioning">decommissioned</a> 13 April 1959, and finally scrapped in 1963.

California State Route 75

State Route 75 (SR 75) is a short, <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a> in <a href="San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">San Diego County, California</a>. It is a loop route of <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) that begins near <a href="Imperial%20Beach%2C%20California">Imperial Beach</a>, heading west on Palm Avenue. The route continues north along the <a href="Silver%20Strand%20%28San%20Diego%29">Silver Strand</a>, a thin strip of land, through <a href="Silver%20Strand%20State%20Beach">Silver Strand State Beach</a>. SR 75 passes through the city of <a href="Coronado%2C%20California">Coronado</a> as Orange Avenue and continues onto the <a href="San%20Diego%E2%80%93Coronado%20Bridge">San Diego–Coronado Bay Bridge</a>, which traverses the <a href="San%20Diego%20Bay">San Diego Bay</a>, before joining back with I-5 near downtown <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a> at a freeway interchange.

The Silver Strand Highway was constructed and open to the public by 1924. What would become SR 75 was added to the state highway system in 1933, and designated Legislative Route 199 in 1935. SR 75 was not officially designated until the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. The Coronado Bay Bridge opened in 1969, and provided a direct connection between San Diego and Coronado. Since then, various proposals have taken place to relieve commuter traffic between San Diego and <a href="Naval%20Air%20Station%20North%20Island">Naval Air Station North Island</a> that traverses the city of Coronado. However, none of these proposals have gained support, including an attempt in 2010.

SR 75 begins as Palm Avenue at <a href="Interstate%205%20in%20California">I-5</a> in the <a href="San%20Ysidro%2C%20San%20Diego">San Ysidro</a> neighborhood of <a href="San%20Diego">San Diego</a>, heading westbound from the Southland Plaza mall. The route travels between the communities of <a href="Palm%20City%2C%20San%20Diego">Palm City</a> and <a href="Nestor%2C%20San%20Diego">Nestor</a> before entering the city limits of <a href="Imperial%20Beach%2C%20California">Imperial Beach</a>. There, SR 75 curves to the north, becoming Silver Strand Boulevard and crossing into <a href="Coronado%2C%20California">Coronado</a>. SR 75 continues onto the peninsula containing <a href="Coronado%20Island">Coronado Island</a>, separated from the mainland by <a href="San%20Diego%20Bay">San Diego Bay</a>. The highway passes through the <a href="Silver%20Strand%20Training%20Complex">Silver Strand Training Complex</a> and the <a href="South%20Bay%20Study%20Area">South Bay Study Area</a> before entering the <a href="Coronado%20Cays%2C%20Coronado%2C%20California">Coronado Cays</a> subdivision and paralleling <a href="Silver%20Strand%20%28San%20Diego%29">Silver Strand State Beach</a>.

After this, SR 75 passes through the <a href="Naval%20Amphibious%20Base%20Coronado">United States Naval Amphibious Base</a> for a few miles before entering downtown Coronado. The highway becomes Orange Avenue and turns north-northeast as the main street through Coronado. SR 75 intersects <a href="California%20State%20Route%20282">SR 282</a> at the <a href="one-way%20couplet">one-way couplet</a> of Third and Fourth Streets; SR 282 continues west on Third Street and returns to SR 75 on Fourth Street, while SR 75 continues east on Fourth Street and heads west towards Orange Avenue on Third Street. The one-way couplet is brief, and SR 75 becomes a divided highway before crossing the <a href="San%20Diego%E2%80%93Coronado%20Bridge">Coronado Bridge</a>. While on the bridge, SR 75 crosses into the city of San Diego again.
Once on the mainland, SR 75 has a northbound exit to National Avenue and a southbound entrance from Cesar E. Chavez Parkway. Through traffic is directed onto I-5 south or north in <a href="Logan%20Heights%2C%20San%20Diego">Logan Heights</a>, where SR 75 ends.

SR 75 is eligible for the <a href="State%20Scenic%20Highway%20System%20%28California%29">State Scenic Highway System</a>. It is signed as a scenic route for nearly its entire length, from the Imperial Beach city limit to Avenida del Sol in Coronado, meaning that it is a substantial section of highway passing through a "memorable landscape" with no "visual intrusions", where the potential designation has gained popular favor with the community. SR 75 is also part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. In 2013, SR 75 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 66,000 on the Coronado Bay Bridge (the highest AADT for the highway), and 16,000 between Rainbow Drive and 7th Street in Imperial Beach (the lowest AADT for the highway).

The intersection of Third Street and Orange Avenue dates back to at least 1890. The process of paving portions of Orange Avenue began in 1893, with an estimated cost of $50,000 (about $ in dollars); of <a href="sidewalk">sidewalk</a>s were also included. The plan was to make the avenue "one of the most beautiful in Southern California." From Palm City to Imperial Beach, the road was paved by 1920. The Silver Strand Highway opened in 1924 during a festival at the Tent City summer resort in Coronado, and went from Coronado to Palm City. By 1928, all streets in the city of Coronado had been paved, which was expected to encourage people to visit Tent City.

Plans to transfer the Silver Strand Highway to state maintenance were in place as early as November 1931, and were to take effect once Silver Strand State Park was completed and open. In 1933, the highway from the San Diego–Coronado Ferry to Route 2 (now I-5) was added to the state highway system, and was designated as Legislative Route 199 two years later. By that same year, Sign Route 75 was posted from <a href="U.S.%20Route%20101">U.S. Route 101</a> (US 101) in Palm City to the ferry landing. After a subsequent highway project around 1939, SR 75 passed through Tent City and, according to William Cecil, the city's public works director in 1998, "contributed to its demise."

The first contract for widening the highway between Coronado and Coronado Heights was <a href="Construction%20bidding">awarded</a> in 1944, as this part of the road was "now too narrow and dilapidated to meet traffic requirements." The State Highway Commission allocated $25,000 (about $ in dollars) to install <a href="traffic%20signal">traffic signal</a>s at the intersection of SR 75 and US 101 in March 1951. Plans to widen the road to four lanes were put on hold in July.

By July 1952, it had been disclosed that some local businesses near Palm City had lodged opposition to the widening of the highway after $500,000 (about $ in dollars) had been allocated to the project. Following protests from local businessmen regarding the design of the median, the planned removal of access to intersecting streets, and the planned changes to street parking, Governor <a href="Earl%20Warren">Earl Warren</a> wrote to the San Diego Public Safety Committee, hoping to have the dispute resolved. In November, funds were allocated to acquire land for the construction in the 1953–1954 state budget. A year later, $430,000 (about $ in dollars) had been allocated to the widening project. A contract was given to the Daley Corporation to carry out the construction in 1955. The highway was to be widened to four lanes, and would add three <a href="pedestrian%20crossing">pedestrian crossing</a>s. The completion of the widening project was announced on August 10, 1956. The final cost of the project was $850,000 (about $ in dollars), with money from the City of Coronado and the state.

Discussion regarding a bridge dates back to 1926; however, the Navy opposed the plan over concerns that an enemy could destroy the bridge and trap ships in the harbor. In 1955, the California Senate approved $200,000 (about $ in dollars) to conduct a study regarding a possible vehicular tunnel from San Diego to Coronado. Later, in June 1961, a proposal for an underwater tube along SR 75 was formally proposed, and would not have needed the approval of the residents of Coronado. Interviews of commuters were planned in August, to determine the traffic patterns along SR 75. The survey took place on October 2 along Silver Strand Boulevard.

The SR 75 designation was originally established in 1963 with two segments: from I-5 to the ferry across San Diego Bay from Coronado to downtown, and from <a href="California%20State%20Route%20125">SR 125</a> to I-5. In 1967, the Coronado Bridge was scheduled to be added to the route once it was completed, and the portion from Fourth Street to the ferry was deemed as temporary until the bridge opened. Construction began in February. Coronado residents largely opposed the bridge, but Governor <a href="Pat%20Brown">Pat Brown</a> "overrode their wishes" according to former city councilman Bob Odiorne, who also claimed that the opposition caused the city to lose opportunities to move the approaches to the bridge away from residential areas. Following attempts from Barbara Hutchinson, the vice president of the Kearny Mesa Town Council, to ask the Coronado and San Diego city councils to intervene in the construction, San Diego city attorney Edward Butler stated that the state had the ultimate authority to decide whether or not to build the bridge, and that the City of San Diego could not interfere. Before the bridge opened, in 1968, the changes originally proposed by the Legislature in 1967 were made to the law; the designation came into effect on February 21, 1969. The bridge eventually opened on August 3, 1969.

By 1969, Palm Avenue was the primary commercial street in Imperial Beach, and was described by the "<a href="San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">San Diego Union</a>" as "a strip of large signs and businesses. It is not a 'downtown.'" Plans were under way to add an interchange at Silver Strand State Beach for the Coronado Cays development. In September, the City of Coronado added Orange Avenue south of Third Street as a truck route leading to the base. By May 1970, the part of SR 75 on the Coronado Bridge had been declared a scenic highway. President <a href="Richard%20Nixon">Richard Nixon</a> and Mexican president <a href="Gustavo%20D%C3%ADaz%20Ordaz">Díaz Ordaz</a> used Orange Avenue as a <a href="motorcade">motorcade</a> route on September 3, 1970, en route to the <a href="Hotel%20del%20Coronado">Hotel del Coronado</a>.

Proposition N was proposed in 1974 to attempt to resolve concerns regarding traffic in Coronado. The plan was to build another highway along the northern and eastern shore of Coronado Island, to bypass the busy residential and commercial districts and provide easy access to the Silver Strand from the western end of the bridge. The proposition asked voters whether the City Council should "actively pursue" the matter. Critics contended that the highway would block the view of the San Diego Bay, and that the city would be unable to alter traffic patterns in the meantime. Coronado mayor Rolland McNeely opposed the proposal in early November 1974 as it would require approval from over thirty government agencies and would force the city to continue with building this road, although some declared it "impossible to build." The voters rejected this plan.

The portion of SR 75 from Pomona Avenue in Coronado to Imperial Beach was also recommended to become a scenic highway in February 1974. Future improvements to the Imperial Beach – Coronado portion were cancelled in April. In 1976, the <a href="California%20State%20Legislature">California State Legislature</a> renumbered the portion from I-5 to SR 125 as SR 117, which later became <a href="California%20State%20Route%20905">SR 905</a>. The change took effect at the beginning of 1977. The renumbering was to reduce confusion with the Coronado portion, according to Caltrans regional director <a href="Jacob%20Dekema">Jacob Dekema</a>; new signs were to be put into place shortly thereafter. The bridge and the resulting traffic continued to be a hotly debated issue in the early 1980s. A plan in 1981 to convert Fourth Street into an expressway leading to the naval station was strongly opposed by the public due to the required demolition of structures and a lack of evidence that the plan would succeed in reducing traffic; by this time, Third and Fourth streets had been converted into one-way streets between the bridge and the naval station. A major renovation of the bridge was scheduled for late 1992, which would include a movable barrier to prevent head-on collisions and necessary resurfacing of the roadway. Work was underway in January 1993 on the $4 million project (about $ in dollars), but it was behind the three-month schedule by 11 days due to rainfall and was expected to be completed by March.

When the Coronado Bridge opened, a toll of 60 cents was charged to use the bridge. In 1980, the toll became $1.20, charged only in the westbound direction towards Coronado. A seventh toll booth was to be constructed in September 1987. The toll dropped to $1 in 1988. The bridge tolls ended at 10 p.m. on June 27, 2002, after the San Diego Association of Governments decided to stop collecting tolls; drivers paid a total of $197 million throughout the years. The speed limit was decreased to in October 2005 along Third and Fourth streets, after traffic increased by 20 percent following the removal of the toll. Traffic barriers along Third Street to block traffic from turning onto intersecting streets were removed in November 2004, following voter approval.

The City of Coronado has attempted to have a tunnel built from the Coronado bridge to the San Diego Naval Base numerous times, and hired Ledford Enterprises to help with the lobbying process in 2002 and 2006. The city endorsed a proposed study in 2004 to determine possible alternatives to resolve the traffic issues, which included keeping the status quo. On June 8, 2010, Coronado voters decided against Proposition H, which would have advised the city to undergo further investigation into building the tunnel. This concluded ten years of studies and proposals by the city of Coronado to find a way to reduce traffic to the naval station during rush hour. Critics of the proposal did not believe that the tunnel would resolve the traffic issues on the northern part of SR 75 or on SR 282. Following this, the Coronado City Council voted to abolish the Tunnel Commission that had been formed to study the issue.

Efforts were underway by Imperial Beach city officials to improve the reputation and economic standing of the Palm Avenue area in the first decade of the 21st century. The area was described by the "<a href="San%20Diego%20Union-Tribune">San Diego Union-Tribune</a>" as a "hodgepodge of vacant land and aging apartment buildings and businesses, many in need of a coat of paint" in 2003. Residents hoped to revitalize the area, providing commerce right next to an entrance to the beach. City officials offered local business owners loans for necessary construction or rehabilitation in 2005. The Imperial Beach city council approved the redevelopment of the Palm Avenue corridor in 2008, following a study in 2003. A Palm Avenue Commercial Corridor Master Plan was endorsed in February 2009, in efforts to improve the commercial area. In September 2012, the Imperial Beach city council raised objections over the Caltrans decision to increase the speed limit on SR 75 to from on the portion of the highway from Delaware Street to the western Imperial Beach city limit due to concerns about safety. The rest of the highway was to retain the speed limit.

California State Route 76

State Route 76 (SR 76) is a <a href="state%20highway">state highway</a> long in the U.S. state of <a href="California">California</a>. It is a much used east–west route in the <a href="North%20County">North County</a> region of <a href="San%20Diego%20County%2C%20California">San Diego County</a> that begins in <a href="Oceanside%2C%20California">Oceanside</a> near <a href="Interstate%205%20%28California%29">Interstate 5</a> (I-5) and continues east. The highway is a major route through the region, passing through the community of <a href="Bonsall%2C%20California">Bonsall</a> and providing access to <a href="Fallbrook%2C%20California">Fallbrook</a>. East of the junction with <a href="Interstate%2015%20%28California%29">I-15</a>, SR 76 goes through <a href="Pala%2C%20California">Pala</a> and <a href="Pauma%20Valley%2C%20California">Pauma Valley</a> before terminating at <a href="State%20Route%2079%20%28California%29">SR 79</a>.

A route along the corridor has existed since the early 20th century, as has the bridge over the <a href="San%20Luis%20Rey%20River">San Luis Rey River</a> near Bonsall. The route was added to the state highway system in 1933, and was officially designated by the <a href="California%20State%20Legislature">California State Legislature</a> as SR 76 in the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>. The section of the highway through Oceanside and Bonsall is mostly a four-lane expressway; east of I-15, SR 76 is mostly a two-lane highway. Originally, the entire highway was two lanes wide; west of Bonsall, the route was widened in stages, after decades of funding shortages, planning, and litigation. The <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a> (Caltrans) maintained plans to expand the entire length of the highway west of I-15 to an expressway, and as of May 2017, construction between Bonsall and I-15 was complete.

The roadway carrying the SR 76 designation begins at <a href="County%20Route%20S21%20%28California%29">County Route S21</a> (CR S21) in <a href="Oceanside%2C%20California">Oceanside</a>, although Caltrans does not consider the road west of I-5 to be part of the route, and it is not in the legal definition. There is soon an interchange with <a href="Interstate%205%20%28California%29">I-5</a>, after which SR 76 becomes a four-lane <a href="Limited-access%20road">expressway</a> known as the San Luis Rey Mission Expressway. From I-5 to Mission Avenue, the highway parallels the <a href="San%20Luis%20Rey%20River">San Luis Rey River</a> until it passes by <a href="Oceanside%20Municipal%20Airport">Oceanside Municipal Airport</a>. During this stretch, SR 76 intersects Loretta Street, Canyon Drive, Benet Road, Airport Road, and Foussat Road. There are two overpasses: one over Mission Avenue, and one over El Camino Real, before the road intersects Douglas Drive, the main road to the San Luis Rey gate of <a href="Camp%20Pendleton">Camp Pendleton</a>. After an intersection with Rancho Del Oro Road, SR 76 passes over Mission Avenue again before intersecting with Old Grove Road, Frazee Road, a turnoff into the Towne Center North shopping center, and College Boulevard.
As it enters rural Oceanside, SR 76 intersects with North Santa Fe Avenue (<a href="County%20Route%20S14%20%28California%29">CR S14</a>), Guajome Lake Road (near <a href="Guajome%20County%20Park">Guajome County Park</a>), and Melrose Drive. SR 76 intersects the southern segment of <a href="County%20Route%20S13%20%28California%29">CR S13</a>, known as East Vista Way, and passes over the San Luis Rey River on roughly parallel bridges before an intersection at North River Road. The highway passes through Bonsall, intersecting Via Montellano, Olive Hill Road, and Throughbred Lane. SR 76 then meets the northern segment of CR S13, known as South Mission Road, while heading north into <a href="Fallbrook%2C%20California">Fallbrook</a>; SR 76 is the primary road connecting the two portions of CR S13. Here, SR 76 becomes known as Pala Road. It intersects Via Monserate and Gird Road south of Fallbrook before crossing the former routing of <a href="U.S.%20Route%20395%20%28California%29">US 395</a> and the current routing of <a href="Interstate%2015%20%28California%29">I-15</a> in the community of <a href="Pala%20Mesa%20Village%2C%20California">Pala Mesa Village</a>.

SR 76 then goes through <a href="Pala%2C%20California">Pala</a> and the <a href="Pala%20Indian%20Reservation">Pala Indian Reservation</a>, providing access to the <a href="Pala%20Casino">Pala Casino</a> and intersecting <a href="County%20Route%20S16%20%28California%29">CR S16</a>, the turnoff to the <a href="Asistencia%20San%20Antonio%20de%20Pala">Pala Mission</a> and <a href="Temecula%2C%20California">Temecula</a>. Continuing to parallel the San Luis Rey River, SR 76 passes by the <a href="Wilderness%20Gardens%20County%20Park">Wilderness Gardens County Park</a> before entering the community of <a href="Pauma%20Valley%2C%20California">Pauma Valley</a> and meeting the southern terminus of <a href="County%20Route%20S7%20%28California%29">CR S7</a> (Nate Harrison Grade), a dirt road leading into <a href="Palomar%20Mountain">Palomar Mountain State Park</a>. SR 76 intersects the southern leg of <a href="County%20Route%20S6%20%28California%29">CR S6</a> (Valley Center Road), leading to <a href="Valley%20Center%2C%20California">Valley Center</a> and <a href="Escondido%2C%20California">Escondido</a>. East of the small <a href="Yuima%20Indian%20Reservation">Yuima Indian Reservation</a>, it then encounters the northern leg of CR S6, the southern approach to the <a href="Palomar%20Observatory">Palomar Observatory</a> and Palomar Mountain State Park, as well as the community of <a href="La%20Jolla%20Amago%2C%20California">La Jolla Amago</a>. It then briefly passes through the <a href="Cleveland%20National%20Forest">Cleveland National Forest</a> and meets the eastern terminus of CR S7, the eastern approach to Palomar Mountain. SR 76 then passes along the shores of <a href="Lake%20Henshaw%2C%20California">Lake Henshaw</a> before terminating at the intersection with <a href="State%20Route%2079%20%28California%29">SR 79</a> at Morettis Junction, southeast of Lake Henshaw.
From I-5 to I-15, SR 76 is part of the <a href="California%20Freeway%20and%20Expressway%20System">California Freeway and Expressway System</a>, but is not part of the <a href="National%20Highway%20System%20%28United%20States%29">National Highway System</a>, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the <a href="Federal%20Highway%20Administration">Federal Highway Administration</a>. SR 76 is legally eligible for the <a href="State%20Scenic%20Highway%20System%20%28California%29">State Scenic Highway System</a>, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the <a href="California%20Department%20of%20Transportation">California Department of Transportation</a>. The part of the highway from the western terminus to Douglas Drive is also named for Tony Zeppetella, an Oceanside police officer killed while on duty performing a <a href="traffic%20stop">traffic stop</a> in 2003. In 2014, SR 76 had an <a href="annual%20average%20daily%20traffic">annual average daily traffic</a> (AADT) of 1,400 between East Palomar Road and the eastern terminus at SR 79, and 55,000 between Airport Road and El Camino Real in Oceanside, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.

The road through the San Luis Rey Valley was planned as early as 1889, and was constructed during the early 20th century. It was added to the state highway system in 1933, while the condition of the highway continued to improve. The San Luis Rey Mission Expressway was eventually constructed during the 1990s and 2000s, and efforts were underway to extend the expressway east to I-15 during the 2010s.

Plans by the City of Oceanside for a road east through the San Luis Rey Valley to Fallbrook date from June 1889, and included a bridge over the San Luis Rey River. Construction on the bridge over the river at Bonsall had commenced by October 1906, and the bridge was to be long. In November, the road to the bridge was under construction; originally, the bridge was to serve the road from Escondido to Temecula. A survey was commissioned in 1908 to replace the road along the south bank of the river with one along the north bank to Pala, as the former was sandy and difficult for travel. State funding issues for the Pala road by May 1912 that prevented completion, though the planned road had been surveyed from Bonsall, where it met with the Escondido road, to Oceanside.

Flooding in January 1916 resulted in the closing of the pre-existing road between Bonsall and Pala; part of it reopened in October. Nevertheless, of the road between Pauma Valley and Pala did not reopen for two years. Meanwhile, a road from Pala to Warner Springs neared completion in March 1918, though a bridge would be necessary for the road to be usable during the winter months. By mid-1921, plans were underway to pave Mission Avenue through the Oceanside city limits. The first east from Oceanside were paved by November 1924. The Bonsall Bridge over the San Luis Rey River was completed in 1925, and opened in 1926 as the county's largest bridge at the time; it served as part of the road from San Diego to Elsinore. The Pala road was constructed by 1930, although it was not paved east of Pala.

The road that extended from US 101 in Oceanside all the way to SR 79 near Lake Henshaw was originally added to the state highway system in 1933, but was not designated as legislative Route 195 until 1935. By 1936, US 395 was signed along what would become SR 76 through Bonsall, as part of the route in between <a href="Lake%20Elsinore%2C%20California">Elsinore</a> and San Diego. In 1943, work began on widening the approaches to the Bonsall bridge. US 395 had been shifted east away from Bonsall by 1949. SR 76 was signed by 1954. During the <a href="1964%20state%20highway%20renumbering%20%28California%29">1964 state highway renumbering</a>, Route 195 was legally redesignated as State Route 76; at that time, the legal definition was updated to reflect the new designation of I-5, replacing US 101.

The original idea for constructing a replacement for Mission Avenue dates from 1950. By 1961, there were plans to make SR 76 a freeway from Oceanside to Fallbrook Road, and an expressway from there to US 395. The following year, the new Highway 76 Association formed a committee to promote the upgrade of the road into Pauma Valley. In 1963, more specific plans were proposed by the Highway Development Association initiative, including making the portions from Foussat Road and the <a href="Mission%20San%20Luis%20Rey%20de%20Francia">Mission San Luis Rey de Francia</a> and from Vista Way to Mission Road an expressway, and making the part of the highway in Oceanside wider. In 1964, the state allocated funds for the widening of SR 76 to four lanes in Oceanside, and in October 1965, the first portion of the widening from Carey Road to Frontier Drive entered the bidding phase. The next part of the widening entered the <a href="construction%20bidding">bidding phase</a> in December 1968, and extended from Frontier Drive to near the Mission.

Caltrans engineer Jacob Dekema announced in April 1969 that construction on SR 76 and the nearby <a href="SR%2078%20%28CA%29">SR 78</a> between I-5 and US 395 would be delayed until work was underway on I-5 and US 395 was underway, or at least until 1976. Nevertheless, a widening project was commissioned in 1970 between Pauma Reservation Road and Cole Grade Road, well east of US 395. The next year, construction began on a new interchange between the future routing of SR 76 and I-5, near Oceanside Harbor and Camp Del Mar in Camp Pendleton. The expansion of SR 76 appeared on the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) regional government plan in late 1974. At that time, there was an effort by the City of Oceanside to have SR 76 included as a scenic highway, but SR 76 has not been included in the system. The Chamber of Commerce decided to continue efforts to have SR 76 expanded at the end of 1974.

In January 1975, Caltrans presented plans to realign SR 76 away from Mission Avenue and move it to the south side of the San Luis Rey River from I-5 to Frontier Drive. One member of the Tri-Cities Taxpayers' League suggested that the freeway be built on the northern side of the river, and follow the river all the way east to I-15. Following concerns that the project would be cancelled due to lack of state funding, the California Highway Commission (CHC) stated that the proposal was still being considered. The City of Oceanside raised concerns about the congestion on Mission Avenue, as well as the realignment being a part of the city master plan. After this, at the start of the next year, the CHC decided to keep the proposal, though there were concerns that construction would be delayed due to the state financial crisis. Caltrans stated a few months later that SR 76 would be delayed because of the funding issues and the relatively low levels of traffic that would not support building a freeway. Following this, State Senator John Stull alleged that Caltrans head Adriana Gianturco was purposefully delaying the project by delaying the release of the <a href="environmental%20impact%20report">environmental impact report</a>. A petition drive began soon after, supported by many North County leaders, with the exception of Bonsall due to concerns about a full freeway running through the community.

From 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police kept track of over 1,000 accidents that occurred along SR 76. A citizen action group known as Concerned Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway as opposed to a freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, and building a route through an environmentally sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, <a href="Jerry%20Brown">Jerry Brown</a>, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR 76, had not been started.

In the meantime, the Oceanside Development Agency recommended that the new highway be extended west to Pacific Street to aid in redeveloping the downtown area. The San Diego Regional Coastal Commission disagreed with constructing the highway, among other development proposals for downtown Oceanside, due to concerns about destroying habitat along the river and the marsh areas. Soon after, in October 1980, the California Coastal Commission recommended removing the realignment of the freeway from plans entirely, on environmental grounds.

In 1983, the introduction of a federal <a href="gasoline%20tax">gasoline tax</a> of five cents per gallon (one cent per liter) added more funding to complete projects in San Diego County, among other places. From that revenue, $5 million (about $ in dollars) was allocated to rebuilding the Bonsall bridge and realigning the highway. Issues cited with the old bridge included the sharp turns at either end and its narrow width, though some members of the community hoped that the old bridge would remain standing as a historical landmark, and a pedestrian bridge. County Supervisor Paul Eckert commissioned a campaign to leave the bridge standing a week later. Plans to replace the bridge were delayed by April, due to issues acquiring the land necessary for the new bridge.

Caltrans tentatively approved the westernmost of the SR 76 widening project in May, while noting that there were several more steps in the legal process necessary before construction began. Two years later, concerns were expressed by environmental groups over the potential destruction of the habitat of the <a href="least%20Bell%27s%20vireo">least Bell's vireo</a> songbird by the construction of SR 76 and other projects in the region. In 1986, the bird was added to the federal <a href="endangered%20species">endangered species</a> register. The next year, the Oceanside Jaycees group collected 12,000 signatures supporting the construction of the freeway immediately. At that time, the fatality rate on SR 76 was 222 percent above that of any other state highway in California. The petitions were given to the office of then-Governor <a href="George%20Deukmejian">George Deukmejian</a>. In November 1987, the <a href="U.S.%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service</a> approved the project, on condition that Caltrans purchase more land to set up habitat for <a href="environmental%20mitigation">environmental mitigation</a>.

Funds for the new Bonsall bridge were approved by the California Transportation Commission (CTC) in October 1988, and construction was scheduled to begin in early 1989. In November 1989, the California Coastal Commission gave the go-ahead for the realignment of SR 76 in western Oceanside, from I-5 to Frontier Drive. However, in February 1990, the <a href="Sierra%20Club">Sierra Club</a>, <a href="National%20Audubon%20Society">National Audubon Society</a>, and <a href="League%20for%20Coastal%20Protection">League for Coastal Protection</a> filed a lawsuit to have the approval overturned, citing concerns over the destruction of habitat. The Bonsall bridge was completed in early 1990, while the old bridge became a National Historic Place. In 1992, the City of Oceanside offered to purchase land as additional habitat for the songbird, even though it was not a party to the lawsuit. The following year, the City Council voted to use the Lawrence Canyon land for commercial use instead of for the environmental mitigation, thus stalling the project. Following this, the CTC rejected the proposal to build the highway, requiring Caltrans to find another parcel to use for constructing habitat. The CTC did approve the proposal a month later, provided that this land was found before construction began. In October, the City Council decided to use the Lawrence Canyon land for mitigation after all. Nevertheless, a city councilman raised concerns that the expressway would not be adequate to handle 2010 traffic levels.

The four lane expressway bypass of Oceanside was constructed beginning in 1994. The first from I-5 to Foussat Road opened to traffic in late 1995. The cost of this portion was $10 million (about $ in dollars); at that time, completion of the rest of the route was expected for 2008. The rerouting of SR 76 away from Mission Avenue resulted in a decrease in business for establishments located along the old routing. On June 12, 1996, the groundbreaking ceremony for the second phase of the project took place, by which time the completion date for the entire roadway had slipped to 2010. This phase between Foussat Road and Jefferies Ranch Road was finished in late 1999. Because the expressway was constructed on top of Mission Avenue east of Old Grove Road, the former was rerouted onto a new alignment that connected to Frazee Road. Mission Avenue was thus fragmented, and does not exist between Frazee Road and Jefferies Ranch Road, where the designation resumes.

By 2002, Caltrans had two proposals for the part of the widening project between East Vista Way and Mission Road: building the new highway on top of the old one, or constructing a new roadway to the south of the San Luis Rey River. Concerns arose that the TransNet local sales tax would not be extended by voters, leading to the cancellation of that project. The San Diego Association of Governments included the widening east to Bonsall in the regional plan in 2003, but indicated that the portion from Bonsall to I-15 would be dependent on the availability of funding. Residents of Fallbrook and Bonsall criticized the fact that SR 76 was one of the few TransNet projects that was not to be completed by the expiration of the tax in 2008. The city of Oceanside proposed plans for grade-separated interchanges with College Boulevard and Melrose Drive in 2004, as part of a proposal to convert the expressway through Oceanside to a freeway. After complaints from residents, these proposals were tabled.

After TransNet was renewed in November 2004, planning continued for widening the remaining portion of SR 76 west of I-15, due to the frequent accidents that occurred on the eastern portion, although some claimed that the habits of drivers were at fault. The 2007 environmental impact report recommended constructing the new roadway along the route of the old one, rather than moving the entire highway south.

Meanwhile, congestion east of I-15 increased with the opening of four new <a href="casino">casino</a>s near Pala. The Pala Indian band was required to pay for the costs to improve the road to mitigate the increased traffic levels from their proposed expansion. Construction began on widening the highway in April 2008, and in March 2009, two lanes of a realigned segment of SR 76 opened east of I-15. Initially, only two lanes were open, with the other two lanes of this new four lane divided highway planned to open in September 2009. This improvement was intended to reduce accidents on a stretch of road that carried over 12,000 motorists per day, many headed for either the Pala Indian casino or a new gravel quarry that had recently opened. The casino and quarry owners each paid for half of the $26 million (about $ in dollars) cost of the new road. Even after this, in 2009, the corner of SR 76 and Palomar Mountain Road was determined to be the place in the county with the most motorcycle accidents.

Construction started on widening SR 76 between Melrose Drive and South Mission Road in January 2010 to four lanes, funded by the federal government, state government, and by TransNet revenue. The project included building a second bridge over the San Luis Rey River. Discussion on whether the route of the highway should go south or north of the river east of Mission Road began later that year, with residents expressing concerns about being able to make left turns. In June 2011, Caltrans decided to use the existing roadway as the path, but agreed to build traffic signals at Via Monserate, South Mission Road, Gird Road, and Old Highway 395. For environmental mitigation, Caltrans purchased the parcel known as Rancho Lilac, which was . The second Bonsall bridge was finished by April 2012. The westbound lanes between Melrose Drive and Mission Road opened to traffic in October, with the entire roadway projected to be complete by the end of the year. The total cost of the entire widening project east of Melrose Drive is projected to be $371 million.

A request by the city of Oceanside to restore access to Jefferies Ranch Road from SR 76 was declined by Caltrans in late 2012, due to concerns about future expressway expansion to six lanes. In May 2013, construction at the I-15 and SR 76 interchange uncovered a "<a href="Bison%20latifrons">Bison latifrons</a>" fossil. Revisions to the interchange were finished in August 2013. The final portion east to I-15 was contracted out in August, and construction was to begin soon afterward and extend until 2017, at a cost of $201 million. In August 2016, traffic was to switch from the existing roadway to the newly constructed one west of I-15, from Gird Road to Old Highway 395. This would allow for the older roadway to be reconfigured to carry westbound traffic, while the new roadway would handle eastbound traffic. The new roadway was described as having fewer turns than the older road, which would increase safety. The expansion of the road to four lanes was completed in May 2017; this meant that from about east of the interchange with I-15 west to CR S21 the roadway was four lanes wide, including the widening that had been paid for by the owners of a rock quarry.

Montgomery later identified Horrocks as one of his most able officers, appointing him to <a href="corps">corps</a> commands in both <a href="North%20African%20Campaign">North Africa</a> and <a href="Western%20Front%20%28World%20War%20II%29">Europe</a>. In 1943, Horrocks was seriously wounded and took more than a year to recover before returning to command a corps in Europe. It is likely that this period out of action meant he missed out on promotion; his contemporary corps commanders in North Africa, <a href="Oliver%20Leese">Oliver Leese</a> and <a href="Miles%20Dempsey">Miles Dempsey</a>, went on to command at <a href="Field%20army">army</a> level and above. Horrocks' wound caused continuing health problems and led to his early retirement from the army after the war.

Since 1945, Horrocks has been regarded by some as one of the most successful British generals of the war, "a man who really led, a general who talked to everyone, down to the simplest <a href="Private%20%28rank%29">private</a> soldier", and the ""beau ideal" of a corps commander". <a href="General%20%28United%20States%29">General</a> <a href="Dwight%20D.%20Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, the <a href="Supreme%20Allied%20Commander">Supreme Allied Commander</a> in Western Europe, called him "the outstanding British general under Montgomery".

Brian Gwynne Horrocks was the only son of <a href="Colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Colonel</a> <a href="William%20Horrocks">Sir William Horrocks</a>, a "Lancashire born" doctor in the <a href="Royal%20Army%20Medical%20Corps">Royal Army Medical Corps</a> (RAMC), and his wife, Minna Horrocks, "who had all the gaiety and charm of the Irish". Born in <a href="Ranikhet">Ranikhet</a> in <a href="British%20Raj">British India</a> on 7 September 1895, young Brian—after having had "particularly happy memories of the four years spent at <a href="Gibraltar">Gibraltar</a> when my father was working on the causes of <a href="Brucellosis">Malta fever</a>"—returned to Britain, where he was educated at <a href="Bow%20School%2C%20Durham">Bow School, Durham</a>, later <a href="Uppingham%20School">Uppingham School</a>, <a href="Rutland">Rutland</a>, an English <a href="Independent%20school%20%28UK%29">public school</a>, "where I gravitated automatically into the army class. There was never any question of my entering a profession other than the army." Of his childhood, he claimed to have had "an extremely happy childhood". Horrocks later wrote that, as his life was devoted almost entirely to sport, he had very little aptitude for hard work. He entered the <a href="Royal%20Military%20College%2C%20Sandhurst">Royal Military College, Sandhurst</a>, in October 1912, "bottom but one". Horrocks's time at Sandhurst was, by his own admission, not very distinguished. "Let me be quite honest about it; I was idle, careless about my turnout—in army parlance, scruffy—and, due to the fact that I am inclined to roll when I walk, very unsmart on parade". His score was sixth-lowest of the 167 successful applicants for cadetships—even after the addition of 200 bonus points for an <a href="Officers%27%20Training%20Corps">Officer Training Corps</a> (OTC) certificate, which not all the other candidates had. An unpromising student, he might not have received a commission at all but for the outbreak of the <a href="First%20World%20War">First World War</a> in August 1914.

Horrocks was <a href="Officer%20%28armed%20forces%29">commissioned</a> as a <a href="second%20lieutenant">second lieutenant</a> into the <a href="Middlesex%20Regiment">Middlesex Regiment</a>, a <a href="line%20infantry">line infantry</a> regiment of the <a href="British%20Army">British Army</a>, on 8 August 1914. Horrocks, in charge of a ninety-five-man draft of replacements, joined the 1st Battalion of his regiment as part of the <a href="British%20Expeditionary%20Force%20%28World%20War%20I%29">British Expeditionary Force</a> (BEF) during the BEF's retreat following its baptism of fire at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Mons">Battle of Mons</a>. By the time he and his men had got to <a href="Southampton">Southampton</a> his ninety-five-man draft had increased to ninety-eight, with three others, in their keenness to get into the war, having sneaked in. He described the feeling at the time: "This was, I should think, the last time there was any romance attached to war. It is impossible now after the bitter experience of two world wars to recapture the spirit of this country in August, 1914. As I marched through those cheering crowds I felt like a king among men. It was all going to be over by Christmas and our one anxiety was whether we would get over there in time. And all ranks felt the same."

Arriving in France, Horrocks was assigned to No. 16 Platoon of the 1st Battalion, Middlesex, with Captain Edward Stephen Gibbons (who was killed in 1918) as his <a href="company%20commander">company commander</a>. The battalion was part of the <a href="19th%20Light%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">19th Independent Brigade</a>, which was not assigned to a division. Horrocks wrote that his "chief memory of those days, and the memory retained by all platoon commanders, was of marching—endless and exhausting marches. I had never realised before that it was possible to go to sleep while the legs continued automatically to function." He found comfort in "that priceless Cockney sense of humour. A small private soldier in the rank in front of me looked up at his neighbour, who was blessed with a long lugubrious face, and said, "Why don't you give your face a holiday, chum? Try a smile"." He also came to greatly admire Captain Gibbons, along with his platoon sergeant, Sergeant Whinney. Once, while it was pouring with rain, when the officers of the battalion were offered billets in a comfortable farmhouse, while the <a href="Other%20ranks%20%28UK%29">other ranks</a> slept in a manure-packed field recently departed by some cows, Captain Gibbons was furious, insisting that the officers should share in the misery of their subordinates. "My heart sank but I knew instinctively that he was right", Horrocks later wrote. Douglas Delaney writes that the "willingness of soldiers to follow was constructed on gestures like this. It is interesting how some events, though seemingly insignificant in the bigger scheme of things, become embedded in memory, making lifelong memories of themselves." Horrocks was not to last much longer in battle, as on 21 October, at the <a href="Race%20to%20the%20Sea">Battle of Armentières</a>, his platoon was surrounded, and Horrocks, while defending the town of <a href="Maisnil">Maisnil</a> against a German attack, received a bullet wound through the lower abdomen and upper thigh, and was taken prisoner. "The war for me was over and my active military career had stopped for four years."

Incarcerated in a military hospital, he was repeatedly interrogated by his German captors, who believed that the British were using <a href="dum-dum">expanding bullets</a> in contravention of the <a href="Hague%20Conventions%20%281899%20and%201907%29">1899 Hague Convention</a>. Horrocks' captors refused to change his clothes or sheets, and denied him and a fellow officer basic amenities. Both had temporarily lost the use of their legs, and were forced to crawl to the toilet, which caused Horrocks' wounds to become infected. Conditions improved after his discharge and transfer to a <a href="prisoner%20of%20war%20camp">prisoner of war camp</a>. On his way to the camp, Horrocks befriended his German escort—he attributed their rapport to the mutual respect that front-line troops share. He was promoted to <a href="Lieutenant%20%28British%20Army%20and%20Royal%20Marines%29">lieutenant</a> on 18 December 1914, despite being in enemy hands, and often tried to escape, once coming within of the Dutch border before being recaptured. He was eventually placed in a compound for Russian officers, in the hope that the language barrier would hinder his escape attempts; Horrocks used the time to learn the <a href="Russian%20language">Russian language</a>. Years later, working in the <a href="British%20House%20of%20Commons">House of Commons</a>, he startled <a href="Nikita%20Khrushchev">Nikita Khrushchev</a> and <a href="Nikolai%20Bulganin">Nikolai Bulganin</a> by greeting them in their native tongue. In the latter part of the war he was held in <a href="Holzminden%20prisoner-of-war%20camp">Holzminden prisoner-of-war camp</a>. His resistance in captivity would earn him the <a href="Military%20Cross">Military Cross</a> (MC), awarded in 1920 and backdated to 5 May 1919.

Repatriated at the end of the war, Horrocks had difficulty adapting to a peacetime routine. He went on sprees in <a href="London">London</a>, spending four years of accumulated back-pay in six weeks.

In 1919 Horrocks was posted to Russia as part of the <a href="Allied%20intervention%20in%20the%20Russian%20Civil%20War">Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War</a>. After landing at <a href="Vladivostok">Vladivostok</a> on 19 April, he was briefed at British headquarters. The <a href="White%20movement">White Army</a> under Admiral <a href="Aleksandr%20Kolchak">Kolchak</a>, with the help of released <a href="Czechoslovak%20Legions">Czechoslovak Legion</a> prisoners, had driven the <a href="Red%20Army">Red Army</a> out of <a href="Siberia">Siberia</a>. Kolchak's Czech troops were returning home, and the British military contingent was urgently trying to replace them with Russians. To accomplish this, the British had only two infantry battalions and two small administrative missions, one charged with training and arming the Russians with British war-surplus equipment, and the other with improving the White Army's communications.

Horrocks' first task, along with a party of 13 British officers and 30 <a href="Other%20ranks%20%28UK%29">other ranks</a>, was to guard a train delivering 27 carriages of shells to the White Army in <a href="Omsk">Omsk</a>, away on the <a href="Trans-Siberian%20Railway">Trans-Siberian Railway</a>. The journey took more than a month, and as the only party member fluent in Russian, Horrocks had to deal with many of the difficulties encountered. At every station, he had to ward off station masters intent on acquiring the carriages. While stopped in <a href="Manchuli">Manchuli</a>, the British officers' presence provoked a <a href="duel">duel</a> between two <a href="Cossack">Cossack</a> officers. Horrocks accepted an invitation to act as a second, but the pair were arrested before the duel could take place. He managed to defuse the situation before it came to trial, by claiming his faulty Russian had been the cause of the misunderstanding.

His next assignment was in <a href="Yekaterinburg">Yekaterinburg</a> in the <a href="Urals">Urals</a>, where he was appointed second in command of a training school for <a href="non-commissioned%20officer">non-commissioned officer</a>s attached to the Anglo-Russian Brigade. He found this post frustrating, having to dismiss nearly a third of his initial <a href="En%20cadre">cadre</a> on medical grounds, and struggling to get supplies and support from the White Army authorities. Despite this, he developed a rapport with his men and an admiration for the Russian soldier.

Although British forces were ordered home shortly afterwards, Horrocks and another officer, <a href="Eric%20Hayes">George Hayes</a>, remained to advise the First Siberian Army. The White Army was in retreat, and Horrocks joined them as they fell back to Vladivostok, away. He was captured by the Red Army on 7 January 1920, in the town of <a href="Krasnoyarsk">Krasnoyarsk</a>, and spent 10 months as a prisoner, narrowly surviving severe <a href="typhus">typhus</a>. The British government negotiated a prisoner release, and Horrocks left Russia on 29 October, returning home on the <a href="Royal%20Navy">Royal Navy</a> cruiser <a href="HMS%20Delhi%20%28D47%29">HMS "Delhi"</a>.

Horrocks rejoined his regiment, based in Germany with the <a href="British%20Army%20of%20the%20Rhine">British Army of the Rhine</a>, and followed it to <a href="Ireland">Ireland</a>, then embroiled in the <a href="Irish%20War%20of%20Independence">Anglo-Irish War</a>. His duties included searching for arms and dealing with ambushes and roadblocks, which he called "a most unpleasant form of warfare". This was followed by a short period in <a href="Silesia">Silesia</a> to deal with tensions between the Polish and German populations.

On his return to Britain, Horrocks took up the <a href="modern%20pentathlon">modern pentathlon</a>. He competed successfully in army tournaments, and was picked for the British Olympic team for the <a href="1924%20Summer%20Olympics">1924 Paris Olympics</a>, where he finished 19th out of 38. Horrocks spent the remainder of the <a href="Interwar%20period">inter-war years</a> in postings that included <a href="adjutant">adjutant</a> for the <a href="9th%20Battalion%2C%20Middlesex%20Regiment">9th Battalion, Middlesex Regiment</a> of the <a href="Army%20Reserve%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> (1926–1930); student at the <a href="Staff%20College%2C%20Camberley">Staff College, Camberley</a> (1931–32); <a href="Staff%20%28military%29">Staff Captain</a> at the War Office (1934–36); <a href="brigade%20major">brigade major</a> with the <a href="5th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">5th Infantry Brigade</a> (1936–38); and instructor at the Staff College. The Territorial Army posting, which Horrocks considered to be among his happiest periods, provided experience in dealing with citizen soldiers, which would prove highly valuable during the Second World War. He received a <a href="brevet%20%28military%29">brevet</a> <a href="Major%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">majority</a> in 1935, and was promoted to substantive major in 1936, and brevet <a href="Lieutenant%20colonel%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">lieutenant colonel</a> in 1937.

In 1928, Horrocks married Nancy Kitchin, daughter of an architect for the <a href="Local%20Government%20Board">Local Government Board</a>. They had one child, a daughter named Gillian, who drowned in 1979 while swimming in the <a href="River%20Thames">River Thames</a>.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Horrocks was working as an instructor at the Staff College, Camberley, where he had taught since 1938. After helping organise a new, shorter, officer-training course, in December 1939 he was promoted to substantive lieutenant colonel. The following May, he was despatched to France to command the 2nd Battalion, Middlesex Regiment, a machine-gun battalion directly subordinate to the <a href="3rd%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">3rd Division</a> headquarters of <a href="Major-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Major-General</a> <a href="Bernard%20Montgomery">Bernard Montgomery</a>. British <a href="Military%20doctrine">doctrine</a> at the time retained heavy machine guns under the direct command of a corps or division, rather than as an organic part of subordinate formations. He joined the battalion during its <a href="Battle%20of%20Dunkirk">retreat to Dunkirk</a>, and after only 17 days had impressed his superiors sufficiently to be given the temporary rank of <a href="Brigadier%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">brigadier</a>, and the command of <a href="11th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20and%20Headquarters%20South%20East">11th Brigade</a>. The brigade's previous commander, <a href="Kenneth%20Arthur%20Noel%20Anderson">Kenneth Anderson</a>, had been promoted to <a href="General%20officer%20commanding">General Officer Commanding</a> (GOC) 3rd Division during the <a href="Dunkirk%20evacuation">evacuation</a>, when <a href="Lieutenant-general%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Lieutenant-General</a> <a href="Alan%20Brooke%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Alanbrooke">Alan Brooke</a>, commander of <a href="II%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">II Corps</a>, was recalled to the United Kingdom and Montgomery took over the corps. On Horrocks' return to Britain, he was given command of <a href="9th%20Infantry%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">9th Brigade</a> and assigned to defend against a possible German invasion. A short stint as Brigadier General Staff of <a href="Western%20Command%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Western Command</a> followed, before promotion to <a href="Acting%20%28rank%29">acting</a> major-general and command of <a href="44th%20%28Home%20Counties%29%20Division">44th (Home Counties) Infantry Division</a> on 25 June 1941. He was promoted to substantive colonel on 28 May 1941 (with seniority backdated to 1 July 1940).

In March 1942, Horrocks was given command of the newly formed <a href="9th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">9th Armoured Division</a> and gained the temporary rank of major-general on 27 June. Horrocks, an infantry soldier with no experience in dealing with cavalry, was an unusual choice for commander of an armoured division. He trained the division hard, organising exercises to improve the effectiveness of his troops, and to familiarise himself with <a href="armoured%20warfare">armoured warfare</a>. Despite never having commanded a division in battle, he was further promoted to acting lieutenant-general and sent to Egypt to command the <a href="Eighth%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Eighth Army</a>'s <a href="XIII%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XIII Corps</a>, under Montgomery. <a href="General%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">General</a> <a href="Harold%20Alexander%2C%201st%20Earl%20Alexander%20of%20Tunis">Sir Harold Alexander</a> and Lieutenant-General Montgomery had decided to make a "clean sweep" when replacing the dismissed <a href="Claude%20Auchinleck">Claude Auchinleck</a> as <a href="Commander-in-chief">Commander-in-Chief</a> (C-in-C) <a href="Middle%20East%20Command">Middle East</a> and Eighth Army commander respectively. Officers perceived to have failed under the old regime were removed, and Montgomery's favoured commanders were brought in. Among these was Horrocks, an officer who, Montgomery felt, was "exactly what was wanted for the job that lay ahead".

On arriving in North Africa, Horrocks' corps was ordered to defend the <a href="Battle%20of%20Alam%20el%20Halfa">Alam el Halfa</a> ridge in northwestern Egypt from an expected attack by the <a href="Afrika%20Korps">Afrika Korps</a>. Concerned that heavy casualties would jeopardise his planned <a href="Second%20Battle%20of%20El%20Alamein">El Alamein offensive</a>, Montgomery instructed Horrocks to repel <a href="Erwin%20Rommel">Erwin Rommel</a>'s forces "without getting unduly mauled in the process". Horrocks prepared for a purely defensive battle, with his armour dug in around the ridge. When the Germans attacked on 30 August, they failed to lure the British tanks towards their <a href="88%20mm%20gun">88 mm gun</a>s—a tactic that had previously been used with great success—and found themselves battered by both artillery and the <a href="Desert%20Air%20Force">Desert Air Force</a> (DAF). The battle ended with the Germans in control of Himeihat hill, but at a high cost, and the Allied forces unwilling to try to re-take it after a failed attack by the <a href="2nd%26amp%3Bnbsp%3BNew%20Zealand%20Division">2nd New Zealand Division</a>. The army's defensive success raised morale, and Horrocks was praised by his subordinate, Brigadier <a href="George%20Philip%20Bradley%20Roberts">George Roberts</a>, for his "wonderful knack of inspiring confidence and enthusiasm wherever he goes". Montgomery, too, was pleased, saying "he deserves great credit for his action on that day".

Horrocks was offered the command of <a href="X%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">X Corps</a>, an armoured corps, in the planned Alamein battle. He refused it, believing that Major-General <a href="Herbert%20Lumsden">Herbert Lumsden</a>, a cavalry officer, would be more suited to the role. Instead he retained command of XIII Corps, and was given the task of making a feint to the south to deceive <a href="Axis%20powers">Axis forces</a>, while the main thrust was made by <a href="XXX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">XXX Corps</a> and X Corps to the north. Montgomery told Horrocks that he was not to incur tank losses, so XIII Corps' offensive operations were limited to small-scale raids. In the aftermath of the landmark British victory that followed, Horrocks' corps was assigned to the reserve and was reduced in size while the rest of the Eighth Army pursued the retreating Axis forces. At one point the only formation under his command was a salvage unit clearing the wreckage of the battlefield, which he visited daily. In December, he relinquished command of XIII Corps to Lieutenant General <a href="Miles%20Dempsey">Miles Dempsey</a> and took over command of X Corps, the lead corps in the advance of the Eighth Army, after Lumsden's dismissal for his perceived poor performance during the pursuit. Horrocks was appointed a Companion of the <a href="Distinguished%20Service%20Order">Distinguished Service Order</a> on 31 December 1942.

Following the fall of <a href="Tripoli">Tripoli</a> in January 1943, the remaining Axis forces retreated to prepared defences in Southern Tunisia, in front of the <a href="Mareth%20Line">Mareth Line</a> built by France before the war. Here in March, Horrocks carried out one of his most successful actions. His corps, composed of the <a href="1st%20%28United%20Kingdom%29%20Division">1st Armoured Division</a>, a Free French brigade and the attached New Zealand Corps (which included the 2nd New Zealand Division and the <a href="8th%20Armoured%20Brigade%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 8th Armoured Brigade</a>), was ordered to attack as part of <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Mareth%20Line%23Supercharge%20II">Operation Supercharge</a> after XXX Corps failed to breach the line. He carried out a <a href="Flanking%20maneuver">flanking manoeuvre</a> through a pass judged by the Germans to be impenetrable, rendering the Mareth position untenable and forcing the Axis into another retreat. Three <a href="Royal%20Italian%20Army%20during%20World%20War%20II">Italian</a> divisions were destroyed, and the German <a href="15th%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">15th</a> and <a href="21st%20Panzer%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">21st Panzer Division</a>s and the <a href="164th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28Wehrmacht%29">164th Division</a> were heavily depleted. Horrocks was then transferred to the <a href="First%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">First Army</a> to take over <a href="IX%20Corps%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">IX Corps</a> after its previous commander, Lieutenant-General <a href="John%20Crocker">John Crocker</a>, was wounded in a training accident. He led this corps in the final Allied <a href="Tunisian%20Campaign">offensive in Tunisia</a> during April and May 1943, capturing <a href="Tunis">Tunis</a> and accepting the surrender of the remnants of Rommel's <a href="Panzer%20Army%20Africa">Army Group Africa</a>. He was <a href="mentioned%20in%20dispatches">mentioned in despatches</a> on 24 June, and for his service in Tunisia, was appointed a <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Bath">Companion of the Order of the Bath</a> on 5 August. He was also given the rank of temporary lieutenant-general and war substantive major-general.

In June 1943, after returning to command of X Corps, Horrocks sustained serious injuries during an air raid at <a href="Bizerte">Bizerte</a>, while watching an amphibious rehearsal by the <a href="46th%20Infantry%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">46th Infantry Division</a> for Operation Avalanche, the <a href="Allied%20invasion%20of%20Italy%23Salerno%20landings">Salerno landings</a>. Bullets from a <a href="strafing">strafing</a> German fighter struck his upper chest and carried on through his body, piercing his <a href="lung">lung</a>s, <a href="stomach">stomach</a>, and <a href="intestine">intestine</a>s. He underwent five operations and spent fourteen months recovering. He was replaced as commander of X Corps by Lieutenant-General <a href="Richard%20McCreery">Sir Richard McCreery</a>.

It was a year before Horrocks recovered sufficiently to tell Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the <a href="Chief%20of%20the%20General%20Staff%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Chief of the Imperial General Staff</a> (CIGS), that he was "very anxious to be given another corps". Restored to the acting rank of lieutenant-general in August 1944, he was sent to France to assume command of XXX Corps during the cataclysm engulfing the trapped <a href="7th%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German 7th Army</a> and <a href="5th%20Panzer%20Army">5th Panzer Army</a> in the <a href="Falaise%20Pocket">Falaise Pocket</a>. Montgomery had been dissatisfied with the performance of the corps and its GOC, <a href="Gerard%20Bucknall">Gerard Bucknall</a>, a fellow Middlesex Regiment officer, since the <a href="Normandy%20landings">landings in Normandy</a> two months earlier. Horrocks retained control of XXX Corps during the advance through Belgium, taking <a href="Brussels">Brussels</a>, and at one point advanced in only six days. Supplies were a constant concern; the major French deep-water ports were still in German hands, and Allied supply lines stretched back to the Normandy beaches. Montgomery's <a href="21st%20Army%20Group">21st Army Group</a> was by now operating from its ports—twice the distance <a href="Military%20logistics">logistical</a> planners had accounted for—so XXX Corps was diverted towards <a href="Antwerp">Antwerp</a> to secure its <a href="Port%20of%20Antwerp">docks and harbour</a>. The city and port fell to the <a href="11th%20Armoured%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">11th Armoured Division</a> in early September, but Montgomery halted XXX Corps for resupply short of the wide <a href="Albert%20Canal">Albert Canal</a> to the north of the city, which consequently remained in enemy hands. Horrocks regretted this after the war, believing that his corps might have advanced another with the fuel available, although it is doubtful this could have been achieved without delays. Unknown to the Allies, at that time XXX Corps was opposed by only a single German division. The pause allowed the Germans to regroup around the <a href="Scheldt">Scheldt</a> River, and by the time the Allies resumed their advance, <a href="Kurt%20Student">General Student</a>'s <a href="1st%20Parachute%20Army%20%28Germany%29">First Paratroop Army</a> had arrived and set up strong defensive positions along the opposite side of the canal. The task of breaking the strengthened German line, which stretched from Antwerp to the North Sea along the Scheldt River, would fall to the <a href="First%20Canadian%20Army">First Canadian Army</a> in the month-long, costly <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Scheldt">Battle of the Scheldt</a>. By mid-September, XXX Corps had been diverted again, this time to the east.

In September, Montgomery, now a field marshal, made his ambitious thrust across the <a href="Rhine">Rhine</a> and into Germany's industrial heartland, codenamed <a href="Operation%20Market%20Garden">Operation Market Garden</a>, a priority for 21st Army Group. XXX Corps under Horrocks was to lead the ground assault, passing along a corridor held by airborne forces to link up with the <a href="1st%20Airborne%20Division%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">British 1st Airborne Division</a> in <a href="Battle%20of%20Arnhem">Arnhem</a> within four days. In the event XXX Corps never arrived, and although 1st Airborne clung on to their tenuous position for a further five days, by 21 September almost three-quarters of the division was destroyed or captured. Postwar analyses have been divided, some stressing a perceived lack of urgency on the part of Horrocks' men, while others note that German defences in the area were severely underestimated by <a href="First%20Allied%20Airborne%20Army">First Allied Airborne Army</a>'s <a href="Military%20intelligence">intelligence</a>. Particularly important was the failure to identify the remnants of two SS Panzer divisions, which after Normandy had been sent to the Arnhem area for rest and refitting; intelligence had stated that only "a few infantry units and between 50 and 100 tanks" were in the Netherlands. A series of counterattacks by Army Group B under <a href="Generalfeldmarschall">Field Marshal</a> <a href="Walter%20Model">Walter Model</a> kept Horrocks' units on the defensive, and delayed their advance by forcing the British to halt and secure their flank. The terrain over which Horrocks' men had to move was unsuitable, restricting the vanguard (the <a href="Guards%20Armoured%20Division">Guards Armoured Division</a>) to a single narrow raised highway through flat or flooded countryside. The <a href="Nijmegen">Nijmegen</a> Bridge, just from Arnhem, was not captured by the <a href="508th%20Infantry%20Regiment%20%28United%20States%29">508th Parachute Infantry Regiment</a> on the first day as planned, and XXX Corps had to assist in its capture on their arrival in Nijmegen two days later, causing a further delay of 36 hours. Horrocks was not personally blamed for the operation's failure; during this period <a href="Brigadier%20general%20%28United%20States%29">Brigadier General</a> <a href="James%20M.%20Gavin">James Gavin</a>'s <a href="82nd%20Airborne%20Division">U.S. 82nd Airborne Division</a> came under Horrocks' command, and Gavin later wrote: 

During the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Bulge">Battle of the Bulge</a>, Horrocks was temporarily relieved of his command of XXX Corps by Field Marshal Montgomery and sent back to Britain to rest. Montgomery had taken this move because Horrocks had become "nervy and difficult with his staff" and had "attempted to act foolishly" with XXX Corps. The corps was temporarily commanded by Major-General <a href="Gwilym%20Ivor%20Thomas">Ivor "von Thoma" Thomas</a>, GOC of the <a href="43rd%20%28Wessex%29%20Infantry%20Division">43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division</a>.

In early 1945, XXX Corps took part in <a href="Operation%20Veritable">Operation "Veritable"</a>, during which the <a href="German%20Army%20%28Wehrmacht%29">German Army</a> was forced back over the Rhine. The corps employed firepower on a massive scale, and "every trick that had been learnt during the past two and a half years was brought into play, and several new ones added". For a short period XXX Corps had nine divisions under its command. Before the operation, Horrocks accepted an offer to use <a href="RAF%20Bomber%20Command">Bomber Command</a> to attack the town of <a href="Kleve">Cleves</a>, assisting the advance of the <a href="15th%20%28Scottish%29%20Infantry%20Division">15th (Scottish) Infantry Division</a>. The bombers released of high explosive that devastated the town. Horrocks later said that this had been "the most terrible decision I had ever taken in my life" and that he felt "physically sick" when he saw the bombers overhead. Operation "Veritable" was successful; by the evening of 9 February (D+1) XXX Corps had broken through the <a href="Siegfried%20Line">Siegfried Line</a> and into <a href="Germany">Germany</a> with only light casualties. <a href="Bremen%20%28city%29">Bremen</a> was captured on 26 April, exposing the <a href="Sandbostel">Sandbostel</a> concentration camp, <a href="Stalag%20X-B">Stalag X-B</a>. The corps had reached <a href="Cuxhaven">Cuxhaven</a> by the time <a href="End%20of%20World%20War%20II%20in%20Europe">hostilities ceased</a>.

Horrocks received two further mentions in despatches for his service in north-west Europe on 22 March and 9 August 1945, and was appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire</a> on 5 July. He was honoured by the governments of Belgium (the <a href="War%20Cross%20%28Belgium%29">Croix de Guerre 1940 with Palm</a> and <a href="Order%20of%20the%20Crown%20%28Belgium%29">Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown with Palm</a>), France (<a href="Croix%20de%20guerre%201939%E2%80%931945">Croix de Guerre</a> and <a href="L%C3%A9gion%20d%27honneur">Commandeur of the Légion d'honneur</a>), the Netherlands (Knight Grand Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20Orange-Nassau">Order of Orange-Nassau</a>), Greece (Commander of the Order of King George I), and the United States (<a href="Legion%20of%20Merit">Legion of Merit</a>).

Horrocks continued to serve in the armed forces after the war, initially as General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Western Command, receiving substantive promotion to lieutenant-general in 1946, with seniority backdated to 29 December 1944. He briefly commanded the British Army of the Rhine, until he fell ill in August 1948; he was invalided out of the service early in January 1949 by the lingering effects of the wounds he had received in North Africa. Promoted to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the <a href="King%27s%20Birthday%20Honours">King's Birthday Honours</a> that year, he served as Honorary Colonel of a <a href="Territorial%20Army%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Territorial Army</a> unit of the <a href="Royal%20Artillery">Royal Artillery</a>. In 1949 he was appointed <a href="Black%20Rod">Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod</a>, a post traditionally held by retired officers; this appointment was confirmed on the accession of <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Elizabeth II</a> in 1952. Black Rod has the responsibility of supervising the administration of the <a href="House%20of%20Lords">House of Lords</a>, controlling admission to it, and taking part in ceremonies. In 1957, Horrocks had the unusual duty of ordering <a href="Vivien%20Leigh">Vivien Leigh</a> out of the House when she interrupted proceedings to plead that the <a href="St%20James%27s%20Theatre">St James's Theatre</a> be saved from demolition. On other occasions, because the Black Rod had to remain in place during long debates, Horrocks relieved his boredom by completing <a href="football%20pools">football pools</a> coupons. This had the advantage of looking like note-taking to the assembled lords. Horrocks held the post of Black Rod until 1963.

Horrocks became interested in writing, and submitted articles about military matters to newspapers and magazines including the "<a href="Picture%20Post">Picture Post</a>" and "<a href="The%20Sunday%20Times">The Sunday Times</a>". This led to a short but successful career as the presenter of a series of television programmes, "British Castles" (1962), "Men in Battle" and "Epic Battle", produced by <a href="Huw%20Wheldon">Huw Wheldon</a>. In these, Horrocks lectured on great historical battles, "highlighting excitement and interest" to allow the programmes to appeal to the widest possible audience. He was interviewed extensively for the <a href="Thames%20Television">Thames Television</a> series, "<a href="The%20World%20at%20War">The World at War</a>", and, to his embarrassment, appeared on the cover of the BBC's "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" magazine. After his television career ended, he served on the <a href="Board%20of%20directors">board</a> of the housebuilding company <a href="Bovis%20Homes%20Group">Bovis</a>, and continued writing, contributing a column to "The Sunday Times" and editing a series of British Army <a href="regiment">regiment</a>al histories. In 1968 Horrocks collaborated with <a href="J%20%26amp%3B%20L%20Randall">J & L Randall</a> as editor of the 'Merit' board game 'Combat'. His portrait and signature appear on the box and in his introduction to the game he states "In war no two battles are ever the same because the terrain is always different and it is this, more than anything else, which influences the composition of the different armies and the tactics employed by the rival Commanders". His autobiography, "A Full Life", was published in 1960, and he co-authored "Corps Commander", an account of his battles in north-west Europe, published in 1977.

Horrocks acted as a military consultant for the 1977 film <a href="A%20Bridge%20Too%20Far%20%28film%29">"A Bridge Too Far"</a>, based on Operation Market Garden. The actor <a href="Edward%20Fox%20%28actor%29">Edward Fox</a> played Horrocks in the film, and later commented: 

Horrocks died on 4 January 1985, aged 89. The memorial service, held at <a href="Westminster%20Abbey">Westminster Abbey</a> on 26 February, was attended by Major-General Peter Gillett and <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20Defence">Secretary of State for Defence</a> <a href="Michael%20Heseltine">Michael Heseltine</a>, who represented the <a href="Elizabeth%20II%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">Queen</a> and <a href="Margaret%20Thatcher">Prime Minister</a> respectively. Thirty regiments and many other formations and associations were represented at the service.

Love It to Death

Love It to Death is the third studio album by the American rock band <a href="Alice%20Cooper%20%28band%29">Alice Cooper</a>, released in March 1971. It was the band's first commercially successful album, and is considered to be where the band first consolidated its aggressive hard-rocking sound. The album's best-known track, "<a href="I%27m%20Eighteen">I'm Eighteen</a>", was released as a single to test the band's commercial viability before the album was recorded.

Formed in the mid-1960s, the band took the name Alice Cooper in 1968 and became known for its outrageous theatrical live shows. The loose, psychedelic <a href="Freak%20scene">freak rock</a> of the first two albums failed to find an audience. The band moved to Detroit in 1970 and was influenced by the aggressive hard rock scene there. A young <a href="Bob%20Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> was enlisted as producer, and he encouraged the band to tighten its songwriting over two months of rehearsing ten to twelve hours a day. The single "I'm Eighteen" achieved top-forty success soon after, peaking at . This convinced <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros.</a> that Alice Cooper had the commercial potential to release an album. After its release in March 1971, "Love It to Death" reached on the <a href="Billboard%20200">"Billboard" 200</a> albums chart and has since been <a href="RIAA%20certification">certified platinum</a>. The album's second single, "<a href="Caught%20in%20a%20Dream">Caught in a Dream</a>", charted at .

The original album cover featured <a href="Alice%20Cooper">the singer Cooper</a> posed with his thumb protruding so it appeared to be his penis; Warner Bros. soon replaced it with a censored version. The Love It to Death tour featured an elaborate <a href="shock%20rock">shock rock</a> live show: during "Ballad of Dwight Fry"—about an inmate in an insane asylum—Cooper would be dragged offstage and return in a straitjacket, and the show climaxed with Cooper's mock execution in a prop electric chair during "Black Juju". Ezrin and the Coopers continued to work together for a string of hit albums until the band's breakup in 1974. The album has come to be seen as a foundational influence on <a href="hard%20rock">hard rock</a>, <a href="Punk%20rock">punk</a>, and <a href="Heavy%20metal%20music">heavy metal</a>; several tracks have become live Alice Cooper standards and are frequently covered by other bands.

Detroit-born vocalist <a href="Alice%20Cooper">Vincent Furnier</a> co-formed the Earwigs in the mid-1960s in Phoenix, Arizona. The band released a few singles and went through a few name changes before settling on a lineup with guitarist <a href="Glen%20Buxton">Glen Buxton</a>, guitarist and keyboardist <a href="Michael%20Owen%20Bruce">Michael Bruce</a>, bassist <a href="Dennis%20Dunaway">Dennis Dunaway</a>, and drummer <a href="Neal%20Smith%20%28drummer%29">Neal Smith</a>. In 1968 the band adopted the name Alice Cooper—a name Furnier later adopted as his own—and presented a story that it came from a 17th-century witch whose name they learned from a session with a <a href="ouija">ouija</a> board.

At some point Buxton painted circles under his eyes with cigarette ashes, and soon the rest followed with ghoulish black makeup and outlandish clothes. The band moved to Los Angeles and became known for its provocative, theatrical <a href="shock%20rock">shock rock</a> stage show. In an incident during a performance at the <a href="Toronto%20Rock%20and%20Roll%20Revival">Toronto Rock and Roll Revival</a> in 1969, Cooper threw a live chicken into the audience, who tore it to shreds.

The group's first two albums, "<a href="Pretties%20for%20You">Pretties for You</a>" (1969) and "<a href="Easy%20Action">Easy Action</a>" (1970), appeared on <a href="Frank%20Zappa">Frank Zappa</a>'s <a href="Straight%20Records">Straight Records</a> label, and failed to find an audience. The band relocated to Detroit and found itself in the midst of a music scene populated with the hard-driving rock of the <a href="MC5">MC5</a>, the stage-diving <a href="Iggy%20Pop">Iggy Pop</a> with <a href="the%20Stooges">the Stooges</a>, and the theatricality of <a href="George%20Clinton%20%28musician%29">George Clinton</a>'s <a href="Parliament-Funkadelic">Parliament and Funkadelic</a>. The Alice Cooper band incorporated these influences into a tight hard-rock sound coupled with an outrageous live show.

While at the <a href="Strawberry%20Fields%20%28Canadian%20festival%29">Strawberry Fields Festival</a> in Canada in April 1970, band manager <a href="Shep%20Gordon">Shep Gordon</a> contacted producer <a href="Jack%20Richardson%20%28record%20producer%29">Jack Richardson</a>, who had produced hit singles for <a href="the%20Guess%20Who">the Guess Who</a>. Richardson was uninterested in producing the Alice Cooper band himself, and sent the young <a href="Bob%20Ezrin">Bob Ezrin</a> in his place. Cooper recalled the junior producer as "a nineteen-year-old Jewish hippie" who reacted to meeting the outlandish band "as if he had just opened a surprise package and found a box full of maggots".

Ezrin initially turned down working with the band, but changed his mind when he saw them perform at <a href="Max%27s%20Kansas%20City">Max's Kansas City</a> in New York City the following October. Ezrin was impressed with the band's audience-participation rock-theater performance and the cult-like devotion of the band's fans, who dressed up and knew the lyrics and actions to the music, which Ezrin compared to the later <a href="The%20Rocky%20Horror%20Picture%20Show%20cult%20following">cult following of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show"</a>. Ezrin returned to Toronto to convince Richardson to take on the band; Richardson did not want to work directly with such a group but agreed on condition that Ezrin took the lead.

The band and Ezrin did pre-production for the album in <a href="Pontiac%2C%20Michigan">Pontiac, Michigan</a>, in November and December 1970, and recorded at the RCA Mid-American Recording Center in Chicago in December. Richardson and Ezrin produced the album for Richardson's Nimbus 9 Productions, with Richardson as executive producer.

Ezrin, with his classical and folk background, attempted to have the band tighten the loosely structured songs. The band resisted at first but came to see things Ezrin's way, and ten to twelve hours a day of rehearsal resulted in a tight set of hard rock songs with little of the psychedelic freak-rock aesthetic of the first two albums. According to Cooper, Ezrin "ironed the songs out note by note, giving them coloring, personality". Ezrin rearranged "I'm Eighteen" from an eight-minute jam piece called "I Wish I Was 18 Again" to a taut three-minute rocker.

Both Buxton and Bruce used <a href="Gibson%20SG">Gibson SG</a> guitars and tended to double up, playing similar parts with subtle differences in phrasing and tone. Dunaway often played a moving <a href="counter-melody">counter-melody</a> bass part, rather than following the typical rock strategy of holding to the <a href="root%20%28chord%29">chord's root</a>.

Zappa had sold Straight Records to <a href="Warner%20Bros.%20Records">Warner Bros.</a> in 1970 for $50,000. That November the group released a single of "I'm Eighteen" backed with "Is It My Body"; and Warner Bros. agreed to allow the group to proceed with an album if the single sold well. The band posed as fans and made hundreds of calls to radio stations to request the song, and Gordon is said to have paid others a dollar per radio request. Soon the song was on the airwaves across the US—even on mainstream AM radio—and peaked at on the charts. The success of the single convinced Warner to contract Richardson to produce "Love It to Death".

Ezrin was intent on developing a cohesive sound for the album, and his earnestness was a source of humor for the band. At a time when <a href="the%20Beatles">the Beatles</a> had a reputation that made them seem beyond criticism, the Alice Cooper band intended "Second Coming" as a jab at the recently released track "<a href="The%20Long%20and%20Winding%20Road">The Long and Winding Road</a>" with <a href="Phil%20Spector">Phil Spector</a>'s elaborate production—the hyperbolic acclaim it received struck the band as if it were the <a href="Second%20Coming">Second Coming</a> of a master composer on the order of <a href="Ludwig%20van%20Beethoven">Beethoven</a>—as well as Ezrin's attempts to bring such production values to Alice Cooper's music. Ezrin did not realize the joke was largely at his expense. When recording the "I wanna get out of here" sequence of "Ballad of Dwight Fry", Ezrin had Cooper lie on the floor surrounded by a cage of metal chairs to create an element of realism to the singer's frantic screams. "Black Juju" was the only track recorded live in the studio. "I'm Eighteen" was a sixteen-track recording at 15 <a href="Inch%20per%20second">IPS</a>; other tracks were recorded at 30 IPS.

A dark, aggressive song whose lumbering, <a href="Distortion%20%28music%29">distorted</a> guitar riff is in E minor, "I'm Eighteen" was the band's first hit. In raspy vocals against <a href="Arpeggio">arpeggiated</a> guitar backing, the lyrics describe the existential anguish of being at the cusp of adulthood, decrying in each verse being "in the middle" of something, such as "life" or "doubt". The chorus switches to a series of <a href="power%20chord">power chord</a>s building from A, the vocals proclaiming: "I'm eighteen / And I don't know what I want ... I gotta get out of this place / I'll go runnin' in outer space". The song turns around at the conclusion with an embrace of those things that had caused such anguish: "I'm eighteen and I like it!"

"I'm Eighteen" comes between two straight-ahead rockers: "Long Way to Go" and album opener "Caught in a Dream". Both follow simple hard-rock , trading heavy riffing with guitar fills and solos. The album title derives from lyrics in "Long Way to Go". "Caught in a Dream" was the album's second single and features irreverent, tongue-in-cheek lyrics such as "I need everything the world owes me / I tell that to myself and I agree". The first side closes with "Black Juju" by bassist Dunaway, a lengthy track in the vein of <a href="The%20Doors">The Doors</a>, and <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>'s "<a href="Interstellar%20Overdrive">Interstellar Overdrive</a>"—both bands Alice Cooper earlier had opened for—with an organ part derived from Pink Floyd's "<a href="Set%20the%20Controls%20for%20the%20Heart%20of%20the%20Sun">Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun</a>". The band named the song after a stray dog in Pontiac.

"Is It My Body", the B-side to the "I'm Eighteen" single, opens the second side of the album. The verses pose the questions: "What have I got? / That makes you want to love me? / Is it my body?"—and declare in the chorus: "Have you got the time to find out / Who I really am?" "Hallowed Be My Name" follows with lyrics such as "Screaming at mothers / Cursing the Bible". "Second Coming" continues on the theme of religion: "... have no other gods before me / I'm the light / The devil's getting smarter all the time" The track developed from one of Cooper's lyrical fragments—"Time is getting closer / I read it on a poster"—and is set to a delicate piano by Ezrin.

"The Ballad of Dwight Fry" is a dramatic piece about the inmate of a mental asylum. It opens with a young girl's voice asking if her "Daddy" will "ever come home", against a childlike piano backdrop. The song shifts to <a href="acoustic%20guitar">acoustic guitar</a> and Cooper singing presumably in the persona of the girl's father, at first in a wavering almost-whisper. His voice builds with his persona's increasing instability, eventually shouting in the heavy, guitar-backed chorus: "See my only mind explode / Since I've gone away". After the second chorus there is a softer, creepy keyboard break written by Bruce but played by Ezrin, and when the vocals reappear they repeat "I wanna get out of here", at first tentative and imploring, before climaxing in the character's total mental breakdown and a return to the chorus. The song's main character is named for <a href="Dwight%20Frye">Dwight Frye</a>, an actor Hollywood media dubbed "the man with the thousand-watt stare" who portrayed <a href="Renfield">Renfield</a>, the lunatic slave of the titular vampire in the 1931 film "<a href="Dracula%20%281931%20English-language%20film%29">Dracula</a>" starring <a href="Bela%20Lugosi">Bela Lugosi</a>.

The album closes with a cover of "<a href="Sun%20Arise">Sun Arise</a>" by Australian entertainer <a href="Rolf%20Harris">Rolf Harris</a>. The upbeat pop song had been a show-opener for the band throughout 1970, and contrasts with the darkness of the rest of the album.

"I'm Eighteen" was the band's first top 40 in the US, a success that led to a recording deal with Warner Bros. Records. It spent eight weeks on the US charts, peaking at . In Canada it broke the top ten, peaking at .

"Love It to Death" was released on March 8, 1971; a British release of the album followed in June on the Straight label. "Love It to Death" was the first of the band's albums on which the members received individual credit for songs; previously the band as a whole was credited with all material. Although the original sleeve stated that the album was a Straight release, Straight had already been purchased by Warner Bros and the album bore Warner disc labels. The album reached on the US album charts, in Britain, and in Canada. The <a href="Recording%20Industry%20Association%20of%20America">RIAA</a> certified the album gold on November 6, 1972, and platinum on July 30, 2001. Alice Cooper was the first band on <a href="Warner%20Music%20Canada">Warner Music Canada</a>'s roster to sell more than 100,000 copies each of four albums in Canada. In 1973 the band was awarded platinum albums in Canada for "Love It to Death", "Killer", "School's Out", and "Billion Dollar Babies". The album first appeared on CD in October 1990.

The original cover shows the long-haired band members in dresses and makeup, and Cooper holding a cape around himself with his thumb sticking out to give the illusion of an exposed penis. This led <a href="Warner%20Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> to censor it—first that December by covering it with white strips, then by having the photo touched up with paint in pressings beginning in 1972. Both front and back cover photos were taken by Roger Prigent, credited as "Prigent". The <a href="gatefold">gatefold</a> features a close-up photo by Dave Griffith of Cooper's eyes heavily made-up with spidery eyelashes; in his pupils appear photos of the other band members.

"<a href="Caught%20in%20a%20Dream">Caught in a Dream</a>" was released as a single backed with "Hallowed Be My Name" on April 27, 1971; it peaked in the US at . The group supported the album with extensive touring. "Ballad of Dwight Fry" was a dramatized set piece in the live show, featuring an actress dressed as a nurse who dragged Cooper offstage and brought him back on <a href="straitjacket">straitjacket</a>ed in time for the second verse's "Sleepin' don't come very easy / In a strait white vest". At the song's climax, Cooper would break free of the straitjacket and hurl it into the audience. The Love It to Death tour of 1971 featured an <a href="electric%20chair">electric chair</a> in the earliest staged executions of the singer. These executions were to become an attraction of the band's shows, which became progressively more flamboyant; the shows in the <a href="Billion%20Dollar%20Babies">Billion Dollar Babies</a> tour of 1973 concluded with Cooper's execution by prop <a href="guillotine">guillotine</a>. The Love It to Death tour grossed so much the band bought a forty-two room mansion from <a href="Ann-Margret">Ann-Margret</a> in <a href="Greenwich%2C%20Connecticut">Greenwich, Connecticut</a>, which was to be its home base for the next few years.

The album garnered mixed reviews. "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" called the album "artfully absurd third-generation rock" and the group "the first stars of future rock". <a href="John%20Mendelsohn%20%28musician%29">John Mendelsohn</a> gave the album a favorable review in "Rolling Stone", writing that it "represents at least a modest oasis in the desert of dreary blue-jeaned aloofness served up in concert by most American rock-and-rollers". However, referring to "Black Juju" he also said that "the one bummer on this album is so loud a bummer that it may threaten to neutralize the ingratiating effect" of the other tracks. <a href="Robert%20Christgau">Robert Christgau</a> wrote in "<a href="The%20Village%20Voice">The Village Voice</a>", "The singles ('Caught in a Dream' and 'I'm Eighteen') are fantastic, but the album is freighted with <a href="Psychedelic%20music%23Post-psychedelic%20era">post-psychedelic</a> garbage, the kind of thing that's done better by the heavy metal kids down the block."

The band saw its popularity rise over the next several albums. "<a href="Killer%20%28Alice%20Cooper%20album%29">Killer</a>" followed in November 1971 and reached on the US charts, and the band finally topped those charts in 1973 with its sixth album, "Billion Dollar Babies". Unreleased <a href="Demo%20%28music%29">demos</a> of "Love It to Death" have circulated among fans; highlights include outtakes of "Ballad of Dwight Fry" with alternative lyrics, and early versions of "You Drive Me Nervous", which did not have an official release until it appeared on "Killer".

"Love It to Death" is seen as one of the foundational albums of the heavy metal sound, along with contemporary releases by <a href="Black%20Sabbath">Black Sabbath</a>, <a href="Led%20Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a>, <a href="Deep%20Purple">Deep Purple</a>, and others. A review in British magazine "<a href="Melody%20Maker">Melody Maker</a>" called it "an album for the punk and pimply crowd" a few years before <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> became a phenomenon. Pioneer punk band the <a href="Ramones">Ramones</a> found inspiration in Alice Cooper's music and "Love It to Death" in particular. Vocalist <a href="Joey%20Ramone">Joey Ramone</a> based the group's first song, "I Don't Care", on the chords of the main riff to "I'm Eighteen". <a href="John%20Lydon">John Lydon</a> wrote the song "Seventeen" on the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a> album "<a href="Never%20Mind%20the%20Bollocks%2C%20Here%27s%20the%20Sex%20Pistols">Never Mind the Bollocks</a>" in response to "I'm Eighteen", and is said to have auditioned for the Sex Pistols by miming to an Alice Cooper song—most frequently reported as "I'm Eighteen". "Love It to Death" inspired <a href="Pat%20Smear">Pat Smear</a> to pick up the guitar at age twelve; he went on to co-found the <a href="Germs%20%28band%29">Germs</a>, tour as second guitarist for <a href="Nirvana%20%28band%29">Nirvana</a>, and play rhythm guitar for the <a href="Foo%20Fighters">Foo Fighters</a>.

"<a href="Hit%20Parader">Hit Parader</a>" included "Love It to Death" in its heavy metal Hall of Fame in 1982, and placed the album twenty-first on its list of "Top 100 Metal Albums" in 1989. In 2003 it was ranked on "<a href="Rolling%20Stone">Rolling Stone</a>"s <a href="Rolling%20Stone%27s%20500%20Greatest%20Albums%20of%20All%20Time">500 Greatest Albums of All Time</a>. Greg Prato of <a href="AllMusic">AllMusic</a> called "Love It to Death" "an incredibly consistent listen from beginning to end" and "the release when everything began to come together for the band". To <a href="Pete%20Prown">Pete Prown</a> and <a href="HP%20Newquist">HP Newquist</a>, the groups's theatrical arrangements help its two guitarists " the all-too-common clichés" in their simple hard-rock riffing and soloing "that were part and parcel of early seventies rock".

The band was pleased with the collaboration with Ezrin, and he remained their producer (with the exception of "Muscle Of Love", released in 1973) until Cooper's first solo album, "<a href="Welcome%20to%20My%20Nightmare">Welcome to My Nightmare</a>" in 1975. "Love It to Death" launched Ezrin's own production career, which went on to include prominent albums such as <a href="Aerosmith">Aerosmith</a>'s "<a href="Get%20Your%20Wings">Get Your Wings</a>" (1974), <a href="Kiss%20%28band%29">Kiss</a>'s "<a href="Destroyer%20%28Kiss%20album%29">Destroyer</a>" (1976), and Pink Floyd's "<a href="The%20Wall">The Wall</a>" (1979).

Songs from "Love It to Death" continued to be frequent requests long after <a href="Alice%20Cooper">Cooper went solo</a>. In response, when writing material for his 1989 album "<a href="Trash%20%28Alice%20Cooper%20album%29">Trash</a>", Cooper and producer <a href="Desmond%20Child">Desmond Child</a> spent time listening to "Love it to Death" and the band's 1974 "<a href="Greatest%20Hits%20%28Alice%20Cooper%20album%29">Greatest Hits</a>" album to "find that vibe and match it to" a style appropriate to the 1990s.

<a href="Thrash%20metal">Thrash metal</a> band <a href="Anthrax%20%28American%20band%29">Anthrax</a> included a cover of "I'm Eighteen" on its debut album "<a href="Fistful%20of%20Metal">Fistful of Metal</a>" in 1984. <a href="Alternative%20metal">Alternative metal</a> band <a href="Melvins">the Melvins</a> covered "Second Coming" and "Ballad of Dwight Fry" on their album "<a href="Lysol%20%28album%29">Lysol</a>" in 1992. The song "Dreamin on the 1998 Kiss album "<a href="Psycho%20Circus">Psycho Circus</a>" bears such a resemblance to "I'm Eighteen" that a month after the album's release Cooper's publisher filed a plagiarism suit, settled out of court in Cooper's favor. Swedish <a href="death%20metal">death metal</a> band <a href="Entombed%20%28band%29">Entombed</a> released an EP in 1999 entitled "Black Juju" that included a cover of "Black Juju".
<a href="Alternative%20rock">Alternative rock</a> band <a href="Sonic%20Youth">Sonic Youth</a> recorded covers of "Hallowed Be My Name" (as "Hallowed Be Thy Name") and "Is It My Body"—the latter of which is bassist <a href="Kim%20Gordon">Kim Gordon</a>'s favorite of her own vocal performances. Gordon used the song's title for a 1993 essay on the artist <a href="Mike%20Kelley%20%28artist%29">Mike Kelley</a>, in which she described the Coopers as "anti-hippie[s] reveling in the aesthetics of the ugly". The essay appeared in 2014 in a collection by Gordon also titled "Is It My Body?"

0.999...

In <a href="mathematics">mathematics</a>, 0.999... (also written 0., among other ways), denotes the <a href="repeating%20decimal">repeating decimal</a> consisting of <a href="infinity">infinitely many</a> 9s after the <a href="decimal%20point">decimal point</a> (and one 0 before it). This repeating decimal represents the <a href="Infimum%20and%20supremum">smallest number no less than</a> every <a href="decimal%20number">decimal number</a> in the sequence (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...). This number is equal to 1. In other words, "0.999..." and "1" represent the same number. There are many ways of showing this equality, from intuitive arguments to <a href="mathematical%20rigor">mathematically rigorous</a> <a href="mathematical%20proof">proofs</a>. The technique used depends on target audience, background assumptions, historical context, and preferred development of the <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s, the system within which 0.999... is commonly defined. (In other systems, 0.999... can have the same meaning, a different definition, or be undefined.)

More generally, every nonzero <a href="repeating%20decimal">terminating decimal</a> has two equal representations (for example, 8.32 and 8.31999...), which is a property of all <a href="radix">base</a> representations. The utilitarian preference for the terminating decimal representation contributes to the misconception that it is the only representation. For this and other reasons—such as rigorous proofs relying on non-elementary techniques, properties, or disciplines—some people can find the equality sufficiently <a href="counterintuitive">counterintuitive</a> that they question or reject it. This has been the subject of several studies in <a href="mathematics%20education">mathematics education</a>.

There is an <a href="elementary%20proof">elementary proof</a> of the equation , which uses just the mathematical tools of comparison and addition of (finite) <a href="decimal%20number">decimal number</a>s, without any reference to more advanced topics such as <a href="series%20%28mathematics%29">series</a>, <a href="limit%20%28mathematics%29">limits</a>, formal <a href="construction%20of%20real%20numbers">construction of real numbers</a>, etc. The proof, an exercise given by , is a direct formalization of the intuitive fact that, if one draws 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc. on the <a href="number%20line">number line</a> there is no room left for placing a number between them and 1. The meaning of the notation 0.999... is the least point on the number line lying to the right of all of the numbers 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc. Because there is ultimately no room between 1 and these numbers, the point 1 must be this least point, and so .

If one places 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc. on the <a href="number%20line">number line</a>, one sees immediately that all these points are to the left of 1, and that they get closer and closer to 1.

More precisely, the distance from 0.9 to 1 is , the distance from 0.99 to 1 is , and so on. The distance to 1 from the th point (the one with 9s after the decimal point) is .

Therefore, if 1 were not the smallest number greater than 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc., then there would be a point on the number line that lies between 1 and all these points. This point would be at a distance from 1 that is less than for every <a href="integer">integer</a> . In the standard <a href="number%20system">number system</a>s (the <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s and the <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s), there is no number that is less than for all "n". This is (one version of) the <a href="Archimedean%20property">Archimedean property</a>, which can be proven to hold in the system of rational numbers. Therefore, 1 is the smallest number that is greater than all 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc., and so .

Part of what this argument shows is that there is a <a href="least%20upper%20bound">least upper bound</a> of the sequence 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, etc.: a smallest number that is greater than all of the terms of the sequence. One of the <a href="axiom">axiom</a>s of the <a href="real%20number%20system">real number system</a> is the <a href="completeness%20axiom">completeness axiom</a>, which states that every bounded sequence has a least upper bound. This least upper bound is one way to define infinite decimal expansions: the real number represented by an infinite decimal is the least upper bound of its finite truncations. The argument here does not need to assume completeness to be valid, because it shows that this particular sequence of rational numbers in fact has a least upper bound, and that this least upper bound is equal to one.

The previous explanation is not a proof, as one cannot define properly the relationship between a number and its representation as a point on the number line. For the accuracy of the proof, the number , with nines after the decimal point, is denoted . Thus , , , and so on. As , with digits after the decimal point, the addition rule for decimal numbers implies

and

for every <a href="positive%20integer">positive integer</a> .

One has to show that 1 is the smallest number that is no less than all . For this, it suffices to prove that, if a number is not larger than 1 and no less than all , then . So let such that

for every <a href="positive%20integer">positive integer</a> .
Therefore,

This implies that the difference between and is less than the inverse of any positive integer. Thus this difference must be zero, and, thus ; that is
This proof relies on the fact that zero is the only <a href="nonnegative%20number">nonnegative number</a> that is less than all inverses of integers, or equivalently that there is no number that is larger than every integer. This is the <a href="Archimedean%20property">Archimedean property</a>, that is verified for <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s and <a href="real%20number">real number</a>s. Real numbers may be enlarged into <a href="number%20systems">number systems</a>, such as <a href="hyperreal%20number">hyperreal number</a>s, with infinitely small numbers (<a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a>s) and infinitely large numbers (<a href="infinite%20number">infinite number</a>s). When using such systems, notation 0.999... is generally not used, as there is no smallest number that is no less than all . (This is implied by the fact that implies ).

The matter of overly simplified illustrations of the equality is a subject of pedagogical discussion and critique. discusses the argument that, in elementary school, one is taught that , so, ignoring all essential subtleties, "multiplying" this identity by gives . He further says that this argument is unconvincing, because of an unresolved ambiguity over the meaning of the <a href="equals%20sign">equals sign</a>; a student might think, "It surely does not mean that the number 1 is identical to that which is meant by the notation ." Most undergraduate mathematics majors encountered by Byers feel that while is "very close" to 1 on the strength of this argument, with some even saying that it is "infinitely close", they are not ready to say that it is equal to 1. discusses how "this argument gets its force from the fact that most people have been indoctrinated to accept the first equation without thinking", but also suggests that the argument may lead skeptics to question this assumption.

Byers also presents the following argument. Let
Students who did not accept the first argument sometimes accept the second argument, but, in Byers' opinion, still have not resolved the ambiguity, and therefore do not understand the representation for infinite decimals. , presenting the same argument, also state that it does not explain the equality, indicating that such an explanation would likely involve concepts of infinity and <a href="completeness%20axiom">completeness</a>. , citing , also conclude that the treatment of the identity based on such arguments as these, without the formal concept of a limit, is premature.

The same argument is also given by , who notes that skeptics may question whether is <a href="cancellable">cancellable</a>: whether it makes sense to subtract from both sides.

Since the question of 0.999... does not affect the formal development of mathematics, it can be postponed until one proves the standard theorems of <a href="real%20analysis">real analysis</a>. One requirement is to characterize real numbers that can be written in decimal notation, consisting of an optional sign, a finite sequence of one or more digits forming an integer part, a decimal separator, and a sequence of digits forming a fractional part. For the purpose of discussing 0.999..., the integer part can be summarized as "b" and one can neglect negatives, so a decimal expansion has the form
The fraction part, unlike the integer part, is not limited to finitely many digits. This is a <a href="positional%20notation">positional notation</a>, so for example the digit 5 in 500 contributes ten times as much as the 5 in 50, and the 5 in 0.05 contributes one tenth as much as the 5 in 0.5.

Perhaps the most common development of decimal expansions is to define them as sums of <a href="infinite%20series">infinite series</a>. In general:

For 0.999... one can apply the <a href="convergent%20series">convergence</a> theorem concerning <a href="geometric%20series">geometric series</a>:
Since 0.999... is such a sum with "a" = 9 and common ratio "r" = , the theorem makes short work of the question:
This proof appears as early as 1770 in <a href="Leonhard%20Euler">Leonhard Euler</a>'s "<a href="Elements%20of%20Algebra">Elements of Algebra</a>".
The sum of a geometric series is itself a result even older than Euler. A typical 18th-century derivation used a term-by-term manipulation similar to the <a href="%23Digit%20manipulation">algebraic proof</a> given above, and as late as 1811, Bonnycastle's textbook "An Introduction to Algebra" uses such an argument for geometric series to justify the same maneuver on 0.999... A 19th-century reaction against such liberal summation methods resulted in the definition that still dominates today: the sum of a series is "defined" to be the limit of the sequence of its partial sums. A corresponding proof of the theorem explicitly computes that sequence; it can be found in any proof-based introduction to calculus or analysis.

A <a href="sequence">sequence</a> ("x", "x", "x", ...) has a <a href="limit%20of%20a%20sequence">limit</a> "x" if the distance |"x" − "x"| becomes arbitrarily small as "n" increases. The statement that 0.999... = 1 can itself be interpreted and proven as a limit:
The first two equalities can be interpreted as symbol shorthand definitions. The remaining equalities can be proven. The last step, that → 0 as "n" → ∞, is often justified by the <a href="Archimedean%20property">Archimedean property</a> of the real numbers. This limit-based attitude towards 0.999... is often put in more evocative but less precise terms. For example, the 1846 textbook "The University Arithmetic" explains, ".999 +, continued to infinity = 1, because every annexation of a 9 brings the value closer to 1"; the 1895 "Arithmetic for Schools" says, "when a large number of 9s is taken, the difference between 1 and .99999... becomes inconceivably small". Such <a href="heuristic">heuristic</a>s are often interpreted by students as implying that 0.999... itself is less than 1.

The series definition above is a simple way to define the real number named by a decimal expansion. A complementary approach is tailored to the opposite process: for a given real number, define the decimal expansion(s) to name it.

If a real number "x" is known to lie in the <a href="closed%20interval">closed interval</a> [0, 10] (i.e., it is greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to 10), one can imagine dividing that interval into ten pieces that overlap only at their endpoints: [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], and so on up to [9, 10]. The number "x" must belong to one of these; if it belongs to [2, 3] then one records the digit "2" and subdivides that interval into [2, 2.1], [2.1, 2.2], ..., [2.8, 2.9], [2.9, 3]. Continuing this process yields an infinite sequence of <a href="nested%20intervals">nested intervals</a>, labeled by an infinite sequence of digits "b", "b", "b", "b", ..., and one writes

In this formalism, the identities 1 = 0.999... and 1 = 1.000... reflect, respectively, the fact that 1 lies in both [0, 1] and [1, 2], so one can choose either subinterval when finding its digits. To ensure that this notation does not abuse the "=" sign, one needs a way to reconstruct a unique real number for each decimal. This can be done with limits, but other constructions continue with the ordering theme.

One straightforward choice is the <a href="nested%20intervals%20theorem">nested intervals theorem</a>, which guarantees that given a sequence of nested, closed intervals whose lengths become arbitrarily small, the intervals contain exactly one real number in their <a href="intersection%20%28set%20theory%29">intersection</a>. So "b"."b""b""b"... is defined to be the unique number contained within all the intervals ["b", "b" + 1], ["b"."b", "b"."b" + 0.1], and so on. 0.999... is then the unique real number that lies in all of the intervals [0, 1], [0.9, 1], [0.99, 1], and [0.99...9, 1] for every finite string of 9s. Since 1 is an element of each of these intervals, 0.999... = 1.

The Nested Intervals Theorem is usually founded upon a more fundamental characteristic of the real numbers: the existence of <a href="least%20upper%20bound">least upper bound</a>s or "<a href="suprema">suprema</a>". To directly exploit these objects, one may define "b"."b""b""b"... to be the least upper bound of the set of approximants {"b", "b"."b", "b"."b""b", ...}. One can then show that this definition (or the nested intervals definition) is consistent with the subdivision procedure, implying 0.999... = 1 again. Tom Apostol concludes,

Some approaches explicitly define real numbers to be certain <a href="construction%20of%20the%20real%20numbers">structures built upon the rational numbers</a>, using <a href="axiomatic%20set%20theory">axiomatic set theory</a>. The <a href="natural%20number">natural number</a>s – 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on – begin with 0 and continue upwards, so that every number has a successor. One can extend the natural numbers with their negatives to give all the <a href="integer">integer</a>s, and to further extend to ratios, giving the <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s. These number systems are accompanied by the arithmetic of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More subtly, they include <a href="order%20theory">ordering</a>, so that one number can be compared to another and found to be less than, greater than, or equal to another number.

The step from rationals to reals is a major extension. There are at least two popular ways to achieve this step, both published in 1872: <a href="Dedekind%20cut">Dedekind cut</a>s and <a href="Cauchy%20sequence">Cauchy sequence</a>s. Proofs that 0.999... = 1 which directly use these constructions are not found in textbooks on real analysis, where the modern trend for the last few decades has been to use an axiomatic analysis. Even when a construction is offered, it is usually applied towards proving the axioms of the real numbers, which then support the above proofs. However, several authors express the idea that starting with a construction is more logically appropriate, and the resulting proofs are more self-contained.

In the <a href="Dedekind%20cut">Dedekind cut</a> approach, each real number "x" is defined as the "<a href="infinite%20set">infinite set</a> of all <a href="rational%20number">rational number</a>s less than x". In particular, the real number 1 is the set of all rational numbers that are less than 1. Every positive decimal expansion easily determines a Dedekind cut: the set of rational numbers which are less than some stage of the expansion. So the real number 0.999... is the set of rational numbers "r" such that "r" < 0, or "r" < 0.9, or "r" < 0.99, or "r" is less than some other number of the form
Every element of 0.999... is less than 1, so it is an element of the real number 1. Conversely, all elements of 1 are rational numbers that can be written as

with and .
This implies

and thus
and since

by the definition above, every element of 1 is also an element of 0.999..., and, combined with the proof above that every element of 0.999... is also an element of 1, the sets 0.999... and 1 contain the same rational numbers, and are therefore the same set, that is, 0.999... = 1.

The definition of real numbers as Dedekind cuts was first published by <a href="Richard%20Dedekind">Richard Dedekind</a> in 1872.
The above approach to assigning a real number to each decimal expansion is due to an expository paper titled "Is 0.999 ... = 1?" by Fred Richman in "<a href="Mathematics%20Magazine">Mathematics Magazine</a>", which is targeted at teachers of collegiate mathematics, especially at the junior/senior level, and their students. Richman notes that taking Dedekind cuts in any <a href="dense%20subset">dense subset</a> of the rational numbers yields the same results; in particular, he uses <a href="decimal%20fraction">decimal fraction</a>s, for which the proof is more immediate. He also notes that typically the definitions allow

Another approach is to define a real number as the limit of a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers. This construction of the real numbers uses the ordering of rationals less directly. First, the distance between "x" and "y" is defined as the absolute value |"x" − "y"|, where the absolute value |"z"| is defined as the maximum of "z" and −"z", thus never negative. Then the reals are defined to be the sequences of rationals that have the <a href="Cauchy%20sequence">Cauchy sequence</a> property using this distance. That is, in the sequence ("x", "x", "x", ...), a mapping from natural numbers to rationals, for any positive rational "δ" there is an "N" such that |"x" − "x"| ≤ "δ" for all "m", "n" > "N". (The distance between terms becomes smaller than any positive rational.)

If ("x") and ("y") are two Cauchy sequences, then they are defined to be equal as real numbers if the sequence ("x" − "y") has the limit 0. Truncations of the decimal number "b"."b""b""b"... generate a sequence of rationals which is Cauchy; this is taken to define the real value of the number. Thus in this formalism the task is to show that the sequence of rational numbers
has the limit 0. Considering the "n"th term of the sequence, for , it must therefore be shown that
This limit is plain if one understands the <a href="Limit%20of%20a%20sequence%23Formal%20Definition">definition of limit</a>. So again 0.999... = 1.

The definition of real numbers as Cauchy sequences was first published separately by <a href="Eduard%20Heine">Eduard Heine</a> and <a href="Georg%20Cantor">Georg Cantor</a>, also in 1872. The above approach to decimal expansions, including the proof that 0.999... = 1, closely follows Griffiths & Hilton's 1970 work "A comprehensive textbook of classical mathematics: A contemporary interpretation". The book is written specifically to offer a second look at familiar concepts in a contemporary light.

Commonly in <a href="secondary%20schools">secondary schools</a>' mathematics education, the real numbers are constructed by defining a number using an integer followed by a <a href="radix%20point">radix point</a> and an infinite sequence written out as a string to represent the <a href="fractional%20part">fractional part</a> of any given real number. In this construction, the set of any combination of an integer and digits after the decimal point (or radix point in non-base 10 systems) is the set of real numbers. This construction can be rigorously shown to satisfy all of the <a href="Real%20number%23Axiomatic%20approach">real axioms</a> after defining an <a href="equivalence%20relation">equivalence relation</a> over the set that defines 1 = 0.999... as well as for any other nonzero decimals with only finitely many nonzero terms in the decimal string with its trailing 9s version. With this construction of the reals, all proofs of the statement "1 = 0.999..." can be viewed as implicitly assuming the equality when any operations are performed on the real numbers.

The result that 0.999... = 1 generalizes readily in two ways. First, every nonzero number with a finite decimal notation (equivalently, endless trailing 0s) has a counterpart with trailing 9s. For example, 0.24999... equals 0.25, exactly as in the special case considered. These numbers are exactly the decimal fractions, and they are <a href="Dense%20set">dense</a>.

Second, a comparable theorem applies in each radix or <a href="base%20%28exponentiation%29">base</a>. For example, in base 2 (the <a href="binary%20numeral%20system">binary numeral system</a>) 0.111... equals 1, and in base 3 (the <a href="ternary%20numeral%20system">ternary numeral system</a>) 0.222... equals 1. In general, any terminating base "b" expression has a counterpart with repeated trailing digits equal to "b" − 1. Textbooks of real analysis are likely to skip the example of 0.999... and present one or both of these generalizations from the start.

Alternative representations of 1 also occur in non-integer bases. For example, in the <a href="golden%20ratio%20base">golden ratio base</a>, the two standard representations are 1.000... and 0.101010..., and there are infinitely many more representations that include adjacent 1s. Generally, for <a href="almost%20all">almost all</a> "q" between 1 and 2, there are uncountably many base-"q" expansions of 1. On the other hand, there are still uncountably many "q" (including all natural numbers greater than 1) for which there is only one base-"q" expansion of 1, other than the trivial 1.000... This result was first obtained by <a href="Paul%20Erd%C5%91s">Paul Erdős</a>, Miklos Horváth, and István Joó around 1990. In 1998 Vilmos Komornik and Paola Loreti determined the smallest such base, the <a href="Komornik%E2%80%93Loreti%20constant">Komornik–Loreti constant</a> "q" = 1.787231650... In this base, 1 = 0.11010011001011010010110011010011...; the digits are given by the <a href="Thue%E2%80%93Morse%20sequence">Thue–Morse sequence</a>, which does not repeat.

A more far-reaching generalization addresses <a href="non-standard%20positional%20numeral%20systems">the most general positional numeral systems</a>. They too have multiple representations, and in some sense the difficulties are even worse. For example:

That all these different number systems suffer from multiple representations for some real numbers can be attributed to a fundamental difference between the real numbers as an ordered set and collections of infinite strings of symbols, ordered <a href="lexicographic%20ordering">lexicographically</a>. Indeed, the following two properties account for the difficulty:

The first point follows from basic properties of the real numbers: "L" has a <a href="supremum">supremum</a> and "R" has an <a href="infimum">infimum</a>, which are easily seen to be equal; being a real number it either lies in "R" or in "L", but not both since "L" and "R" are supposed to be <a href="disjoint%20sets">disjoint</a>. The second point generalizes the 0.999.../1.000... pair obtained for "p" = "0", "p" = "1". In fact one need not use the same alphabet for all positions (so that for instance <a href="mixed%20radix">mixed radix</a> systems can be included) or consider the full collection of possible strings; the only important points are that at each position a <a href="finite%20set">finite set</a> of symbols (which may even depend on the previous symbols) can be chosen from (this is needed to ensure maximal and minimal choices), and that making a valid choice for any position should result in a valid infinite string (so one should not allow "9" in each position while forbidding an infinite succession of "9"s). Under these assumptions, the above argument shows that an <a href="monotonic">order preserving</a> map from the collection of strings to an interval of the real numbers cannot be a <a href="bijection">bijection</a>: either some numbers do not correspond to any string, or some of them correspond to more than one string.

Marko Petkovšek has proven that for any positional system that names all the real numbers, the set of reals with multiple representations is always dense. He calls the proof "an instructive exercise in elementary <a href="point-set%20topology">point-set topology</a>"; it involves viewing sets of positional values as <a href="Stone%20space">Stone space</a>s and noticing that their real representations are given by <a href="continuous%20function%20%28topology%29">continuous functions</a>.

One application of 0.999... as a representation of 1 occurs in elementary <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>. In 1802, H. Goodwin published an observation on the appearance of 9s in the repeating-decimal representations of fractions whose denominators are certain <a href="prime%20number">prime number</a>s. Examples include:
E. Midy proved a general result about such fractions, now called "<a href="Midy%27s%20theorem">Midy's theorem</a>", in 1836. The publication was obscure, and it is unclear if his proof directly involved 0.999..., but at least one modern proof by W. G. Leavitt does. If it can be proved that if a decimal of the form 0."b""b""b"... is a positive integer, then it must be 0.999..., which is then the source of the 9s in the theorem. Investigations in this direction can motivate such concepts as <a href="greatest%20common%20divisor">greatest common divisor</a>s, <a href="modular%20arithmetic">modular arithmetic</a>, <a href="Fermat%20prime">Fermat prime</a>s, <a href="order%20%28group%20theory%29">order</a> of <a href="group%20%28mathematics%29">group</a> elements, and <a href="quadratic%20reciprocity">quadratic reciprocity</a>.
Returning to real analysis, the base-3 analogue 0.222... = 1 plays a key role in a characterization of one of the simplest <a href="fractal">fractal</a>s, the middle-thirds <a href="Cantor%20set">Cantor set</a>:

The "n"th digit of the representation reflects the position of the point in the "n"th stage of the construction. For example, the point is given the usual representation of 0.2 or 0.2000..., since it lies to the right of the first deletion and to the left of every deletion thereafter. The point is represented not as 0.1 but as 0.0222..., since it lies to the left of the first deletion and to the right of every deletion thereafter.

Repeating nines also turn up in yet another of Georg Cantor's works. They must be taken into account to construct a valid proof, applying <a href="Cantor%27s%20diagonal%20argument">his 1891 diagonal argument</a> to decimal expansions, of the <a href="uncountability">uncountability</a> of the unit interval. Such a proof needs to be able to declare certain pairs of real numbers to be different based on their decimal expansions, so one needs to avoid pairs like 0.2 and 0.1999... A simple method represents all numbers with nonterminating expansions; the opposite method rules out repeating nines. A variant that may be closer to Cantor's original argument actually uses base 2, and by turning base-3 expansions into base-2 expansions, one can prove the uncountability of the Cantor set as well.

Students of mathematics often reject the equality of 0.999... and 1, for reasons ranging from their disparate appearance to deep misgivings over the <a href="Limit%20of%20a%20sequence">limit</a> concept and disagreements over the nature of <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a>s. There are many common contributing factors to the confusion:

These ideas are mistaken in the context of the standard real numbers, although some may be valid in other number systems, either invented for their general mathematical utility or as instructive <a href="counterexample">counterexample</a>s to better understand 0.999...

Many of these explanations were found by <a href="David%20Tall">David Tall</a>, who has studied characteristics of teaching and cognition that lead to some of the misunderstandings he has encountered in his college students. Interviewing his students to determine why the vast majority initially rejected the equality, he found that "students continued to conceive of 0.999... as a sequence of numbers getting closer and closer to 1 and not a fixed value, because 'you haven't specified how many places there are' or 'it is the nearest possible decimal below 1.

The elementary argument of multiplying 0.333... = by 3 can convince reluctant students that 0.999... = 1. Still, when confronted with the conflict between their belief of the first equation and their disbelief of the second, some students either begin to disbelieve the first equation or simply become frustrated. Nor are more sophisticated methods foolproof: students who are fully capable of applying rigorous definitions may still fall back on intuitive images when they are surprised by a result in advanced mathematics, including 0.999... For example, one real analysis student was able to prove that 0.333... = using a <a href="supremum">supremum</a> definition, but then insisted that 0.999... < 1 based on her earlier understanding of long division. Others still are able to prove that = 0.333..., but, upon being confronted by the <a href="%23Fractions">fractional proof</a>, insist that "logic" supersedes the mathematical calculations.

<a href="Joseph%20Mazur">Joseph Mazur</a> tells the tale of an otherwise brilliant calculus student of his who "challenged almost everything I said in class but never questioned his calculator," and who had come to believe that nine digits are all one needs to do mathematics, including calculating the square root of 23. The student remained uncomfortable with a limiting argument that 9.99... = 10, calling it a "wildly imagined infinite growing process."

As part of Ed Dubinsky's <a href="APOS%20theory">APOS theory</a> of mathematical learning, he and his collaborators (2005) propose that students who conceive of 0.999... as a finite, indeterminate string with an infinitely small distance from 1 have "not yet constructed a complete process conception of the infinite decimal". Other students who have a complete process conception of 0.999... may not yet be able to "encapsulate" that process into an "object conception", like the object conception they have of 1, and so they view the process 0.999... and the object 1 as incompatible. Dubinsky "et al." also link this mental ability of encapsulation to viewing as a number in its own right and to dealing with the set of natural numbers as a whole.

With the rise of the <a href="Internet">Internet</a>, debates about 0.999... have become commonplace on <a href="newsgroup">newsgroup</a>s and <a href="message%20board">message board</a>s, including many that nominally have little to do with mathematics. In the newsgroup , arguing over 0.999... is described as a "popular sport", and it is one of the questions answered in its <a href="FAQ">FAQ</a>. The FAQ briefly covers , multiplication by 10, and limits, and it alludes to Cauchy sequences as well.

A 2003 edition of the general-interest newspaper column "<a href="The%20Straight%20Dope">The Straight Dope</a>" discusses 0.999... via and limits, saying of misconceptions,
A "<a href="Slate%20%28magazine%29">Slate</a>" article reports that the concept of 0.999... is "hotly disputed on websites ranging from "<a href="World%20of%20Warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>" message boards to <a href="Ayn%20Rand">Ayn Rand</a> forums". In the same vein, the question of 0.999... proved such a popular topic in the first seven years of <a href="Blizzard%20Entertainment">Blizzard Entertainment</a>'s <a href="Battle.net">Battle.net</a> forums that the company issued a "press release" on <a href="April%20Fools%27%20Day">April Fools' Day</a> 2004 that it is 1:

Two proofs are then offered, based on limits and multiplication by 10.

0.999... features also in <a href="mathematical%20joke">mathematical joke</a>s, such as:
Although the real numbers form an extremely useful <a href="number%20system">number system</a>, the decision to interpret the notation "0.999..." as naming a real number is ultimately a convention, and <a href="Timothy%20Gowers">Timothy Gowers</a> argues in "Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction" that the resulting identity 0.999... = 1 is a convention as well:

One can define other number systems using different rules or new objects; in some such number systems, the above proofs would need to be reinterpreted and one might find that, in a given number system, 0.999... and 1 might not be identical. However, many number systems are extensions of, rather than independent alternatives to, the real number system, so 0.999... = 1 continues to hold. Even in such number systems, though, it is worthwhile to examine alternative number systems, not only for how 0.999... behaves (if, indeed, a number expressed as "0.999..." is both meaningful and unambiguous), but also for the behavior of related phenomena. If such phenomena differ from those in the real number system, then at least one of the assumptions built into the system must break down.

Some proofs that 0.999... = 1 rely on the <a href="Archimedean%20property">Archimedean property</a> of the real numbers: that there are no nonzero <a href="infinitesimal">infinitesimal</a>s. Specifically, the difference 1 − 0.999... must be smaller than any positive rational number, so it must be an infinitesimal; but since the reals do not contain nonzero infinitesimals, the difference is therefore zero, and therefore the two values are the same.

However, there are mathematically coherent ordered <a href="algebraic%20structure">algebraic structure</a>s, including various alternatives to the real numbers, which are non-Archimedean. <a href="Non-standard%20analysis">Non-standard analysis</a> provides a number system with a full array of infinitesimals (and their inverses). <a href="A.%20H.%20Lightstone">A. H. Lightstone</a> developed a decimal expansion for <a href="hyperreal%20number">hyperreal number</a>s in (0, 1). Lightstone shows how to associate to each number a sequence of digits,

indexed by the <a href="hypernatural">hypernatural</a> numbers. While he does not directly discuss 0.999..., he shows the real number is represented by 0.333...;...333... which is a consequence of the <a href="transfer%20principle">transfer principle</a>. As a consequence the number 0.999...;...999... = 1. With this type of decimal representation, not every expansion represents a number. In particular "0.333...;...000..." and "0.999...;...000..." do not correspond to any number.

The standard definition of the number 0.999... is the <a href="limit%20of%20a%20sequence">limit of the sequence</a> 0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ... A different definition involves what <a href="Terry%20Tao">Terry Tao</a> refers to as "ultralimit", i.e., the equivalence class [(0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...)] of this sequence in the <a href="ultrapower%20construction">ultrapower construction</a>, which is a number that falls short of 1 by an infinitesimal amount. More generally, the hyperreal number with last digit 9 at infinite <a href="hypernatural">hypernatural</a> rank "H", satisfies a strict inequality Accordingly, an alternative interpretation for "zero followed by infinitely many 9s" could be
All such interpretations of "0.999..." are infinitely close to 1. <a href="Ian%20Stewart%20%28mathematician%29">Ian Stewart</a> characterizes this interpretation as an "entirely reasonable" way to rigorously justify the intuition that "there's a little bit missing" from 1 in 0.999... Along with Katz & Katz, Robert Ely also questions the assumption that students' ideas about are erroneous intuitions about the real numbers, interpreting them rather as "nonstandard" intuitions that could be valuable in the learning of calculus.
Jose Benardete in his book "Infinity: An essay in metaphysics" argues that some natural pre-mathematical intuitions cannot be expressed if one is limited to an overly restrictive number system:
<a href="Combinatorial%20game%20theory">Combinatorial game theory</a> provides alternative reals as well, with infinite Blue-Red <a href="Hackenbush">Hackenbush</a> as one particularly relevant example. In 1974, <a href="Elwyn%20Berlekamp">Elwyn Berlekamp</a> described a correspondence between Hackenbush strings and binary expansions of real numbers, motivated by the idea of <a href="data%20compression">data compression</a>. For example, the value of the Hackenbush string LRRLRLRL... is 0.010101... = . However, the value of LRLLL... (corresponding to 0.111...) is infinitesimally less than 1. The difference between the two is the <a href="surreal%20number">surreal number</a> , where ω is the first <a href="ordinal%20number">infinite ordinal</a>; the relevant game is LRRRR... or 0.000...

This is in fact true of the binary expansions of many rational numbers, where the values of the numbers are equal but the corresponding binary tree paths are different. For example, 0.10111... = 0.11000..., which are both equal to 3/4, but the first representation corresponds to the binary tree path LRLRLLL... while the second corresponds to the different path LRLLRRR...

Another manner in which the proofs might be undermined is if 1 − 0.999... simply does not exist, because subtraction is not always possible. Mathematical structures with an addition operation but not a subtraction operation include <a href="commutative">commutative</a> <a href="semigroup">semigroup</a>s, <a href="commutative%20monoid">commutative monoid</a>s and <a href="semiring">semiring</a>s. Richman considers two such systems, designed so that 0.999... < 1.

First, Richman defines a nonnegative "decimal number" to be a literal decimal expansion. He defines the <a href="lexicographical%20order">lexicographical order</a> and an addition operation, noting that 0.999... < 1 simply because 0 < 1 in the ones place, but for any nonterminating "x", one has 0.999... + "x" = 1 + "x". So one peculiarity of the decimal numbers is that addition cannot always be cancelled; another is that no decimal number corresponds to . After defining multiplication, the decimal numbers form a positive, totally ordered, commutative semiring.

In the process of defining multiplication, Richman also defines another system he calls "cut "D"", which is the set of <a href="Dedekind%20cut">Dedekind cut</a>s of decimal fractions. Ordinarily this definition leads to the real numbers, but for a decimal fraction "d" he allows both the cut (−∞, "d" ) and the "principal cut" (−∞, "d" <nowiki>]</nowiki>. The result is that the real numbers are "living uneasily together with" the decimal fractions. Again 0.999... < 1. There are no positive infinitesimals in cut "D", but there is "a sort of negative infinitesimal," 0, which has no decimal expansion. He concludes that 0.999... = 1 + 0, while the equation "0.999... + "x" = 1" has no solution.

When asked about 0.999..., novices often believe there should be a "final 9", believing 1 − 0.999... to be a positive number which they write as "0.000...1". Whether or not that makes sense, the intuitive goal is clear: adding a 1 to the final 9 in 0.999... would carry all the 9s into 0s and leave a 1 in the ones place. Among other reasons, this idea fails because there is no "final 9" in 0.999... However, there is a system that contains an infinite string of 9s including a last 9.

The <a href="p-adic%20number">"p"-adic numbers</a> are an alternative number system of interest in <a href="number%20theory">number theory</a>. Like the real numbers, the "p"-adic numbers can be built from the rational numbers via <a href="Cauchy%20sequence">Cauchy sequence</a>s; the construction uses a different metric in which 0 is closer to "p", and much closer to "p", than it is to 1. The "p"-adic numbers form a <a href="field%20%28algebra%29">field</a> for prime "p" and a <a href="ring%20%28mathematics%29">ring</a> for other "p", including 10. So arithmetic can be performed in the "p"-adics, and there are no infinitesimals.

In the 10-adic numbers, the analogues of decimal expansions run to the left. The 10-adic expansion ...999 does have a last 9, and it does not have a first 9. One can add 1 to the ones place, and it leaves behind only 0s after carrying through: 1 + ...999 = ...000 = 0, and so ...999 = −1. Another derivation uses a geometric series. The infinite series implied by "...999" does not converge in the real numbers, but it converges in the 10-adics, and so one can re-use the familiar formula:
(Compare with the series <a href="%23Infinite%20series%20and%20sequences">above</a>.) A third derivation was invented by a seventh-grader who was doubtful over her teacher's limiting argument that 0.999... = 1 but was inspired to take the multiply-by-10 proof <a href="%23Digit%20manipulation">above</a> in the opposite direction: if "x" = ...999 then 10"x" =  ...990, so 10"x" = "x" − 9, hence "x" = −1 again.

As a final extension, since 0.999... = 1 (in the reals) and ...999 = −1 (in the 10-adics), then by "blind faith and unabashed juggling of symbols" one may add the two equations and arrive at ...999.999... = 0. This equation does not make sense either as a 10-adic expansion or an ordinary decimal expansion, but it turns out to be meaningful and true if one develops a theory of "double-decimals" with eventually repeating left ends to represent a familiar system: the real numbers.

The philosophy of <a href="ultrafinitism">ultrafinitism</a> rejects as meaningless concepts dealing with infinite sets, such as idea that the notation formula_1 might stand for a decimal number with an "infinite sequence of nines", as well as the summation of infinitely many numbers formula_2 corresponding to the positional values of the decimal digits in that infinite string. In this approach to mathematics, only some particular (fixed) number of finite decimal digits is meaningful. Instead of "equality", one has "approximate equality", which is equality up to the number of decimal digits that one is permitted to compute. Although Katz and Katz argue that ultrafinitism may capture the student intuition that 0.999... ought to be less than 1, the ideas of ultrafinitism do not enjoy widespread acceptance in the mathematical community, and the philosophy lacks a generally agreed-upon formal mathematical foundation.

Myxobolus cerebralis

Myxobolus cerebralis is a <a href="myxosporea">myxosporea</a>n <a href="parasite">parasite</a> of <a href="salmonidae">salmonid</a>s (<a href="salmon">salmon</a>, <a href="trout">trout</a>, and their allies) that causes whirling disease in <a href="fish%20farming">farmed</a> salmon and trout and also in <a href="Wild%20fisheries">wild fish populations</a>. It was first described in <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> in Germany a century ago, but its range has spread and it has appeared in most of Europe (including Russia), the United States, South Africa, Canada and other countries. In the 1980s, "M. cerebralis" was found to require a <a href="tubificidae">tubificid</a> <a href="oligochaete">oligochaete</a> (a kind of <a href="segmented%20worm">segmented worm</a>) to complete its life cycle. The parasite infects its hosts with its cells after piercing them with <a href="polar%20filament">polar filament</a>s ejected from <a href="nematocyst">nematocyst</a>-like capsules.

Whirling disease afflicts <a href="juvenile%20fish">juvenile fish</a> (fingerlings and fry) and causes <a href="skeleton">skeletal</a> deformation and <a href="neural">neurological</a> damage. Fish "whirl" forward in an awkward, corkscrew-like pattern instead of swimming normally, find feeding difficult, and are more vulnerable to <a href="predator">predator</a>s. The mortality rate is high for fingerlings, up to 90% of infected populations, and those that do survive are deformed by the parasites residing in their <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> and <a href="bone">bone</a>. They act as a reservoir for the parasite, which is released into water following the fish's death. "M. cerebralis" is one of the most economically important myxozoans in fish, as well as one of the most pathogenic. It was the first myxosporean whose pathology and symptoms were described scientifically. The parasite is not transmissible to humans.

The <a href="Taxonomy%20%28biology%29">taxonomy</a> and naming of both "M. cerebralis", and of <a href="myxozoan">myxozoan</a>s in general, have complicated histories. It was originally thought to infect fish brains (hence the <a href="specific%20name%20%28zoology%29">specific epithet</a> "cerebralis") and <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>s, though it soon was found to primarily infect <a href="cartilage">cartilage</a> and <a href="skeleton">skeletal tissue</a>. Attempts to change the name to "Myxobolus chondrophagus", which would more accurately describe the organism, failed because of <a href="binomial%20nomenclature">nomenclature rules</a>. Later, the organisms previously called "Triactinomyxon dubium" and "T. gyrosalmo" (<a href="class%20%28biology%29">class</a> <a href="Actinosporea">Actinosporea</a>) were found to be, in fact, triactinomyxon stages of "M. cerebralis", the life cycle of which was expanded to include the triactinomyxon stage. Similarly, other actinosporeans were folded into the life cycles of various myxosporeans.

Today, the myxozoans, previously thought to be multicellular <a href="protozoans">protozoans</a>, are considered <a href="animal">animal</a>s by most scientists, though their status has not officially changed. Recent molecular studies suggest they are related to <a href="Bilateria">Bilateria</a> or <a href="Cnidaria">Cnidaria</a>, with Cnidaria being closer morphologically because both groups have extrusive filaments. Bilateria were somewhat closer in some genetic studies, but those were found to have used samples that were contaminated by material from the host organism, and a 2015 study confirms they are cnidarians.

"M. cerebralis" has many diverse stages ranging from single <a href="cell%20%28biology%29">cells</a> to relatively large spores, not all of which have been studied in detail.

The stages that infect fish, called <a href="triactinomyxon">triactinomyxon</a> spores, are made of a single style that is about 150 <a href="micrometre">micrometers</a> (µm) long and three processes or "tails", each about 200 micrometers long. A <a href="sporoplasm">sporoplasm</a> packet at the end of the style contains 64 germ cells surrounded by a cellular envelope. There are also three <a href="polar%20capsule">polar capsule</a>s, each of which contains a coiled <a href="polar%20filament">polar filament</a> between 170 and 180 µm long. Polar filaments in both this stage and in the <a href="myxospore">myxospore</a> stage (see picture above) rapidly shoot into the body of the host, creating an opening through which the sporoplasm can enter.

Upon contact with fish hosts and firing of the polar capsules, the sporoplasm contained within the central style of the triactinomyxon migrates into the epithelium or gut lining. Firstly, this sporoplasm undergoes <a href="mitosis">mitosis</a> to produce more <a href="amoeboid">amoeboid</a> cells, which migrate into deeper tissue layers, to reach the cerebral cartilage.

Myxospores, which develop from <a href="sporogonic">sporogonic</a> cell stages inside fish hosts, are lenticular. They have a diameter of about 10 micrometers and are made of six cells. Two of these cells form polar capsules, two merge to form a binucleate sporoplasm, and two form protective valves. Myxospores are infective to oligochaetes, and are found among the remains of digested fish cartilage. They are often difficult to distinguish from related species because of morphological similarities across <a href="genus">genera</a>. Though "M. cerebralis" is the only myxosporean ever found in salmonid cartilage, other visually similar species may be present in the skin, <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a>, or <a href="muscle">muscle</a>.

"Myxobolus cerebralis" has a two-host life cycle involving a salmonid fish and a tubificid oligochaete. So far, the only worm known to be susceptible to "M. cerebralis" infection is "<a href="Tubifex%20tubifex">Tubifex tubifex</a>", though what scientists currently call "T. tubifex" may in fact be more than one species. First, myxospores are ingested by tubificid worms. In the <a href="Gut%20%28zoology%29">gut</a> <a href="lumen%20%28anatomy%29">lumen</a> of the worm, the spores extrude their <a href="polar%20capsule">polar capsule</a>s and attach to the gut <a href="epithelium">epithelium</a> by <a href="polar%20filament">polar filament</a>s. The shell valves then open along the suture line and the binucleate germ cell penetrates between the intestinal epithelial cells of the worm. This cell multiplies, producing many <a href="amoeboid">amoeboid</a> cells by an asexual cell <a href="Binary%20fission">fission</a> process called <a href="Protozoal%20merogony">merogony</a>. As a result of the multiplication process, the intercellular space of the epithelial cells in more than 10 neighbouring worm segments may become infected.

Around 60–90 days postinfection, sexual cell stages of the parasite undergo <a href="sporogenesis">sporogenesis</a>, and develop into <a href="pansporocyst">pansporocyst</a>s, each of which contains eight triactinomyxon-stage spores. These spores are released from the oligochaete anus into the water. Alternatively, a fish can become infected by eating an infected oligochaete. Infected tubificids can release triactinomyxons for at least a year. The triactinomyxon spores are carried by the water currents, where they can infect a salmonid through the skin. Penetration of the fish by these spores takes only a few seconds. Within five minutes, a sac of germ cells called a <a href="sporoplasm">sporoplasm</a> has entered the fish <a href="Epidermis%20%28skin%29">epidermis</a>, and within a few hours, the sporoplasm splits into individual cells that will spread through the fish.

Within the fish, both intracellular and extracellular stages reproduce in its cartilage by asexual <a href="Endogeny%20%28biology%29">endogeny</a>, meaning new cells grow from within old cells. The final stage within the fish is the creation of the myxospore, which is formed by <a href="sporogony">sporogony</a>. They are released into the environment when the fish decomposes or is eaten. Some recent research indicates some fish may expel viable myxospores while still alive.

Myxospores are extremely tough: "it was shown that "Myxobolus cerebralis" spores can tolerate freezing at −20°C for at least 3 months, aging in mud at 13°C for at least 5 months, and passage through the guts of <a href="northern%20pike">northern pike</a> "Esox lucius" or <a href="mallard">mallard</a>s "Anas platyrhynchos" without loss of infectivity" to worms. Triactinomyxons are much shorter-lived, surviving 34 days or less, depending on temperature.

"M. cerebralis" infections have been reported from a wide range of salmonid species: eight species of "Atlantic" salmonids, "<a href="Salmo">Salmo</a>"; four species of "Pacific" salmonids, "<a href="Oncorhynchus">Oncorhynchus</a>"; four species of char, "<a href="Salvelinus">Salvelinus</a>"; the grayling, "<a href="Thymallus%20thymallus">Thymallus thymallus</a>"; and the huchen, "<a href="Hucho%20hucho">Hucho hucho</a>". "M. cerebralis" causes damage to its fish hosts through attachment of triactinomyxon spores and the migrations of various stages through tissues and along nerves, as well as by digesting cartilage. The fish's tail may darken, but aside from lesions on cartilage, internal organs generally appear healthy. Other symptoms include skeletal deformities and "whirling" behavior (tail-chasing) in young fish, which was thought to have been caused by a loss of equilibrium, but is actually caused by damage to the spinal cord and lower brain stem. Experiments have shown that fish can kill "Myxobolus" in their skin (possibly using <a href="antibodies">antibodies</a>), but that the fish do not attack the parasites once they have migrated to the central nervous system. This response varies from species to species.

In "T. tubifex", the release of triactinomyxon spores from the <a href="intestine">intestinal</a> wall damages the worm's <a href="mucosa">mucosa</a>; this may happen thousands of times in a single worm, and is believed to impair nutrient absorption. Spores are released from the worm almost exclusively when the temperature is between 10 °C and 15 °C, so fish in warmer or cooler waters are less likely to be infected, and infection rates vary seasonally.

Fish size, age, concentration of triactinomyxon spores, and water temperature all affect infection rates in fish, as does the species of the fish in question. The disease has the most impact on fish less than five months old because their skeletons have not <a href="ossification">ossified</a>. This makes young fish more susceptible to deformities and provides "M. cerebralis" more cartilage on which to feed. In one study of seven species of many strains, <a href="brook%20trout">brook trout</a> and <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> (except one strain) were far more heavily affected by "M. cerebralis" after two hours of exposure than other species were, while <a href="bull%20trout">bull trout</a>, <a href="Chinook%20salmon">Chinook salmon</a>, <a href="brown%20trout">brown trout</a>, and <a href="Arctic%20grayling">Arctic grayling</a> were least severely affected. While brown trout may harbor the parasite, they typically do not show any symptoms, and this species may have been "M. cerebralis"' original host. This lack of symptoms in brown trout meant that the parasite was only discovered after nonnative rainbow trouts were introduced in Europe.

Moderate or heavy clinical infection of fish with whirling disease can be presumptively diagnosed on the basis of changes in behavior and appearance about 35 to 80 days after initial infection, though "injury or deficiency in dietary <a href="tryptophan">tryptophan</a> and <a href="ascorbic%20acid">ascorbic acid</a> can evoke similar signs", so conclusive diagnosis may require finding myxospores in the fish's cartilage. In heavy infections, only examining cartilage microscopically may be needed to find spores. In less severe infections, the most common test involves digestion of the cranial cartilage with the <a href="protease">protease</a>s <a href="pepsin">pepsin</a> and <a href="trypsin">trypsin</a> (pepsin-trypsin digest—PTD) before looking for spores. The head and other tissues can be further examined using <a href="histopathology">histopathology</a> to confirm whether the location and morphology of the spores matches what is known for "M. cerebralis". Serological identification of spores in tissue sections using an <a href="antibody">antibody</a> raised against the spores is also possible. Parasite identity can also be confirmed using the <a href="polymerase%20chain%20reaction">polymerase chain reaction</a> to amplify the 415 base pair <a href="18S%20rRNA">18S rRNA</a> <a href="gene">gene</a> from "M. cerebralis". Fish should be screened at the life stage most susceptible to the parasites, with particular focus on fish in aquaculture units.

Although originally a mild pathogen of <a href="Brown%20trout">"Salmo trutta"</a> in central Europe and other salmonids in northeast Asia, the introduction of the <a href="rainbow%20trout">rainbow trout</a> ("Oncorhynchus mykiss") has greatly increased the impact of this parasite. Having no innate immunity to "M. cerebralis", rainbow trout are particularly susceptible, and can release so many spores that even more resistant species in the same area, such as "S. trutta", can become overloaded with parasites and incur 80%–90% mortalities. Where "M. cerebralis" has become well-established, it has caused decline or even elimination of whole cohorts of fish.

The impact of "M. cerebralis" in Europe is somewhat lessened because the species is endemic to this region, giving native <a href="fish%20stock">fish stock</a>s a degree of <a href="immunity%20%28medical%29">immunity</a>. Rainbow trout, the most susceptible species to this parasite, are not native to Europe; successfully reproducing <a href="feral">feral</a> populations are rare, so few wild rainbow trout are young enough to be susceptible to infection. On the other hand, they are widely reared for restocking <a href="fishing%23Recreational%20fishing">sport-fishing</a> waters and for <a href="aquaculture">aquaculture</a>, where this parasite has its greatest impact. Hatching and rearing methods designed to prevent infection of rainbow trout fry have proved successful in Europe. These techniques include hatching eggs in spore-free water and rearing fry to the "ossification" stage in tanks or raceways. These methods give particular attention to the quality of water sources to guard against spore introduction during water exchanges. Fry are moved to earthen ponds only once they are considered to be clinically resistant to the parasite, after skeletal ossification occurs.

"M. cerebralis" was first found in New Zealand in 1971. The parasite has only been found in rivers in the South Island, away from the most important aquaculture sites. Additionally, salmonid species commercially aquacultured in New Zealand have low susceptibility to whirling disease, and the parasite has also not been shown to affect native salmonids. An important indirect effect of the parasites presence is <a href="quarantine">quarantine</a> restriction placed on <a href="export">export</a>s of salmon products to Australia.

"M. cerebralis" was first recorded in North America in 1956 in <a href="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, having been introduced via infected trout imported from Europe, and has spread steadily south and westwards. Until the 1990s, whirling disease was considered a manageable problem affecting rainbow trout in hatcheries. However, it has recently become established in natural waters of the Rocky Mountain states (<a href="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="Montana">Montana</a>, <a href="Idaho">Idaho</a>, <a href="New%20Mexico">New Mexico</a>), where it is causing heavy mortalities in several sportfishing rivers. Some streams in the western United States have lost 90% of their trout. In addition, whirling disease threatens recreational fishing, which is important for the tourism industry, a key component of the economies of some U.S. western states. For example, "the <a href="Montana">Montana</a> Whirling Disease Task Force estimated trout fishing generated US $300,000,000 in recreational expenditures in Montana alone". Making matters worse, some of the fish species that "M. cerebralis" infects (<a href="bull%20trout">bull trout</a>, <a href="cutthroat%20trout">cutthroat trout</a>, and <a href="Rainbow%20trout">steelhead</a>) are already threatened or <a href="endangered%20species">endangered</a>, and the parasite could worsen their already precarious situations. For reasons that are poorly understood, but probably have to do with environmental conditions, the impact on infected fish has been greatest in Colorado and Montana, and least in <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Michigan">Michigan</a>, and New York.

Whirling disease was first detected in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although it was first discovered in Banff, it is not necessarily where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds are infected with the disease.

As a result of the new declaration, a domestic movement permit will be required from the CFIA for susceptible species and end uses identified in the Domestic Movement Control Program, the vector "Tubifex tubifex", the disease causing agent "Myxobolus cerebralis", and/or related things out of the infected and buffer areas of Alberta. Recreational and sport fishing, including fishing led by a professional guide, will not require a CFIA permit.

Some biologists have attempted to disarm triactinomyxon spores by making them fire prematurely. In the laboratory, only extreme <a href="acidity">acidity</a> or <a href="basicity">basicity</a>, moderate to high concentrations of salts, or electric current caused premature filament discharge; neurochemicals, cnidarian <a href="chemosensitizer">chemosensitizer</a>s, and trout mucus were ineffective, as were anesthetized or dead fish. If spores could be disarmed, they would be unable to infect fish, but further research is needed to find an effective treatment.

Some strains of fish are more resistant than others, even within species; using resistant strains may help reduce the incidence and severity of whirling disease in aquaculture. There is also some circumstantial evidence that fish populations can develop resistance to the disease over time. Additionally, aquaculturists may avoid "M. cerebralis" infections by not using earthen ponds for raising young fish; this keeps them away from possibly infected tubificids and makes it easier to eliminate spores and oligochaetes through filtration, chlorination, and ultraviolet bombardment. To minimise tubificid populations, techniques include periodic disinfection of the hatchery or aquaculture ponds, and the rearing of small trout indoors in pathogen-free water. Smooth-faced concrete or plastic-lined raceways that are kept clean and free of contaminated water keep aquaculture facilities free of the disease.

Lastly, some drugs, such as <a href="furazolidone">furazolidone</a>, <a href="furoxone">furoxone</a>, <a href="benomyl">benomyl</a>, <a href="fumagillin">fumagillin</a>, <a href="proguanil">proguanil</a> and <a href="clamoxyquine">clamoxyquine</a>, have been shown to impede spore development, which reduces infection rates. For example, one study showed that feeding fumagillin to "O. mykiss" reduced the number of infected fish from between 73% and 100% to between 10% and 20%. Unfortunately, this treatment is considered unsuitable for wild trout populations, and no drug treatment has ever been shown to be effective in the studies required for United States <a href="Food%20and%20Drug%20Administration">Food and Drug Administration</a> approval.

Recreational and sports fishers can help to prevent the spread of the parasite by not transporting fish from one body of water to another, not disposing of fish <a href="bone">bone</a>s or entrails in any body of water, and ensuring boots and shoes are clean before moving between different bodies of water. Federal, state, provincial, and local regulations on the use of <a href="bait%20%28luring%20substance%29">bait</a> should be followed.

History of Sheffield

The area known as Sheffield was probably founded in the second half of 1AD in a clearing by the <a href="River%20Sheaf">River Sheaf</a>.

Although humans may have lived in the area for at least 10,000 years, significant urban growth only occurred after the <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a>.

Sheffield has been well known for blade production since the 14th century. By 1600, Sheffield became the biggest producer of cutlery outside of London. 

Technological improvements, such as the <a href="crucible%20steel">crucible steel</a> process after 1740, led to rapid industrial growth. Sheffield town was incorporated as a <a href="Borough%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">borough</a> in 1843 and granted a <a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">city charter</a> in 1893.

Sheffield remained a major industrial city until the early 1970s. The economic downturn following the <a href="1973%20oil%20crisis">1973 oil crisis</a>, technological improvements and <a href="economies%20of%20scale">economies of scale</a>, and a wide-reaching restructuring of steel production throughout the <a href="European%20Economic%20Community">European Economic Community</a> led to the closure of many of the steelworks.

Urban and economic regeneration schemes began in the late 1980s to diversify the city's economy. Sheffield is now a centre for banking and insurance functions with <a href="HSBC">HSBC</a>, <a href="Santander%20UK">Santander</a> and <a href="Aviva">Aviva</a> having regional offices in the city. The city has also attracted digital start-ups, with 25,000 now employed in the digital sector.

The earliest known evidence of human occupation in the Sheffield area was found at <a href="Creswell%20Crags">Creswell Crags</a> to the east of the city. Artefacts and rock art found in caves at this site have been dated by archaeologists to the late <a href="Upper%20Palaeolithic">Upper Palaeolithic</a> period, at least 12,800 years ago. Other <a href="prehistoric">prehistoric</a> remains found in Sheffield include a <a href="Mesolithic">Mesolithic</a> "house"—a circle of stones in the shape of a hut-base dating to around 8000 BC, found at <a href="Deepcar">Deepcar</a>, in the northern part of the city. This has been ascribed to the <a href="Maglemosian%20culture">Maglemosian culture</a>.(). The site's culture has similarities to <a href="Star%20Carr">Star Carr</a> in North Yorkshire, but gives its name to unique "Deepcar type assemblages" of <a href="microliths">microliths</a> in the archaeology literature. A cup and ring-marked stone was discovered in Ecclesall Woods in 1981, and has been dated to the late Neolithic or Bronze Age periods. It, and an area around it of 2 m diameter, is a <a href="Scheduled%20Ancient%20Monument">scheduled ancient monument</a>.

During the <a href="Bronze%20Age">Bronze Age</a> (about 1500 BC) tribes sometimes called the <a href="Urn%20people">Urn people</a> started to settle in the area. They built numerous stone circles, examples of which can be found on <a href="Wyming%20Brook">Ash Cabin Flat</a>, <a href="Froggatt%20Edge">Froggatt Edge</a> and Hordron Edge ("<a href="Hordron%20Edge%20stone%20circle">Hordron Edge stone circle</a>"). Two Early Bronze Age urns were found at <a href="Crookes">Crookes</a> in 1887, and three Middle Bronze Age barrows found at <a href="Lodge%20Moor">Lodge Moor</a> (both suburbs of the modern city).

During the <a href="British%20Iron%20Age">British Iron Age</a> the area became the southernmost territory of the <a href="Pennines">Pennine</a> tribe called the <a href="Brigantes">Brigantes</a>. It is this tribe who in around 500 BC are thought to have constructed the <a href="hill%20fort">hill fort</a> that stands on the summit of a steep hill above the <a href="River%20Don%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">River Don</a> at <a href="Wincobank%20%28hill%20fort%29">Wincobank</a>, in what is now northeastern Sheffield. Other Iron Age hill forts in the area are <a href="Carl%20Wark">Carl Wark</a> on Hathersage Moor to the southwest of Sheffield, and one at <a href="Scholes%20Wood">Scholes Wood</a>, near <a href="Rotherham">Rotherham</a>. The rivers Sheaf and Don may have formed the boundary between the territory of the Brigantes and that of a rival tribe called the <a href="Corieltauvi">Corieltauvi</a> who inhabited a large area of the northeastern <a href="The%20Midlands">Midlands</a>.

The <a href="Roman%20invasion%20of%20Britain">Roman invasion of Britain</a> began in AD 43. By 51 the Brigantes had submitted to the clientship of Rome, eventually being placed under direct rule in the early 70s. Few <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman</a> remains have been found in the Sheffield area. A minor <a href="Roman%20road">Roman road</a> linking the Roman forts at <a href="Templeborough">Templeborough</a> and <a href="Brough-on-Noe">Brough-on-Noe</a> possibly ran through the centre of the area covered by the modern city, and <a href="Icknield%20Street">Icknield Street</a> is thought to have skirted its boundaries. The routes of these roads within this area are mostly unknown, although sections of the former were thought, by <a href="Joseph%20Hunter%20%28antiquarian%29">Hunter</a> and <a href="Robert%20Eadon%20Leader">Leader</a>, be visible between <a href="Fulwood%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Redmires</a> and <a href="Stanage%20Edge">Stanage</a> on an ancient road known as the <a href="Long%20Causeway">Long Causeway</a>. In recent years some scholars have cast doubt on this, with an initial survey of Barber Fields, <a href="Ringinglow">Ringinglow</a>, suggesting the Roman Road took a route over <a href="Burbage%20Brook">Burbage Edge</a>. The remains of a Roman road, possibly linked to the latter, were discovered in <a href="Brinsworth">Brinsworth</a> in 1949.

In April 1761, tablets or <a href="Roman%20military%20diploma">diplomas</a> dating from the Roman period were found in the <a href="Rivelin%20Valley">Rivelin Valley</a> south of <a href="Stannington%2C%20Sheffield">Stannington</a>, close to the likely course of the Templeborough to Brough-on-Noe road. These tablets included a grant of citizenship and land or money to a retiring Roman auxiliary of the <a href="Sunuci">Sunuci</a> tribe of Belgium.

"To . . . . . . . . the son of Albanus, of the tribe of the Sunuci, late a foot soldier in the first cohort of the Sunuci commanded by M. Junius Claudianus."

In addition there have been finds dating from the Roman period on Walkley Bank Road, which leads onto the valley bottom.

There have been small finds of Roman coins throughout the Sheffield area, for example 30 to 40 Roman coins were found near the Old Great Dam at Crookesmoor, 19 coins were found near Meadowhall in 1891, 13 in <a href="Pitsmoor">Pitsmoor</a> in 1906, and ten coins were found at a site alongside Eckington cemetery in December 2008. Roman burial urns were also found at Bank Street near <a href="Sheffield%20Cathedral">Sheffield Cathedral</a>, which, along with the name of the old lane behind the church (Campo Lane), has led to speculation that there may have been a Roman camp at this site. It is unlikely that the settlement that grew into Sheffield existed at this time. In 2011 excavations revealed remains of a substantial 1st or 2nd century AD Roman rural estate centre, or 'villa' on what is believed to be a pre-existing Brigantian farmstead site at <a href="Whirlow%20Hall%20Farm">Whirlow Hall Farm</a> in South-west Sheffield.

Following the departure of the Romans, the Sheffield area may have been the southern part of the <a href="Celt">Celt</a>ic kingdom of <a href="Elmet">Elmet</a>, with the rivers Sheaf and Don forming part of the boundary between this kingdom and the kingdom of <a href="Mercia">Mercia</a>. Gradually, <a href="Angles">Anglian</a> settlers pushed west from the kingdom of <a href="Deira">Deira</a>. The Britons of Elmet delayed this English expansion into the early part of the 7th century. An enduring Celtic presence within this area is evidenced by the settlements called <a href="Wales%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Wales</a> and Waleswood close to Sheffield—the word "Wales" derives from the Germanic word "<a href="Walha">Walha</a>", and was originally used by the Anglo-Saxons to refer to the native Britons.

The name "Sheffield" is <a href="Old%20English">Old English</a> in origin. It derives from the <a href="River%20Sheaf">River Sheaf</a>, whose name is a corruption of "shed" or "sheth", meaning to divide or separate. "Field" is a <a href="List%20of%20generic%20forms%20in%20British%20place%20names">generic suffix</a> deriving from the Old English "feld", meaning a forest clearing. It is likely then that the origin of the present-day city of Sheffield is an Anglo-Saxon settlement in a clearing beside the confluence of the rivers <a href="River%20Sheaf">Sheaf</a> and <a href="River%20Don%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Don</a> founded between the arrival of the Anglo-Saxons in this region (roughly the 6th century) and the early 9th century.

The names of many of the other areas of Sheffield likely to have been established as settlements during this period end in "ley", which signifies a clearing in the forest, or "ton", which means an enclosed farmstead. These settlements include <a href="Heeley">Heeley</a>, <a href="Longley%2C%20Sheffield">Longley</a>, <a href="Norton%2C%20Sheffield%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Norton</a>, <a href="Owlerton">Owlerton</a>, <a href="Southey%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Southey</a>, <a href="Tinsley%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Tinsley</a>, <a href="Totley">Totley</a>, <a href="Wadsley">Wadsley</a>, and <a href="Walkley">Walkley</a>.
The earliest evidence of this settlement is thought to be the <a href="Sheffield%20Cross">shaft of a stone cross</a> dating from the early 9th century that was found in Sheffield in the early 19th century. This shaft may be part of a cross removed from the church yard of the Sheffield parish church (now Sheffield Cathedral) in 1570. It is now kept in the <a href="British%20Museum">British Museum</a>.

A document from around the same time, an entry for the year 829 in the "<a href="Anglo-Saxon%20Chronicle">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</a>", refers to the submission of <a href="Eanred%20of%20Northumbria">King Eanred</a> of <a href="Northumbria">Northumbria</a> to <a href="Egbert%20of%20Wessex">King Egbert</a> of <a href="Wessex">Wessex</a> at the hamlet of <a href="Dore">Dore</a> (now a suburb of Sheffield): "Egbert led an army against the Northumbrians as far as Dore, where they met him, and offered terms of obedience and subjection, on the acceptance of which they returned home". This event made Egbert the first Saxon to claim to be king of all of England.

The latter part of the 9th century saw a wave of <a href="Norsemen">Norse</a> (Viking) settlers and the subsequent establishment of the <a href="Danelaw">Danelaw</a>. The names of hamlets established by these settlers often end in "thorpe", which means a farmstead. Examples of such settlements in the Sheffield area are <a href="Grimesthorpe">Grimesthorpe</a>, <a href="Hackenthorpe">Hackenthorpe</a>, <a href="Jordanthorpe">Jordanthorpe</a>, <a href="Netherthorpe%2C%20Sheffield">Netherthorpe</a>, <a href="Upperthorpe%2C%20Sheffield">Upperthorpe</a>, <a href="Waterthorpe">Waterthorpe</a>, and <a href="Woodthorpe%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Woodthorpe</a>. By 918 the Danes south of the Humber had submitted to <a href="Edward%20the%20Elder">Edward the Elder</a>, and by 926 Northumbria was under the control of King <a href="%C3%86thelstan">Æthelstan</a>.

In 937 the combined armies of <a href="Olaf%20Guthfrithson">Olaf Guthfrithson</a>, <a href="Viking">Viking</a> king of <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, <a href="Constantine%20II%20of%20Scotland">Constantine</a>, king of Scotland and <a href="Owain%20ap%20Dyfnwal%20%28fl.%20934%29">Owain ap Dyfnwal</a>, king of the Cumbrians, invaded England. The invading force was met and defeated by an army from Wessex and Mercia led by King Æthelstan at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Brunanburh">Battle of Brunanburh</a>. The location of "Brunanburh" is unknown, but some historians have suggested a location between <a href="Tinsley%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Tinsley</a> in Sheffield and <a href="Brinsworth">Brinsworth</a> in Rotherham, on the slopes of White Hill. After the death of King Athelstan in 939 Olaf Guthfrithson invaded again and took control of Northumbria and part of Mercia. Subsequently, the Anglo-Saxons, under <a href="Edmund%20I">Edmund</a>, re-conquered the Midlands, as far as Dore, in 942, and captured Northumbria in 944.

The <a href="Domesday%20Book">Domesday Book</a> of 1086, which was compiled following the <a href="Norman%20conquest%20of%20England">Norman Conquest</a> of 1066, contains the earliest known reference to the districts around Sheffield as the manor of "Hallun" (or <a href="Hallamshire">Hallam</a>). This manor retained its Saxon lord, <a href="Waltheof%2C%20Earl%20of%20Northumbria">Waltheof</a>, for some years after the conquest. The Domesday Book was ordered written by William the Conqueror so that the value of the townships and manors of England could be assessed. The entries in the Domesday Book are written in a Latin shorthand; the extract for this area begins:

Translated it reads:

The reference is to <a href="Roger%20de%20Busli">Roger de Busli</a>, tenant-in-chief in Domesday and one of the greatest of the new wave of Norman magnates. Waltheof, Earl of Northumbria had been executed in 1076 for his part in an uprising against William I. He was the last of the Anglo-Saxon earls still remaining in England a full decade after the Norman conquest. His lands had passed to his wife, <a href="Judith%20of%20Lens">Judith of Normandy</a>, niece to William the Conqueror. The lands were held on her behalf by <a href="Roger%20de%20Busli">Roger de Busli</a>.

The Domesday Book refers to Sheffield twice, first as "Escafeld", then later as "Scafeld". Sheffield historian S. O. Addy suggests that the second form, pronounced "Shaffeld", is the truer form, as the spelling "Sefeld" is found in a deed issued less than one hundred years after the completion of the survey. Addy comments that the "E" in the first form may have been mistakenly added by the Norman scribe.

Roger de Busli died around the end of the 11th century, and was succeeded by a son, who died without an heir. The manor of Hallamshire passed to <a href="William%20de%20Lovetot">William de Lovetot</a>, the grandson of a Norman baron who had come over to England with the Conqueror. William de Lovetot founded the parish churches of <a href="St%20Mary%27s%20Church%2C%20Handsworth%2C%20Sheffield">St Mary</a> at <a href="Handsworth%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Handsworth</a>, <a href="Church%20of%20St%20Nicholas%2C%20Bradfield">St Nicholas</a> at High Bradfield and <a href="Church%20of%20St.%20Mary%2C%20Ecclesfield">St. Mary's</a> at Ecclesfield at the start of the 12th century in addition to Sheffield's own parish church. He also built the original wooden Sheffield Castle, which stimulated the growth of the town.

Also dating from this time is <a href="Beauchief%20Abbey">Beauchief Abbey</a>, which was founded by Robert FitzRanulf de Alfreton. The abbey was dedicated to Saint Mary and Saint <a href="Thomas%20Becket">Thomas Becket</a>, who had been canonised in 1172. Thomas Tanner, writing in 1695, stated that it was founded in 1183. <a href="Samuel%20Pegge">Samuel Pegge</a> in his "History of Beauchief Abbey" notes that Albinas, the <a href="abbot">abbot</a> of <a href="Derby">Derby</a>, who was one of the witnesses to the charter of foundation, died in 1176, placing foundation before that date.

Following the death of William de Lovetot, the manor of Hallamshire passed to his son Richard de Lovetot and then his son William de Lovetot before being passed by marriage to <a href="Gerard%20de%20Furnival">Gerard de Furnival</a> in about 1204. The de Furnivals held the manor for the next 180 years. The fourth Furnival lord, Thomas de Furnival, supported <a href="Simon%20de%20Montfort%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Leicester">Simon de Montfort</a> in the <a href="Second%20Barons%27%20War">Second Barons' War</a>. As a result of this, in 1266 a party of barons, led by John de Eyvill, marching from north <a href="Lincolnshire">Lincolnshire</a> to <a href="Derbyshire">Derbyshire</a> passed through Sheffield and destroyed the town, burning the church and castle.

A new stone castle was constructed over the next four years and a new church was consecrated by <a href="William%20de%20Wickwane">William de Wickwane</a> the <a href="Archbishop%20of%20York">Archbishop of York</a> around 1280. In 1295 Thomas de Furnival's son (also Thomas) was the first lord of Hallamshire to be called to Parliament, thus taking the title <a href="Baron%20Furnivall">Lord Furnivall</a>. On 12 November 1296 <a href="Edward%20I%20of%20England">Edward I</a> granted a charter for a market to be held in Sheffield on Tuesday each week. This was followed on 10 August 1297 by a <a href="charter">charter</a> from Lord Furnival establishing Sheffield as a free <a href="borough">borough</a>.

The <a href="Sheffield%20Town%20Trust">Sheffield Town Trust</a> was established in the Charter to the Town of Sheffield, granted in 1297. De Furnival, granted land to the <a href="freehold%20%28law%29">freeholder</a>s of Sheffield in return for an annual payment, and a Common <a href="Burgery%20of%20Sheffield">Burgery</a> administrated them. The Burgery originally consisted of public meetings of all the freeholders, who elected a Town Collector. Two more generations of Furnivals held Sheffield before it passed by marriage to Sir Thomas Nevil and then, in 1406, to <a href="John%20Talbot%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">John Talbot</a>, the first <a href="Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">Earl of Shrewsbury</a>.
In 1430 the 1280 Sheffield parish church building was pulled down and replaced. Parts of this new church still stand today and it is now Sheffield city centre's oldest surviving building, forming the core of <a href="Sheffield%20Cathedral">Sheffield Cathedral</a>. Other notable surviving buildings from this period include the <a href="Old%20Queen%27s%20Head">Old Queen's Head</a> pub in Pond Hill, which dates from around 1480, with its timber frame still intact, and <a href="Bishops%27%20House">Bishops' House</a> and <a href="Broom%20Hall">Broom Hall</a>, both built around 1500.

The fourth Earl of Shrewsbury, <a href="George%20Talbot%2C%204th%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">George Talbot</a> took up residence in Sheffield, building the <a href="Sheffield%20Manor">Manor Lodge</a> outside the town in about 1510 and adding a chapel to the Parish Church c1520 to hold the family vault. Memorials to the fourth and sixth Earls of Shrewsbury can still be seen in the church. In 1569 <a href="George%20Talbot%2C%206th%20Earl%20of%20Shrewsbury">George Talbot</a>, the sixth Earl of Shrewsbury, was given charge of <a href="Mary%2C%20Queen%20of%20Scots">Mary, Queen of Scots</a>. Mary was regarded as a threat by <a href="Elizabeth%20I%20of%20England">Elizabeth I</a>, and had been held captive since her arrival in England in 1568.

Talbot brought Mary to Sheffield in 1570, and she spent most of the next 14 years imprisoned in <a href="Sheffield%20Castle">Sheffield Castle</a> and its dependent buildings. The castle park extended beyond the present Manor Lane, where the remains of Manor Lodge are to be found. Beside them is the Turret House, an <a href="Elizabethan%20era">Elizabethan</a> building, which may have been built to accommodate the captive queen. A room, believed to have been the queen's, has an elaborate plaster ceiling and overmantel, with heraldic decorations. During the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, Sheffield changed hands several times, finally falling to the <a href="Parliament%20of%20England">Parliamentarians</a>, who demolished the Castle in 1648.

The <a href="Industrial%20Revolution">Industrial Revolution</a> brought large-scale <a href="steel">steel</a> making to Sheffield in the 18th century. Much of the medieval town was gradually replaced by a mix of <a href="Georgian%20architecture">Georgian</a> and <a href="Victorian%20architecture">Victorian</a> buildings. Large areas of <a href="Sheffield%20City%20Centre">Sheffield's city centre</a> have been rebuilt in recent years, but among the modern buildings, some old buildings have been retained.

Sheffield's developed after the industrial revolution because of its geography.

Fast-flowing rivers, such as the Sheaf, the Don and the Loxley, made it an ideal location for water-powered industries to develop. Raw materials, like coal, iron ore, <a href="ganister">ganister</a> and millstone grit for grindstones, found in the nearby hills, were used in cutlery and blade production.

As early as the 14th century, Sheffield was noted for the production of knives:

By 1600 Sheffield was the main centre of cutlery production in England outside London, and in 1624 <a href="Company%20of%20Cutlers%20in%20Hallamshire">The Company of Cutlers in Hallamshire</a> was formed to oversee the trade. Examples of water-powered blade and cutlery workshops from around this time can be seen at the <a href="Abbeydale%20Industrial%20Hamlet">Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet</a> and <a href="Shepherd%20Wheel">Shepherd Wheel</a> museums in Sheffield.

Around a century later, <a href="Daniel%20Defoe">Daniel Defoe</a> in his book "<a href="A%20tour%20thro%27%20the%20whole%20island%20of%20Great%20Britain">A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain</a>", wrote:

In the 1740s <a href="Benjamin%20Huntsman">Benjamin Huntsman</a>, a clock maker in <a href="Handsworth%2C%20South%20Yorkshire">Handsworth</a>, invented a form of the <a href="crucible%20steel">crucible steel</a> process for making a better quality of steel than had previously been available. At around the same time <a href="Thomas%20Boulsover">Thomas Boulsover</a> invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of <a href="silver">silver</a> onto a <a href="copper">copper</a> ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as <a href="Sheffield%20plate">Sheffield plate</a>. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a <a href="Sheffield%20Assay%20Office">silver assay office</a>. In the late 18th century, <a href="Britannia%20metal">Britannia metal</a>, a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.
Huntsman's process was only made obsolete in 1856 by <a href="Henry%20Bessemer">Henry Bessemer</a>'s invention of the <a href="Bessemer%20converter">Bessemer converter</a>, but production of crucible steel continued until well into the 20th century for special uses, as Bessemer's steel was not of the same quality, in the main replacing wrought iron for such applications as rails. Bessemer had tried to induce steelmakers to take up his improved system, but met with general rebuffs, and finally was driven to undertake the exploitation of the process himself. To this end he erected steelworks in Sheffield. Gradually the scale of production was enlarged until the competition became effective, and steel traders generally became aware that the firm of Henry Bessemer & Co. was underselling them to the extent of £20 a ton. One of Bessemer's converters can still be seen at Sheffield's <a href="Kelham%20Island%20Museum">Kelham Island Museum</a>.

<a href="Stainless%20steel">Stainless steel</a> was discovered by <a href="Harry%20Brearley">Harry Brearley</a> in 1912, at the Brown Firth Laboratories in Sheffield. His successor as manager at Brown Firth, <a href="William%20Herbert%20Hatfield">Dr William Hatfield</a>, continued Brealey's work. In 1924 he patented '18-8 stainless steel', which to this day is probably the most common alloy of this type.
These innovations helped Sheffield to gain a worldwide recognition for the production of cutlery; utensils such as the <a href="bowie%20knife">bowie knife</a> were mass-produced and shipped to the United States. The population of the town increased rapidly. In 1736 Sheffield and its surrounding hamlets held about 7000 people, in 1801 there were 60,000, and by 1901, the population had grown to 451,195.

This growth spurred the reorganisation of the governance of the town. Prior to 1818, the town was run by a mixture of bodies. The <a href="Sheffield%20Town%20Trust">Sheffield Town Trust</a> and the <a href="Church%20Burgesses">Church Burgesses</a>, for example, divided responsibility for the improvement of streets and bridges. By the 19th century both organisations lacked funds and struggled even to maintain existing infrastructure. The Church Burgesses organised a public meeting on 27 May 1805 and proposed to apply to Parliament for an act to pave, light and clean the city's streets. The proposal was defeated.

The idea of a Commission was revived in 1810, and later in the decade Sheffield finally followed the model adopted by several other towns in petitioning for an Act to establish an <a href="Improvement%20Commission">Improvement Commission</a>. This eventually led to the <a href="Sheffield%20Improvement%20Act%201818">Sheffield Improvement Act 1818</a>, which established the Commission and included several other provisions. In 1832 the town <a href="Sheffield%20%28UK%20Parliament%20constituency%29">gained political representation</a> with the formation of a <a href="Parliamentary%20borough">Parliamentary borough</a>. A <a href="municipal%20borough">municipal borough</a> was formed by an Act of Incorporation in 1843, and this borough was granted the style and title of "<a href="City%20status%20in%20the%20United%20Kingdom">City</a>" by Royal Charter in 1893.
From the mid-18th century, a succession of public buildings were erected in the town. <a href="St%20Paul%27s%20Church%2C%20Sheffield">St Paul's Church</a>, now demolished, was among the first, while <a href="Sheffield%20Old%20Town%20Hall">the old Town Hall</a> and the present <a href="Cutlers%27%20Hall">Cutlers' Hall</a> were among the major works of the 19th century. The town's water supply was improved by the Sheffield Waterworks Company, who built <a href="reservoir%20%28water%29">reservoirs</a> around the town. Parts of Sheffield were devastated when, following a five-year construction project, the Dale Dyke dam collapsed on Friday 11 March 1864, resulting in the <a href="Great%20Sheffield%20Flood">Great Sheffield Flood</a>.

Sheffield's transport infrastructure was also improved. In the 18th century <a href="Turnpike%20trust">turnpike</a> roads were built connecting Sheffield with Barnsley, Buxton, Chesterfield, Glossop, Intake, Penistone, Tickhill, and Worksop. In 1774 a wooden tramway was laid at the Duke of Norfolk's Nunnery Colliery. The tramway was destroyed by rioters, who saw it as part of a plan to raise the price of coal. A replacement tramway that used L-shaped rails was laid by John Curr in 1776 and was one of the earliest cast-iron railways. The <a href="Sheffield%20Canal">Sheffield Canal</a> opened in 1819 allowing the large-scale transport of freight.

This was followed by the <a href="Sheffield%20and%20Rotherham%20Railway">Sheffield and Rotherham Railway</a> in 1838, the <a href="Sheffield%2C%20Ashton-under-Lyne%20and%20Manchester%20Railway">Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway</a> in 1845, and the <a href="Midland%20Railway">Midland Railway</a> in 1870. The <a href="Sheffield%20Tramway">Sheffield Tramway</a> was started in 1873 with the construction of a horse tram route from Lady's Bridge to Attercliffe. This route was later extended to Brightside and Tinsley, and further routes were constructed to Hillsborough, Heeley, and Nether Edge. Due to the narrow medieval roads the tramways were initially banned from the town centre. An improvement scheme was passed in 1875; Pinstone Street and Leopold Street were constructed by 1879, and Fargate was widened in the 1880s. The 1875 plan also called for the widening of the <a href="High%20Street%20%28Sheffield%29">High Street</a>; disputes with property owners delayed this until 1895.

Steel production in the 19th century involved long working hours, in unpleasant conditions that offered little or no safety protection. <a href="Friedrich%20Engels">Friedrich Engels</a> in his "<a href="The%20Condition%20of%20the%20Working%20Class%20in%20England">The Condition of the Working Class in England</a>" in 1844 described the conditions prevalent in the city at that time:

Sheffield became one of the main centres for <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a> organisation and agitation in the UK. By the 1860s, the growing conflict between capital and labour provoked the so-called '<a href="Sheffield%20Outrages">Sheffield Outrages</a>', which culminated in a series of explosions and murders carried out by union militants. The <a href="Sheffield%20Trades%20Council">Sheffield Trades Council</a> organised a meeting in Sheffield in 1866 at which the <a href="United%20Kingdom%20Alliance%20of%20Organised%20Trades">United Kingdom Alliance of Organised Trades</a>—a forerunner of the <a href="Trades%20Union%20Congress">Trades Union Congress</a> (TUC)—was founded.

In 1914 Sheffield became a <a href="diocese">diocese</a> of the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a>, and the parish church became a <a href="Sheffield%20Cathedral">cathedral</a>. During the First World War the <a href="Sheffield%20City%20Battalion">Sheffield City Battalion</a> suffered heavy losses at the <a href="Battle%20of%20the%20Somme">Somme</a> and Sheffield itself was bombed by a German <a href="zeppelin">zeppelin</a>.

The recession of the 1930s was only halted by the increasing tension as the Second World War loomed. The steel factories of Sheffield were set to work making weapons and ammunition for the war. As a result, once war was declared, the city once again became a target for bombing raids. In total there were 16 raids over Sheffield, but it was the heavy bombing over the nights of 12 and 15 December 1940 (now known as the <a href="Sheffield%20Blitz">Sheffield Blitz</a>) when the most substantial damage occurred. More than 660 lives were lost and numerous buildings were destroyed.

Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s saw many large scale developments in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and a new system of roads, including the Inner Ring Road, were laid out. Also at this time many of the old <a href="slum">slum</a>s were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the <a href="Park%20Hill%2C%20Sheffield">Park Hill flats</a>, and the <a href="Gleadless%20Valley">Gleadless Valley</a> estate.
Sheffield's traditional manufacturing industries (along with those of many other areas in the UK), declined during the 20th century. In the 1980s, it was the setting for two films written by locally-born <a href="Barry%20Hines">Barry Hines</a>: "<a href="Looks%20and%20Smiles">Looks and Smiles</a>", a 1981 film that portrayed the depression that the city was enduring, and "<a href="Threads">Threads</a>", a 1984 television film that simulated a <a href="nuclear%20winter">nuclear winter</a> in Sheffield after a warhead is dropped to the east of the city.

The building of the <a href="Meadowhall%20shopping%20centre">Meadowhall shopping centre</a> on the site of a former steelworks in 1990 was a mixed blessing, creating much needed jobs but speeding the decline of the city centre. Attempts to regenerate the city were kick-started by the hosting of the <a href="1991%20Summer%20Universiade">1991 World Student Games</a> and the associated building of new sporting facilities such as the <a href="Sheffield%20Arena">Sheffield Arena</a>, <a href="Don%20Valley%20Stadium">Don Valley Stadium</a> and the <a href="Ponds%20Forge">Ponds Forge</a> complex. Sheffield began construction of a <a href="Sheffield%20Supertram">tram</a> system in 1992, with the first section opening in 1994.

Starting in 1995, the "Heart of the City Project" has seen public works in the city centre: the <a href="Peace%20Gardens">Peace Gardens</a> were renovated in 1998, the <a href="Millennium%20Gallery">Millennium Gallery</a> opened in April 2001, and a 1970s town hall extension was demolished in 2002 to make way for the <a href="Sheffield%20Winter%20Garden">Winter Garden</a>, which opened on 22 May 2003. A series of other projects grouped under the title <a href="Sheffield%20One">Sheffield One</a> aim to regenerate the whole of the city centre.

On 25 June 2007, <a href="2007%20United%20Kingdom%20floods%23South%20Yorkshire">flooding caused millions of pounds worth of damage</a> to buildings in the city and led to the loss of two lives. Since 2012, there have been disputes between the city council and residents over the fate of the city's 36,000 highway trees, with 4,000 having been felled as part of a scheme to maintain the city streets. However, there have been plans for the highway maintenance to replant all felled trees across the city, including those historically felled and not previously replanted.

In July 2013 the <a href="Sevenstone">Sevenstone</a> project, which aimed to demolish and rebuild a large part of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped. The city council is looking for partners to take a new version of the plan forwards. In April 2014 the council, together with Sheffield University, proposed a plan to reduce the blight of empty shops in the city centre by offering them free of charge to small businesses on a month-by-month basis.

Bobby Eaton

Robert Lee Eaton (born August 14, 1958) is an American retired <a href="Professional%20wrestling">professional wrestler</a>, who made his debut in 1976. Eaton is most famous for his work in <a href="tag%20team">tag team</a>s, especially his days as one-half of <a href="The%20Midnight%20Express%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Midnight Express</a>. Under the <a href="Manager%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">management</a> of <a href="Jim%20Cornette">Jim Cornette</a>, Eaton originally teamed with <a href="Dennis%20Condrey">Dennis Condrey</a> and, later on, with <a href="Stan%20Lane">Stan Lane</a>. He has also worked with a number of other tag team partners, including <a href="Koko%20B.%20Ware">Koko B. Ware</a>, <a href="Steve%20Keirn">Steve Keirn</a>, and <a href="Darren%20Matthews">"Lord" Steven Regal</a>.

In his career, Eaton wrestled for extended periods of time for various wrestling promotions: Mid-America Wrestling, <a href="Continental%20Wrestling%20Association">Continental Wrestling Association</a>, <a href="Universal%20Wrestling%20Federation%20%28Bill%20Watts%29">Mid-South Wrestling</a>, <a href="World%20Class%20Championship%20Wrestling">World Class Championship Wrestling</a>, <a href="Jim%20Crockett%20Promotions">Jim Crockett Promotions</a>, <a href="World%20Championship%20Wrestling">World Championship Wrestling</a>, and <a href="Smoky%20Mountain%20Wrestling">Smoky Mountain Wrestling</a>. He has also made brief guest appearances for <a href="Extreme%20Championship%20Wrestling">Extreme Championship Wrestling</a> and <a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a>, in addition to appearances for a considerable number of <a href="Independent%20circuit">independent</a> wrestling promotions over the years. He wrestled his last match in 2012 after a 26-year in-ring career.

Growing up in <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville, Alabama</a>, Eaton was a fan of professional wrestling, especially the NWA Mid-America <a href="professional%20wrestling%20promotion">professional wrestling promotion</a>. This promotion was operated by <a href="Nick%20Gulas">Nick Gulas</a>, who staged wrestling shows in the Alabama and Tennessee region. Eaton's first involvement in the sport came at the age of 13, while attending Chapman Middle School, when he helped set up <a href="wrestling%20ring">wrestling ring</a>s in his hometown. He later trained under <a href="Tojo%20Yamamoto">Tojo Yamamoto</a> to become a professional wrestler.

In May 1976, at the age of 17, Eaton made his debut in <a href="NWA%20Mid-America">NWA Mid-America</a>. He entered his first match, a loss to <a href="Bearcat%20Wright">Bearcat Wright</a>, as a last-minute substitute for Wright's absent opponent. He quickly became a regular in Mid-America and continued to train with the more experienced wrestlers. Before long, fans, as well as promoter Nick Gulas, noticed Eaton's athleticism and showmanship. Gulas decided to "promote" Eaton up the ranks of NWA Mid-America, giving him matches later in the show, closer to the main event. The <a href="List%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23A">angle</a> that really helped elevate Eaton's name up the <a href="List%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23C">card</a> in the promotion took place after the introduction of the tag team <a href="Hollywood%20Blonds%23Buddy%20Roberts%20and%20Jerry%20Brown">The Hollywood Blonds</a> (Jerry Brown and <a href="Dale%20Hey">Buddy Roberts</a>). Eaton fought the Blonds with a variety of partners, including his old trainer Yamamoto and <a href="Pez%20Whatley">"Pistol" Pez Whatley</a>. When the Blonds decided to move to a different wrestling promotion, the storyline maintained that Eaton was responsible for driving them out of NWA Mid-America.

In 1978, Eaton teamed with <a href="Lanny%20Poffo">Leapin' Lanny Poffo</a> (brother of the more well-known "Macho Man" Randy Savage), and together they won the <a href="NWA%20Mid-America%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">NWA Mid-America Tag Team Championship</a> from Gypsy Joe and <a href="Junkyard%20Dog">Leroy Rochester</a>. It was Eaton's first title win, and he and Poffo held it for a little over a month. Eaton went on to form a team, known as The Jet Set, with George Gulas, Nick Gulas's son. Together, Eaton and Gulas held the tag team title three times. During their time as a team, the two were involved in a storyline feud with <a href="Terry%20Gordy">Terry Gordy</a> and <a href="Michael%20Hayes%20%28wrestler%29">Michael Hayes</a> before Gordy and Hayes became famous under the name <a href="Fabulous%20Freebirds">The Fabulous Freebirds</a>.
In the spring of 1979, Eaton started a <a href="Feud%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">feud</a> with Chris Colt, designed to establish Eaton as more than just a good tag team competitor. The feud between the two was so heated that it saw Colt suspended for <a href="Piledriver%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">piledriving</a> Eaton on the concrete floor, making it appear Eaton had been seriously injured. Eaton suffered no injuries, however. At that time, the piledriver was banned in most federations and treated as a move that could potentially paralyze a wrestler. This was done to give the move more "shock value". Eaton conclusively defeated Colt, earning a place as one of the top <a href="Face%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">faces</a> (good guys) in NWA Mid-America. During 1979 and 1980, Eaton worked a series of singles matches against <a href="Dennis%20Condrey">Dennis Condrey</a>, a man he would later team up with to gain worldwide fame.

At the end of 1979, Eaton turned <a href="Heel%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">heel</a> (bad guy) for the first time in his career by joining Tojo Yamamoto's group of wrestlers, whom the fans hated. Although Eaton is now thought of mainly as a heel, his fans were surprised at the time. Eaton's heel run did not last long before he rescued his former Jet Set partner, George Gulas, from a two-on-one attack by <a href="The%20Blond%20Bombers%23Larry%20Latham%20and%20Wayne%20Farris">The Blond Bombers</a> (<a href="Moondog%20Spot">Larry Latham</a> and <a href="The%20Honky%20Tonk%20Man">Wayne Ferris</a>) to return to the fan-favorite side once more. After reuniting the team, Eaton and Gulas had one final run with tag team champions and worked an intense feud with Latham and Ferris.

When Nick Gulas' wrestling promotion closed due to dwindling ticket sales, Eaton briefly wrestled for a promotion in Georgia. Before long Eaton returned closer to home, working for promoter <a href="Jerry%20Jarrett">Jerry Jarrett</a>'s <a href="Continental%20Wrestling%20Association">Continental Wrestling Association</a> (CWA), which was centered in <a href="Memphis%2C%20Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. During his early days in the promotion, Eaton faced <a href="Stan%20Lane">Stan Lane</a> several times in tag team competition. Eaton's most successful partnership in the CWA, in terms of title wins, was with <a href="Koko%20B.%20Ware">Sweet Brown Sugar</a>, nicknamed "the New Wave". The two wrestlers blended their athleticism and high flying abilities to form a very successful team. The New Wave held the <a href="AWA%20Southern%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">AWA Southern Tag Team Championship</a> three times (twice with manager <a href="Jimmy%20Hart">Jimmy Hart</a> in their corner). After achieving success as a tag team, it was decided that Eaton and Sugar should split up and feud with each other. This storyline resulted in Eaton "forcing" Sugar out of the promotion after he won a <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Loser%20Leaves%20Town%20match">"Losers Leaves Town" match</a> against Sugar.

Sugar's disappearance was soon followed by the appearance of a masked man called Stagger Lee, who looked and wrestled like Sugar. The storyline of Sugar returning under the mask to fight the heels helped make the masked man instantly popular with the crowd. Eaton, along with the rest of Jimmy Hart's <a href="List%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23S">stable</a> "the First Family", tried in vain to unmask Stagger Lee.

Eaton turned face and re-teamed with Sugar, although they maintained the storyline that Eaton's partner was actually "Stagger Lee" and not Sugar. The team regained the tag team title before losing it to <a href="The%20Fabulous%20Ones">The Fabulous Ones</a> (Stan Lane and <a href="Steve%20Keirn">Steve Keirn</a>). Afterward, Eaton teamed up with <a href="The%20Moondogs%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">The Moondogs</a> (<a href="Randy%20Colley">Rex</a> and <a href="Moondog%20Spot">Spot</a>) to face <a href="Jerry%20Lawler">Jerry Lawler</a> and the Fabulous Ones. During the match, one of the Moondogs accidentally hit Eaton with their trademark bone, costing their side the match. After the match ended, the Moondogs, as well as Jimmy Hart, turned on Eaton, beating him down until he was saved by Stagger Lee.

Soon after Eaton joined <a href="Universal%20Wrestling%20Federation%20%28Bill%20Watts%29%23Mid-South%20Wrestling">Mid-South Wrestling</a> under promoter <a href="Bill%20Watts">Bill Watts</a>, he became part of the Midnight Express. Eaton teamed with former rival Dennis Condrey under the management of <a href="Jim%20Cornette">Jim Cornette</a> to form a new version of the tag team. The Express had previously been a group of wrestlers consisting of Condrey, <a href="Randy%20Rose">Randy Rose</a> and <a href="Norvell%20Austin">Norvell Austin</a>, but with Eaton's arrival, the Midnight Express worked exclusively as a two-man team. To complement the nickname "Lover Boy" Dennis, Eaton was nicknamed "Beautiful" Bobby, a nickname he still uses when wrestling. At first, The Express was booked in an angle with the <a href="UWF%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">Mid-South Tag Team Champions</a> <a href="Magnum%20T.A.">Magnum T.A.</a> and <a href="Mr.%20Wrestling%20II">Mr. Wrestling II</a>. The highlight of the angle saw Eaton and Condrey <a href="tarring%20and%20feathering">tarring and feathering</a> Magnum T.A. in the middle of the ring. The Express first won the tag team title when Mr. Wrestling II turned on Magnum T.A., attacking him during the title match and allowing Eaton and Condrey to win the title without much opposition.

With Mr. Wrestling II and Magnum T.A. splitting up, the Midnight Express needed a new team to defend their newly won title against. They began a long series of matches against <a href="The%20Rock%20%27n%27%20Roll%20Express">The Rock 'n' Roll Express</a> (<a href="Ricky%20Morton">Ricky Morton</a> and <a href="Reuben%20Kane">Robert Gibson</a>) which ran well into the 1990s and spanned several wrestling promotions. The two teams feuded throughout 1984 in Mid-South Wrestling before the Midnight Express left the promotion. The Midnight Express versus Rock 'n' Roll Express series of matches were so well received by the fans that independent promoters all over the United States still book those two teams against each other today, 20 years after the rivalry started. The Midnight Express had a short stay in <a href="World%20Class%20Championship%20Wrestling">World Class Championship Wrestling</a> in <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, where they feuded mainly with <a href="The%20Fantastics">The Fantastics</a> (<a href="Bobby%20Fulton">Bobby Fulton</a> and <a href="Tommy%20Rogers%20%28wrestler%29">Tommy Rogers</a>).

In 1985 Eaton, Condrey and Cornette signed with <a href="Jim%20Crockett%20Promotions">Jim Crockett Promotions</a> (JCP) and were given national exposure on JCP's televised programs on <a href="TBS%20%28TV%20network%29">SuperStation TBS</a>. Shortly after joining JCP, the Midnight Express reignited their feud with the Rock 'n' Roll Express and won the <a href="WCW%20World%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">NWA World Tag team title</a> from them in February 1986. During the course of their heated angle, Eaton and Condrey re-lost the title to the Rock 'n' Roll Express six months later. Eaton and Condrey also had long running feuds with <a href="The%20New%20Breed%20%28professional%20wrestling%20tag%20team%29">The New Breed</a> (<a href="Christopher%20Ashford-Smith">Chris Champion</a> and <a href="Sean%20Royal">Sean Royal</a>) as well as <a href="The%20Road%20Warriors">The Road Warriors</a> (<a href="Road%20Warrior%20Animal">Animal</a> and <a href="Road%20Warrior%20Hawk">Hawk</a>). The feud with the Road Warriors included a high-profile <a href="Professional%20wrestling%20match%20types%23Scaffold%20match">Scaffold match</a> at <a href="Starrcade%20%281986%29">Starrcade 1986</a>, which the Midnight Express lost.

In early 1987, Condrey left JCP for undisclosed reasons, and "Sweet" Stan Lane took his place as part of the Midnight Express. In May 1987, after teaming for only a few months, Eaton and Lane became champions when they won the <a href="WCW%20United%20States%20Tag%20Team%20Championship">NWA United States Tag team title</a> for the first time, a title they would win three times during their time together. A year later the team was cheered on despite being heels, as the Midnight Express won the NWA World Tag Team Title from <a href="Arn%20Anderson">Arn Anderson</a> and <a href="Tully%20Blanchard">Tully Blanchard</a> on September 10, 1988. This feud was cut short when Anderson & Blanchard signed with the WWF over money issues. The Midnight Express' run with the title lasted a little over a month-and-a-half before the Road Warriors took the gold from them in a brutal match up, which saw the heel Road Warriors brutalize the now-popular Midnight Express.
Now the fan favorites, the Midnight Express had to contend with a team thought to be disbanded forever: the Original Midnight Express, which consisted of Condrey and Randy Rose, who joined JCP after a brief run in the <a href="American%20Wrestling%20Association">AWA</a>. The duo was led by long-time Jim Cornette nemesis <a href="Paul%20Heyman">Paul E. Dangerously</a>, in a storyline that saw them trying to prove the originals were better than the new version. The surprise appearance of the Original Midnight Express gave Dangerously's team the initial momentum in the feud, but soon after, Condrey left the promotion once more. This forced the bookers to bring in <a href="Jack%20Victory">Jack Victory</a> as a replacement as Condrey's disappearance cut the promising feud short.

The Midnight Express then turned their attention to Paul E.'s new team, The <a href="Headshrinkers">Samoan S.W.A.T. Team</a> as well as a new version of <a href="The%20Fabulous%20Freebirds">The Fabulous Freebirds</a>. Eaton and Lane were defeated by the Freebirds in the finals of a tournament for the vacated World Tag Team Titles. Following this loss, the Midnight Express teamed with their former enemies The Road Warriors and <a href="%26quot%3BDr.%20Death%26quot%3B%20Steve%20Williams">"Dr. Death" Steve Williams</a> to defeat the SST and the Freebirds in a <a href="WarGames%20match">WarGames match</a> at <a href="The%20Great%20American%20Bash%20%281987%29">The Great American Bash</a>. Following this feud, Lane and Eaton began having issues with a young new team in the NWA known as "the Dynamic Dudes" (<a href="Shane%20Douglas">Shane Douglas</a> and <a href="John%20Laurinaitis">Johnny Ace</a>). The Dudes admitted that the Midnight Express was one of their favorite teams and asked if Cornette would be their manager as well. Cornette agreed to manage the young team, to the displeasure of the Midnight Express. After arguing with the Express, Jim Cornette stopped accompanying Eaton and Lane to the ring, choosing to only actively manage the Dudes. At the , the two teams met with Jim Cornette appearing in a neutral corner, forced to choose between the teams. The Express started out very aggressively, especially for a team that was supposed to be fan favorites, and when the night was over, the Midnight Express had once again established themselves as heels with Jim Cornette in their corner; Cornette had never stopped siding with the Express.

After returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a storyline with the up-and-coming team of <a href="Brian%20Pillman">Flyin' Brian</a> and <a href="Tom%20Zenk">"Z-Man" Tom Zenk</a> over the United States Tag team title. The Express won the title from the young team in early 1990, but lost the belts to <a href="The%20Steiner%20Brothers">The Steiner Brothers</a> (<a href="Rick%20Steiner">Rick</a> and <a href="Scott%20Steiner">Scott</a>) three months later. After a loss at the WCW pay-per-view <a href="Halloween%20Havoc%20%281990%29">Halloween Havoc 1990</a>, the Midnight Express split up, as Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation, while Eaton chose to remain in WCW. For the first time in almost a decade, there was no Midnight Express.
For the first time since 1979, Eaton was a singles competitor, and he faced an uphill struggle to establish himself. He wrestled his former opponents in tag team competition such as Brad Armstrong (whom he defeated at <a href="WrestleWar%20%281991%29">WrestleWar '91</a>), Ricky Morton and "Z-Man" Tom Zenk (whom he defeated at <a href="Starrcade%20%281990%29">Starrcade '90</a>, but lost to at the <a href="Clash%20of%20the%20Champions%23Clash%20of%20the%20Champions%20XIV">Clash of the Champions XIV</a>), but it was not until he turned face during the early parts of 1991 that he started to move up the rankings. At <a href="SuperBrawl%20I">SuperBrawl I</a>, Eaton defeated Arn Anderson to win the <a href="WCW%20World%20Television%20Championship">World Television Championship</a>. Eaton's highest profile match as a singles wrestler came when he faced off against the <a href="WCW%20World%20Heavyweight%20Championship">World Heavyweight Champion</a> <a href="Ric%20Flair">"Nature Boy" Ric Flair</a> at <a href="Clash%20of%20the%20Champions%23Clash%20of%20the%20Champions%20XV">Clash of the Champions XV</a> in a <a href="Two%20out%20of%20three%20falls%20match">two-out-of-three falls match</a>. Eaton pinned Flair in the first fall, but ultimately lost to Flair two falls to one. His World Television Championship reign was short-lived, as he came face to face with newcomer <a href="Stone%20Cold%20Steve%20Austin">"Stunning" Steve Austin</a>, who cheated his way to win the title from Eaton.

Late in 1991, Paul E. Dangerously formed the <a href="List%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23S">faction</a> <a href="Dangerous%20Alliance">The Dangerous Alliance</a>. Eaton joined the group when he assisted <a href="Rick%20Rude">Rick Rude</a>, with the storyline being that Dangerously had brought Rude to WCW, in defeating <a href="Sting%20%28wrestler%29">Sting</a> for the United States Championship. In joining the group, Eaton became allies with Rude, <a href="Larry%20Zbyszko">Larry Zbyszko</a>, and his two former rivals for the World Television Championship in Arn Anderson and Steve Austin. Shortly after the group was formed, Anderson and Eaton became its tag team specialists. This seemed to make sense, as both men had been successful tag team wrestlers in their careers; Anderson himself had been a two-time world champion teaming with Tully Blanchard in the <a href="Four%20Horsemen%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">Four Horsemen</a> and had also won the belts with Zbyszko earlier in the year. Eaton and Anderson quickly won the WCW World Tag Team Championship by defeating <a href="Ricky%20Steamboat">Ricky Steamboat</a> and <a href="Dustin%20Rhodes">Dustin Rhodes</a>, the team to whom Anderson and Zbyszko lost the belts, for the championship and held on to the belts for five months before they lost them to the Steiner Brothers.
The Dangerous Alliance was a dominant force in WCW. At one point during 1992, they held every title except the WCW World Title, which was held by their main opponent and arch enemy <a href="Steve%20Borden">Sting</a>. The war between the Dangerous Alliance and Sting and friends escalated until it was decided to settle it in a double-ring War Games match at <a href="WrestleWar%20%281992%29">WrestleWar 1992</a>. Sting's team won when Sting forced Eaton to give up after Larry Zbyszko accidentally struck Eaton in the arm with a metal rod. This match would be given a <a href="Dave%20Meltzer%23Rating%20system">5-star rating</a> from <a href="Dave%20Meltzer">Dave Meltzer</a> of the "Wrestling Observer Newsletter".

In the aftermath of the War Games match, Zbyszko was kicked out of the Alliance for causing the Alliance loss. Soon after the Alliance disintegrated, Paul E. Dangerously left WCW. Eaton and Anderson continued to team after the Alliance fell apart, now managed by Michael Hayes. Eaton and Anderson worked in the tag team division until new WCW booker Bill Watts fired Eaton along with a number of other WCW regulars in a cost-cutting measure.

When Eaton found himself without a job, he reached out to former manager Jim Cornette. Cornette had started his own wrestling federation, <a href="Smoky%20Mountain%20Wrestling">Smoky Mountain Wrestling</a> (SMW) and welcomed Eaton with open arms. Eaton joined up with "<a href="The%20Heavenly%20Bodies">The Heavenly Bodies</a>" (Stan Lane and <a href="Tom%20Prichard">Tom Prichard</a>), and the three were booked as the top heels of the federation for a while. Eaton also won the federation's version of the TV title, known as the <a href="SMW%20Beat%20the%20Champ%20Television%20Championship">SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship</a>.

Eaton toured Japan with <a href="New%20Japan%20Pro-Wrestling">New Japan Pro-Wrestling</a> in 1993, 1994 and 1995.

When Bill Watts was ousted from his position in WCW in favor of <a href="Eric%20Bischoff">Eric Bischoff</a> in 1993, Eaton was rehired. Once back on the roster, Eaton teamed up with a young <a href="Chris%20Benoit">Chris Benoit</a> in Benoit's first stint with WCW. Together they were mainly used to help establish rising teams or give established teams opposition. After Benoit left to return to Japan, in Eaton's next venture in tag teaming, under the name "Bad Attitude", he teamed up with Steve Keirn, formerly of the Fabulous Ones. Bad Attitude's single noteworthy moment together came when they were present as Arn Anderson turned on tag team partner Dustin Rhodes. Otherwise, the team did not get much exposure. During this time, Eaton also made a couple of appearances in ECW due to a talent trade arrangement between WCW and ECW. His most well-known appearance was at the "When Worlds Collide" show on May 14, 1994, where he teamed with <a href="Sabu%20%28wrestler%29">Sabu</a> to beat Arn Anderson and <a href="Terry%20Funk">Terry Funk</a>.

After Bad Attitude quietly ended, Eaton was placed with British snob <a href="Darren%20Matthews">"Lord" Steven Regal</a>. A series of <a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Vignette">vignettes</a> followed, in which Regal educated Eaton on how to be a man of class and sophistication. The Blue Bloods initially feuded with <a href="the%20Nasty%20Boys">the Nasty Boys</a> (<a href="Brian%20Knobs">Brian Knobs</a> and <a href="Jerry%20Sags">Jerry Sags</a>), their complete opposites in terms of "sophistication" and presentation. They also feuded with Harlem Heat (<a href="Booker%20T%20%28wrestler%29">Booker T</a> and <a href="Stevie%20Ray">Stevie Ray</a>) over the World Tag Team Championship, but never took the belts, and engaged in a short "Snobs versus Rednecks" program with <a href="Stud%20Stable">the Stud Stable</a> (<a href="Jimmy%20Golden">Bunkhouse Buck</a> and <a href="Dick%20Slater">Dick Slater</a>). In all of 1996 the team members made only one <a href="pay-per-view">pay-per-view</a> (PPV) appearance, as individuals in the "Lethal Lottery" during May's <a href="Slamboree%20%281996%29">Slamboree</a>. Later that year, Regal won the World Television Championship. Not long after, Eaton was moved out of the group, <a href="Glossary%20of%20professional%20wrestling%20terms%23Turn">turning on</a> his partners, wrestling Regal for the television championship on two occasions.

The Blue Bloods storyline represented the last serious <a href="Push%20%28professional%20wrestling%29">push</a> that Eaton was given by the WCW booking team. After the run with Regal and Taylor ended, Eaton wrestled mainly on WCW's weekend show, "Saturday Night", occasionally winning against wrestlers low in the rankings and losing to wrestlers above him.

In 2003, Eaton worked for NWA Mid-Atlantic, forming a new version of the Midnight Express with Ricky Nelson. This Midnight Express version was very short-lived, and Eaton instead began touring with Dennis Condrey (and sometimes Stan Lane) as the Midnight Express. This version of the Midnight Express performed together on select independent wrestling cards in the United States until 2012 when Eaton worked his last match.

Eaton made a one night only appearance for <a href="Total%20Nonstop%20Action%20Wrestling">Total Nonstop Action Wrestling</a> on August 13, 2003, as a part of a <a href="Kid%20Kash">Kid Kash</a> storyline where Kash faced off against a series of 1980s wrestling stars such as Larry Zbyszko and Ricky Morton. Eaton lost to Kid Kash in his only TNA appearance to date. On October 23, 2015, Eaton wrestled his last match of his nearly 40-year career, losing to Ricky Morton, also ending the 30-plus year feud between The Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Midnight Express.

Eaton is often regarded as one of the nicest people in the wrestling business, even though he wrestled as a heel for a majority of his career. In his 1999 book "", Mick Foley praised Eaton as being one of the most underrated superstars in the business, and its nicest, commenting that "it was damn near impossible to pay for anything with Bobby around, though I will confess to not trying that hard". This opinion was supported in "The Stone Cold Truth" by Steve Austin.
In addition to his personality, he is also popular with other wrestlers due to his wrestling style. Wrestling Eaton is known as "a night off", because Eaton is so skilled that the action looks very convincing but does not hurt the opponent.

Eaton is married to <a href="Bill%20Dundee">Bill Dundee</a>'s daughter, Donna. When they first started dating, they had to keep the relationship secret from her father, as her father had forbidden her from dating the wrestlers he was booking. When Dundee found out she was dating Eaton, he relented because Eaton was such a nice guy. Eaton and Donna have three children: Dustin, Dylan, and Taryn. Dylan is a professional wrestler.

In September, 2006 it was reported that Eaton was hospitalized after suffering a <a href="Myocardial%20infarction">heart attack</a>. Later, after being released from the hospital, Eaton released a statement saying that he did not have a heart attack but was diagnosed with high blood pressure with a hint of diabetes. Since then, he has suffered with several health issues, especially cardiac problems which have seen him hospitalized on several occasions. In June 2013, Eaton underwent successful surgery to have a <a href="pacemaker">pacemaker</a> inserted.

On August 5, 2016, Eaton was reported missing by his sister Debbie. According to <a href="Tommy%20Dreamer">Tommy Dreamer</a>, Eaton was last seen in Atlanta, where a photo, which has since been deleted, showed him eating at the <a href="airport">airport</a>, and had no phone and was confused. A day later, Eaton was found safe. Wrestler Matt Sigmon posted a photo on his <a href="Twitter">Twitter</a> account of himself and Bobby Eaton.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a <a href="comic%20science%20fiction">science fiction comedy</a> radio series written by <a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a> (with some material in the first series provided by <a href="John%20Lloyd%20%28writer%29">John Lloyd</a>). It was originally broadcast in the United Kingdom by <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> in 1978, and afterwards the <a href="BBC%20World%20Service">BBC World Service</a>, <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a> in the US and <a href="CBC%20Radio">CBC Radio</a> in Canada. The series was the first radio comedy programme to be produced in stereo, and was innovative in its use of music and sound effects, winning a number of awards.

The series follows the adventures of hapless Englishman <a href="Arthur%20Dent">Arthur Dent</a> and his friend <a href="Ford%20Prefect%20%28character%29">Ford Prefect</a>, an alien who writes for "<a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28fictional%29">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a>", a pan-galactic encyclopaedia and travel guide. After Earth is destroyed in the first episode, Arthur and Ford find themselves aboard a stolen spaceship piloted by a <a href="motley%20crew">motley crew</a> including <a href="Zaphod%20Beeblebrox">Zaphod Beeblebrox</a> (Ford's semi-cousin and Galactic President), depressed <a href="robot">robot</a> <a href="Marvin%20the%20Paranoid%20Android">Marvin</a>, and <a href="Trillian%20%28character%29">Trillian</a>, the only other human survivor of Earth's destruction.

A pilot programme was commissioned in March 1977, and was recorded by the end of the following June. A second series was commissioned in 1979, transmitted in 1980. Episodes of the first series were re-recorded for release on <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%23LP%20album%20adaptations">LP records and audio cassettes</a> and Adams adapted the first series into a <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28novel%29">best-selling novel</a> in 1979. After the 1980 transmissions of the second radio series, a <a href="The%20Restaurant%20at%20the%20End%20of%20the%20Universe">second novel</a> was published and the first series was adapted for <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28TV%20series%29">television</a>. This was followed by three further novels, a <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28computer%20game%29">computer game</a>, and <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">various other media</a>.

Adams considered writing a third radio series to be based on his novel "<a href="Life%2C%20the%20Universe%20and%20Everything">Life, the Universe and Everything</a>" in 1993, but the project did not begin until after his death in 2001. <a href="Dirk%20Maggs">Dirk Maggs</a>, with whom Adams had discussed the new series, directed and co-produced the radio adaptation as well as adaptations of the remaining "Hitchhiker's Guide" novels "<a href="So%20Long%2C%20and%20Thanks%20for%20All%20the%20Fish">So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish</a>" and "<a href="Mostly%20Harmless">Mostly Harmless</a>". These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series, transmitted in 2004 and 2005. A sixth series, adapting <a href="Eoin%20Colfer">Eoin Colfer</a>'s sixth part in the "trilogy", "<a href="And%20Another%20Thing...%20%28novel%29">And Another Thing...</a>" was broadcast in March 2018.

<a href="Douglas%20Adams">Douglas Adams</a> had contributed comedy sketches for BBC radio programmes produced by <a href="Simon%20Brett">Simon Brett</a> (including "<a href="The%20Burkiss%20Way">The Burkiss Way</a>" and "<a href="Week%20Ending">Week Ending</a>"), and was asked to pitch a radio sitcom in February 1977. Adams initially pitched a "bedsit comedy" because that "seemed to be what most situation comedies tended to be about." Adams said in an interview that when Brett proposed a radio science fiction comedy series, he "fell off his chair...because it was what I'd been fighting for all these years". Adams wrote his first outlines in February 1977.

Originally to be called "The Ends of the Earth," each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a different way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character who knew what was going to happen to Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in <a href="Innsbruck">Innsbruck</a>, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a "roving reporter" for "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," a pan-galactic encyclopaedia and travel guide. Recollections by his friends at the time indicate that Adams first spoke of the idea of "<a href="hitchhiking">hitchhiking</a> around the galaxy" while on holiday in Greece in 1973.

As the first episode's writing progressed, the "Guide" became the central focus of his story, and Adams decided to base the whole series around it, with the initial destruction of Earth being the only holdover from the "Ends of the Earth" proposal. In Adams' February 1977 outline, the character of Arthur Dent was called "Aleric B", the joke being that the audience initially assume the character is also an alien rather than a human. Adams renamed the character for the pilot to "Arthur Dent". Adams' biographer M. J. Simpson suggested that the character was almost certainly named after the 17th century puritan writer <a href="Arthur%20Dent%20%28Puritan%29">Arthur Dent</a>, author of "The Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven" first published in 1601, although Adams himself claimed no recollection of consciously choosing the name.

A pilot episode was commissioned on 1 March 1977 and the recording was completed on 28 June 1977. Brett and Adams recounted different parts of the pilot episode's genesis, including convincing the BBC that such a programme could not be recorded with a studio audience, and insisting that the programme be recorded in stereo sound. To win the latter argument, "Hitchhiker's" was briefly classified internally as a drama instead of a comedy, as in 1977 BBC Radio Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in stereo, whereas BBC Radio Comedy programmes were not.

A full series of six episodes (five new episodes, plus the pilot) was commissioned on 31 August 1977. However, Adams had in the meantime sent a copy of the "Hitchhiker's" pilot episode to the BBC's "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" production office, and was commissioned to write a four-part "Doctor Who" serial ("<a href="The%20Pirate%20Planet">The Pirate Planet</a>") a few weeks later. In addition, Brett had left the BBC, and the final five episodes in the first series were produced by <a href="Geoffrey%20Perkins">Geoffrey Perkins</a>.

With conflicting writing commitments, Adams engaged his friend and flatmate <a href="John%20Lloyd%20%28writer%29">John Lloyd</a> to assist in writing the fifth and sixth episodes. The second episode was produced in November 1977. The script of the last episode of the first series (later retitled "The Primary Phase") was completed in February 1978, and production (including sound mixing and effects) was completed on 3 March 1978.

Adams wrote the main parts of Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect with actors <a href="Simon%20Jones%20%28actor%29">Simon Jones</a> and <a href="Geoffrey%20McGivern">Geoffrey McGivern</a> in mind. According to Jones, Adams telephoned him when he was writing the pilot to ask whether he would essentially play himself; Adams later stated that although Dent was not a portrayal of Jones, he wrote the part to play to Jones's strengths as an actor.

The radio series (and the LP and TV versions) featured <a href="narration">narration</a> by comedy actor <a href="Peter%20Jones%20%28actor%29">Peter Jones</a> as "The Book". He was cast after it was decided that a "Peter-Jonesy" sort of voice was required. This led to a three-month search for an actor with sonorous, avuncular tones who sounded exactly like Jones, after which the producers hired Jones himself. Following another actor dropping out of the production, <a href="Bill%20Wallis">Bill Wallis</a> was called in at short notice to play two parts, Mr Prosser and Vogon Jeltz. One character appearing in the pilot who was dropped from subsequent incarnations of the story was Lady Cynthia, an aristocrat who helps demolish Dent's house, played by another ex-<a href="Cambridge%20Footlights">Cambridge Footlights</a> actress, <a href="Jo%20Kendall">Jo Kendall</a>.

The pilot featured only a small cast of characters, and following its commission into a series there was a need for additional characters. Many were picked for their roles in previous series; <a href="Mark%20Wing-Davey">Mark Wing-Davey</a> had played a character in "<a href="The%20Glittering%20Prizes">The Glittering Prizes</a>" "who took advantage of people and was very trendy", making him suitable for the role of Zaphod, according to Adams. <a href="Richard%20Vernon">Richard Vernon</a>, noted for his portrayal of "grandfatherly types", was chosen as Slartibartfast. Other characters included <a href="Susan%20Sheridan">Susan Sheridan</a> as Trillian and <a href="Stephen%20Moore%20%28actor%29">Stephen Moore</a> as Marvin.

Earthman Arthur Dent learns his house is about to be demolished to make way for a new road. His friend Ford Prefect informs him that the planet is about to be demolished by a <a href="Vogon">Vogon</a> constructor fleet "to make way for a hyperspace bypass", and that Ford is in fact an alien writer for <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28fictional%29">"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy"</a>, a pan-galactic encyclopaedia and travel guide. Hitching a ride aboard the Vogon ship which has just destroyed Earth, the pair find themselves aboard a stolen spaceship, "<a href="Heart%20of%20Gold%20%28The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%29">The Heart of Gold</a>". On board is Ford's semi-cousin and President of the Galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox; a woman Dent met at a party, Trisha "Trillian" McMillan; and a depressed robot, Marvin. Beeblebrox is searching for the mythical planet of <a href="Magrathea">Magrathea</a> and the answer to the "<a href="Phrases%20from%20The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy">Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything</a>", which it turns out is "42". Dent and the others find themselves at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, then held captive aboard a <a href="Golgafrincham">Golgafrincham</a> ship about to crash-land on prehistoric Earth.

In series two, Zaphod, wanted for stealing the "Heart of Gold" amongst other misdemeanors, attempts to contact the editor of "The Guide" while escaping mercenaries from <a href="Frogstar">Frogstar</a>, "the most totally evil place in the Galaxy". Arthur and Ford are rescued after being stranded on prehistoric Earth for years and reunited aboard the "Heart of Gold", where they are pursued by Vogons. Finding themselves on the planet of <a href="Brontitall">Brontitall</a>, populated by a race of bird people, they hear about the rudest word in the universe and the <a href="Shoe%20Event%20Horizon">Shoe Event Horizon</a>. Escaping using a 900-year-old spaceship, the three find themselves in the offices of the "Guide" editor, Zarniwoop, and we discover that it was Zaphod who accidentally signed off the Earth for destruction.

One of Adams's stated goals was to be experimental in the use of sound. Being a fan of <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a> and the <a href="The%20Beatles">Beatles</a>, and especially the experimental <a href="concept%20album">concept album</a>s both bands produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Adams wanted the programme to have the feel of a "rock album ... to convey the idea that you actually were on a spaceship or an alien planet—that sense of a huge aural landscape".

The first series was therefore the first BBC radio comedy to use <a href="stereophonic%20sound">stereophonic</a> techniques. Adams later said that before "Hitchhiker's", stereo was deemed impossible for radio comedy and after it was made compulsory. Producer Geoffrey Perkins recalled that the technology available in 1978 for mixing sound effects at the BBC's <a href="Paris%20Theatre">Paris Theatre</a> radio studio was limited. The production had one <a href="Multitrack%20recording">eight track tape recorder</a> at their disposal and so many of the effects in the programme were mixed "live" with <a href="tape%20loops">tape loops</a> of background sound effects strung around the recording studio. Actors whose speech needed to be modified in post-production by Radiophonic technicians, such as Stephen Moore's performance as Marvin the Android, were recorded in isolation from the main "humanoid" characters. Allegedly, Moore recorded most of his performance in a cupboard and met the other actors only after the first session was complete.

Sound and effects were created by <a href="Paddy%20Kingsland">Paddy Kingsland</a>, <a href="Dick%20Mills">Dick Mills</a> and Harry Parker of the <a href="BBC%20Radiophonic%20Workshop">BBC Radiophonic Workshop</a>. Several of the sound effects recorded by Dick Mills for the first series were released on the album "<a href="BBC%20Sound%20Effects%20No.%2026%20%E2%80%93%20Sci-Fi%20Sound%20Effects">BBC Sound Effects No. 26 – Sci-Fi Sound Effects</a>". Other BBC staff members who worked on the first two radio series included Alick Hale-Munro (chief sound engineer) and Anne Ling (production secretary) and the "Technical Team" is given as: Paul Hawdon, Lisa Braun (studio manager), Colin Duff (studio manager), Eric Young, Martha Knight, Max Alcock and John Whitehall.

The first radio series (first six episodes) was broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> in March and April 1978. A seventh episode was broadcast on 24 December 1978. This seventh episode was commonly known as the <a href="Christmas">Christmas</a> Episode. This had nothing to do with Christmas except in an early draft (which would have had <a href="Marvin%20the%20Paranoid%20Android">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> as the "star" that was followed by the <a href="Three%20Wise%20Men">Three Wise Men</a>); it was called the Christmas Episode because it was first broadcast on <a href="Christmas%20Eve">Christmas Eve</a>.

Production on the second series was delayed several times. While Adams was meant to be working on scripts for a stage adaptation of "Hitchhiker's" in April 1979, he was also employed as the Script Editor for "<a href="Doctor%20Who">Doctor Who</a>" and turned down an offer from John Lloyd to submit material for "<a href="Not%20the%20Nine%20O%27Clock%20News">Not the Nine O'Clock News</a>". The recording on the first day scheduled for the second radio series, 19 May 1979, was left incomplete because Adams had not yet finished the script. Further scheduled recordings on 11 July and 1 August of that year were also cancelled, this time due in part to Adams trying to work on the LP re-recordings of the first series, as well as its novelisation.

Further recording attempts were made on 23 October and 3 December. The recording of the final episode in the second series was completed on 13 January 1980: the audio mixing of the episode was not finished until 25 January, the day it was transmitted. The tape "arrived just a few minutes before transmission". The final five episodes, completing the second radio series, were broadcast in January 1980.

The theme tune used for the radio series (and all subsequent adaptations) is "Journey of the Sorcerer", an <a href="instrumental">instrumental</a> piece composed by <a href="Bernie%20Leadon">Bernie Leadon</a> and recorded by the <a href="Eagles%20%28band%29">Eagles</a> on their album "<a href="One%20of%20These%20Nights">One of These Nights</a>". Adams chose this song for its futuristic-sounding nature, but also for the fact that it had a <a href="banjo">banjo</a> in it, which, as <a href="Geoffrey%20Perkins">Geoffrey Perkins</a> recalls, Adams said would give it an "on the road, hitch-hiking feel".

Adams also wanted to incorporate music from a variety of pop, rock and classical artists. Series one ("The Primary Phase") included an eclectic range of modern classical, experimental rock and electronic music. "" lists works including "A Modern Mass for the Dead" (Requiem) by <a href="Gy%C3%B6rgy%20Ligeti">György Ligeti</a>, "<a href="A%20Rainbow%20in%20Curved%20Air">A Rainbow in Curved Air</a>" by <a href="Terry%20Riley">Terry Riley</a>, "Volumina" by György Ligeti, "<a href="Evening%20Star%20%28album%29">Wind on Water</a>" by <a href="Robert%20Fripp">Robert Fripp</a> and <a href="Brian%20Eno">Brian Eno</a>, "Poppy Nogood and the Phantom Band" by Terry Riley, "Cachaca" by <a href="Patrick%20Moraz">Patrick Moraz</a>, "<a href="Shine%20On%20You%20Crazy%20Diamond">Shine On You Crazy Diamond</a>" (intro) by <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, "<a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Music">Rock and Roll Music</a>" by <a href="Beatles">The Beatles</a>, "<a href="Also%20sprach%20Zarathustra%20%28Strauss%29">Also sprach Zarathustra</a>" (intro) by <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>, "Katakomben" by Gruppe Between, "Space Theme" by <a href="Stomu%20Yamashta">Stomu Yamashta</a>, "<a href="Oxyg%C3%A8ne">Oxygène</a>" by <a href="Jean%20Michel%20Jarre">Jean Michel Jarre</a>, "<a href="That%27s%20Entertainment%21%20%28song%29">That's Entertainment</a>" by <a href="Howard%20Dietz">Howard Dietz</a> and <a href="Arthur%20Schwartz">Arthur Schwartz</a>, "<a href="Another%20Green%20World">Over Fire Island</a>" by Eno (with Fripp), "Miracles of the Gods" by Absolute Elsewhere, "Mikrophoniet" by <a href="Karlheinz%20Stockhausen">Karlheinz Stockhausen</a>, "Melodien" by György Ligeti, "The Engulfed Cathedral" by <a href="Isao%20Tomita">Isao Tomita</a>, "Volkstanz" by Gruppe Between and "<a href="What%20a%20Wonderful%20World">What a Wonderful World</a>" by <a href="Louis%20Armstrong">Louis Armstrong</a>.

This diverse range of music was only featured during the first series due to the difficulty in <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28radio%20series%29%23Commercial%20rights%20issues">obtaining rights</a> for commercial releases (leading to episodes of the first series being remade as an <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%23LP%20album%20adaptations">LP album</a> without the proprietary background music in 1979). For series two <a href="Paddy%20Kingsland">Paddy Kingsland</a> was commissioned to provide background music and for the third to fifth series <a href="Paul%20Wickens">Paul 'Wix' Wickens</a> was chosen.

The series was first broadcast on BBC Radio 4 at 10.30pm on Wednesday 8 March 1978. Simon Jones recalled that Adams was initially disappointed at the scheduling as the timeslot was allegedly guaranteed to turn a programme into a "cult" (i.e. a small but dedicated listenership). As it happened, the programme gained listeners through the lack of any competition elsewhere on television or radio, but primarily through word of mouth; several Sunday newspapers included reviews and it was mentioned in Radio 4's "Pick of the Week". As a result of its exposure through these reviews, the BBC received numerous requests for a repeat from people who had missed the initial episodes. A repeat of the series was broadcast on 23 April, only two weeks after the last episode had aired.

In the end, the complete first series was rebroadcast twice by the BBC in 1978 and once in 1979, as well as on the <a href="BBC%20World%20Service">BBC World Service</a>. The complete second series was rebroadcast once in 1980, and the complete original run of 12 episodes was broadcast twice over a twelve-week period, once from April to June 1981 and the second time from the end of March to the start of June 1983.

Broadcasting by <a href="National%20Public%20Radio">National Public Radio</a> in the United States followed in March 1981 with a repeat broadcast in September. This was one of their first transmissions in stereo. The following year, 1982, the series was carried by <a href="CBC%20Radio">CBC Radio</a> (<a href="Canadian%20Broadcasting%20Corporation">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a>). A German radio version of the first six radio episodes, "Per Anhalter ins All" was transmitted in 1981 and the twelve original radio episodes have been translated and transmitted in Finland, France, The Netherlands and Sweden.

All of the episodes, including those completed after Adams's death, are referred to as "Fits" after <a href="Lewis%20Carroll">Lewis Carroll</a>'s "<a href="The%20Hunting%20of%20the%20Snark">The Hunting of the Snark</a>: an Agony in Eight Fits". In 1981, upon a rebroadcast of the twelve episodes of the first two series, it was decided that the Christmas episode, which previously had no episode number, would be called "Fit the Seventh" and the episodes in the second series, which had first been billed as Fit the First to Fit the Fifth (representing five parts of the second series) would become Fit the Eighth to Fit the Twelfth.

The first series was noted for its unusual concept, out-of-context parodies, "semantic and philosophical jokes", compressed prose and "groundbreaking deployment of sound effects and voice techniques".

The programme was a hit with listeners, although a <a href="BBC%20World%20Service">BBC World Service</a> listener in India allegedly "strongly objected to 'Robots taking part in a comedy show'" and another in <a href="Sierra%20Leone">Sierra Leone</a> thought that "as a source of information it is misleading". One listener complained to the "<a href="Radio%20Times">Radio Times</a>" that "In just about 50 years of radio and latterly TV listening and watching, this strikes me as the most fatuous, inane, childish, pointless, codswallopping drivel...It is not even remotely funny".

<a href="BBC%20Radio%203">BBC Radio 3</a>'s "Critics Forum" thought the show had "the sort of effect that a "<a href="Monty%20Python">Monty Python</a>" programme actually has, of making everything that appears immediately after it on radio or television or whatever, seem absolutely ludicrous". By the time the sixth episode was broadcast, the show had become a cult hit.

The success of the series encouraged Adams to <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28book%29">adapt it into a novel</a>, which was based on the first four Fits and released in the second week of October 1979. While the second radio series was being recorded in 1979, Adams was commissioned to deliver a pilot script for a <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28TV%20series%29">television adaptation</a>, which, after a number of delays, was delivered by 1981. The storyline set out by the initial radio series has since appeared in numerous formats including a <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28video%20game%29">1984 video game</a> and a 2005 <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28film%29">feature film</a>.

The original series was the recipient of a number of awards including the Imperial Tobacco Award (1978), The Sony Award (1979), The Society of Authors/Pye Awards Best Programme for Young People (1980) and the Mark Time Awards 'Grand Master Award' (Adams) and 'Hall of Fame' (1998). It was the only radio show ever to be nominated for the <a href="Hugo%20Award">Hugo science fiction awards</a>, in 1979, in the '<a href="Hugo%20Award%20for%20Best%20Dramatic%20Presentation">Best Dramatic Presentation</a>' category.
As a result of the series, Douglas Adams was inducted into the <a href="Radio%20Academy">Radio Academy</a>'s Hall of Fame.

In November 2003, two years after Adams's death and 23 years after the production on the Secondary Phase had ceased, a new radio adaptation of Adams' unadapted novel "<a href="Life%2C%20the%20Universe%20and%20Everything">Life, the Universe and Everything</a>" was announced. This would become the third series of the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" on radio. <a href="Dirk%20Maggs">Dirk Maggs</a>, a friend of Adams, was chosen to create, direct and co-produce the adaptations. Maggs had previously consulted with Adams on potential radio adaptations for the final three books in 1993 and 1997. The project was restarted in September 2001 by Maggs, Helen Chattwell and Bruce Hyman, with help from Jane Belson and Ed Victor.

At the time of the announcement, it was stated that the original goal was to transmit the six-part adaptation of the third novel starting in February 2004, with the remaining eight episodes comprising the final two novels. A fourth and fifth series based on "<a href="So%20Long%2C%20and%20Thanks%20For%20All%20the%20Fish">So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish</a>" and "<a href="Mostly%20Harmless">Mostly Harmless</a>" were to have been transmitted in September 2004.

However, soon after the six episodes comprising the third series had been recorded by <a href="Above%20the%20Title%20Productions">Above the Title Productions</a>, a minor legal dispute over the online availability of episodes arose between the production company and <a href="The%20Walt%20Disney%20Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>, which had started production on the <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28film%29">"Hitchhiker's" movie</a>, also in 2003. This led to a delay in transmitting the third series and an immediate cessation in the production of series four and five. Eventually a deal was worked out, and the Tertiary Phase was first broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> on 21 September 2004.

Maggs stated in the series' script book that he felt bound by his promise to Douglas Adams to allow the scripts of the Tertiary Phase to closely follow the plot of the third book; "I myself was willing to give the Tertiary Phase 7 out of 10 on the grounds that I was a little too reverential to the text and the pace suffered as a result." But in adapting the final two novels, the only instructions Maggs got from Adams was "They don't need more than four episodes each." Thus Maggs was able to use many of the major plot elements of the final two books (though not necessarily in the same order), and attempt to reconnect plot threads from all five radio series.

The new episodes reunited most of the living original cast. The parts of <a href="The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%20%28fictional%29">The Book</a>, <a href="Minor%20characters%20from%20The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%23Eddie">Eddie the Computer</a> and <a href="Minor%20characters%20from%20The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%23Slartibartfast">Slartibartfast</a> were recast to replace actors now deceased, with <a href="William%20Franklyn">William Franklyn</a>, Roger Gregg and <a href="Richard%20Griffiths">Richard Griffiths</a> taking over these three roles, respectively. <a href="Peter%20Jones%20%28actor%29">Peter Jones</a>, the original narrator, had died in 2000; <a href="Richard%20Vernon">Richard Vernon</a>, the original Slartibartfast, had died in 1997; and David Tate, who had voiced Eddie the Computer (among many other roles), had died in 1996.

Bill Wallis, who played <a href="Minor%20characters%20from%20The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%23Mr%20Prosser">Mr. Prosser</a> and <a href="Minor%20characters%20from%20The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%23Prostetnic%20Vogon%20Jeltz">Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz</a> in the original series, was unavailable, and <a href="Toby%20Longworth">Toby Longworth</a> took the role of Jeltz in the new series. John Marsh, who had been the continuity announcer for Fits Two to Twelve, was rehired to reprise this role. There was also a posthumous cameo role by Adams as <a href="Minor%20characters%20from%20The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%23Agrajag">Agrajag</a>, edited from his BBC audiobook recording of the novel.

In series 3, after the events of series 2 are revealed to be a hallucination, Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect find themselves again stuck on prehistoric Earth. After being rescued, they find themselves transported to <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a> just before it is destroyed by 11 white robots. Slartibartfast teaches Dent how cricket is based on the history of the worst wars in the galaxy, and the pair travel to Krikkit in order to prevent another war. In the final part, Dent and Trillian meet the computer behind the Supernova Bomb and there is another attempt to find the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe and Everything.

In the fourth series, Dent discovers that Earth has been recreated again and meets <a href="Fenchurch%20%28The%20Hitchhiker%27s%20Guide%20to%20the%20Galaxy%29">Fenchurch</a>, the woman of his dreams. Meanwhile, a spaceship lands in Knightsbridge, God's Last Message to his Creation is discovered, and Marvin makes his last appearance. In the fifth series, a tenth planet in the solar system is discovered and Ford discovers that "The Guide" has become a much more sinister place to work. Arthur Dent discovers that he is a father and his new daughter, Random, flies to Earth to meet him. There are three potential endings to the series.

The third series ran on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> from Tuesday 21 September to 26 October 2004, with repeats on the following Thursdays. The series was also <a href="streaming%20media">streamed</a> in <a href="RealPlayer">RealPlayer</a> and <a href="Windows%20Media">Windows Media</a> formats (including versions in a <a href="Surround%20Sound">5.1 surround mix</a>) were made available on Radio 4's website until the following Thursday. In another continuity nod, the term "Fit" is still used in place of "episode"; episodes of the third series were subtitled "Fits the Thirteenth" to "Eighteenth".

The six-part "Tertiary Phase" was broadcast in September and October 2004. The four-part "Quandary Phase" was broadcast in May 2005, and the four-part "Quintessential Phase" was broadcast immediately following, in May and June 2005. The names for these series were chosen because they sound "less daunting, more memorable and are a bit easier to spell" than the standard terms <a href="quaternary">quaternary</a> and <a href="quinary">quinary</a>.

A six episode series dubbed the "Hexagonal Phase" was broadcast on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a> beginning on 8 March 2018, exactly 40 years after the first series' initial broadcast in 1978, and concluding 12 April 2018. The series is based on the sixth novel "<a href="And%20Another%20Thing...%20%28novel%29">And Another Thing...</a>" by <a href="Eoin%20Colfer">Eoin Colfer</a> and adapted by the director <a href="Dirk%20Maggs">Dirk Maggs</a> who included some dialogue and material based on unfinished ideas in Adams's papers. Dirk Maggs produced the series which features members of the original radio and television casts.

The first two series were first released on record (as broadcast radio in 1979), audio cassette (revised from radio) and CD (revised revised) in 1988, marking the tenth anniversary of the first broadcast of the first episode. These were the first programmes of any kind released on CD by the <a href="BBC%20Radio%20Collection">BBC Radio Collection</a>. The two radio series were known simply as "the first series" and "the second series" until 1992 when the BBC made its first re-release in separate boxes as "The Primary Phase" and "The Secondary Phase". The episodes were released with those titles in 1993, and again in 1998, for the series' twentieth anniversary. In 2001, they became the first programmes of any kind re-released by the BBC Radio Collection in an <a href="Compressed%20audio%20optical%20disc">MP3-CD</a> format.

A three-CD set of the Tertiary Phase was released in mid-October 2004, before the final episodes were broadcast. These CDs contain extended material, previously cut to make 27-minute episodes for radio. A two-CD set of the Quandary Phase was released at the end of May 2005, and a two-CD set of the Quintessential Phase was released at the end of June 2005. Both sets again include material that was originally cut for reasons of timing. The sixth series is scheduled for release on CD on 13 April 2018.

A script book for the final fourteen episodes was released in July 2005. The book is entitled "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases." Dirk Maggs writes in his introduction that the "book is a companion volume to ""..."

A box set entitled "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Complete Radio Series" was released on 3 October 2005. It contains fifteen CDs, subdivided per radio series, and bonus material exclusive to the box set. BBC Audio released a DVD version of the "Tertiary Phase", featuring that series in 5.1 surround sound, in October 2006. Contrary to previous announcements, this was merely a <a href="DVD-Video">DVD-Video</a> disc with Dolby Digital sound and other features, rather than a <a href="DVD-Audio">DVD-Audio</a> disc. While it had been stated that BBC Audio plans on also releasing the fourth and fifth radio series on DVD, no dates have been set.

Special editions of the Primary and Secondary Phases were released in November 2008. These have, according to the BBC, been given "a thorough clean-up and remaster" by Dirk Maggs. This includes using the new Philip Pope signature tune, so the material can be released worldwide, which has required John Marsh to re-record his announcements so they could be mixed in. Cleaning up the recordings aims to reduce the hiss produced by the overdubbing in the original and also re-levelling the episodes to produce a greater clarity in the sound.

According to the inlay which comes with the Special Edition, all previous CD editions of the Primary & Secondary Phases played back slightly fast due to <a href="Tape%20transport">capstan</a> wear on the mastering tape machine, with the result that the audio was <a href="Pitch%20shift">pitch-shifted</a> up by half a <a href="semitone">semitone</a>. That was corrected for the special editions and has the effect of making the episodes nearly a minute longer.

A number of scenes from Fit the Third were cut from commercially released recordings of the radio series because they featured copyrighted music. For example, in one scene <a href="Marvin%20the%20Paranoid%20Android">Marvin</a> "hums" like <a href="Pink%20Floyd">Pink Floyd</a>, using the opening to "<a href="Shine%20On%20You%20Crazy%20Diamond">Shine On You Crazy Diamond</a>", then "sings" "<a href="Rock%20and%20Roll%20Music">Rock and Roll Music</a>" by <a href="The%20Beatles">The Beatles</a>, and finally the theme music from "", the opening "Sunrise" movement from <a href="Richard%20Strauss">Richard Strauss</a>'s "<a href="Also%20sprach%20Zarathustra%20%28Strauss%29">Also sprach Zarathustra</a>". It would have been very cost prohibitive in the 1980s to get clearances to release a recording of Fit the Third with this music, though agreements were reached on most of the rest of the copyrighted music used during the first series. As a result, all commercial recordings of Fit the Third are about two minutes shorter than other episodes. Recordings of the original radio broadcasts still contain it.

For the CD and cassette releases of the Tertiary Phase in the United States, and all CD and cassette releases of the Quandary and Quintessential Phases, the instrumental title theme, "<a href="Journey%20of%20the%20Sorcerer">Journey of the Sorcerer</a>", composed by <a href="Bernie%20Leadon">Bernie Leadon</a> and originally recorded by US rock band <a href="the%20Eagles">the Eagles</a>, was re-interpreted by The Illegal Eagles, a <a href="tribute%20band">tribute band</a>, using an arrangement by <a href="Philip%20Pope">Philip Pope</a>. This was done for licensing reasons (though the original track was used for the original radio transmissions and the on-demand downloads). In a 2005 interview with <a href="Simon%20Jones%20%28actor%29">Simon Jones</a>, the use of this song was mentioned as a major cause for the delay in releasing recordings of the new series in the United States.

The Well of Loneliness

The Well of Loneliness is a <a href="lesbian%20literature">lesbian novel</a> by British author <a href="Radclyffe%20Hall">Radclyffe Hall</a> that was first published in 1928 by <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a>. It follows the life of Stephen Gordon, an Englishwoman from an upper-class family whose "<a href="sexual%20inversion%20%28sexology%29">sexual inversion</a>" (<a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a>) is apparent from an early age. She finds love with Mary Llewellyn, whom she meets while serving as an <a href="List%20of%20ambulance%20drivers%20during%20World%20War%20I">ambulance driver in World War I</a>, but their happiness together is marred by social isolation and rejection, which Hall depicts as typically suffered by "inverts", with predictably debilitating effects. The novel portrays "inversion" as a natural, God-given state and makes an explicit plea: "Give us also the right to our existence".

The novel became the target of a campaign by <a href="James%20Douglas%20%28journalist%29">James Douglas</a>, editor of the "<a href="Sunday%20Express">Sunday Express</a>", who wrote, "I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of <a href="prussic%20acid">prussic acid</a> than this novel." Although its only sexual reference consists of the words “she kissed her full on the lips, as a lover” and "and that night, they were not divided", a British court judged it <a href="Obscenity%23United%20Kingdom">obscene</a> because it defended "unnatural practices between women". In the United States the book survived legal challenges in <a href="New%20York%20%28state%29">New York state</a> and in <a href="United%20States%20Customs%20Court">Customs Court</a>.

Publicity over "The Well of Loneliness"s legal battles increased the visibility of <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a>s in British and American culture. For decades it was the best-known lesbian novel in English, and often the first source of information about lesbianism that young people could find. Some readers have valued it, while others have criticised it for Stephen's expressions of <a href="self-hatred">self-hatred</a>, and viewed it as inspiring shame. Its role in promoting images of lesbians as "mannish" or <a href="cross-dressing">cross-dressed</a> women has also been controversial. Although critics differ as to the value of "The Well of Loneliness" as a work of literature, its treatment of sexuality and gender continues to inspire study and debate.

In 1926, Radclyffe Hall was at the height of her career. Her novel "Adam's Breed", about the spiritual awakening of an Italian headwaiter, had become a bestseller; it would soon win the <a href="Prix%20Femina">Prix Femina</a> and the <a href="James%20Tait%20Black%20Prize">James Tait Black Prize</a>. She had long thought of writing a novel about sexual inversion; now, she believed, her literary reputation would allow such a work to be given a hearing. Since she knew she was risking scandal and "the shipwreck of her whole career", she sought and received the blessing of her partner, <a href="Una%20Troubridge">Una Troubridge</a>, before she began work. Her goals were social and political; she wanted to end public silence about <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a> and bring about "a more tolerant understanding" – as well as to "spur all classes of inverts to make good through hard work...and sober and useful living".

In April 1928 she told her editor that her new book would require complete commitment from its publisher and that she would not allow even one word to be altered. "I have put my pen at the service of some of the most persecuted and misunderstood people in the world...So far as I know nothing of the kind has ever been attempted before in fiction."

The book's protagonist, Stephen Gordon, is born in the late <a href="Victorian%20era">Victorian era</a> to upper-class parents in <a href="Worcestershire">Worcestershire</a> who are expecting a boy and who christen her with the name they had already chosen. Even at birth she is physically unusual, a "narrow-hipped, wide-shouldered little tadpole of a baby". She hates dresses, wants to cut her hair short, and longs to be a boy. At seven, she develops a crush on a housemaid named Collins, and is devastated when she sees Collins kissing a <a href="footman">footman</a>.

Stephen's father, Sir Phillip, dotes on her; he seeks to understand her through the writings of <a href="Karl%20Heinrich%20Ulrichs">Karl Heinrich Ulrichs</a>, the first modern writer to propose a theory of homosexuality, but does not share his findings with Stephen. Her mother, Lady Anna, is distant, seeing Stephen as a "blemished, unworthy, maimed reproduction" of Sir Phillip. At eighteen, Stephen forms a close friendship with a Canadian man, Martin Hallam, but is horrified when he declares his love for her. The following winter, Sir Phillip is crushed by a falling tree; at the last moment he tries to explain to Lady Anna that Stephen is an <a href="sexual%20inversion%20%28sexology%29">invert</a>, but dies without managing to do so.

Stephen begins to dress in masculine clothes made by a tailor rather than a dressmaker. At twenty-one she falls in love with Angela Crossby, the American wife of a new neighbour. Angela uses Stephen as an "<a href="anodyne">anodyne</a> against boredom", allowing her "a few rather schoolgirlish kisses". The pair conduct a relationship that, although not explicitly stated, seems to have some sexual element, at least for Stephen. Then Stephen discovers that Angela is having an affair with a man. Fearing exposure, Angela shows a letter from Stephen to her husband, who sends a copy to Stephen's mother. Lady Anna denounces Stephen for "presum[ing] to use the word love in connection with...these unnatural cravings of your unbalanced mind and undisciplined body." Stephen replies, "As my father loved you, I loved...It was good, good, "good" – I'd have laid down my life a thousand times over for Angela Crossby." After the argument, Stephen goes to her father's study and for the first time opens his locked bookcase. She finds a book by <a href="Krafft-Ebing">Krafft-Ebing</a> – assumed by critics to be "<a href="Psychopathia%20Sexualis">Psychopathia Sexualis</a>", a text about homosexuality and <a href="paraphilias">paraphilias</a> – and, reading it, learns that she is an invert.

Stephen moves to London and writes a well-received first novel. Her second novel is less successful, and her friend the playwright Jonathan Brockett, himself an invert, urges her to travel to Paris to improve her writing through a fuller experience of life. There she makes her first, brief contact with urban invert culture, meeting the lesbian <a href="salon%20%28gathering%29">salon</a> hostess Valérie Seymour. During World War I she joins an ambulance unit, eventually serving at the front and earning the <a href="Croix%20de%20Guerre">Croix de Guerre</a>. She falls in love with a younger fellow driver, Mary Llewellyn, who comes to live with her after the war ends. They are happy at first, but Mary becomes lonely when Stephen returns to writing. Rejected by <a href="wikt%3Apolite%20society">polite society</a>, Mary throws herself into Parisian nightlife. Stephen believes Mary is becoming hardened and embittered and feels powerless to provide her with "a more normal and complete existence".

Martin Hallam, now living in Paris, rekindles his old friendship with Stephen. In time, he falls in love with Mary. Persuaded that she cannot give Mary happiness, Stephen pretends to have an affair with Valérie Seymour to drive her into Martin's arms. The novel ends with Stephen's plea to God: "Give us also the right to our existence!"

Hall describes "The Well of Loneliness" as "The first long and very serious novel entirely upon the subject of sexual inversion" She wrote "The Well of Loneliness" in part to popularise the ideas of <a href="sexology">sexologists</a> such as <a href="Richard%20von%20Krafft-Ebing">Richard von Krafft-Ebing</a> and <a href="Havelock%20Ellis">Havelock Ellis</a>, who regarded homosexuality as an inborn and unalterable trait: congenital sexual inversion. 

In Krafft-Ebing's "Psychopathia Sexualis" (1886), the first book Stephen finds in her father's study, inversion is described as a degenerative disorder common in families with histories of mental illness. Exposure to these ideas leads Stephen to describe herself and other inverts as "hideously maimed and ugly". Later texts such as "Sexual Inversion" (1896) by Havelock Ellis – who contributed a foreword to "The Well" – described inversion simply as a difference, not as a defect. By 1901 Krafft-Ebing had adopted a similar view. Hall championed their ideas over those of the <a href="psychoanalysis">psychoanalysts</a>, who saw homosexuality as a form of arrested psychological development, and some of whom believed it could be changed. Indeed, Havelock Ellis' commentary for the novel, which, although edited and censored to some extent, aligns the novel directly with theories of Sexual Inversion: "I have read The Well of Loneliness with great interest because— apart from its fine qualities as a novel by a writer of accomplished art— it possesses a notable psychological and sociological significance. So far as I know, it is the first English novel which presents, in a completely faithful and uncompromising form, one particular aspect of sexual life as it exists among us today. The relation of certain people, who, while different from their fellow human beings, are sometimes of the highest character and the finest aptitudes— to the often hostile society in which they move, presents difficult and still unresolved problems"

The term sexual inversion implied <a href="gender%20role">gender role</a> reversal. Female inverts were, to a greater or lesser degree, inclined to traditionally male pursuits and dress; according to Krafft-Ebing, they had a "masculine soul". Krafft-Ebing believed that the most extreme inverts also exhibited reversal of <a href="secondary%20sex%20characteristic">secondary sex characteristic</a>s; Ellis's research had not demonstrated any such physical differences, but he devoted a great deal of study to the search for them. The idea appears in "The Well" in Stephen's unusual proportions at birth and in the scene set at Valerie Seymour's salon, where "the timbre of a voice, the build of an ankle, the texture of a hand" reveals the inversion of the guests.

In 1921, <a href="F.%20E.%20Smith%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Birkenhead">Lord Birkenhead</a>, the <a href="Lord%20Chancellor%20of%20Great%20Britain">Lord Chancellor of Great Britain</a>, had opposed a bill that would have criminalised lesbianism on the grounds that "of every thousand women ... 999 have never even heard a whisper of these practices". In reality, awareness of lesbianism had been gradually increasing since World War I, but it was still a subject most people had never heard of, or perhaps just preferred to ignore. "The Well of Loneliness" made sexual inversion a subject of household conversation for the first time. The banning of the book drew so much attention to the very subject it was intended to suppress that it left British authorities wary of further attempts to censor books for lesbian content. In 1935, after a complaint about a health book entitled "The Single Woman and Her Emotional Problems", a Home Office memo noted: "It is notorious that the prosecution of the "Well Of Loneliness" resulted in infinitely greater publicity about lesbianism than if there had been no prosecution."

In a study of a working-class lesbian community in <a href="Buffalo%2C%20New%20York">Buffalo, New York</a>, in the 1940s and 1950s, "The Well of Loneliness" was the only work of lesbian literature anyone had read or heard of. For many young lesbians in the 1950s, it was the only source of information about lesbianism. "The Well"'s name recognition made it possible to find when bookstores and libraries did not yet have sections devoted to <a href="LGBT%20literature">LGBT literature</a>. As late as 1994, an article in "<a href="Feminist%20Review">Feminist Review</a>" noted that "The Well" "regularly appears in <a href="coming%20out">coming-out</a> stories – and not just those of older lesbians". It has often been mocked: <a href="Terry%20Castle">Terry Castle</a> says that "like many bookish lesbians I seem to have spent much of my adult life making jokes about it", and <a href="Mary%20Renault">Mary Renault</a>, who read it in 1938, remembered laughing at its "earnest humourlessness" and "impermissible allowance of self-pity". Yet it has also produced powerful emotional responses, both positive and negative. One woman was so angry at the thought of how "The Well" would affect an "isolated emerging lesbian" that she "wrote a note in the library book, to tell other readers that women loving women can be beautiful". A <a href="Holocaust">Holocaust</a> survivor said, "Remembering that book, I wanted to live long enough to kiss another woman."

James Douglas illustrated his denunciation of "The Well" with a photograph of Radclyffe Hall in a silk smoking jacket and bow tie, holding a cigarette and monocle. She was also wearing a straight knee-length skirt, but later "Sunday Express" articles cropped the photo so tightly that it became difficult to tell she was not wearing trousers. Hall's style of dress was not scandalous in the 1920s; short hairstyles were common, and the combination of tailored jackets and short skirts was a recognised fashion, discussed in magazines as the "severely masculine" look. Some lesbians, like Hall, adopted variations of the style as a way of signalling their sexuality, but it was a code that only a few knew how to read. With the controversy over "The Well of Loneliness", Hall became the public face of sexual inversion, and all women who favoured masculine fashions came under new scrutiny. Lesbian journalist <a href="Evelyn%20Irons">Evelyn Irons</a> – who considered Hall's style of dress "rather effeminate" compared to her own – said that after the publication of "The Well", truck drivers would call out on the street to any woman who wore a collar and tie: "Oh, you're Miss Radclyffe Hall". Some welcomed their newfound visibility: when Hall spoke at a luncheon in 1932, the audience was full of women who had imitated her look. But in a study of lesbian women in Salt Lake City in the 1920s and '30s, nearly all regretted the publication of "The Well" because it had drawn unwanted attention to them.

In the 1970s and early '80s, when <a href="lesbian%20feminist">lesbian feminist</a>s rejected the <a href="butch%20and%20femme">butch and femme</a> identities that Hall's novel had helped to define, writers like <a href="Jane%20Rule">Jane Rule</a> and <a href="Blanche%20Wiesen%20Cook">Blanche Wiesen Cook</a> criticised "The Well" for defining lesbianism in terms of masculinity, as well as for presenting lesbian life as "joyless". 

Furthermore, "The Well" arguably embodies what modern readers may regard as <a href="Misogyny">misogynistic</a> and <a href="Biphobia">biphobic</a> ideas in its presentation of the <a href="femme">femme</a> women who experience attraction towards Stephen but eventually end up in heterosexual relationships. Mary's femininity, in particular, is belittled by Hall's presentation of her: She is not Stephen's equal in age, education, family, or wealth, and so is constantly infantilised by her lover. This, coupled with Mary's dependence on Stephen, seems to emphasise the supposed inferiority of the feminine to the masculine. As Clare Hemmings argues, Mary is merely used as “a means for Stephen to reach her own understanding of the true nature of the deviant’s plight.” 

Moreover, Hemmings continues that both Mary and Angela represent the “‘traitorous femme’ who remains untrustworthy as she may leave you [her female lover] for a man.” The idea that Mary’s sexuality and seemingly genuine feelings for Stephen are invalidated by the possibility of her heterosexual relationship with Martin may seem <a href="Biphobia">biphobic</a> to modern readers. Furthermore, Hall’s treatment of Mary as a dependant and a <a href="Foil%20%28literature%29">foil</a> for Stephen’s masculinity seemingly degrades <a href="femme">femme</a> lesbianism, or femininity in itself, as innately untrustworthy and inferior to forms of masculinity, whether exhibited by men or women. 

The understanding of sexuality represented in the novel is considered strictly in binary terms and exists within misogynistic stereotypes that were prevalent when the novel was published. This contributes to the undertones of biphobia that are present in the treatment of the femme characters that exhibit female-female sexual attraction, especially so in the treatment of Mary. These choices could be partly explained by the understanding of the term bisexuality at the time. During the interwar period the definition was most often understood as a scientific term describing a psychological gender duality, rather than referencing a sexual preference. In other words, the term was used as a scientific neologism for androgyny, and related to understandings of gender and sex, but not to sexual preferences . The heterosexist theory of sexual inversion exhibited in the novel, which asserts that women who love women are really men, could not account for same-sex attractions in feminine and bisexual women, however, especially those whose partners were not masculine. 
Some women in this period ascribed to the theory of Otto Weininger, who suggested that those attracted to others of their own sex were born neither male nor female, but both: they were "sexually intermediate types" This theory posited that "the woman who attracts and is attracted by other women is herself half male" and that "homo-sexuality in a woman is the outcome of her masculinity and presupposes a higher degree of development” . Unfortunately, this argument contributes to misogynistic ideas that align intellect genetically with men and masculinity, meaning that Stephen's literary talents in the novel are considered part of her sexual inversion, and come from her masculine brain. This also means that the femme characters, such as Mary, are represented as inferior to the masculine. It invalidates their sexuality as bisexual, because bisexuality did not fit within the binary definitions of sexual inversion. 

Some critics assert that "The Well's" queer significance extends beyond lesbianism, arguing that the novel provides important bisexual representation in literature. 

Other criticism focuses on the potential confusion of sexuality with gender in the novel. As Jay Prosser argues"," “rightly tracing Hall’s debt to nineteenth-century sexologists, critics have wrongly reduced sexual inversion to homosexuality.” What many refer to as Stephen's ‘<a href="Butch%20and%20femme">butch lesbianism</a>’, Prosser suggests, is actually a <a href="transgender">transgender</a> identity. As a child, Stephen insists that s/he is male - “Yes, of course I’m a boy…I must be a boy ‘cause I feel exactly like one,” – and, when talking to her/his mother, Stephen claims that, “All my life I’ve never felt like a woman, and you know it.” Through Stephen's final rejection of Mary, ostensibly so that Mary can participate in a heterosexual relationship with Martin and therefore have a more secure life, Prosser surmises that “Stephen affirms her identification with the heterosexual man”, thus rejecting lesbianism and instead aligning her/himself with the male.

Esther Newton, writing in 1989, provides a different perspective of Hall's seemingly confusing depiction of Stephen's lesbianism and its conflation with her gender, hinging her discussion on understanding "The Well" in its historical and social context. Newton argues that "Hall and many other feminists like her embraced [...] the image of the mannish lesbian [...] primarily because they desperately wanted to break out of the asexual model of romantic friendship" prevalent in the nineteenth century. Sex was seen as something that "could only occur in the presence of an imperial and imperious penis", such that sex between women was simply not recognised to exist. Newton shows how sexologists of the time, like <a href="Havelock%20Ellis">Ellis</a>, echoes this sentiment, where his "antifeminism and reluctance to see active lust in women committed him to fusing inversion and masculinity". In a society "very conscious of sex and its vast importance", Stephen feels excluded from the rigid, feminine role imposed on her as a biological female. Hence, for Stephen's lesbianism to be recognised by the readers in that time, Hall had to deliberately show Stephen "enter(ing) the male world, [...] as a lesbian in male body drag", which simultaneously enabled the feminine women in the novel to demonstrate their lesbianism through "association with their masculine partners". 

The novel has had its defenders among feminists in the academy, such as <a href="Alison%20Hennegan">Alison Hennegan</a>, pointing out that the novel did raise awareness of homosexuality among the British public and cleared the way for later work that tackled gay and lesbian issues.

In more recent criticism, critics have tended to focus on the novel's historical context, but "The Well"'s reputation as ""the most depressing" lesbian novel ever written" persists and is still controversial. Some critics see the book as reinforcing <a href="homophobia">homophobic</a> beliefs, while others argue that the book's tragedy and its depiction of shame are its most compelling aspects.

"The Well"'s ideas and attitudes now strike many readers as dated, and few critics praise its literary quality. Nevertheless, it continues to compel critical attention, to provoke strong identification and intense emotional reactions in some readers, and to elicit a high level of personal engagement from its critics.

In Hall's time, Paris was known for having a relatively large and visible gay and lesbian community – in part because France, unlike England, had no laws against male homosexuality. <a href="Marcel%20Proust">Marcel Proust</a>'s novels continued in their influence upon 1920s Parisian society depicting lesbian and gay subculture. When Stephen first travels to Paris, at the urging of her friend Jonathan Brockett – who may be based on <a href="No%C3%ABl%20Coward">Noël Coward</a> – she has not yet spoken about her inversion to anyone. Brockett, acting as tour guide, hints at a secret history of inversion in the city by referring to <a href="Marie%20Antoinette">Marie Antoinette</a>'s rumoured relationship with the <a href="Princesse%20de%20Lamballe">Princesse de Lamballe</a>.
Brockett next introduces Stephen to Valérie Seymour, who – like her prototype, <a href="Natalie%20Clifford%20Barney">Natalie Clifford Barney</a> – is the hostess of a <a href="salon%20%28gathering%29">literary salon</a>, many of whose guests are lesbians and gay men. Immediately after this meeting Stephen announces she has decided to settle in Paris at 35 Rue Jacob (purchased at Seymour's recommendation), with its temple in a corner of an overgrown garden. Barney lived and held her salon at 20 Rue Jacob. Stephen is wary of Valérie, and does not visit her salon until after the war, when Brockett persuades her that Mary is becoming too isolated. She finds Valérie to be an "indestructible creature" capable of bestowing a sense of self-respect on others, at least temporarily: "everyone felt very normal and brave when they gathered together at Valérie Seymour's". With Stephen's misgivings "drugged", she and Mary are drawn further into the "desolate country" of Paris gay life. At Alec's Bar – the worst in a series of depressing nightspots – they encounter "the battered remnants of men who...despised of the world, must despise themselves beyond all hope, it seemed, of salvation".

Many of those familiar with the subculture she described, including her own friends, disagreed with her portrayal of it; <a href="Romaine%20Brooks">Romaine Brooks</a> called her "a digger-up of worms with the pretension of a distinguished archaeologist". Hall's correspondence shows that the negative view of bars like Alec's that she expressed in "The Well" was sincerely meant, but she also knew that such bars did not represent the only homosexual communities in Paris. It is a commonplace of criticism that her own experience of lesbian life was not as miserable as Stephen's. By focusing on misery and describing its cause as "ceaseless persecution" by "the so-called just and righteous", she intensified the urgency of her plea for change.

Although Hall's author's note disclaims any real-world basis for the ambulance unit that Stephen joins, she drew heavily on the wartime experiences of her friend <a href="Toupie%20Lowther">Toupie Lowther</a>, co-commander of the only women's unit to serve on the front in France. Lowther, like Stephen, came from an aristocratic family, adopted a masculine style of dress, and was an accomplished fencer, tennis player, motorist and <a href="jujutsu">jujitsu</a> enthusiast. In later years she said the character of Stephen was based on her, which may have been partly true.

In "The Well of Loneliness", war work provides a publicly acceptable role for inverted women. The narrative voice asks that their contributions not be forgotten and predicts that they will not go back into hiding: "a battalion was formed in those terrible years that would never again be completely disbanded". This military metaphor continues later in the novel when inverts in postwar Paris are repeatedly referred to as a "miserable army". Hall invokes the image of the <a href="shell%20shock">shell-shocked</a> soldier to depict inverts as psychologically damaged by their outcast status: "for bombs do not trouble the nerves of the invert, but rather that terrible silent bombardment from the <a href="artillery%20battery">batteries</a> of God's good people".

Hall, who had converted to the <a href="Roman%20Catholic%20Church">Roman Catholic Church</a> in 1912, was devoutly religious. She was also a believer in <a href="necromancy">communication with the dead</a> who had once hoped to become a <a href="medium%20%28spirituality%29">medium</a> – a fact that brought her into conflict with the church, which condemned <a href="spiritualism">spiritualism</a>. Both these beliefs made their way into "The Well of Loneliness".

Stephen, born on Christmas Eve and named for the <a href="Saint%20Stephen">first martyr of Christianity</a>, dreams as a child that "in some queer way she [is] Jesus". When she discovers that Collins, object of her childhood crush, has <a href="housemaid%27s%20knee">housemaid's knee</a>, she prays that the affliction be transferred to her: "I would like to wash Collins in my blood, Lord Jesus – I would like very much to be a Saviour to Collins – I love her, and I want to be hurt like You were". This childish desire for martyrdom prefigures Stephen's ultimate self-sacrifice for Mary's sake. After she tricks Mary into leaving her – carrying out a plan that leads Valérie to exclaim "you were made for a martyr!" – Stephen, left alone in her home, sees the room thronged with inverts, living, dead and unborn. They call on her to <a href="intercession">intercede</a> with God for them, and finally <a href="spirit%20possession">possess</a> her. It is with their collective voice that she demands of God, "Give us also the right to our existence".

After Stephen reads Krafft-Ebing in her father's library, she opens the Bible at random, seeking a sign, and reads <a href="Book%20of%20Genesis">Genesis 4:15</a>, "And the Lord set a mark upon <a href="Cain">Cain</a> ..." Hall uses the <a href="Curse%20and%20mark%20of%20Cain">mark of Cain</a>, a sign of shame and exile, throughout the novel as a metaphor for the situation of inverts. Her defence of inversion took the form of a <a href="Christianity%20and%20homosexuality%23Views%20supportive%20of%20homosexuality">religious argument</a>: God had created inverts, so humanity should accept them. "The Well"'s use of religious imagery outraged the book's opponents, but Hall's vision of inversion as a God-given state was an influential contribution to the language of <a href="LGBT%20rights">LGBT rights</a>.

Three publishers praised "The Well" but turned it down. Hall's agent then sent the manuscript to <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> who, though cautious about publishing a controversial book, saw the potential for a commercial success. Cape tested the waters with a small <a href="print%20run">print run</a> of 1500 copies, priced at 15 <a href="shilling">shilling</a>s – about twice the cost of an average novel – to make it less attractive to sensation-seekers. Publication, originally scheduled for late 1928, was brought forward when he discovered that another novel with a lesbian theme, <a href="Compton%20Mackenzie">Compton Mackenzie</a>'s "Extraordinary Women", was to be published in September. Though the two books proved to have little in common, Hall and Cape saw "Extraordinary Women" as a competitor and wanted to beat it to market. "The Well" appeared on 27 July, in a black cover with a plain jacket. Cape sent review copies only to newspapers and magazines he thought would handle the subject matter non-sensationally.

Early reviews were mixed. Some critics found the novel too preachy; others, including <a href="Leonard%20Woolf">Leonard Woolf</a>, thought it was poorly structured, or complained of sloppiness in style. There was praise for its sincerity and artistry, and some expressed sympathy with Hall's moral argument. In the three weeks after the book appeared in bookstores, no reviewer called for its <a href="book%20censorship">suppression</a> or suggested that it should not have been published. A review in "T.P.'s & Cassell's Weekly" foresaw no difficulties for "The Well": "One cannot say what effect this book will have on the public attitude of silence or derision, but every reader will agree with Mr. Havelock Ellis in the preface, that 'the poignant situations are set forth with a complete absence of offence.'"

Papers from the author's archive, which are set to be digitised by the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas alongside those of her partner, the artist Una Vincenzo, Lady Troubridge, show that the novel was supported by thousands of readers, who wrote to Hall in outrage at the ban. 

Although some writers in the 1970s and 1980s treated "The Well of Loneliness" as a thinly veiled autobiography, Hall's childhood bore little resemblance to Stephen's. Angela Crossby may be a composite of various women with whom Hall had affairs in her youth, but Mary, whose lack of outside interests leaves her idle when Stephen is working, does not resemble Hall's partner Una Troubridge, an accomplished sculptor who translated <a href="Colette">Colette</a>'s novels into English. Hall said she drew on herself only for the "fundamental emotions that are characteristic of the inverted".

James Douglas, editor of the "<a href="Sunday%20Express">Sunday Express</a>", did not agree. Douglas was a dedicated moralist, an exponent of <a href="muscular%20Christianity">muscular Christianity</a>, which sought to reinvigorate the <a href="Church%20of%20England">Church of England</a> by promoting physical health and manliness. His colourfully worded editorials on subjects such as "the <a href="flapper">flapper</a> vote" (that is, the extension of <a href="suffrage">suffrage</a> to women under 30) and "modern sex novelists" helped the "Express" family of papers prosper in the cutthroat circulation wars of the late 1920s. These leader articles shared the pages of the "Sunday Express" with gossip, murderers' confessions, and features about the love affairs of great men and women of the past.
Douglas's campaign against "The Well of Loneliness" began on 18 August, with poster and billboard advertising and a teaser in the "Daily Express" promising to expose "A Book That Should Be Suppressed". In his editorial the next day, Douglas wrote that "sexual inversion and perversion" had already become too visible and that the publication of "The Well" brought home the need for society to "cleans[e] itself from the leprosy of these lepers". For Douglas the <a href="sexology">sexological</a> view of homosexuality was <a href="pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, incompatible with the <a href="Christian%20doctrine">Christian doctrine</a> of <a href="free%20will%20in%20theology">free will</a>; instead, he argued, homosexuals were damned by their own choice – which meant that others could be corrupted by "their propaganda". Above all, children must be protected: "I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of <a href="prussic%20acid">prussic acid</a> than this novel. Poison kills the body, but moral poison kills the soul." He called on the publishers to withdraw the book and the <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> to take action if they did not.

In what Hall described as an act of "imbecility coupled with momentary panic", <a href="Jonathan%20Cape">Jonathan Cape</a> sent a copy of "The Well" to the Home Secretary for his opinion, offering to withdraw the book if it would be in the <a href="public%20interest">public interest</a> to do so. The Home Secretary was <a href="William%20Joynson-Hicks">William Joynson-Hicks</a>, a <a href="Conservative%20Party%20%28UK%29">Conservative</a> known for his crackdowns on alcohol, nightclubs and gambling, as well as for his opposition to a revised version of "<a href="The%20Book%20of%20Common%20Prayer">The Book of Common Prayer</a>". He took only two days to reply that "The Well" was "gravely detrimental to the public interest"; if Cape did not withdraw it voluntarily, criminal proceedings would be brought.

Cape announced that he had stopped publication, but he secretly leased the rights to <a href="Pegasus%20Press">Pegasus Press</a>, an English-language publisher in France. His partner Wren Howard took <a href="papier-m%C3%A2ch%C3%A9">papier-mâché</a> moulds of the <a href="typesetting">type</a> to Paris, and by 28 September, Pegasus Press was shipping its edition to the London bookseller <a href="Leopold%20Hill">Leopold Hill</a>, who acted as distributor. With publicity increasing demand, sales were brisk, but the reappearance of "The Well" on bookshop shelves soon came to the attention of the Home Office. On 3 October Joynson-Hicks issued a warrant for shipments of the book to be seized.

One consignment of 250 copies was stopped at <a href="Dover">Dover</a>. Then the Chairman of the <a href="Board%20of%20Customs">Board of Customs</a> balked. He had read "The Well" and considered it a fine book, not at all obscene; he wanted no part of suppressing it. On 19 October he released the seized copies for delivery to Leopold Hill's premises, where the <a href="Metropolitan%20Police">Metropolitan Police</a> were waiting with a search warrant. Hill and Cape were summoned to appear at <a href="Bow%20Street%20Magistrates%27%20Court">Bow Street Magistrates' Court</a> to show cause why the book should not be destroyed.

From its beginning, the "Sunday Express"s campaign drew the attention of other papers. Some backed Douglas, including the "<a href="Sunday%20Chronicle">Sunday Chronicle</a>", "<a href="The%20Sunday%20People">The People</a>" and <a href="Truth%20%28British%20periodical%29">"Truth"</a>. The <a href="The%20Daily%20News%20%28UK%29">"Daily News and Westminster Gazette"</a> ran a review that, without commenting on Douglas's action, said the novel "present[ed] as a martyr a woman in the grip of a vice". Most of the British press defended "The Well". <a href="The%20Nation%20and%20Athenaeum">"The Nation"</a> suggested that the "Sunday Express" had only started its campaign because it was August, the journalistic <a href="silly%20season">silly season</a> when good stories are scarce. "<a href="Country%20Life%20%28magazine%29">Country Life</a>" and "<a href="Lady%27s%20Pictorial">Lady's Pictorial</a>" both ran positive reviews. Arnold Dawson of the "<a href="Daily%20Herald%20%28UK%20newspaper%29">Daily Herald</a>", a <a href="Labour%20Party%20%28UK%29">Labour</a> newspaper, called Douglas a "stunt journalist"; he said no one would give the book to a child, no child would want to read it, and any who did would find nothing harmful. Dawson also printed a scathing condemnation of the Home Office by <a href="H.%20G.%20Wells">H. G. Wells</a> and <a href="George%20Bernard%20Shaw">George Bernard Shaw</a> and started a counter-campaign that helped Hall obtain statements of support from the <a href="National%20Union%20of%20Railwaymen">National Union of Railwaymen</a> and the <a href="South%20Wales%20Miners%27%20Federation">South Wales Miners' Federation</a>.
<a href="Leonard%20Woolf">Leonard Woolf</a> and <a href="E.%20M.%20Forster">E. M. Forster</a> drafted a letter of protest against the suppression of "The Well", assembling a list of supporters that included Shaw, <a href="T.%20S.%20Eliot">T. S. Eliot</a>, <a href="Arnold%20Bennett">Arnold Bennett</a>, <a href="Vera%20Brittain">Vera Brittain</a> and <a href="Ethel%20Smyth">Ethel Smyth</a>. According to <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>, the plan broke down when Hall objected to the wording of the letter, insisting it mention her book's "artistic merit – even genius". "The Well"s sentimental romanticism, traditional form, and lofty style – using words like "withal", "betoken" and "hath" – did not appeal to <a href="Modernist">Modernist</a> aesthetics; not all those willing to defend it on grounds of <a href="freedom%20of%20speech">literary freedom</a> were equally willing to praise its artistry. The petition dwindled to a short letter in "<a href="The%20Nation%20and%20Athenaeum">The Nation and Athenaeum</a>", signed by Forster and Virginia Woolf, that focused on the <a href="chilling%20effect%20%28term%29">chilling effects</a> of censorship on writers.

The obscenity trial began on 9 November 1928. Cape's <a href="solicitor">solicitor</a> Harold Rubinstein sent out 160 letters to potential witnesses. Many were reluctant to appear in court; according to Virginia Woolf, "they generally put it down to the weak heart of a father, or a cousin who is about to have twins". About 40 turned up on the day of the trial, including Woolf herself, Forster, and such diverse figures as biologist <a href="Julian%20Huxley">Julian Huxley</a>, Laurence Housman of the <a href="British%20Sexological%20Society">British Sexological Society</a>, Robert Cust <a href="Justice%20of%20the%20Peace">JP</a> of the <a href="London%20Morality%20Council">London Morality Council</a>, <a href="Charles%20Ricketts">Charles Ricketts</a> of the <a href="Royal%20Academy%20of%20Art">Royal Academy of Art</a> and <a href="Rabbi">Rabbi</a> Joseph Frederick Stern of the <a href="East%20London%20Synagogue">East London Synagogue</a>. <a href="Norman%20Haire">Norman Haire</a>, who was the star witness after Havelock Ellis bowed out, declared that homosexuality ran in families and a person could no more become it by reading books than if he could become syphilitic by reading about <a href="syphilis">syphilis</a>. None were allowed to offer their views of the novel. Under the <a href="Obscene%20Publications%20Act">Obscene Publications Act</a> of 1857, <a href="Chief%20Magistrate">Chief Magistrate</a> Sir <a href="Chartres%20Biron">Chartres Biron</a> could decide whether the book was obscene without hearing any testimony on the question. "I don't think people are entitled to express an opinion upon a matter which is the decision of the court," he said. Since Hall herself was not on trial, she did not have the right to her own counsel, and Cape's <a href="barrister">barrister</a> <a href="Norman%20Birkett">Norman Birkett</a> had persuaded her not to give evidence herself.

Birkett arrived in court two hours late. In his defence, he tried to claim that the relationships between women in "The Well of Loneliness" were purely <a href="Platonic%20love">platonic</a> in nature. Biron replied, "I have read the book." Hall had urged Birkett before the trial not to ""sell" the inverts in our defence". She took advantage of a lunch recess to tell him that if he continued to maintain her book had no lesbian content she would stand up in court and tell the magistrate the truth before anyone could stop her. Birkett was forced to retract. He argued instead that the book was tasteful and possessed a high degree of <a href="literary%20merit">literary merit</a>. <a href="James%20Melville%20%28Labour%20politician%29">James Melville</a>, appearing for Leopold Hill, took a similar line: the book was "written in a reverend spirit", not to inspire libidinous thoughts but to examine a social question. The theme itself should not be forbidden, and the book's treatment of its theme was unexceptionable.

In his judgement, issued on 16 November, Biron applied the <a href="Hicklin%20test">Hicklin test</a> of obscenity: a work was obscene if it tended to "deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences". He held that the book's literary merit was irrelevant because a well-written obscene book was even more harmful than a poorly written one. The topic in itself was not necessarily unacceptable; a book that depicted the "moral and physical degradation which indulgence in those vices must necessary involve" might be allowed, but no reasonable person could say that a plea for the recognition and toleration of inverts was not obscene. He ordered the book destroyed, with the defendants to pay court costs.

Hill and Cape appealed to the London <a href="Court%20of%20Quarter%20Sessions">Court of Quarter Sessions</a>. The prosecutor, <a href="Attorney%20General">Attorney General</a> Sir <a href="Thomas%20Inskip%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Caldecote">Thomas Inskip</a>, solicited testimony from biological and medical experts and from the writer <a href="Rudyard%20Kipling">Rudyard Kipling</a>. But when Kipling appeared on the morning of the trial, Inskip told him he would not be needed. James Melville had wired the defence witnesses the night before to tell them not to come in. The panel of twelve magistrates who heard the appeal had to rely on passages Inskip read to them for knowledge of the book, since the Director of Public Prosecutions had refused to release copies for them to read. After deliberating for only five minutes, they upheld Biron's decision.

"The Sink of Solitude", an anonymous lampoon in verse by "several hands", appeared in late 1928. It satirised both sides of the controversy over "The Well of Loneliness", but its primary targets were Douglas and Joynson-Hicks, "Two "Good" Men – never mind their intellect". Though the introduction, by journalist <a href="P.%20R.%20Stephensen">P. R. Stephensen</a>, described "The Well"s moral argument as "feeble" and dismissed Havelock Ellis as a "psychopath", "The Sink" itself endorsed the view that lesbianism was innate:

It portrayed Hall as a humourless moralist who had a great deal in common with the opponents of her novel. One illustration, picking up on the theme of religious martyrdom in "The Well", showed Hall nailed to a cross. The image horrified Hall; her guilt at being depicted in a drawing that she saw as blasphemous led to her choice of a religious subject for her next novel, "The Master of the House".

<a href="Alfred%20A.%20Knopf%2C%20Inc.">Alfred A. Knopf, Inc.</a> had planned to publish "The Well of Loneliness" in the United States at the same time as Cape in the United Kingdom. But after Cape brought forward the publication date, Knopf found itself in the position of publishing a book that had been withdrawn in its home country. They refused, telling Hall that nothing they could do would keep the book from being treated as pornography.

Cape sold the US rights to the recently formed publishing house of <a href="Pascal%20Covici">Pascal Covici</a> and Donald Friede. Friede had heard gossip about "The Well" at a party at <a href="Theodore%20Dreiser">Theodore Dreiser</a>'s house and immediately decided to acquire it. He had previously sold a copy of Dreiser's "<a href="An%20American%20Tragedy">An American Tragedy</a>" to a Boston police officer to create a censorship test case, which he had lost; he was awaiting an appeal, which he would also lose. He took out a $10,000 bank loan to outbid another publisher which had offered a $7,500 advance, and enlisted <a href="Morris%20Ernst">Morris Ernst</a>, co-founder of the <a href="American%20Civil%20Liberties%20Union">American Civil Liberties Union</a>, to defend the book against legal challenges. Friede invited <a href="John%20S.%20Sumner">John Saxton Sumner</a> of the <a href="New%20York%20Society%20for%20the%20Suppression%20of%20Vice">New York Society for the Suppression of Vice</a> to buy a copy directly from him, to ensure that he, not a bookseller, would be the one prosecuted. He also travelled to Boston to give a copy to the <a href="Watch%20and%20Ward%20Society">Watch and Ward Society</a>, hoping both to further challenge censorship of literature and to generate more publicity; he was disappointed when they told him they saw nothing wrong with the book.
In New York, Sumner and several police detectives seized 865 copies of "The Well" from the publisher's offices, and Friede was charged with selling an obscene publication. But Covici and Friede had already moved the printing plates out of New York in order to continue publishing the book. By the time the case came to trial, it had already been reprinted six times. Despite its price of $5 – twice the cost of an average novel – it sold more than 100,000 copies in its first year.

In the US, as in the UK, the Hicklin test of obscenity applied, but New York <a href="case%20law">case law</a> had established that books should be judged by their effects on adults rather than on children and that literary merit was relevant. Ernst obtained statements from authors including Dreiser, <a href="Ernest%20Hemingway">Ernest Hemingway</a>, <a href="F.%20Scott%20Fitzgerald">F. Scott Fitzgerald</a>, <a href="Edna%20St.%20Vincent%20Millay">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a>, <a href="Sinclair%20Lewis">Sinclair Lewis</a>, <a href="Sherwood%20Anderson">Sherwood Anderson</a>, <a href="H.%20L.%20Mencken">H. L. Mencken</a>, <a href="Upton%20Sinclair">Upton Sinclair</a>, <a href="Ellen%20Glasgow">Ellen Glasgow</a> and <a href="John%20Dos%20Passos">John Dos Passos</a>. Besides, freedom of expression was protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. To make sure these supporters did not go unheard, he incorporated their opinions into his <a href="brief%20%28law%29">brief</a>. His argument relied on a comparison with "Mademoiselle de Maupin" by <a href="Th%C3%A9ophile%20Gautier">Théophile Gautier</a>, which had been cleared of obscenity in the 1922 case "Halsey v. New York". "Mademoiselle de Maupin" described a lesbian relationship in more explicit terms than "The Well" did. According to Ernst, "The Well" had greater social value because it was more serious in tone and made a case against misunderstanding and intolerance.

In an opinion issued on 19 February 1929, Magistrate Hyman Bushel declined to take the book's literary qualities into account and said "The Well" was "calculated to deprave and corrupt minds open to its immoral influences". Under New York law, Bushel was not a <a href="trier%20of%20fact">trier of fact</a>; he could only remand the case to the New York Court of Special Sessions for judgement. On 19 April, that court issued a three-paragraph decision stating that "The Well"'s theme – a "delicate social problem" – did not violate the law unless written in such a way as to make it obscene. After "a careful reading of the entire book", they cleared it of all charges.

Covici-Friede then imported a copy of the Pegasus Press edition from France as a further test case and to solidify the book's US copyright. Customs barred the book from entering the country, which might also have prevented it from being shipped from state to state. The <a href="United%20States%20Customs%20Court">United States Customs Court</a> ruled that the book did not contain "one word, phrase, sentence or paragraph which could be truthfully pointed out as offensive to modesty".

The Pegasus Press edition of the book remained available in France, and some copies made their way into the UK. In a "Letter from Paris" in "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", <a href="Janet%20Flanner">Janet Flanner</a> reported that it sold most heavily at the news vendor's cart that served passengers travelling to London on "<a href="Golden%20Arrow%20%28train%29">La Fleche D'Or</a>".

In 1946, three years after Hall's death, Troubridge wanted to include "The Well" in a Collected Memorial Edition of Hall's works. Peter Davies of the Windmill Press wrote to the <a href="Home%20Office">Home Office</a>'s legal adviser to ask whether the post-war <a href="Attlee%20ministry">Labour administration</a> would allow the book to be republished. Unknown to Troubridge, he added a postscript saying "I am not really anxious to do "The Well of Loneliness" and am rather relieved than otherwise by any lack of enthusiasm I may encounter in official circles." <a href="Home%20Secretary">Home Secretary</a> <a href="James%20Chuter%20Ede">James Chuter Ede</a> told Troubridge that any publisher reprinting the book would risk prosecution. In 1949 Falcon Press brought out an edition with no legal challenge. "The Well" has been in print continuously ever since and has been translated into at least 14 languages. In the 1960s it was still selling 100,000 copies a year in the United States alone. Looking back on the controversy in 1972, Flanner remarked on how unlikely it seemed that a "rather innocent" book like "The Well" could have created such a scandal. In 1974, it was read to the British public on <a href="BBC%20Radio%204">BBC Radio 4</a>'s "<a href="Book%20at%20Bedtime">Book at Bedtime</a>".

The copyright protection for "The Well of Loneliness" expired in the <a href="European%20Union">European Union</a> on 1 January 2014. Because of the <a href="URAA">URAA</a>, copyright protection in the United States will continue until at least 2024.

Three other novels with lesbian themes were published in England in 1928: <a href="Elizabeth%20Bowen">Elizabeth Bowen</a>'s "The Hotel", <a href="Virginia%20Woolf">Virginia Woolf</a>'s "" and <a href="Compton%20Mackenzie">Compton Mackenzie</a>'s satirical novel "Extraordinary Women". None were banned. "The Hotel", like earlier English novels in which critics have identified lesbian themes, is marked by complete reticence, while "Orlando" may have been protected by its Modernist playfulness. The Home Office considered prosecuting "Extraordinary Women", but concluded that it lacked the "earnestness" of "The Well" and would not inspire readers to adopt "the practices referred to". Mackenzie was disappointed; he had hoped a censorship case would increase his book's sales. Despite advertising that tried to cash in on the controversy over "The Well" by announcing that Radclyffe Hall was the model for one of the characters, it sold only 2,000 copies.

A fourth 1928 novel, "Ladies Almanack" by the American writer <a href="Djuna%20Barnes">Djuna Barnes</a>, not only contains a character based on Radclyffe Hall but includes passages that may be a response to "The Well". "Ladies Almanack" is a "<a href="roman%20%C3%A0%20clef">roman à clef</a>" of a lesbian literary and artistic circle in Paris, written in an archaic, <a href="Fran%C3%A7ois%20Rabelais">Rabelaisian</a> style and starring <a href="Natalie%20Barney">Natalie Barney</a> as Dame Evangeline Musset. Much as Sir Phillip paces his study worrying about Stephen, Dame Musset's father "pac[es] his library in the most normal of Night-Shirts". When, unlike Sir Phillip, he confronts his daughter, she replies confidently: "Thou, good Governor, wast expecting a Son when you lay atop of your Choosing ... Am I not doing after your very Desire, and is it not the more commendable, seeing that I do it without the Tools for the Trade, and yet nothing complain?" "Ladies Almanack" is far more overtly sexual than "The Well"; its cryptic style, full of in-jokes and ornate language, may have been intended to disguise its content from censors. It could not in any case be prosecuted by the Home Office, since it was published only in France, in a small, privately printed edition. It did not become widely available until 1972.

<a href="Willette%20Kershaw">Willette Kershaw</a>, an American actress who was staging banned plays in Paris, proposed a dramatisation of "The Well of Loneliness". Hall accepted a £100 advance, but when she and Troubridge saw Kershaw act, they found her too feminine for the role of Stephen. Hall tried to void the contract on a technicality, but Kershaw refused to change her plans. The play opened on 2 September 1930. No playwright was credited, implying that Hall had written the adaptation herself; it was actually written by one of Kershaw's ex-husbands, who reworked the story to make it more upbeat. According to <a href="Janet%20Flanner">Janet Flanner</a>, who reported on the opening night for "<a href="The%20New%20Yorker">The New Yorker</a>", Kershaw "made up in costume what she lacked in psychology", with designer boots, breeches and riding crop. Then she changed into a white dress for a final speech in which she "begged humanity, 'already used to earthquakes and murderers', to try to put up with a minor calamity like the play's and the book's Lesbian protagonist, Stephen Gordon". Hall threatened a lawsuit to stop the production, but the issue soon became moot, since the play closed after only a few nights. The public skirmish between Hall and Kershaw increased sales of the novel.

A 1951 French film set in a girls' boarding school was released in the United States as "The Pit of Loneliness" to capitalise on the notoriety of "The Well", but was actually adapted from the novel "Olivia", now known to have been written by <a href="Dorothy%20Bussy">Dorothy Bussy</a>. A mid-1930s <a href="exploitation%20film">exploitation film</a>, "Children of Loneliness", stated it was "inspired by" "The Well". Little of Hall's novel can be discerned in its story of a butch lesbian who is blinded with acid and run over by a truck, freeing the naïve young roommate she seduced to find love with a <a href="fullback%20%28American%20football%29">fullback</a>. A critic for the "<a href="Motion%20Picture%20Herald">Motion Picture Herald</a>" reported that during the film's run in Los Angeles in 1937 – as a double feature with "Love Life of a Gorilla" – a self-identified "doctor" appeared after the screening to sell pamphlets purporting to explain homosexuality. He was arrested for selling obscene literature.

In 1983, American <a href="Performance%20Artist">performance artist</a> <a href="Holly%20Hughes%20%28performance%20artist%29">Holly Hughes</a> wrote a satirical play, "The Well of Horniness", whose title is inspired by that of Hall's novel. The play is described as "a high-camp, low-brow Sapphic murder mystery" presented "in the cliff-hanging style of an old-time radio show."

In 1985, the Mexican writer and social activist <a href="Nancy%20C%C3%A1rdenas">Nancy Cárdenas</a> produced a play based on the novel. The play was staged in <a href="Mexico%20City">Mexico City</a>'s Fru Fru Theatre and was performed by <a href="Irma%20Serrano">Irma Serrano</a> and <a href="Sonia%20Infante">Sonia Infante</a>.

In the novel, a young Stephen disparages the lack of "really adequate pockets" in the feminine dresses and sashes she is forced to wear. At the end of the nineteenth century, sartorial changes in the dress of the New Woman included the development of accessible pockets in dresses as part of rational dressing, and in her article, Janet Myers discusses how pockets were depicted in magazine caricatures of the time as indicative of the more masculine, undesirable New Woman of sexual degeneracy. It is of interest to note that this problem from 1928 largely persists in women's clothing today.

Bill Brown (cricketer)

William Alfred Brown, <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">OAM</a> (31 July 1912 – 16 March 2008) was an Australian <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played 22 <a href="Test%20cricket">Tests</a> between 1934 and 1948, <a href="captain%20%28cricket%29">captaining</a> <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">his country</a> in one Test. A right-handed <a href="opening%20batsman">opening batsman</a>, his partnership with <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a> in the 1930s is regarded as one of the finest in Australian Test history. After the interruption of <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Brown was a member of <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>'s <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">"Invincibles"</a>, who toured England in 1948 without defeat. In a match in November 1947, Brown was the unwitting victim of the first instance of "<a href="Run%20out%23Mankaded">Mankading</a>".

Raised in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>, Brown initially struggled in both work and cricket, before gradually rising through the cricket ranks. He made his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> debut for <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> in the 1932–33 season and forced his way into the national side during the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201934">1934 tour of England</a>. When long-term openers <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a> and <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> retired at the end of the tour, Brown and his state opening partner Fingleton took over. After poor form made his selection for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201938">1938 tour of England</a> controversial, Brown responded with a total of 1,854 runs, including an <a href="Not%20out">unbeaten</a> 206 that saved Australia from defeat in the Second Test, and was honoured as one of the five <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a>.

The outbreak of the Second World War cost Brown his peak years, which he spent in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>. Cricket resumed in 1945–46 and Brown, in Bradman's absence, captained an Australian eleven in a match that was retrospectively awarded Test status. Brown missed the entirety of the following season because of injury. Upon his return, he was unable to repeat his previous success and was ousted from the opening positions by <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> and <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>. Selected for the "Invincibles" tour, he performed reasonably well in the tour matches but, with Morris and Barnes entrenched as openers, he batted out of position in the <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29%23Middle%20order">middle order</a> during the first two Tests. He struggled and was dropped from the Test team, never to return. Upon returning to Australia, Brown continued playing for Queensland until the end of the 1949–50 season.

In retirement, Brown briefly served as a Test <a href="selector%20%28sport%29">selector</a> and sold cars and, later, sports goods. In 2000, he was awarded the Medal of the <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">Order of Australia</a> for his services to cricket. At the time of his death in 2008, he was Australia's oldest Test cricketer.

The son of a dairy farmer and hotel owner, Brown was born in <a href="Toowoomba">Toowoomba</a>, <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. Aged three, business failure hit the family, and they moved to <a href="Marrickville%2C%20New%20South%20Wales">Marrickville</a> in inner <a href="Sydney">Sydney</a>. The family's poor financial position meant that they lived in a one-bedroom home, with Brown and his brother sharing a bed. Educated at Dulwich Hill and Petersham High Schools in Sydney, Brown started playing cricket as a <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a>, before changing his focus to opening the batting. He left high school after two years, but was unable to find regular full-time work amid the <a href="Great%20Depression">Great Depression</a>. In 1929–30, Brown played <a href="Sydney%20Grade%20Cricket">grade cricket</a> for <a href="Marrickville%20Cricket%20Club">Marrickville Cricket Club</a>, but was unable to hold down a regular place. He was on the verge of leaving Sydney when an innings of 172 in the <a href="Sydney%20Grade%20Cricket%23Poidevin-Gray%20Shield">Poidevin-Gray Shield</a> reinvigorated his career. Brown progressed through the grades and reached the club's <a href="First%20XI">First XI</a>, where he performed steadily to earn selection for <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> in 1932–33.

Making his first-class debut for New South Wales in a <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> match against <a href="Queensland%20Bulls">Queensland</a> on 11 November 1932, Brown was <a href="run%20out">run out</a> for a <a href="Duck%20%28cricket%29">duck</a> without facing a ball, while opening with <a href="Jack%20Fingleton">Jack Fingleton</a>. However, the match ended happily with Brown's team winning decisively by an innings and 274 runs. The highlights of Brown's first season were his 79 against <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a>, and 69 against <a href="Douglas%20Jardine">Douglas Jardine</a>'s <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>. However, neither <a href="Harold%20Larwood">Harold Larwood</a> nor <a href="Bill%20Voce">Bill Voce</a>, the "<a href="Bodyline">Bodyline</a>" spearheads, played in the match. During his first season, Brown earned the ire of <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>, who was displeased with Brown's poor communication with batting partners when running between the wickets, with the ensuing risk of falling foul of run outs. Brown ended his debut season with 269 runs at 29.88.

The following season, in the opening match of the season against Queensland at <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a> in November 1933, Brown made 154, partnering Bradman in a stand of 294 in just three hours. This set up a total of 4/494 declared and an innings victory. He followed this with 205 in an <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">opening stand</a> of 340 against <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a>. Brown amassed two further half-centuries to end with 878 runs for the season at an average of 67.53, which placed him second behind Bradman in the first-class run-scoring aggregates. When the selectors met to discuss the tour party for the 1934 tour of England, Brown and Fingleton had similar figures, but with the incumbent Victorian opening pair of <a href="Bill%20Ponsford">Bill Ponsford</a> and captain <a href="Bill%20Woodfull">Bill Woodfull</a> firmly in place, there was only one spot available for a reserve opener. The selectors asked Bradman—Australia's leading batsman—for advice. Bradman nominated Brown, believing that his style was better suited to English pitches. A disappointed Fingleton disagreed and wrote to Woodfull, saying "You have chosen chaps who do not like fast bowling". Brown justified his selection before departure with a pair of 90s in two matches for a combined Australian XI against <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a>.

Brown missed selection for the tour opener against <a href="Worcestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Worcestershire</a>—in which Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice XI—before making his debut in the second match against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>. He made a century against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a> in his second tour match, making 105 in the middle order. Batting at number 3 against <a href="Lancashire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Lancashire</a> in the final tour match before the Tests, Brown scored 119. After compiling 351 runs at 43.88 in the opening tour matches, he was selected for the Test side. Playing in all five Tests, Brown made his debut at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>, Nottingham and scored 22 in his first innings. After Australia lost three early wickets in the second innings, Brown scored 73 to help secure a winning lead. Brown then made a century while opening the batting against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, and an unbeaten 62 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory over the <a href="Gentlemen%20of%20England">Gentlemen of England</a>. He was promoted to open in the Second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> with Woodfull, after Ponsford was unavailable due to illness. At the home of cricket, Brown made his maiden Test century, scoring 105 in the first innings. His innings was an unhurried one; he tended to wait for the ball to come onto the bat rather than attacking the leather. However, he was unable to prevent Australia from being forced to <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a> and made two; the match ended in an <a href="Result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">innings defeat</a>. He was retained as opener upon Ponsford's return for the Third Test, with Woodfull dropping down the order in a reshuffled batting line-up. Brown made 72 and a duck. The match ended in a draw after both teams passed 490 in the first innings.

It was the start of a barren month for Brown, who passed 30 only once in 11 first-class innings, totalling 171 runs at 15.55. He ended the unproductive sequence with an unbeaten 100 against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>. This came after <a href="Bill%20Voce">Bill Voce</a> had bowled Bodyline at the start of the Australian innings, in contravention of a prior agreement. After an Australian protest, Voce missed the remainder of the match and Brown's innings was punctuated by angry heckling by the local supporters.

He was unable to pass 20 in the final two Tests and ended the series with 300 runs at 33.33. Despite his inability to make a substantial contribution, Australia won the Fifth Test by 562 runs to reclaim <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> 2–1. Brown scored three consecutive half-centuries after the Tests and ended with 1,287 first-class runs at 36.77.

Brown's strong form continued upon returning to Australia, compiling 683 runs at 45.53, including three centuries, to be the second highest run-scorer for the 1934–35 domestic season. He started the season with the testimonial match for Woodfull, who retired upon returning to Australia. Brown scored 102 in the second innings to help Woodfull's men defeat <a href="Vic%20Richardson">Victor Richardson</a>'s XI by seven wickets. He started the Sheffield Shield season with 11 in an innings victory over South Australia, and scored fifties in three consecutive matches, before rounding off the season with 116 in the final match against <a href="Western%20Australia%20cricket%20team">Western Australia</a>.

With the retirement of Woodfull and Ponsford after the tour of England, Brown and his state partner Fingleton became Australia's opening pair for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20South%20Africa%20in%201935%E2%80%9336">1935–36 tour of South Africa</a>. It was one of the most productive phases of both men's career. In Australia's warm-up match against Western Australia before sailing across the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>, Brown struck 55 in an innings win.

Brown started the tour consistently, scoring 148, 58, 31 and 28 not out in the three warm-up matches. In the first match of the tour against <a href="Natal%20cricket%20team">Natal</a>, both Brown and Fingleton made centuries; the first two matches were won by an innings and the third by ten wickets.

Brown scored three consecutive half-centuries in the first two Tests in <a href="Durban">Durban</a> and <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>. Australia won the first by nine wickets and were 124 runs from victory with eight wickets in hand in the second when bad light stopped play. In the Third Test at <a href="Cape%20Town">Cape Town</a>, the pair set a new Australian opening record of 233, which laid the foundation for a large Australian total and an innings victory. It was Australia's first double-century opening stand in Test cricket, and remains an Australian Test record for the first wicket against South Africa. Brown posted 121, his highest Test score at the time. He scored 34 and 84 in Australia's only innings of the Fourth and Fifth Tests in Johannesburg and Durban, making solid opening stands with Fingleton, who scored three consecutive centuries. The pair laid the platform for two further innings victories, as Australia took the five-Test series 4–0. Brown compiled 417 runs at 59.57 for the series. He scored a further four fifties in the remaining tour matches to end with 1,065 runs at 62.65.

In 1936, Brown accepted a coaching position and employment as a car salesman to move back to Queensland, representing his state of birth from 1936–37 onwards. He was appointed captain the following season. Brown started the new season strongly, scoring 111 for <a href="Vic%20Richardson">Victor Richardson</a>'s XI in a testimonial match against Bradman's XI, in the opening match of summer. In November, Brown played for an Australian XI and Queensland in two matches against the touring England team, scoring 71 and 74 in the two drawn matches.

His 1936–37 season was interrupted by injury and he appeared in only the Third and Fourth <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201936%E2%80%9337">Tests against England</a>. They were relatively unsuccessful, yielding only 95 runs at 23.75 in four innings without passing fifty. Nevertheless, Australia won the two matches. His debut season for Queensland was moderately successful, with 557 runs at an average of 37.13, including one century and four fifties. Brown did not taste victory with his home state during the season; the closest Queensland came was a one-wicket loss to New South Wales.

Brown's form started to deteriorate in 1937–38; he scored only 400 runs at 36.36 for the season. Queensland played five matches under his watch, losing three, and went without victory. Of the two draws, one was washed out and in the other, Queensland hung on with two wickets in hand when time ran out. Although Brown compiled two centuries, he was only twelfth in the aggregates during an Australian season with no international tours. As a result, his selection for the 1938 tour to England was criticised in some quarters.

Brown started the tour patchily, although Australia won each of their first four matches by an innings. In his first four innings, Brown passed five only once, scoring 72 against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>. He returned to form with an unbeaten 194 against <a href="Northamptonshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Northamptonshire</a>, helping to set up an innings win, before adding another 96 in the next match against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>. Brown entered the Tests with 504 runs at 56.00 in the lead-in tour matches.

After adding 48 in Australia's first innings of 411, Brown scored 133 in the second innings of the First Test at Nottingham after the tourists were forced to follow-on, helping Bradman (144 not out) to save the Test. The Australians reached 6/427 in the second innings when the match ended in a draw.

Brown's most celebrated innings came in the Second Test at Lord's, carrying his bat to score 206 in the first televised Test match. England batted first and amassed 494, largely on the back of <a href="Wally%20Hammond">Wally Hammond</a>'s 240. Brown featured in an opening stand of 69 before Fingleton was dismissed. <a href="Hedley%20Verity">Hedley Verity</a> then bowled Bradman for 18, leaving the score at 101, before <a href="Stan%20McCabe">Stan McCabe</a> fell after a quickfire 38 with the score at 3/152. Brown registered his century in 193 minutes, during an innings highlighted by his <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Drive">driving</a> on both sides of the wicket. After <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> was dismissed for 56 following a 134-run partnership, Australia reached stumps at 5/299, with Brown on 140. The following day, Brown set about ensuring that Australia would avoid the <a href="follow%20on">follow on</a>, featuring in an aggressive eighth-wicket stand with tailender <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a>. The pair added 85 runs in just 46 minutes, with Brown recalling "It was a nice day, and a nice wicket. O'Reilly came in, and I told him I'd take the quicks—<a href="Arthur%20Wellard">Wellard</a> and <a href="Ken%20Farnes">Farnes</a>—and Tiger [O'Reilly] took Verity." Brown continued past his double century and remained unbeaten on 206 from just 375 minutes when his last partner fell, leaving Australia all out for 422. Brown's innings was the 100th century by an Australian against England, and the highest Test score for a batsman carrying his bat; it stood until <a href="Glenn%20Turner">Glenn Turner</a> made an unbeaten 223 in 1972. <a href="Ray%20Robinson%20%28cricket%20writer%29">Ray Robinson</a> quipped that Brown's performance "did not cause smoke to rise from the back of those [television] sets but the charm of his style gave viewers a favourable impression of Australian batsmanship". They went on to draw the match, which was crucial in Australia's eventual retention of the Ashes. Brown's uninterrupted batting meant that he was on the field from the first morning until late on the fourth day.

Immediately after making his highest Test score at Lord's, Brown recorded his highest first-class score of 265 not out against <a href="Derbyshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Derbyshire</a>, in six hours of batting. Australia amassed 4/441 declared and won by an innings and 234 runs. He then made it three centuries in a row, scoring 101 against <a href="Warwickshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Warwickshire</a>, setting up another innings win.

The Third Test was washed out without a ball being bowled, and Australia won the Fourth Test by five wickets in a low-scoring match to retain the Ashes. Brown made 22 and nine as Australia scored 242 and 5/107. It was the start of a quiet month for the opener, who scored only 194 runs in eight completed innings. He was the top Australian scorer in both innings of the Fifth Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a>, scoring 69 and 15. This was the match in which <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> scored a world Test record 364 and England compiled 7/903, before winning by an innings and 579 runs, which remains a world record winning margin in a Test match. Throughout the Tests, Brown aggregated 512 runs at 73.14, totalling 1,854 runs at 59.57 in all first-class matches for the tour. This placed Brown second to Bradman in both aggregates and average. He was named as one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Wisden Cricketers of the Year</a> for his performances in 1938. <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">"Wisden"</a> described him as a "cricketer of remarkable powers" who batted with "a charming skill, coolness, thoughtfulness and certainty".

Upon returning to Australia, Brown scored 1,057 runs at 105.70 in the 1938–39 Australian season, including 990 at 110.00 in six Sheffield Shield matches. Brown started the season well, scoring 84 as Queensland amassed 501 against New South Wales. His old state were still 27 runs from making Queensland bat again, but time ran out with one wicket intact, with Brown yet to taste victory with his new state. Nevertheless, he continued to perform strongly and passed 50 in each of his first four innings. In the fourth of these, he was out for 99 and then declared at 5/510 to leave Victoria a victory target of 319. Brown then narrowly missed out on a milestone for the second time in the match when Victoria scraped home by three wickets to deny him a maiden victory with his home state. In the next match, he carried his bat to make an unbeaten 174 against <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a> at the <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a>, as his team fell to an innings defeat.

After twelve matches for his state of origin, Brown was still to end up on the winning side. This changed in the next match against New South Wales. After their opponents had made 214, Brown top-scored with 95 as Queensland replied with 200. New South Wales made 264 to leave Brown's men 279 for victory. The captain led the way, combining with Geoff Cook in Queensland's then record first-wicket partnership of 265. Brown was out for 168, but his team held on to secure an eight-wicket victory over New South Wales. It was Brown's first win in Queensland colours. He then scored 81 in a ten-wicket defeat to South Australia, before adding a second victory, this time over Victoria. Brown ended the season by amassing 215 as Queensland reached 7/575 declared before completing an innings win. Brown topped the aggregates with 1,057 runs and was the only player to pass 1,000 runs for the season.

Brown had another strong campaign in the following year, netting 857 runs at 61.21, including three centuries. Despite this, Queensland had another poor season, losing five of their six matches. Brown started the season strongly, scoring 87 and 137, but he was unable to stop New South Wales winning the opening match by three wickets. After a seven-wicket loss to Victoria, Brown made 156, but was unable to prevent an innings defeat to South Australia. After an innings loss to New South Wales, he made 111 to steer Queensland to its only win of the season, a two-wicket victory over South Australia. He finished the season with 35 and 97 as The Rest of Australia lost to New South Wales by two wickets.

Due to <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, cricket in Australia was scaled down and in a shortened season in 1940–41, Brown made 307 runs at 30.70 in five matches, with two half-centuries. In 1941–42, he played one match, his last first-class fixture during the war, scoring 56 and 69 in a narrow 19-run win over New South Wales.

Brown was a <a href="flight%20lieutenant">flight lieutenant</a> with the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a>, serving in <a href="New%20Guinea%20campaign">New Guinea</a> and the <a href="Philippines">Philippines</a> during the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>, losing his prime years from the age of 27 to 33. During the pre-war years, he had averaged 49.02 in Test cricket.

First-class cricket resumed in 1945–46 after the Allied victory, and Brown began the post-war phase of his career with a steady season, scoring 604 runs at 46.46 with five half-centuries in seven matches. This placed him second to <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> in the run-scoring aggregates. His best effort was a 98 against South Australia, denied a century by a run out. Queensland lost more than they won, with two victories and three losses. At the end of the season, Brown captained an Australian side on a <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%201945%E2%80%9346">tour of New Zealand</a>, and all five matches resulted in convincing victories for the tourists.

Australia played its inaugural Test against <a href="New%20Zealand%20cricket%20team">New Zealand</a> in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>, a match that was retrospectively given Test status. The uncertain status of the tour saw the players wearing blazers that were labelled ABC (<a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control</a>), rather than the Australian coat of arms. Brown led from the front, topping the tour aggregates and averages, with 443 runs at 73.83 in five matches. In the opening tour match against <a href="Auckland%20cricket%20team">Auckland</a>, Brown elected to bat and opened with 68 as Australia amassed 579 and took victory by an innings and 180 runs. This was followed by a match against <a href="Canterbury%20Wizards">Canterbury</a> in <a href="Christchurch">Christchurch</a>, in which Brown top-scored with 137. This laid the foundation for a total of 8/415 and another innings victory. Brown made his second consecutive century in the third match against <a href="Otago%20cricket%20team">Otago</a> at <a href="Carisbrook">Carisbrook</a> in <a href="Dunedin">Dunedin</a>, again top-scoring with 106 in an eight-wicket victory. He made 34 in the final tour match as Australia defeated <a href="Wellington%20cricket%20team">Wellington</a> in another innings victory.

The tour culminated in a match against New Zealand at the <a href="Basin%20Reserve">Basin Reserve</a> in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>. With regular captain Don Bradman missing, Brown led a team that included seven Test debutants. The hosts won the toss and elected to bat first on a <a href="sticky%20wicket">wet wicket</a>, which came about after a week of rain before the match. New Zealand managed to reach 4/37 at lunch, before the sun emerged and caused the wicket to turn into a sticky with unpredictable bounce. <a href="Leg%20spin">Leg spin</a>ner Bill O'Reilly—in his last Test—and debutant <a href="Ernie%20Toshack">Ernie Toshack</a>, took 5/14 and 4/12 respectively as New Zealand were bowled out for only 42, losing their last six wickets for five runs. In reply, Australia were 1/9 when <a href="Ken%20Meuleman">Ken Meuleman</a> was dismissed. Having been dropped on 13, Brown then combined in a 109-run first-wicket stand with Barnes, before falling for the innings top-score of 67. It was the only partnership for the Test that went beyond 32. Barnes' dismissal triggered a collapse of 6/57, prompting Brown to declare Australia's innings closed at 8/199. Australia then dismissed New Zealand for 54 in the second innings in just two hours, resulting in victory by an innings and 54 runs in just two days. As the hosts' batsmen fell quickly, many of the Australian bowlers had limited opportunities. With one wicket left in the match, Brown used the toss of a coin to determine which of the debutants <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a> and <a href="Ian%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%29">Ian Johnson</a> would bowl in Tests for the first time. McCool was given the ball and ended the match on his second delivery. Brown's solitary Test as captain makes him the first and the only native Queenslander to have led Australia.

Brown missed the entire 1946–47 Test series against England due to a thumb injury. This allowed young New South Wales opener <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> to make his Test debut. Morris' performance in the series eventually displaced Brown from his position as a first-choice opening batsman alongside Barnes. The injury meant that Brown was unable to play a single match for Queensland.

Brown returned to first-class cricket in 1947–48, scoring 192 runs at 38.40 in the first three matches of the season. The season saw an <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201947-48">Indian tour of Australia</a>. The selectors initially dropped Barnes to pair Brown with Morris to open the batting. Apart from two Tests during the 1936–37 season against England, Brown had not played Test cricket on Australian soil. He had only one opportunity with the bat in the First Test in Brisbane, making 11 as India fell to an innings defeat. It was to be his only innings and Test match on his home ground. Brown's participation in the series was overshadowed by his controversial <a href="run%20out">run out</a> by Indian <a href="left%20arm%20orthodox%20spin">left arm orthodox spin</a>ner <a href="Vinoo%20Mankad">Vinoo Mankad</a> in the Second Test at the <a href="Sydney%20Cricket%20Ground">Sydney Cricket Ground</a> in December 1947. Brown was run out for 18, when in the act of delivering the ball, Mankad held on to it and whipped the <a href="Bail%20%28cricket%29">bails</a> off at the non-striker's end. Brown was well out of his <a href="Crease%20%28cricket%29%23Popping%20crease">crease</a> while he was <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23B">backing-up</a> the striker, so that he could get a head start in case he attempted a run. This was the second time during the season that Mankad had dismissed Brown in this fashion—as he had previously done so in a match against an Australian XI in November. On that occasion, Mankad had warned Brown before running him out. The local press strongly accused Mankad of being unsportsmanlike, although some Australians—including Bradman—defended Mankad's actions. For his part, Brown took full blame and made light of the incident through humorous gestures in later matches, which referred to the event. After this incident, if a batsman is given out this way, he is said to have been "Mankaded".

The dismissal ended another low-scoring innings, and Australia batted only once in a shortened match. Brown was omitted from the team in favour of Barnes for the next two Tests. Morris—who had established himself as one of Australia's first-choice opening batsmen during Brown's injury layoff during the previous season—was rested for the Fifth Test as the Australian Board trialled potential candidates for the 1948 tour of England. Morris was omitted after losing a coin toss to Barnes. Brown partnered Barnes, making 99 in the first innings before being run out. Brown had survived a confident appeal for caught behind before he had scored, and Barnes was convinced that his partner had edged the ball. Barnes claimed that had Brown failed to make an impact in the innings, he would have been overlooked for the 1948 tour.

During the first innings, Brown captained Australia while Bradman was absent with <a href="fibrositis">fibrositis</a>. The tourists fell for 331, with debutants <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> and <a href="Doug%20Ring">Doug Ring</a> taking three wickets apiece. India eventually fell to another innings defeat, so Brown did not have another opportunity to score a Test century on home soil. His Test aggregate in Australia stood at 223 runs at only 33.86, in contrast to his away average of 1,369 runs at 50.70. His first-class batting average of 43.58 for the season was inferior to that of Barnes and Morris, both of whom averaged more than 50.

In any case, Brown had done enough to be chosen to <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">tour England in 1948</a> with the team that became known as the "Invincibles", although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination. Brown made a strong start in the tour matches preceding the Tests. In the fifth fixture, which was against <a href="Cambridge%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Cambridge University</a>, Brown top-scored with 200 in an innings victory. In the following match against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>, he combined with Bradman in a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes, ending with 153 as Australia scored a world-record 721 runs in one day. Australia proceeded to another innings victory, and Brown completed his third century in as many innings with 108 against <a href="Oxford%20University%20Cricket%20Club">Oxford University</a>. He proceeded to add a fourth century in less than three weeks, with 122 against <a href="Nottinghamshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Nottinghamshire</a>, and made an unbeaten 81 against <a href="Hampshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Hampshire</a>. In contrast, middle-order batsman <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a> had struggled in the initial stages of his first tour of England, failing to pass 25 in his first six innings. Thus, Brown gained selection in the First Test at Trent Bridge, batting out of position in the middle order, whereas Harvey was dropped despite making a century in Australia's most recent Test against India.

Brown made 17 in his only innings as Australia won by eight wickets. Between Tests, Brown scored 113 in a slow innings against <a href="Yorkshire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Yorkshire</a> to retain his middle-order position for the Second Test at Lord's. He was unable to replicate the Test centuries he made in the preceding tours, scoring 24 and 32. It was to be his last Test, as <a href="Sam%20Loxton">Sam Loxton</a> top-scored with 159 not out against <a href="Gloucestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Gloucestershire</a> in the match before the Third Test, ousting Brown from his middle-order position. Barnes was injured in the Third Test, but Brown was not recalled for the Fourth Test; instead, <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a> was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order and struck 112. Brown then scored 140 against Derbyshire immediately after the Fourth Test, in a dour display that displeased spectators, and then scored consecutive centuries against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> and the Gentlemen of England after the Tests. He ended with eight centuries and a total of 1,448 runs on the tour at an average of 57.92, behind only Bradman, Hassett and Morris, with the 200 against Cambridge University his highest score. Brown took 4/16 against the South of England in his only bowling assignment of the tour. It was his best career bowling figures, having amassed only six wickets in his first-class career. In three visits to England, Brown scored 18 centuries.

Upon returning to Australia, Bradman retired and Barnes took a break from cricket, thereby opening two vacancies in the Test team. Brown had a reasonable domestic season in 1948–49 to press his claim for a Test recall. He scored 626 runs at 41.73, the sixth highest aggregate of the season, with a century and three fifties. Queensland won two and lost three games. Despite this, the 37-year-old Brown was not named in the touring party for the Test tour of South Africa in 1949–50. In the absence of the Test players, Brown scored 507 runs at 50.70 in the Sheffield Shield season, with a top score of 190, making him the third highest run-getter. In their first five matches of the season, Queensland lost three times, before Brown's 190 in the last match against South Australia set up a nine-wicket win. It was his only century of the season after previously falling for 94 twice.

With his opportunities diminishing, he retired after captaining the Australian Second XI to New Zealand on an end-of-season tour, during which the team went undefeated. Most of the matches were not first-class but Brown scored his final first-class century against <a href="Otago%20cricket%20team">Otago</a>, scoring 184 in an innings victory. He had been less effective in his later years, averaging 38.29 in Tests following World War II.

 Brown was regarded as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. He hooked occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the <a href="Batting%20%28cricket%29%23Cut">cut shot</a>. <a href="Johnny%20Moyes">Johnny Moyes</a> said that "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." Moyes said that Brown was "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist <a href="Neville%20Cardus">Neville Cardus</a> commented "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." <a href="Ray%20Robinson%20%28cricket%20writer%29">Ray Robinson</a> said that Brown was "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same breath as <a href="Archie%20Jackson">Archie Jackson</a>'s". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricket—he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.

Brown's partnership with Fingleton was regarded as one of the great opening pairings in Australian Test cricket history. In ten Tests as an opening combination, the pair averaged 63.75 for the first wicket, higher than any other Australian duo with more than 1,000 runs. Brown was known for his self-effacing nature and was well liked among teammates and opponents alike. Of his batting, Brown joked that "My wife said you could always tell when I was batting by the number of people leaving the ground". During a domestic match at the <a href="Adelaide%20Oval">Adelaide Oval</a> in December 1938, he deflected a ball onto his stumps without dislodging a bail. He added a further 147 runs to end unbeaten on 174, eternally apologising for his luck.

In addition to his batting, Brown was a highly regarded fieldsman known for his fitness. He developed his skills through persistent training with professional sprinters in order to improve his anticipation and speed off the mark. Brown often fielded at slip or in the covers. With Australia boasting the <a href="leg%20spin">leg spin</a> pairing of O'Reilly and <a href="Clarrie%20Grimmett">Clarrie Grimmett</a> in the 1930s, close-catchers were frequently used. Along with Fingleton, Brown often fielded in the leg trap position.

In 1940, Brown married Barbara Hart, a <a href="receptionist">receptionist</a>. The couple had three sons, whom Brown self-deprecatingly noted were "well spaced ... like my centuries". Outside cricket, Brown worked in a variety of jobs. When Bradman relocated from New South Wales to South Australia in 1935, Brown took his job at the men's clothing store FJ Palmer. Following his relocation to Queensland, Brown was a Brisbane car salesman, selling <a href="Chevrolet">Chevrolet</a>s for Eagers and later running a sports store.

Brown was a Queensland selector from 1950–51 to 1959–60, and an Australian selector in 1952–53 after defeating New South Wales' <a href="Chappie%20Dwyer">Chappie Dwyer</a> in an election. He was the first Queenslander in 23 years to serve as a national selector. His brief tenure as a national selector was marked by abuse and harassment from parochial Queenslanders, upset that he did not include his fellow statesmen in the Test team. Brown's sports store was vandalised and he resigned as a selector within a year. In 1992, Brown was elected a life member of the <a href="Queensland%20Cricket%20Association">Queensland Cricket Association</a>, and in 2000 was awarded the Medal of the <a href="Order%20of%20Australia">Order of Australia</a> for his services to cricket.

Upon Bradman's death in February 2001, Brown became the oldest living Australian Test cricketer, greatly amused by the fame that came with the title. Highly regarded by Australian cricketers of the modern era, <a href="Steve%20Waugh">Steve Waugh</a> invited Brown to present Test debutant <a href="Adam%20Gilchrist">Adam Gilchrist</a> with his <a href="baggy%20green">baggy green</a>. The humble Brown was surprised, thinking himself an unworthy choice. Waugh disagreed, opining that "Bill is a baggy green icon who represents all that is good about playing for your country. He is humble, self-effacing and respectful, proud to have been afforded the honour of being an Australian Test cricketer, and a man who always looks for the positive in people." In March 2008, Brown died in Brisbane at the age of 95. He was the last surviving "Invincible" to have played Test cricket before World War II and his death left only four living members of Bradman's 1948 team.

In 2005 Brown was recognised as an outstanding Queenslander in the <a href="Queensland%20Greats%20Awards">Queensland Greats Awards</a> and in 2009 was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

Ian Johnson (cricketer)

Ian William Geddes Johnson, (8 December 1917 – 9 October 1998) was an Australian <a href="cricketer">cricketer</a> who played 45 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> as a slow <a href="off-spin">off-break</a> <a href="bowling%20%28cricket%29">bowler</a> between 1946 and 1956. Johnson captured 109 Test <a href="wicket%23Dismissing%20a%20batsman">wicket</a>s at an <a href="bowling%20average">average</a> of 29.19 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">run</a>s per wicket and as a <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">lower order</a> batsman made 1,000 runs at an <a href="batting%20average%23Cricket">average</a> of 22.92 runs per <a href="innings%23Cricket">dismissal</a>. He <a href="captain%20%28cricket%29">captained</a> the <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australian team</a> in 17 Tests, winning seven and losing five, with a further five <a href="result%20%28cricket%29%23Draw">drawn</a>. Despite this record, he is better known as the <a href="Australian%20national%20cricket%20captains">captain</a> who lost consecutive <a href="the%20Ashes">Ashes</a> series against <a href="England%20cricket%20team">England</a>. Urbane, well-spoken and popular with his opponents and the public, he was seen by his teammates as a disciplinarian and his natural optimism was often seen as naive.

Aged 17, Johnson made his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> debut for <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a> in the 1935–36 season but did not establish a permanent place in the team until 1939–40. His career was interrupted by the <a href="World%20War%20II">Second World War</a>; he served with the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> as a pilot and later as a <a href="flight%20instructor">flight instructor</a>. He returned to cricket after his discharge and was selected to tour New Zealand with the Australian team, making his Test debut. Johnson was part of <a href="Don%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>'s <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">"Invincibles" team</a>; undefeated on tour in England in 1948. He was a regular member of the national side until poor form saw him left out of the Australian squad for the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201953">1953 tour of England</a>.

Johnson was appointed Australian captain following <a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>'s retirement. The appointment was not universally popular; some teammates and supporters felt <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> had a better claim to the position. In his <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201954-55">first series as captain</a>, Australia was defeated by a strong English team on home soil. The tour of the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a> that followed was a cricketing and diplomatic triumph for Johnson. Australia won the Test series comfortably and Johnson's astute public relations skills helped avoid a repeat of the crowd disturbances that had marred England's visit to the islands 12 months before. However, his Australian team then went on to lose the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201956">1956 Ashes series in England</a>. Johnson's Test career ended with Australia's first Test tour of the <a href="Indian%20subcontinent">Indian subcontinent</a>, which occurred during the voyage back to Australia. Australia lost the one-off Test against Pakistan, the first between the two nations, before claiming the series against India. On his return to Australia, he retired from all forms of cricket at age 39.

After retirement, Johnson worked for a time as a <a href="Sportscaster">sports commentator</a>, including covering the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Summer Olympics</a> in Melbourne. In 1957 he was appointed Secretary of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>, one of the most prestigious positions in Australian sport. He would remain in the role for 26 years, overseeing the development of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> and playing a key role in the organisation of the <a href="Centenary%20Test">Centenary Test</a> in 1977. In 1956 he was appointed <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> for services to cricket; this was twice upgraded: to <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">OBE</a> in 1977 and to <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">CBE</a> in 1982.

Johnson was born in <a href="North%20Melbourne%2C%20Victoria">North Melbourne</a>, an inner suburb of Melbourne, on 8 December 1918. His father, <a href="William%20Johnson%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201884%29">William Johnson</a>—a wine and spirit grocer—was a keen cricketer who played one <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class</a> match for <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a> in 1924–25 before serving as a <a href="selector%20%28sport%29">selector</a> for the <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australian Test team</a>. 
As a schoolboy, Ian Johnson excelled at a variety of sports. He participated in athletics and <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a>, as well as playing as a <a href="wicket-keeper">wicket-keeper</a> for <a href="Middle%20Park%2C%20Victoria">Middle Park</a> State School. In 1936, he became the Victorian amateur <a href="squash%20%28sport%29">squash</a> champion. However, he found his vocation in cricket. In 1934–35, aged only 16, and still a schoolboy at <a href="Wesley%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Wesley College</a>, Johnson played his first match for the <a href="Casey-South%20Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">South Melbourne Cricket Club</a> <a href="First%20XI">First XI</a>. 

He was given the opportunity to play first-class cricket the following season, playing <a href="Tasmanian%20Tigers">Tasmania</a>—not then involved in the <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> competition—just 23 days past his seventeenth birthday. He scored 34 and 26 and took two wickets in each innings as Tasmania won by six wickets. He was retained for the next game, scoring 15 runs in his only innings and taking 3 wickets for 40 runs (3/40) in the Tasmanian first innings and 1/27 in the second.

He did not play first-class cricket again for three years, finally returning to the Victorian side to play another two games against Tasmania in 1938–39, making his highest first-class score to date, 88 runs, in the second game. He secured his place in the Victorian team in the 1939–40 season, making his <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> debut against <a href="Southern%20Redbacks">South Australia</a> in Adelaide in November 1939. Batting at <a href="Batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">number five</a>, Johnson scored 33 runs in the first innings and 41 in the second, but was unable to take a wicket. That season, Johnson scored 313 runs at an average of 26.08 and took 13 wickets at an average of 39.92. In a season truncated because of the Second World War, Johnson played five matches in 1940–41, scoring 292 runs at an average of 32.44 and taking 25 wickets at 27.60.

Johnson's cricket career was interrupted by the war and he enlisted in the <a href="Royal%20Australian%20Air%20Force">Royal Australian Air Force</a> (RAAF) in March 1941. He flew <a href="Bristol%20Beaufighter">Bristol Beaufighter</a>s with <a href="No.%2022%20Squadron%20RAAF">No. 22 Squadron RAAF</a> and, by 1944, was serving as a <a href="Flight%20Lieutenant">Flight Lieutenant</a> in the <a href="South%20West%20Pacific%20theatre%20of%20World%20War%20II">South West Pacific theatre</a>. In June 1945, Johnson was awarded the <a href="King%27s%20Commendation%20for%20Valuable%20Service%20in%20the%20Air">King's Commendation for Valuable Service in the Air</a> for his work as a flight instructor with No. 11 Elementary Flying Training School, based at <a href="Benalla%2C%20Victoria">Benalla</a> in rural Victoria. He was discharged in December 1945 and resumed his first-class cricket career in the 1945–46 season.

Following his discharge from service, Johnson returned to first-class cricket in the 1945–46 season, winning a place on the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20New%20Zealand%20in%201945-46">Australian tour of New Zealand</a>. The only Test match—the first between the two nations—was played at the <a href="Basin%20Reserve">Basin Reserve</a> in <a href="Wellington">Wellington</a>. Johnson scored 7 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> and he was not needed to bowl as New Zealand collapsed for an aggregate of just 96 runs in their two innings; Australia won by an <a href="result%20%28cricket%29%23Statement%20of%20result">innings and 103 runs</a>.

Test cricket resumed in Australia with the visit of the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201946-47">English team in 1946–47</a>. Before the Test matches started, the <a href="MCC%20tour%20of%20Australia%20in%201946%E2%80%9347%23Victoria%20vs%20MCC">touring team played Victoria</a> in a warm-up match. Johnson took 4 wickets for 38 runs in the English second innings but was unable to prevent the tourists from winning by 244 runs. He was included in the Australian team for the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23First%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Brisbane">First Test at Brisbane</a>, scoring 47 runs in the Australian total of 645. Once again Johnson was not given an opportunity to bowl as Australia won the match by an innings and 332 runs. Johnson took his first Test wicket with only his third delivery in Test cricket, dismissing <a href="Len%20Hutton">Len Hutton</a> <a href="caught%20%28cricket%29">caught behind</a> down the <a href="leg%20side">leg side</a> in the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Second%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Sydney">Second Test in Sydney</a>. Making use of the breeze, in one 11 over stretch Johnson conceded only three runs—including eight <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23M">maidens</a>, taking one wicket. Johnson went on to take 6 wickets for 42 runs in the innings as England were bowled out for 255. Johnson, batting as a <a href="nightwatchman%20%28cricket%29">nightwatchman</a>, joined <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> at the wicket late on the second day of the match, batting through until <a href="stump%20%28cricket%29%23End%20of%20the%20day%27s%20play">stumps</a>. He was dismissed the next day having scored 7 runs in an Australian total of 659. In the English second innings Johnson took another two wickets; England were dismissed for 371 runs and lost the Test by an innings and 33 runs.

Johnson met with less success in the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Third%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Melbourne">Third Test</a> in his home town of Melbourne. Batting at <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">number six</a>, Johnson was dismissed by <a href="Norman%20Yardley">Norman Yardley</a> for a <a href="duck%20%28cricket%29">golden duck</a> and, in the second innings, <a href="run%20out">run out</a>, again without scoring, giving him an unwanted <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23P">pair</a>. With the ball, Johnson took one wicket in the English first innings. In the second innings Australia were not able to dismiss England and the match was <a href="result%20%28cricket%29">drawn</a>; Johnson failed to take a wicket. Johnson returned to form with the bat in the <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Fourth%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Adelaide">Fourth Test at Adelaide</a>. Unable to take a wicket in England's first innings, during the Australian first innings he made 52 runs. He dismissed Hutton again in the second innings, his only wicket of the match. The match finished in a draw, giving the Australians an unbeatable two–nil lead in the Test series and therefore retaining <a href="The%20Ashes">The Ashes</a>. Johnson was injured and could not play in the Fifth and final <a href="1946-47%20Ashes%20series%23Fifth%20Test%20%E2%80%93%20Sydney">Fifth Test in Sydney</a>.

A weak <a href="Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201947-48">Indian team toured Australia for the first time in 1947–48</a>, to play five Tests against an Australian team led by <a href="Donald%20Bradman">Don Bradman</a>. The Indian team was weakened by withdrawals of their first-choice captain <a href="Vijay%20Merchant">Vijay Merchant</a>, as well as <a href="Rusi%20Modi">Rusi Modi</a> and <a href="Mushtaq%20Ali">Mushtaq Ali</a>. Furthermore, <a href="Fazal%20Mahmood">Fazal Mahmood</a> had become a <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>i, following the <a href="partition%20of%20India">partition of India</a>. Johnson played in the first four Tests, taking 16 wickets at an average of 16.31 runs per wicket. The Third Test at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> (MCG) saw Johnson's best performance of the series, 4/59 in the first innings and 4/35 in the second. Australia won the series 4–0.

Johnson was a member of Don Bradman's <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201948">Australian team touring England in 1948</a>. Known as the "Invincibles", the Australian team was the first side to remain unbeaten through an entire English tour. Johnson started the tour well, taking 7/42 in an early tour match against <a href="Leicestershire%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Leicestershire</a>, followed by 5/53 against <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a>. Against <a href="Essex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Essex</a>, Johnson took 6/37 in the second innings. Earlier in the match Australia had scored 721 runs in a single day; Johnson made 9.

Having earned selection for the First Test at <a href="Trent%20Bridge">Trent Bridge</a>, Johnson took only one wicket in the match; Australia won the Test by eight wickets. He had more success in the Second Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> taking three wickets in the first innings as Australia won the match by 409 runs. Johnson failed to take a wicket in a rain-affected Third Test at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a>, and was replaced after the Fourth Test, having taken only seven wickets in the series at an average of 61.00. "Wisden Cricketers' Almanack" noted that while Johnson had started the tour well, he was not as effective in English conditions as Australian. Nonetheless, Johnson played an important role in maintaining the Australian team's unbeaten record, bowling more overs than anyone other than <a href="Bill%20Johnston%20%28cricketer%29">Bill Johnston</a>—allowing Bradman to rest <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a> and <a href="Ray%20Lindwall">Ray Lindwall</a>, his <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowling</a> pair, for the important matches.

During the Test series in <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20South%20Africa%20in%201949-50">South Africa in 1949–50</a>, Johnson took 18 wickets at an average of 24.22—only Bill Johnston, with 23, took more. Against a <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South African team</a> weakened following the Second World War, the Australians started the series with a win in the First Test at <a href="Ellis%20Park%20Stadium">Ellis Park</a> at <a href="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a>. The Australians won the match by an innings and 83 runs; Johnson made 66 and took 3/37 and 3/54. His best performance was in the Third Test at <a href="Kingsmead%20cricket%20ground%2C%20Durban">Kingsmead</a> in <a href="Durban">Durban</a>; 5/34 including the wicket of <a href="Dudley%20Nourse">Dudley Nourse</a> as South Africa was dismissed for 99. Australia, having made only 75 in their first innings, scored 336, including 151 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> by <a href="Neil%20Harvey">Neil Harvey</a>, to win the match by five wickets. Australia won the series—<a href="Lindsay%20Hassett">Lindsay Hassett</a>'s first as captain—four Tests to nil.

<a href="Freddie%20Brown%20%28cricketer%29">Freddie Brown</a> and his <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201950-51">English team toured Australia in 1950–51</a> to compete for the Ashes in a five Test series. Australia won the series four Tests to one; however "Wisden" reports that while "Australia held a slight superiority ... the difference between the teams was markedly less than revealed by statistics". Johnson had a "mediocre series", taking only seven wickets at an average of 44.42. His best performance was in the Third Test, when he took three wickets in the England first innings. He followed this by scoring 77 runs in a 150 run <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> with Keith Miller, who went on to score 145 <a href="not%20out">not out</a>. Johnson took another wicket in the English second innings and Australia won the Test by an innings and 13 runs. England's victory in the Fifth Test in Melbourne ended Australia's unbeaten run of 29 Tests since 1938.

The next summer, the <a href="West%20Indian%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201951-52">West Indian team visited Australia</a> to play five Tests. The series was billed as the "unofficial cricket championship of the world", following the West Indian victory against England in 1950. However, the Australians won the series comfortably, 4–1. Johnson had another lean series, taking only eight wickets at an average of 32.75.

When the <a href="South%20African%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201952-53">South Africans toured in 1952–53</a>, Johnson was selected for Australia ahead of Queenslander <a href="Colin%20McCool">Colin McCool</a>. His selection was unpopular with a parochial <a href="The%20Gabba">Gabba</a> crowd; when <a href="Gil%20Langley">Gil Langley</a>—who had replaced another Queenslander, <a href="Don%20Tallon">Don Tallon</a>—fumbled a stumping chance against <a href="John%20Watkins%20%28South%20African%20cricketer%29">John Watkins</a>, they cheered loudly. Johnson was omitted from the side for the remainder of the series and was not included in the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201953">Australian squad to tour England in 1953</a>.

While the Australian team lost the Ashes for the first time in twenty years, Johnson spent the winter of 1953 <a href="Play-by-play">calling</a> <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a> matches for local radio station <a href="3AW">3AW</a> and writing columns for "<a href="The%20Argus%20%28Australia%29">The Argus</a> newspaper." Later that year, the <a href="Cricket%20Victoria">Victorian Cricket Association</a> appointed him to succeed the retired Hassett as captain of Victoria. In the middle of the season, at a mutual friend's <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve">New Year's Eve</a> party, Hassett approached Johnson to discuss his form. Taking a confrontational approach, Hassett said to Johnson, "The problem is that you are not getting stuck in. You're not trying." When Johnson protested, Hassett continued "If you have got any brains, you will start taking this game seriously. Because if you do you will end up <a href="Australian%20cricket%20captains">captaining Australia</a> next year."

The other contender for the vacant national captaincy position was <a href="Keith%20Miller">Keith Miller</a>, the fast-bowling all-rounder and captain of <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a>. Miller had led his team to victory in the 1953–54 <a href="Sheffield%20Shield">Sheffield Shield</a> and was recognised as an intuitive captain. Based solely on cricketing merit, Miller, a regular selection at international level, was seen as the superior candidate. However, inter-state rivalries and a perception that Miller would be a poor disciplinarian saw him passed over. This perception was partly based on an incident when Miller, as captain of New South Wales, allowed his teammate <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a> to serve <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23D">drinks</a> on the field dressed in a three-piece suit rather than standard cricket <a href="whites%20%28cricket%29">whites</a>. Johnson, on the other hand, was part of the cricket establishment: he was an alumnus of the exclusive <a href="Wesley%20College%2C%20Melbourne">Wesley College</a> and the son of a former Test selector. He had also returned to form, taking 37 wickets in the 1953–54 Sheffield Shield—more than any other player—at an average of 16.37. In what cricket writer <a href="Dick%20Whitington">Dick Whitington</a> speculated was a vote split between the New South Wales and Victorian factions, the <a href="Cricket%20Australia">Australian Board of Control</a> appointed Johnson as Australian captain. His appointment was not universally applauded. 

Johnson's first challenge as captain was <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201954-55">the Ashes series against England in 1954–55</a>. In his first match as captain—the First Test at <a href="the%20Gabba">the Gabba</a> in <a href="Brisbane">Brisbane</a>—he led his team to victory, defeating England by an innings and 154 runs. It was to be the only Australian victory in the series. Injured, Johnson was unable to play in the Second Test in Sydney. With Miller also injured, <a href="Arthur%20Morris">Arthur Morris</a> was asked to lead the Australian team against an English <a href="fast%20bowling">fast bowling</a> attack including <a href="Frank%20Tyson">Frank Tyson</a> and <a href="Brian%20Statham">Brian Statham</a>. Tyson, who took ten wickets in the match, was instrumental in England winning the Test by 38 runs. Johnson and Miller returned for the Third Test in Melbourne but were unable to prevent another English victory, this time by 128 runs. The Test was marred by controversy; Melbourne newspaper, "<a href="The%20Age">The Age</a>", alleged that the <a href="cricket%20pitch">pitch</a> had been watered during the course of the match, in contravention of the <a href="laws%20of%20cricket">laws of cricket</a>. Following an enquiry, the Victorian Cricket Association and the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a> issued a statement denying any watering of the playing area during the match; however "Wisden" reported that "large cracks were evident on Saturday yet on Monday these had closed and for a time the surface behaved more kindly to batsmen". Certainly, Johnson felt the pitch had been changed to his disadvantage: "It was like losing the toss twice over". Johnson and Test debutant <a href="Len%20Maddocks">Len Maddocks</a> shared a partnership of 54 runs to help Australia fight back in their first innings. Tyson ended the Australian resistance, taking 7/27 in the Australian second innings—England won the match by 128 runs. England won the Fourth Test at Adelaide by five wickets and therefore retained the Ashes. With the Fifth and final Test ending in a draw, England won the series 3–1.

"Wisden" attributed England's victory to "superb fast bowling by Tyson and Statham [that] turned the scales so that finally the Australian batsmen were completely humbled". Losing three successive Tests saw the selectors of the Australian team subjected to harsh criticism. In the four Tests that Johnson played, he claimed 12 wickets at 20.25 and had a batting average of 58.00—inflated because of a series of <a href="not%20out">not out</a> innings; his highest score for the series was 41.

In March 1955, Johnson led Australia's first Test tour of the <a href="West%20Indies%20cricket%20team">West Indies</a>. The Australian Board of Control was concerned about the team's relations with the West Indian public. Against a background of rising anti-colonial feeling and resentment, <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20West%20Indies%20in%201953-54">England's tour of the West Indies the year before</a> had been marred by riots and violent disturbances. With the <a href="White%20Australia%20policy">White Australia policy</a> in place at the time, the Australians feared an unpleasant reception from the Caribbean public. However, the Australian team proved very popular throughout the West Indies; "Wisden" reported that "much credit belonged to the tact displayed by Ian Johnson, who proved a most able captain". Johnson cultivated a relaxed manner with the locals; in one instance at <a href="Sabina%20Park">Sabina Park</a> in <a href="Jamaica">Jamaica</a>, he stopped to pick up a toddler who had run onto the playing field during the change of innings. Smiling and chatting to the boy, he then carried him safely off the ground. Teammate <a href="Alan%20Keith%20Davidson">Alan Davidson</a> claimed, "Ian did the best PR job of any captain I've ever seen".

As well as being popular, the Australian team was successful on the field, winning the series three Tests to nil. The series was dominated by batsmen; in the five Test matches played the Australians scored 12 <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">centuries</a> while for the West Indies, <a href="Clyde%20Walcott">Clyde Walcott</a> alone scored five centuries—including centuries in both innings in the Tests at Sabina Park and <a href="Queens%20Park%20Oval">Queens Park Oval</a>. Johnson injured his foot while batting during the Sabina Park Test and was unable to bowl or field for the remainder of the match. In his place, Miller led the Australians to a nine-wicket victory. The Second Test at Queens Park Oval was a high scoring <a href="result%20%28cricket%29">draw</a>; Johnson scored 66 runs and took a single wicket. Johnson met with success in the Third Test at <a href="Bourda">Bourda</a> in <a href="Georgetown%2C%20Guyana">Georgetown, Guyana</a>. He took 7/44 in the West Indian second innings—still the best-ever innings analysis by an Australian captain—and Australia won the Test by eight wickets.

A major rift between Johnson and Miller—erstwhile rivals for the Australian captaincy—developed during the Fourth Test, played at <a href="Kensington%20Oval">Kensington Oval</a> in <a href="Barbados">Barbados</a>. During the third day, Miller, bowling <a href="swing%20bowling">fast-medium swingers</a>, had dismissed <a href="Everton%20Weekes">Everton Weekes</a> and <a href="Collie%20Smith">Collie Smith</a> in quick succession to leave the West Indies at 6/147 with <a href="Denis%20Atkinson">Denis Atkinson</a> and <a href="Clairmonte%20Depeiaza">Clairmonte Depeiaza</a> batting. Johnson, thinking that the two batsmen would be vulnerable to express pace, asked Miller to increase his bowling speed. When Miller refused, Johnson remonstrated with him: "I'll say who bowls and what they bowl". With Miller refusing to bowl as directed, Johnson replaced him in the attack with Ray Lindwall. Walking off the field at the end of the day's play and continuing in the dressing room, Miller provoked Johnson, telling him he "couldn't captain a team of schoolboys", among other insults. Finally Johnson responded, asking "If you want to go on like that why don't we go around the back and thrash it out?" The much larger Miller declined the offer and the pair travelled back to the team hotel together. The next day, Atkinson and Depeiaza batted throughout the entire day's play. Their partnership of 347 runs for the seventh wicket is still a world record.

In the Fifth and final Test, the Australians scored 758 runs in their only innings—including maiden Test centuries for Benaud and <a href="Ron%20Archer">Ron Archer</a>, centuries for Miller and <a href="Colin%20McDonald%20%28Australian%20cricketer%29">Colin McDonald</a>, and a double century for Neil Harvey—to win the match by an innings and 83 runs.

Overall, despite the team's victory in the series, Johnson's on-field contribution was inconsistent. While he took 14 wickets in the Test series, seven came in just one innings. His inconsistent form saw internal team tensions develop over whether his place in the team was justified; "Wisden" claimed that "some malcontents called him '<a href="myxomatosis">myxomatosis</a>' because he only bowled when the <a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23R">rabbit</a>s were in". 

Donald Bradman wrote to <a href="Prime%20Ministers%20of%20Australia">Prime Minister</a> <a href="Robert%20Menzies">Robert Menzies</a> after the tour, recommending an honour for Johnson in recognition of his contribution to the tour's success. The next year, both Johnson and Miller were appointed as <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Member of the Order of the British Empire</a> (MBE).

Johnson led his <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201956">Australian team to England in 1956</a>. The team's visit to England coincided with what was described by "Wisden" as "the wettest of all summers in memory". The poor weather gave the Australian team little chance to develop their confidence and Johnson used the early matches of the tour to allow his batsmen and bowlers to experiment in the unfamiliar conditions. In one of these early matches, <a href="Surrey%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Surrey</a> defeated Australia by ten wickets; the first time Australia had lost to county opposition since 1912. In parallel with later events in the Old Trafford Test, off-spinner <a href="Jim%20Laker">Jim Laker</a> took all ten wickets in the Australian first innings; Laker and left-arm spinner <a href="Tony%20Lock">Tony Lock</a> took 19 of the 20 Australian wickets that fell in the match. While Johnson was successful with the ball, taking 6 wickets for 168; his preconceived tactics saw him allow Lindwall—his main fast bowler—only two overs in Surrey's first innings and attempt to turn Alan Davidson into a spin bowler. Cricket writer <a href="Ray%20Robinson%20%28cricket%20writer%29">Ray Robinson</a> said of Johnson's tactics throughout the tour, "I have not met one good cricketer or cricket judge who is not mystified by them". The manner of this loss severely dented Australia's confidence against spin for the remainder of the tour.

The First Test, at <a href="Nottingham">Nottingham</a>, was affected by rain and, despite England <a href="Declaration%20and%20forfeiture">declaring</a> twice, the match ended in a draw. Injuries to Lindwall and Davidson meant an under-strength Australian team was forced to take the field in the Second Test at Lord's. In what "Wisden" described as a "triumph of teamwork", the Australians won the match by 185 runs. Johnson was unlucky to lose the toss in the Third Test at Leeds, because Lock and Laker were able to take maximum advantage of a pitch conducive to spin. The duo took 18 of the 20 Australian wickets and England won the match by an innings and 42 runs.

The Fourth Test at Manchester proved controversial. The Old Trafford pitch had little grass, perhaps as a result of earlier wet weather. Again, Johnson lost the toss and England chose to bat first. Johnson and his spinning partner, <a href="Richie%20Benaud">Richie Benaud</a> were unable to exploit the spin-friendly conditions and the English made 459 runs. In reply, the Australians could not come to grips with the conditions; Laker took nine of the ten wickets, Lock the other, as Australia were brushed away for just 84. Amid wild weather, the Australians were asked to <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a>. A determined batting performance was not enough to prevent an English victory by an innings and 170 runs. Laker's performance was historic. He took 10/53, the first time in a Test match a bowler had taken all ten wickets in an innings. With his 9/37 in the first innings, he had captured 19 wickets for the match, still a <a href="List%20of%20first-class%20cricket%20records%23Best%20figures%20in%20a%20match">world record in first-class cricket</a>. "Wisden" reported that the Australians were "extremely bitter over the condition of the pitch". Former Test cricketer and journalist <a href="Bill%20O%27Reilly%20%28cricketer%29">Bill O'Reilly</a> wrote "This pitch is a complete disgrace" while Colin McDonald later said, "England cheated: if by cheating you include the practise of preparing wickets to suit your own purpose." Johnson was generous towards the victors. Playing down the discontent felt by the Australians, he said: "When the controversy and side issues of the match are forgotten, Laker's wonderful bowling will remain." The media reported that Australia had been "Lakered".

The Fifth and final Test was drawn and Australia lost the series two Tests to one. Australia had now lost three Ashes series in a row, the last two with Johnson as captain. His own form was modest; he took only six wickets in the Tests at an average of over 50 runs per wicket. His performance with the bat was worse, scoring just 61 runs at an average of only 7.62. Once again, Johnson's place in the team was questioned. Acerbic cricket pundit <a href="Sid%20Barnes">Sid Barnes</a>—a former teammate—joked that Johnson was "Australia's non-playing captain". Bill Ferguson, the Australian team's scorer, was also critical: "Had Johnson been told by his friends in the press that he was, in fact, a passenger, he might have pondered on the advisability of standing down. [...] There would have been no shame in standing down." Writing after the tour, Miller—a tour selector—stated "Privately I thought that [Johnson] was not a form selection. On the other hand, I did not think it wise to change skippers in midstream." 

On the return journey from England, the Australians toured <a href="India">India</a> and <a href="Pakistan">Pakistan</a> for the first time, with mixed results. On a <a href="cricket%20pitch">matting pitch</a>, unfamiliar to the Australians, Johnson's team lost the inaugural Test against <a href="Pakistan%20national%20cricket%20team">Pakistan</a> at <a href="Karachi">Karachi</a>. Responding to the loss, a cartoon drawn by Norman Mitchell of the Adelaide "<a href="The%20News%20%28Adelaide%29">News</a>" newspaper suggested island planters might be able to scrape together a team that would be a match for the Australians. Returning to turf pitches in India, the Australians restored some pride. Johnson was the highest scorer in the Australian team's victory by an innings and five runs in the First Test at <a href="Jawaharlal%20Nehru%20Stadium%2C%20Chennai">Nehru Stadium</a> in <a href="Chennai">Madras</a>. Due to injury, both Johnson and Miller missed the drawn Second Test at <a href="Brabourne%20Stadium">Brabourne Stadium</a> at <a href="Mumbai">Bombay</a>; Lindwall skippered the side. Johnson returned for the Third Test at <a href="Eden%20Gardens">Eden Gardens</a>, <a href="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> for what would ultimately prove to be his final Test. The Australians won the match by 94 runs, giving them a 2–0 series win. <a href="S.%20K.%20Gurunathan">S. K. Gurunathan</a>, summing up in the <a href="Indian%20Cricket%20%28annual%29">Indian Cricket Almanack</a>, wrote: "The Australians showed themselves to be a superior side even when their batting failed".

When the team finally arrived home, Johnson announced his retirement from all cricket at the age of 39. In all, he played 45 Tests, capturing 109 wickets at an average of 29.19, including three five-wicket hauls. He scored exactly 1,000 runs, making him one of only fourteen Australians to achieve "<a href="double%20%28cricket%29">the double</a>" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test cricket. In all first-class cricket, Johnson had taken 619 wickets and scored 4,905 runs.

His record as the Australian captain was mixed; he had captained Australia in 17 Tests, winning seven and losing five. However, he was better known as the first captain to lead Australia to successive Ashes defeats in the 20th century. Reviewing Johnson's time as captain, "Wisden" said, "Unfortunately for him, he took over in the mid-1950s, when Australian cricket was decidedly inferior to England's for the first time since before the Bradman era" but "he was a fine cricketer and, in some respects, a visionary".

In 1942, aged 24, Johnson married 19-year-old Lal Park, the daughter of former Test cricketer <a href="Roy%20Park%20%28sportsman%29">Roy Park</a>. They were married for 56 years and had two sons, Bill and Bob. After the war, when cricket commitments allowed, Johnson worked as a salesman. Immediately following his retirement, Johnson spent some time as one of the first television sporting commentators in Australia, covering the <a href="1956%20Summer%20Olympics">1956 Summer Olympics</a>, held in his home town of Melbourne. He wrote a book; "Cricket at the Crossroads", published in 1957.

The following year, Johnson was chosen from a group of 44 candidates for the position of secretary of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>. The position—previously held by Test cricketers <a href="Hugh%20Trumble">Hugh Trumble</a> and <a href="Vernon%20Ransford">Vernon Ransford</a>—is one of the most prestigious jobs in Australian cricket. During a time of "dramatic change", he helped to maintain the Melbourne Cricket Ground's ("MCG") pre-eminence as a sporting arena. Johnson managed the club and the ground through some major redevelopment, keeping a balance between the competing interests of <a href="Australian%20rules%20football">Australian rules football</a> and cricket. For services to sports administration, he was appointed an Officer of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> (OBE) in 1976. He played a leading part in organising the <a href="Centenary%20Test%23Centenary%20Test%2C%201977%20at%20the%20Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Centenary Test</a>, held at the MCG in 1977.

For 20 years, he served as a member of the Victorian state <a href="parole%20board">parole board</a>. After serving Melbourne Cricket Club for 26 years, he retired to spend more time at his home in the southern Melbourne suburb of <a href="Albert%20Park%2C%20Victoria">Albert Park</a> and his holiday house in <a href="Torquay%2C%20Victoria">Torquay</a>. In 1982, his OBE was upgraded, when he was invested as a Commander of the <a href="Order%20of%20the%20British%20Empire">Order of the British Empire</a> (CBE) for services to cricket. He died in Melbourne in 1998 following a long illness.

Unusually for an Australian, Johnson bowled <a href="off-spin">off-spin</a> rather than the <a href="wrist%20spin">wrist spin</a> normally associated with countrymen of his day. Johnson had an atypical bowling action, with a "rather staccato swing" of his bowling arm. He bowled with a high degree of <a href="flight%20%28cricket%29">flight</a>, causing opposing batsmen difficulties in judging where the ball would land. Making intelligent use of the wind, Johnson was able to make his deliveries float away from the batsman, changing from his standard off-break. According to <a href="E.%20W.%20Swanton">E. W. Swanton</a>, Johnson was "probably the slowest bowler to achieve any measure of success in Test cricket". His action was compared to a corkscrew; writer Ray Robinson saying that "to coax turn from firm Australian pitches he twisted the ball almost hard enough to screw a doorknob off". There were doubts about the legality of his bowling action; his English rival, <a href="Trevor%20Bailey">Trevor Bailey</a> claimed Johnson <a href="throwing%20%28cricket%29">threw</a> every delivery. Johnson was never <a href="no-ball">no-ball</a>ed for throwing, having played cricket in front of umpires from Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa, the West Indies, India and Pakistan. 

<a href="Jack%20Pollard">Jack Pollard</a> described Johnson as a "dour middle order batsman". He had a sound defence and when necessary could hit the ball with power. Bradman was full of praise for Johnson's batting after the "Invincibles" tour in 1948: "Splendid batsman—most valuable about number 7", also describing him as a "very good slip field".

As captain, Johnson was noted for his public relations skills and his gift for public speaking. He was optimistic by nature, with a belief in "guts and determination". However, he was seen as insensitive at times; Bill Johnston took offence when Johnson attempted to rouse him during a practise session: "Just cos you are one of the old blokes in the side doesn't mean you don't have to bloody well put in you know." At times his optimism could appear artless and naive. <a href="Ian%20Craig">Ian Craig</a>—his successor as Australian captain—was critical of Johnson's attitude during the 1956 tour of England: "I don't think [Johnson] was ever realistic about the situation. [...] I supposed he felt obliged to make rallying speeches, but the team knew what was going on." <a href="Pat%20Crawford">Pat Crawford</a> felt "Johnson couldn't get anything out of the players, whereas the guys would have busted a gut for [Miller]". He was seen by some of his teammates as "dictatorial" with Benaud and Harvey particularly resenting Johnson's insistence on the entire touring party attending every lead-in match before 1956 Test series in England.

Johnson was sportsmanlike; on one occasion in South Africa, when <a href="Eastern%20Province%20cricket%20team">Eastern Province</a> batsman <a href="Ray%20Connell%20%28cricketer%29">Ray Connell</a> was bowled after the ball deflected from his head, Johnson replaced the <a href="bail%20%28cricket%29">bails</a>, allowing him to continue batting. During the Adelaide Test in 1950–51 he "<a href="List%20of%20cricket%20terms%23W">walked</a>", ensuring that the unlucky <a href="John%20Warr">John Warr</a> took at least one wicket for the series. Johnson was not above some gamesmanship, resorting to time-wasting tactics to avoid defeat in the final Test of the 1956 series against England. He was willing to have some fun on occasion; when in the West Indies he convinced a local pilot to allow him to fly the plane carrying the Australian team between Trinidad and nearby <a href="Tobago">Tobago</a>, to the later displeasure of the Australian Board of Control.

Normally diplomatic, in a newspaper article in South Africa, Johnson was blunt with his hosts about race relations in the country: "I am certain that the average man-in-the-street avoids the problem too much for, at the moment, you're living in a fool's paradise". Urbane, courteous and popular with opposition players and spectators, <a href="Colin%20Cowdrey">Colin Cowdrey</a> described Johnson as "an astute leader and fine ambassador for cricket".

Hugh Trumble

Hugh Trumble (19 May 1867 – 14 August 1938) was an Australian <a href="cricket">cricket</a>er who played 32 <a href="Test%20cricket">Test matches</a> as a <a href="all-rounder">bowling all-rounder</a> between 1890 and 1904. He <a href="captain%20%28cricket%29">captained</a> the <a href="Australia%20national%20cricket%20team">Australian team</a> in two Tests, winning both. Trumble took 141 <a href="Wicket%20%28dismisal%29">wickets</a> in Test cricket—a world record at the time of his retirement—at an <a href="bowling%20average">average</a> of 21.78 <a href="run%20%28cricket%29">runs</a> per wicket. He is <a href="Test%20cricket%20hat-tricks">one of only four bowlers</a> to twice take a <a href="Hat-trick%20%28cricket%29">hat-trick</a> in Test cricket. Observers in Trumble's day, including the authoritative "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>", regarded him as ranking among the great Australian bowlers of the <a href="Golden%20Age%20of%20cricket">Golden Age of cricket</a>. He was named as one of the <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">"Wisden" Cricketers of the Year</a> in 1897 and the <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Australian Cricket Hall of Fame</a>, established in 1996, inducted him in 2004.

A tall and thin <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ner, Trumble delivered the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer <a href="cricket%20pitch">pitches</a> of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable <a href="batting%20order%20%28cricket%29">lower order</a> batsman and a fine <a href="fielding%20%28cricket%29">fielder</a> in the <a href="slip%20%28cricket%29">slips</a>. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, with a penchant for practical jokes.

Trumble made his Test debut during the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201890">Australian cricket team's tour of England in 1890</a>, but was unable to secure a permanent place in the Australian side until the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201896">1896 tour of England</a>. When the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201899">Australian team next toured England in 1899</a>, Trumble scored 1,183 runs and took 142 wickets; only <a href="George%20Giffen">George Giffen</a> before him had achieved the "double" of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets as part of a touring team in England. He was appointed <a href="Australian%20national%20cricket%20captains">captain of Australia</a> in 1901–02, when <a href="Joe%20Darling">Joe Darling</a> was unavailable due to farming commitments. He retired after the 1902 Australian tour of England but was coaxed back in 1903–04. In his last Test match, Trumble took a hat-trick, his second, in front of his home town supporters in Melbourne.

Off the field, Trumble worked for the <a href="National%20Australia%20Bank">National Bank of Australasia</a>, rising to the position of manager of a local branch despite his cricket commitments interrupting his banking career. In 1911, he was appointed secretary of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>, overseeing the development of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> (MCG) into a stadium capable of holding over 70,000 spectators. He held this post until his death in 1938 from a heart attack, aged 71.

Trumble was born in the inner <a href="Melbourne">Melbourne</a> neighbourhood of <a href="Collingwood%2C%20Victoria">Collingwood, Victoria</a> in 1867, the son of William, born in <a href="Northern%20Ireland">Northern Ireland</a> and superintendent of an <a href="psychiatric%20hospital">insane asylum</a>, and Scottish-born Elizabeth (née Clark). His elder brother, <a href="John%20Trumble">John</a>, also played Test cricket for Australia and his younger brother, <a href="Thomas%20Trumble">Thomas</a>, was a <a href="Australian%20Public%20Service">public servant</a> who served as Secretary for the <a href="Department%20of%20Defence%20%28Australia%29">Department of Defence</a> from 1918–27, and then official secretary to the <a href="High%20Commissioner%20%28Commonwealth%29">High Commissioner</a> for Australia in London.

Trumble spent part of his early life in the western Victorian town of <a href="Ararat%2C%20Victoria">Ararat</a> before returning to Melbourne, settling in suburban <a href="Camberwell%2C%20Victoria">Camberwell</a>. He was educated at Hawthorn Grammar School and played his early cricket for Kew Cricket Club. Encouraging his sons' early love of cricket, William Trumble—a keen cricketer who bowled <a href="leg%20break">leg break</a>s for <a href="Casey-South%20Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">South Melbourne Cricket Club</a>—set out a <a href="cricket%20pitch">cricket pitch</a> at the family home. He placed a feather on a <a href="line%20and%20length">good length</a> and urged his sons to aim at it when bowling. Known for his accuracy, Hugh later said, "Of course I couldn't repeatedly hit the feather, but I soon reached the stage when I was always pretty close to it"

Trumble transferred to the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a> for the 1887–88 cricket season and was an immediate success. He took 36 wickets that season, finishing with an <a href="Bowling%20average">average</a> of 6.77 runs per wicket; the best in the club, beating his teammate and Australian Test bowler <a href="Fred%20Spofforth">Fred Spofforth</a>. He made his <a href="first-class%20cricket">first-class cricket</a> debut for <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victoria</a> that same season, selected to play against a touring English <a href="First%20XI">XI</a> led by <a href="Middlesex%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Middlesex</a> batsman <a href="George%20Vernon">George Vernon</a>. His first match for Victoria against Australian opposition was against <a href="New%20South%20Wales%20cricket%20team">New South Wales</a> at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>. Bowling with Spofforth, in the first innings Trumble took seven wickets for 52 runs.

Early in the 1889–90 Australian season, Trumble endured a period where he was not able to take wickets consistently. With selection of the Australian team to tour England in 1890 due at this time, Trumble was anxious about this poor run of form. Noting his anxiety while playing, a friend offered him a beer during the <a href="list%20of%20cricket%20terms%23L">lunch break</a> to revive his spirits. Previously a <a href="Teetotalism">teetotaler</a>, Trumble enjoyed his first taste and ordered another before re-entering the field of play. Feeling relaxed, although wondering about his steadiness of step, Trumble took a succession of wickets to ensure his selection in the Australian team. Trumble finished the season with 27 wickets at an average of 14.20 per wicket.

The 1890 Australian team touring England was relatively inexperienced. The team missed the <a href="all-rounder">all-round</a> ability of <a href="George%20Giffen">George Giffen</a>, who had refused to join the squad, thinking it unlikely the tour would be a sporting or financial success. The Australians won 13 matches on tour, losing 16 and <a href="result%20%28cricket%29">drawing</a> 9. Trumble made his Test cricket debut in the First Test against the <a href="England%20cricket%20team">English team</a> at <a href="Lord%27s%20Cricket%20Ground">Lord's Cricket Ground</a>. He took only one <a href="wicket">wicket</a>, dismissing <a href="Bobby%20Peel">Bobby Peel</a> <a href="caught%20%28cricket%29">caught and bowled</a> for 1. Batting at <a href="Tail-end">number eleven</a> in the first <a href="innings">innings</a> he made 1 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> and in the second, 5 runs batting at number ten. Despite this lack of success, he retained his spot in the team for the Second Test at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> where he failed to take a wicket. He was selected for the Third Test at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a> but continuous rain saw the match abandoned without a ball being bowled. Trumble played 28 first-class matches during the tour, scoring 288 runs at an average of 8.47 and took 52 wickets at an average of 21.75. "<a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%27%20Almanack">Wisden Cricketers' Almanack</a>" wrote, "Reports from Australia had led us to expect a great deal of ... Trumble" but his "straightness and regular <a href="line%20and%20length">length</a> [were] insufficient to compensate for an obvious lack of 'devil' and variety".

Trumble was not selected for the Australian team to play <a href="Henry%20Holroyd%2C%203rd%20Earl%20of%20Sheffield">Lord Sheffield</a>'s touring English team in 1891–92. He did not return to the Australian team until his selection in <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201893">the squad to tour England in 1893</a>. Before the Test matches he took 14 wickets for 116 runs (14/116) against the <a href="Gentlemen%20v%20Players">Players</a> followed by 12/84 against <a href="Kent%20County%20Cricket%20Club">Kent</a> at <a href="Gravesend%2C%20Kent">Gravesend</a>. He played in all three Test matches in 1893, taking 6 wickets at an average of 39.00. Trumble scored 58 runs in the Tests with a highest score of 35 but had more success in the other matches, scoring 774 runs, including one <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">century</a> in all first-class matches on tour. "Wisden" noted that "An immense improvement on his form of three years before was shown by Hugh Trumble, who bowled consistently well all through the tour" and "... the reports of Hugh Trumble's improvement in batting were amply borne out, his hitting in many matches being remarkably fine".

When <a href="Andrew%20Stoddart">Andrew Stoddart</a>'s <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201894-95">English team</a> visited Australia in 1894–95, Trumble played only one Test, the Second at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>. In the first innings, England scored 75 runs with Trumble taking 3 wickets. England fought back in their second innings, scoring 475 runs to win the Test by 94 runs; Trumble failed to take a wicket.

Trumble was selected in the <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201896">Australian team to tour England in 1896</a>, despite a poor domestic season in 1895–96 that saw his place in the touring squad seriously questioned by pundits. The leading cricket journalist, <a href="Tom%20Horan">Tom Horan</a> said that as much as he personally liked Trumble, he could not see him as a member of a team for the England tour that season. It was, however, during this tour that Trumble finally established a permanent place in the Australian line up. "Wisden" said of Trumble when listing him as one of its <a href="Wisden%20Cricketers%20of%20the%20Year">Cricketers of the Year</a>, "...it was not until his third visit, during the past season, that Trumble convinced Englishmen he was entitled to rank among the great bowlers of Australia". In that season, Trumble took 148 wickets at an average of 15.81. He was seen as Australia's leading bowler who "was able to inspire [the English] batsmen with a feeling of apprehension". "Wisden's" summary of the 1896 Australian tour said of Trumble, "His great strength lay in the combination of spin with extreme accuracy" and "he was on all wickets distinctly the best bowler on the [Australian] side".

England won the First Test at <a href="Lord%27s">Lord's</a> by 6 wickets, Trumble taking one wicket in each innings. The Second Test at <a href="Old%20Trafford%20Cricket%20Ground">Old Trafford</a> was more closely fought. Despite <a href="K.%20S.%20Ranjitsinhji">K. S. Ranjitsinhji</a> scoring a "marvellous" 154 and <a href="Tom%20Richardson%20%28cricketer%29">Tom Richardson</a> "bowling in his finest form" the Australians managed to hold on for a 3 wicket victory. The Australians required 125 runs to win in their second innings and were expected to make this target easily. Richardson's skilful bowling however saw Trumble and Kelly batting together with only 3 wickets in hand but with 25 runs still to make. Against excellent bowling and in a tense atmosphere, the pair managed to bat Australia home with the last runs taking an hour to score, mainly in <a href="Single%20%28cricket%29">singles</a>. Trumble made 17 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> to follow his 24 runs in the first innings and his 4 wickets. With the series tied at one Test apiece, the Third and final Test was played at <a href="The%20Oval">The Oval</a> in London. On a <a href="sticky%20wicket">pitch damaged by rain</a>, the English batted first and were dismissed for 145. Trumble took 6 wickets for 59 runs, including a 9-<a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a> spell of 5 wickets for 10 runs. England fought back to bowl the Australians out for 119. In turn, the Australians restricted England to 84 runs with Trumble taking 6 wickets for 30, to leave Australia requiring 111 runs in their second innings to win the match. <a href="Bobby%20Peel">Bobby Peel</a> and <a href="Jack%20Hearne%20%28John%20Thomas%20Hearne%29">Jack Hearne</a> combined to bowl Australia out for 44 runs to win the Test by 66 runs and retain <a href="the%20Ashes">the Ashes</a> for England . In the three Tests, Trumble took 18 wickets at an average of 18.83 runs per wicket.

Trumble played in every Test of the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201897-98">1897–98 series against the touring English</a>, who were again captained by Stoddart. England won the First Test in Sydney by 9 wickets with Trumble's 70 runs the highest score in the Australian first innings. Under the captaincy of <a href="Harry%20Trott">Harry Trott</a>, Australia fought back to win the Second Test in Melbourne by an <a href="result%20%28cricket%29">innings and 55 runs</a>. Trumble took 8 wickets in the match and in partnership with <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a> bowled the English out for 150 runs in the second innings. Australia won the Third Test in Adelaide by an innings and 13 runs; Trumble made 37 runs in the Australian innings and took 1 wicket for the match. In the Fourth Test, Trumble combined with <a href="Clem%20Hill">Clem Hill</a> in a 165 run <a href="partnership%20%28cricket%29">partnership</a> for the <a href="wicket%23Partnership">seventh wicket</a>, described by "Wisden" as the turning point in the innings. Australia won the match by 8 wickets. Australia won the Fifth Test and the series four Tests to one. For the series overall, Trumble took 19 wickets at an average of 28.15 runs per wicket and scored 170 runs at an average of 36.20.

The <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201899">1899 Australian tour</a> saw Trumble score 1,183 runs and take 142 wickets; he was only the second Australian, after <a href="George%20Giffen">George Giffen</a>, to score 1,000 runs and take 100 wickets in an English season as part of a touring team. In the Test series, Trumble took 15 wickets at an average of 25.00 and made 232 runs at an average of 38.66. "Wisden" said of Trumble's batting that season, "[Trumble] played so consistently well as to make it clear that if he had not been a bowler he would have been a great batsman". Dry <a href="cricket%20pitch">pitches</a> saw his bowling average fall off a little from the 1896 tour but "Wisden" stated that he "bowled quite as well as in 1896" and "[he] never seemed easy to hit, and whenever the ground gave him least advantage ... he was deadly". Australia won the Second Test by 10 wickets and with the other Tests finishing in <a href="result%20%28cricket%29%23Draw">draws</a>, they retained the Ashes in a one Test to nil series victory. Trumble played particularly well in the Third Test at <a href="Headingley%20Cricket%20Ground">Headingley</a>, where he took 5 wickets for 60 runs and was the highest run-scorer in the Australian second innings with 56. These efforts led him to achieve the number 1 ranking in ICC Test Bowler Rankings for the year 1899 (he retained it for the next 5 years).

At the age of 34, Trumble was chosen to <a href="captain%20%28cricket%29">captain</a> the Australian team against England in 1901–02 when <a href="Joe%20Darling">Joe Darling</a> withdrew to manage his farm in Tasmania after the first three Tests. Australia won the two remaining Tests—the only occasions that Trumble would captain his country in Test cricket—to win the series four Tests to one. Earlier, in the Second Test at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, Trumble took a "<a href="Hat-trick%20%28cricket%29">hat-trick</a>"; only five hat-tricks had been taken in the previous 24 years of Test cricket. He dismissed <a href="Arthur%20Jones%20%28cricketer%29">Arthur Jones</a>, <a href="John%20Gunn%20%28cricketer%29">John Gunn</a> and <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a> in successive balls to complete an Australian victory by 229 runs. In the Third Test in Adelaide, Trumble captured 6 wickets for 74 runs in the England second innings and made 62 <a href="not%20out">not out</a> to help the Australians win the match by 4 wickets. After this success with the bat, Trumble—in his new role as captain—promoted himself to <a href="Opening%20batsman">open the batting</a> alongside <a href="Victor%20Trumper">Victor Trumper</a>. He made only 6 runs, handing the opening batsman role to <a href="Reggie%20Duff">Reggie Duff</a> for the second innings. Australia won the Test by 7 wickets with Trumble not required to bat a second time. In the Fifth Test, again in Melbourne, Trumble took 5 wickets for 62 runs to help restrict England to a lead of 45 runs after the first innings. In the second innings Trumble took another 3 wickets and, combined with Noble's 6 wickets, helped Australia win by 32 runs. Trumble and Noble were the most successful Australian bowlers during the series. Together they took 60 wickets in the Tests: Noble 32 at an average of 19.00 and Trumble 28 at an average of 20.03.
Trumble's last cricketing <a href="Australian%20cricket%20team%20in%20England%20in%201902">tour of England was in 1902</a>, with Darling returning to captain the Australian team. Early in the tour, Trumble broke his thumb at practice, causing him to miss the first month of the English season. Despite this, when he returned for the final three Tests he took 26 wickets. In the at Old Trafford, Trumble took 10 wickets. This included 6 wickets in the second innings when he combined with <a href="Jack%20Saunders%20%28cricketer%2C%20born%201876%29">Jack Saunders</a> to bowl England out for 120; securing an Australian victory by 3 runs. Trumble, recalling his final <a href="over%20%28cricket%29">over</a> of the match, said "With the ball greasy [wet] and my boots unable to get a proper foothold on slippery turf, it was the most trying over I ever bowled." In the at The Oval, Trumble made 64 runs in the first innings and followed this with 8 wickets for 65 runs in the English first innings. He took another 4 wickets in the English second innings, but this was not sufficient to prevent an English victory by one wicket. Darling bowled Trumble unchanged from the Pavilion end throughout both innings of the match. "Wisden" praised Trumble's bowling saying "Trumble, paying us his fifth visit, bowled perhaps better than ever", but remarked that "it must be said that the wet weather and soft wickets were all in his favour"

After playing in one Test match against the <a href="South%20Africa%20national%20cricket%20team">South African team</a> on a stopover when returning from England to Australia, Trumble retired from Test cricket, aged 35. When Australia lost to the <a href="English%20cricket%20team%20in%20Australia%20in%201903-04">English tourists</a> in the First Test in Sydney in 1903–04, Trumble was persuaded to return for the Second Test under the captaincy of Noble. He was immediately successful taking 4 wickets for 107 runs in the first innings and 5 for 34 in the second, but was unable to prevent England from winning the Test by 185 runs Selected for the remaining four Tests, his 24 wickets in four Tests made Trumble the most successful Australian bowler in the series. The writer <a href="Roland%20Perry">Roland Perry</a> described Trumble's final Test match as "the most dramatic and memorable farewell performance ever by a bowler". In front of his home town supporters in Melbourne, he took 7 wickets for 28 runs, including a <a href="hat-trick">hat-trick</a>, to bowl Australia to victory; "Wisden" describing his bowling in the second innings as "practically unplayable". The hat-trick, his second in Test cricket, consisted of the dismissals of <a href="Bernard%20Bosanquet%20%28cricketer%29">Bernard Bosanquet</a>, <a href="Plum%20Warner">Plum Warner</a> and <a href="Dick%20Lilley">Dick Lilley</a> on 7 March. He went on to take the wicket of <a href="Ted%20Arnold">Ted Arnold</a>, ending the match and his career in international cricket.

Trumble was tall and thin, in height. His long face featured prominent ears and a large nose, while his long arms and uncommonly long and strong fingers assisted his bowling. The cricket writer <a href="Ray%20Robinson%20%28cricket%20writer%29">Ray Robinson</a> said of Trumble: "<a href="El%20Greco">El Greco</a>, with his lengthening touch would have liked to draw Trumble. Hugh's lantern shaped head set on a column of a neck would have given the Spaniard a halfway start." English cricketer and author <a href="Plum%20Warner">Plum Warner</a> called him "That great camel, Hughie Trumble."
When bowling, Trumble made the most of his height, bringing the ball over the full extent of his right arm. His action was described by his team-mate and bowling partner, <a href="Monty%20Noble">Monty Noble</a>, as "sidelong and insinuating, with his neck craned like a gigantic bird". He bowled <a href="off%20spin">off spin</a>ners with an impeccable <a href="line%20and%20length">length</a> at <a href="medium%20pace">medium pace</a> and was able to <a href="swing%20bowling">swing</a> the <a href="new%20ball">new ball</a>. He had a well-disguised slower ball, hoodwinking batsmen such as <a href="Stanley%20Jackson">Stanley Jackson</a>, who said, "You old devil. You get me <a href="Caught%20%28cricket%29">caught-and-bowled</a> whenever you like but I'll pick that slow one sooner or later." He preferred English pitches, saying he hardly saw one on which he could not get some turn and the temperate weather allowed him to bowl all day. In Australia, Trumble had to work harder for his wickets on firmer pitches, relying on his change of pace and consistent accuracy; he claimed he could land the ball on a saucer away five times out of six. <a href="Johnnie%20Moyes">Johnnie Moyes</a> named him as an "immortal of the art" who succeeded by "attacking the batsman's strength". <a href="W.%20G.%20Grace">W. G. Grace</a> called him "the best bowler Australia has sent us". While Trumble was able to score 1,183 runs during the 1899 tour of England, the demands of bowling did not allow him to consistently score heavily. His long, <a href="wikt%3Aprehensile">prehensile</a> fingers helped him make a reputation as a fine <a href="slip%20%28cricket%29">slips</a> fieldsman and he was the first to take 20 catches in an Australian season. English cricketer <a href="Johnny%20Douglas">Johnny Douglas</a> said, "Trumble should not be allowed on the cricket field—his natural place would be up trees in the bush." He practised slip fielding by catching a tennis ball thrown against a brick wall; he believed this practise trained him not to "snatch" at the ball but allow it to fall into his safe hands.

Trumble was known for his cleverness on the field. <a href="C.%20B.%20Fry">C. B. Fry</a> said of him, "He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and changing bowlers." On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two <a href="wide%20%28cricket%29">wide</a>s that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the <a href="boundary%20%28cricket%29">boundary</a> to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to <a href="follow-on">follow-on</a> (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious <a href="sportsmanship">sportsmanship</a> of the action, he replied, "I had to do it, old chap, but I wonder what my father will think of it?" Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; <a href="New%20Zealand">New Zealand</a> cricketer, <a href="Dan%20Reese">Dan Reese</a>, who played against and alongside Trumble said, "His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character."

He was popular with team-mates and opponents alike, with a weakness for practical jokes. On board a ship travelling to England, Trumble offered to coach unsuspecting fellow travellers in various deck sports such as <a href="quoits">quoits</a>. Accepting Trumble's advice, they were made to contort themselves into a number of ludicrous positions to the amusement of his team-mates and other onlookers <a href="wikt%3Ain%20the%20know">in the know</a>. To prolong the joke, in his own games Trumble would adopt the same peculiar stance and method he advocated.

"The first of the great off spinners of the Test-match age", in 32 Tests, Trumble took 141 wickets at an <a href="bowling%20average">average</a> of just over 20 runs per wicket. He took 5 wickets in an <a href="Innings%20%28cricket%29">innings</a> on nine occasions and 10 wickets in a match three times. On retirement, he had taken more wickets in Test cricket than any other player; a record he held for nearly 10 years until surpassed by <a href="Sydney%20Barnes">Sydney Barnes</a>. It wasn't until <a href="Dennis%20Lillee">Dennis Lillee</a> 75 years later that anyone was able to better Trumble's 141 wickets against England. While mainly a bowler, Trumble batted well enough to make 851 runs in Test cricket at an <a href="batting%20average%23Cricket">average</a> of 19.79 with a highest score of 70. Trumble was also prolific at first-class level. He took 929 wickets, including 5 wickets in an innings on 69 occasions, and as a batsman, he made 5,395 runs with three <a href="century%20%28cricket%29">centuries</a> and a highest score of 107. For <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a>, he took just under 400 wickets and scored more than 3,000 runs; winning the club best bowling average on six occasions and the best batting average once.

Trumble was particularly effective in England. After taking 52 wickets on his first tour of England in 1890, his other four visits to England—in 1893, 1896, 1899 and 1902—saw him take over 100 wickets in first-class matches. In 1899, he scored 1,183 runs making him one of only four Australians, with <a href="George%20Giffen">George Giffen</a>, <a href="Warwick%20Armstrong">Warwick Armstrong</a> (both three times) and <a href="Jack%20Gregory%20%28cricketer%29">Jack Gregory</a>, to take over 100 wickets and make over 1,000 runs on a tour of England.

The <a href="ICC%20player%20rankings">ICC player rankings</a> have been applied retrospectively to cricket history and Trumble achieved the top ranking as a bowler. By June 1896, he was ranked fifth in the world and never again slipped lower; from 1899 until his retirement he was the first or second best bowler in the world according to the ratings. As a batsman, Trumble's ranking peaked at twelfth in the world after the Third Test in Adelaide in 1901–02.

Trumble was the first player to take two <a href="Hat-trick%20%28cricket%29">hat-tricks</a> in Test cricket. Both hat-tricks were taken against England at the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a>, where Trumble played his club cricket. Hat-tricks are extremely rare; in over 131 years of Test cricket to March 2008, there had only been <a href="Test%20cricket%20hat-tricks">37 Test hat-tricks</a> and only <a href="Jimmy%20Matthews">Jimmy Matthews</a> and <a href="Wasim%20Akram">Wasim Akram</a> been able to repeat Trumble's feat of taking a second.

Trumble joined the <a href="National%20Australia%20Bank">National Bank of Australasia</a> in 1887 to begin a career in banking. While the bank often allowed him time to practice, his frequent absences with cricket meant his career progression was slow; after each of his five tours of England he returned to find junior bank officers promoted over him. Nevertheless, he was appointed accountant at the <a href="Richmond%2C%20Victoria">Richmond</a> branch in 1903 and after his retirement from cricket in 1908, manager of the <a href="Kew%2C%20Victoria">Kew</a> branch.

A loyal clubman, Trumble served on the committee of the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Club">Melbourne Cricket Club</a> (MCC) from 1900–01 to 1910–11 and was made a life member in 1904. In 1911 he resigned from the bank to become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27 years until his death. In this role, he played a leading part in reconciling the club and the <a href="Cricket%20Victoria">Victorian Cricket Association</a> after a period of some friction between the two bodies. He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including <a href="Bert%20Ironmonger">Bert Ironmonger</a>, whom Trumble saw play on a visit to <a href="Queensland">Queensland</a>. During his term as secretary, the <a href="Melbourne%20Cricket%20Ground">Melbourne Cricket Ground</a> was expanded to a capacity of over 70,000 spectators.

Trumble was a prominent writer about and elder statesman of the game and was conspicuous in his support for journalists calling at any hour. From time to time, Trumble acted as a <a href="selector%20%28sport%29">selector</a> of the <a href="Victorian%20Bushrangers">Victorian cricket team</a>. In 2001, Trumble was selected in the Melbourne Cricket Club <a href="Team%20of%20the%20Century">Team of the Century</a>, and in 2004 he was inducted into the <a href="Australian%20Cricket%20Hall%20of%20Fame">Australian Cricket Hall of Fame</a> for his contribution to the sport in Australia.

In 1899, aged 31, Trumble met and fell in love with Florence Christian, aged 19 from Queensland. The couple were married in 1902, with the wedding timed to allow a honeymoon trip accompanying the Australian cricket tour of England. An injury to his thumb freed Trumble from cricket commitments for a while, to his new wife's delight. Together, the couple had eight children; six sons and two daughters. One son, <a href="Robert%20Trumble">Robert</a>, a renowned musician and writer, dedicated his first book, "The Golden Age of Cricket", to his father. Trumble died aged 71, from a heart attack in his home in the Melbourne eastern suburb of <a href="Hawthorn%2C%20Victoria">Hawthorn</a>.

J. R. Richard

James Rodney Richard (born March 7, 1950) is an American former <a href="starting%20pitcher">starting pitcher</a> in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> who played his entire career, from 1971 to 1980, with the <a href="Houston%20Astros">Houston Astros</a>.

After leaving high school, Richard was selected by the Astros as the second overall pick in the first round of the <a href="1969%20Major%20League%20Baseball%20draft">1969 amateur draft</a>. From the time he made his major league debut with the Astros in 1971 until 1975, Richard had a limited role as an Astros pitcher, throwing no more than 72 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings</a> in a season. In 1975, Richard played his first full season in the majors as a starting pitcher.

From 1976 to 1980, he was one of the premier pitchers in the majors, leading the <a href="National%20League">National League</a> twice in <a href="strikeout">strikeout</a>s, once in <a href="earned%20run%20average">earned run average</a>, and three times in <a href="hits%20per%20nine%20innings">hits allowed per nine innings</a>, <a href="win%20%28baseball%29">winning</a> at least 18 games a year between 1976 and 1979. On July 30, 1980, Richard suffered a <a href="stroke">stroke</a> and collapsed while playing a game of catch before an Astros game, and was rushed to the hospital for emergency surgery to remove a life-threatening <a href="thrombus">blood clot</a> in his neck. His condition brought a sudden end to his major league career at the age of 30. His 313 strikeouts in 1979 remains an Astros franchise record, and he held the team's record for career strikeouts (1,493) until 1987. Two-time <a href="National%20League%20MVP">National League MVP</a>s <a href="Johnny%20Bench">Johnny Bench</a> and <a href="Dale%20Murphy">Dale Murphy</a> both named Richard as the toughest pitcher they ever faced.

In 1981, Richard attempted a comeback with the Astros, but this failed because the stroke had slowed down his <a href="reaction%20time">reaction time</a> and weakened his <a href="depth%20perception">depth perception</a>. He spent the next few seasons in the <a href="Minor%20League%20Baseball">minor leagues</a> before being released by the Astros in 1984. After his professional baseball career ended, Richard became involved in unsuccessful business deals and went through two divorces, which led to him being homeless and destitute in 1994. Richard found <a href="succor">succor</a> in a local church and later became a <a href="minister%20%28Christianity%29">Christian minister</a>.

Richard was born to Clayton and Lizzie ("née" Frost) Richard in <a href="Vienna%2C%20Louisiana">Vienna, Louisiana</a> and gained prominence in both baseball and <a href="basketball">basketball</a> at <a href="historically%20black">historically black</a> and since closed Lincoln High School in nearby <a href="Ruston%2C%20Louisiana">Ruston</a>. By the time he was a high school senior, Richard stood tall and weighed . That year, he was one of the starting pitchers for Lincoln High School and did not concede a run for the entire season. In one game Richard hit four consecutive <a href="home%20run">home run</a>s while pitching his team to a 48–0 victory against its local rival, <a href="Jonesboro%2C%20Louisiana">Jonesboro</a>'s Jackson High School. Richard, whose baseball idol was <a href="St.%20Louis%20Cardinals">St. Louis Cardinals</a> pitcher <a href="Bob%20Gibson">Bob Gibson</a>, never lost a game he started in his high school career.

Upon graduating from high school, he turned down more than 200 basketball scholarship offers to sign with the Houston Astros. The Astros would later select him with the second overall pick in the 1969 amateur baseball draft, behind the <a href="Washington%20Senators%20%281961%E2%80%9371%29">Washington Senators</a>' selection of <a href="outfielder">outfielder</a> <a href="Jeff%20Burroughs">Jeff Burroughs</a>. Richard later recalled, "There were other guys in my high school with as much ability as I had, but instead of working at a job, they wanted to drink wine on Saturday nights. They thought that was the in thing to do, and consequently our lives went in different directions. For some people it takes that to make a world. It does not for me."

After the Astros drafted Richard, they sent him to play for the Covington Astros, a <a href="Rookie%20League">rookie-level</a> <a href="minor%20league%20baseball">minor league baseball</a> team in the <a href="Appalachian%20League">Appalachian League</a>. Richard started 12 games for Covington, finishing with five wins and four <a href="loss%20%28baseball%29">losses</a>. Despite accumulating an average of 11.41 <a href="Strikeouts%20per%209%20innings%20pitched">strikeouts per nine innings</a>, Richard had trouble throughout the season with his pitching mechanics and <a href="strike%20zone">control</a>. In 56 <a href="innings%20pitched">innings</a>, Richard struck out 71 batters but <a href="base%20on%20balls">walked</a> 52 and gave up 41 <a href="earned%20run">earned run</a>s, resulting in a 6.59 earned run average.

The following year, at 20 years of age, Richard was promoted to the Cocoa Astros of the <a href="Florida%20State%20League">Florida State League</a> in high-A minor league baseball. Richard again compiled a low hits per nine innings (H/9IP) ratio by giving up only 67 <a href="hit%20%28baseball%29">hits</a> in 109 total innings pitched. Despite his 4–11 win–loss record, Richard finished the season with a 2.39 ERA and even threw a <a href="no-hitter">no-hitter</a> against the Daytona Beach Dodgers. During the season, Richard was able to throw an accurate <a href="fastball">fastball</a> which occasionally exceeded 100 miles per hour, and his <a href="slider">slider</a> 93 miles per hour, faster than those of most major-league pitchers. During the 1970–71 off-season, the Astros again promoted Richard: this time to <a href="AAA%20%28baseball%29">Class-AAA baseball</a>, one step below the major leagues, with the <a href="Oklahoma%20City%2089ers">Oklahoma City 89ers</a> of the now-defunct <a href="American%20Association%20%2820th%20century%29">American Association</a>. Richard wore number 50 and kept that number for the rest of his minor-league and major-league career. Richard started all but one of the games he pitched that season. He pitched eight <a href="complete%20game">complete game</a>s and led the league with 202 strikeouts in 173 innings of work. He ended the season with twelve wins and seven losses before being called up by the Houston Astros.

Richard entered Major League Baseball with the Astros in 1971 as a <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20transactions%2325-man%2C%2040-man%2C%20and%20postseason%20rosters">September call-up</a>. On September 5, Richard made his major league debut at just 21 years of age, in the second game of a <a href="doubleheader%20%28baseball%29">doubleheader</a> against the <a href="San%20Francisco%20Giants">San Francisco Giants</a>. Richard used his fastball–slider combination to pick up the win and tied <a href="Karl%20Spooner">Karl Spooner</a>'s 17-year-old major league record for striking out 15 batters in his first major league start. Richard was charged with two earned runs and seven hits in the 5–3 Astros win but struck out <a href="Willie%20Mays">Willie Mays</a> and <a href="Dick%20Dietz">Dick Dietz</a> three times.

Richard made his next start, after five days rest, against the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Cincinnati Reds</a>, who would later finish the NL West season in a tie for fourth place with the Astros. Richard gave up a lead-off home run to <a href="Pete%20Rose">Pete Rose</a> in the first inning and pitched five innings of the two-hit, one-run game. He struck out five batters but walked six. Richard struggled in his two following starts. In a September 16 match-up against the Astros' division rival, the third-place <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Atlanta Braves</a>, Richard pitched seven innings and surrendered four runs on seven hits. He struck out nine batters and even struck out the side in the first inning but also walked four batters. Furthermore, he threw two <a href="wild%20pitch">wild pitch</a>es in the first and fifth innings. In his final game of the season, against the Giants, Richard was replaced in the first inning after pitching to only four batters.

During the next few seasons, Richard split time between the minors and majors and did not become a regular starter with the Astros until 1975. After his "cup of coffee" with the Astros in 1971, Richard was sent back down to Class-AAA baseball to work on his pitching with the Oklahoma City 89ers for the 1972 season. He <a href="games%20started">started</a> 19 games with the 89ers before being called back up to the Astros. In Triple-A baseball in the American Association, Richard finished with 10 wins and eight losses in 128 innings of work. His 3.02 ERA was slightly higher than that of the previous season, but he maintained approximately the same <a href="Bases%20on%20balls%20per%209%20innings%20pitched">walks per nine innings ratio</a> (BB/9IP) that he had the previous year. He recorded six complete games and finished with 169 strikeouts, for a ratio of 11.88 strikeouts per 9 innings. Richard re-entered the majors, starting a day game of a day-night doubleheader for the Astros against the <a href="San%20Diego%20Padres">San Diego Padres</a> on July 30, 1972. He struggled and took the 10–7 loss. Richard did not pitch again until two weeks later, when he entered in <a href="relief%20pitcher">relief</a> for <a href="Ken%20Forsch">Ken Forsch</a> in the fifth inning to keep the Giants limited to a one-run lead. In two innings of relief, Richard gave up one hit, struck out three batters and garnered the win. In his two final relief appearances of the season, Richard gave up five earned runs in just over one inning of work. He finished the season with a 13.50 ERA in only six innings of work and was again sent back down to Triple-A, this time with the Astros-affiliated <a href="Denver%20Bears">Denver Bears</a>.

Richard started eight games with the Bears in 1973 and posted minor league career-worsts in ERA and hits allowed per nine innings. Despite his poor performance with the Bears, Richard was again called up by the Astros. Richard entered in the fourth inning of a June 16 game against the St. Louis Cardinals and his idol Bob Gibson. He pitched four innings of one-run ball and three innings of a two-hit game in his next relief outing. Afterwards, the Astros placed Richard in the starting rotation, and he made his first major league start since July 30 of the previous year. He pitched six solid innings of a one-run ballgame and struck out six while walking three batters. Richard would make his next start four days later. Richard again pitched more than six innings but earned no decision after the Astros' <a href="bullpen">bullpen</a> gave up nine runs during the top of the ninth inning.

After starting a July 4 game against the <a href="Atlanta%20Braves">Braves</a> (which he won), Richard was sent into the bullpen to add <a href="Tom%20Griffin%20%28baseball%29">Tom Griffin</a> into the Astros' starting rotation. He made three relief appearances against the <a href="Montreal%20Expos">Montreal Expos</a> before making a start against the <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Los Angeles Dodgers</a> on July 27. Four days later, Richard threw his first <a href="shutouts%20in%20baseball">shutout</a> against the Dodgers, in which he gave up just five hits and struck out nine batters. Nineteen days later, Richard pitched another complete game, this time giving up two runs while striking out nine and walking three batters. He concluded the season with six wins and two losses in 16 total games, 10 of which he started. He finished with a 4.00 ERA, and struck out 75 batters in 72 innings. He walked 38 batters, giving him a ratio of 4.75 walks per nine innings, which was lower than the ratio he had had in his two previous minor league seasons.

Despite his improved performance in the 1973 season, Richard was sent down to work on his pitching mechanics and ball control in Class-AA baseball with the <a href="Carolina%20Mudcats">Columbus Astros</a> of the <a href="Southern%20League%20%28baseball%29">Southern League</a>. He started 13 games with Columbus before being moved back up to Class-AAA with the Denver Bears. In four starts with the Bears, Richard threw three shutouts and pitched 33 scoreless innings with a 4–0 record and 26 strikeouts. He was called back into the majors on July 13 and stayed with the Astros for the remainder of the season. He first pitched 14 innings of baseball in six relief appearances before being placed on the starting rotation. He then started in all nine of the games he pitched during the remainder of the season. Richard finished with a 4.18 ERA in just over 64 innings of work during the 15 pitching appearances he made during the season.

Even though Richard's statistics showed he bounced between Houston and the minors during his first four years with the Astros due to his wildness, he often told reporters that racism played a role in keeping him from becoming a regular with the big club sooner.

In the off-season, the Astros traded starting pitcher <a href="Claude%20Osteen">Claude Osteen</a> to the Cardinals, and lost pitching ace <a href="Don%20Wilson%20%28baseball%29">Don Wilson</a>, who died from <a href="carbon%20monoxide%20poisoning">carbon monoxide poisoning</a> at the age of 29 on January 5, 1975. As a result, Richard entered the 1975 season as the third starter of the Astros' pitching rotation, behind veterans <a href="Larry%20Dierker">Larry Dierker</a> and <a href="Dave%20Roberts%20%28pitcher%29">Dave Roberts</a>. Richard was scheduled to start on April 9 versus the Braves. He was removed from the game in the fifth inning after jamming his toe on the first base bag but gave up no earned runs in his start. Richard continued to exhibit wildness, as shown when he issued eight walks in both his third and fourth starts of the season. He followed by pitching a complete game win against the San Diego Padres on April 29. The following start, he walked a career-high eleven batters in just six innings of pitching and also gave up seven runs in the Astros' 12–8 win over the Giants. By the All-Star break, Richard had six wins and four losses with a 4.93 ERA in just over 98 innings of work.

In an August 10 game against the <a href="Pittsburgh%20Pirates">Pittsburgh Pirates</a>, Richard yielded just one hit in six innings but walked 10 batters. He rebounded with a complete game shutout against the <a href="New%20York%20Mets">New York Mets</a> eight days later. Richard ended the season on a strong note by winning three of his last four starts, including his final two games against the Dodgers. He finished the year with a 12–10 record for the Astros, who finished with a franchise-worst 64–97 record. Richard was the only starter on the Astros' pitching staff who had a winning record for the season. He led the team with 176 strikeouts, which was also the fifth-highest in the National League. Richard also led the league in walks allowed and wild pitches thrown, with 138 and 20, respectively.

Richard entered the 1976 season as the pitching staff <a href="ace%20%28baseball%29">ace</a> and took over Larry Dierker's position as the <a href="Opening%20Day">Opening Day</a> starter for the Astros. In his first start of the season, Richard gave up four runs in four innings against the defending <a href="World%20Series">World Series</a> champion Cincinnati Reds on April 8. He followed this inauspicious beginning with wins in five of his next six decisions. One of them included a 10-inning shutout effort that led to a 16-inning 1–0 Astros victory against the Dodgers. By the end of May, however, Richard was sitting even with a 5–5 record, loser of four straight decisions. He closed the first half of the season by winning a 10-inning shutout against the Mets on July 6, and an eight-inning start against the Expos four days later. At the All-Star break, Richard had a 9–9 record with a 2.88 ERA in over 153 innings of work.
From July 10 to August 31, Richard racked up eight complete games, including one shutout, and he improved his record from 9–9 to 16–13. He pitched 98 innings and yielded only 22 earned runs, which gave him an ERA of 2.02 during the approximately 50-day span. On August 26, Richard hit his first home run of the season during the second inning of the game. In his last game of the season on October 2, Richard pitched a complete game 13-strikeout performance, and he also hit a two-run home run in the sixth inning.

Richard finished the season with a 20–15 record, 14 complete games, three shutouts, and 214 strikeouts in 291 innings of work. At age 26, Richard became only the second pitcher in Astros' history (after Dierker in 1969) to record 20 wins in a season, tying him for fourth in the NL that year. Richard also became the ninth member of the <a href="Black%20Aces">Black Aces</a>, an organization founded by <a href="Mudcat%20Grant">Mudcat Grant</a> that consists of all <a href="African%20American">African American</a> pitchers who have won at least 20 major league games in a season. He was named the <a href="Most%20Valuable%20Player">Most Valuable Player</a> of the Astros by the <a href="Houston%2C%20Texas">Houston</a> chapter of the <a href="Baseball%20Writers%27%20Association%20of%20America">Baseball Writers' Association of America</a> (BBWAA). Richard finished 17th in <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20Most%20Valuable%20Player%20Award">MVP Award</a> voting and seventh in the NL's Cy Young Award voting. His 2.75 ERA was the seventh-best among the league's starting pitchers, and he held hitters to a 0.212 batting average. He led the league in lowest number of hits allowed per nine innings and in walks allowed; Richard also finished the season second in batters faced, innings pitched and games started. In addition, he led all NL pitchers with 14 hits, two home runs, and nine <a href="run%20batted%20in">runs batted in</a> as a hitter. However, during the year he committed ten <a href="error%20%28baseball%29">errors</a> and finished with an 0.853 <a href="fielding%20percentage">fielding percentage</a>, nearly 0.100 lower than the league average.

Richard began the 1977 season on a high note with a nine-inning, seven-strikeout performance on April 8 against the Braves. He pitched seven complete game victories in the first half of the season. By the All-Star break, Richard had nine wins and six losses in over 160 innings of work, accompanied by 119 strikeouts and a 2.69 ERA. Although Richard struggled through July and early August, he did manage to pitch three complete games (including two shutouts) in five starts from August 27 to September 17. He had 11 and 10 strikeouts respectively in the final two starts of that roughly 20-day span.

Richard closed out the season with two complete games, the first against the Braves on September 27, and the second against the Dodgers on October 2. He had a season-high 14 strikeouts in his final start, which tied <a href="Steve%20Carlton">Steve Carlton</a>'s season-high mark. Richard concluded the season on a high note by winning nine of his last twelve decisions. At the end of the season, he led the Astros' pitching staff in wins, starts, complete games, innings pitched, walks and strikeouts. He had 18 wins and 12 losses in 267 innings pitched and posted a 2.97 ERA and 214 strikeouts. For the first time since becoming a permanent member of the Astros' starting rotation, Richard was not the league leader in walks allowed, but as he had done in 1976, he led the league in wild pitches. He finished fourth in the league with 13 complete games, and he improved his fielding from the previous season by going through an error-free season.

Richard hit well for a pitcher, going 20-for-87 in the season with two triples, two home runs and seven runs batted in. After the season was completed, Richard underwent an emergency <a href="appendicectomy">appendicectomy</a> on October 26, 1977 at a Houston hospital. He spent most of the off-season working out at the <a href="Reliant%20Astrodome">Houston Astrodome</a> and, for relaxation, <a href="fishing">fishing</a>. In early 1978, he was a participant in <a href="American%20Broadcasting%20Company">ABC's</a> <a href="Superstars">Superstars</a> all-around sports competition.

Richard entered the 1978 season as the Astros' <a href="Opening%20Day">Opening Day</a> starter. In the first game of the season, he gave up seven runs on 11 hits and just made it into the fifth inning before being replaced in a loss to the Cincinnati Reds. He recovered from the loss by pitching a complete game two-hit shutout in his next outing against the Dodgers. In an eight-start period from April 26 to June 4, Richard threw six complete games, including two back-to-back shutouts, and lowered his ERA from 4.15 to 3.05. He struck out 67 and gave up only 39 hits in the 63 total innings he pitched. On a June 9 start against the Cardinals, Richard struck out 12 batters but also walked six and gave up five earned runs. By the end of the first half of the season Richard had pitched back-to-back games with nine and 12 strikeout performances, against the <a href="Cincinnati%20Reds">Reds</a> and <a href="Los%20Angeles%20Dodgers">Dodgers</a>, respectively. At the All-Star break, he had an 8–9 record with a 3.49 ERA but also had 157 strikeouts in 139 innings of work.

After the break, Richard threw an 11-inning, 10-strikeout game against the Expos and followed with two complete games and another nine-inning performance in a game that went into extra innings. He was selected as the National League <a href="Pitcher%20of%20the%20Month">Pitcher of the Month</a> after going a perfect 4–0 with a 1.29 ERA and 58 strikeouts in 56 innings during July. Throughout much of August, his season ERA hovered below 3.00, and he averaged well over a strikeout per inning. On August 21, in an 8–3 victory over the <a href="Chicago%20Cubs">Chicago Cubs</a>, he broke Don Wilson's 1969 club record of 235 strikeouts. In the final two months of the season, Richard's strikeout average dramatically increased, and he struck out a double-digit number of batters in three of his last five starts. In his third-to-last start, Richard broke <a href="Tom%20Seaver">Tom Seaver</a>'s NL record of 290 strikeouts by a right-hander when he struck out <a href="Bob%20Horner">Bob Horner</a>. In his final outing of the season, Richard reached the 300-strikeout pinnacle by striking out <a href="Rowland%20Office">Rowland Office</a> in a September 28 victory over the Braves. He also hit his seventh career home run, making him the Astros' career leader in home runs by a pitcher. At that time, he became only the tenth pitcher, third National Leaguer and first NL right-hander in history to strike out more than 300 batters in a single season.

Richard finished the season with 18 wins, 11 losses and a 3.11 ERA. He led the team's pitching staff in innings pitched, starts, complete games, shutouts, hits allowed, earned runs, walks allowed and strikeouts. He held batters to a .156 batting average at home and a .196 average overall, which was the lowest in the NL. Richard again fared well in the field, finishing with three errors and a 0.957 fielding percentage, slightly higher than the 0.950 league average. He finished fourth in the Cy Young Award voting, behind <a href="Gaylord%20Perry">Gaylord Perry</a>, <a href="Burt%20Hooton">Burt Hooton</a> and <a href="Vida%20Blue">Vida Blue</a>. He finished atop the league in strikeouts per nine innings (9.90), fewest hits allowed per nine innings (6.28), walks (141), and wild pitches (16).

In his second game of the 1979 season, Richard set the modern-day record for throwing six wild pitches in a single game against the Dodgers. Despite this, he finished the game with a 13-strikeout performance in a 2–1 Astros victory. He won his first four decisions that season but those victories were followed by four losses. He continued to accumulate strikeouts and finally began to walk fewer batters on average, exhibiting greater control over his pitching. Richard evened out his record at seven wins and seven losses by pitching a complete game three-hit shutout against the Padres on June 30. By the All-Star break, Richard had 7 wins, 10 losses, a 3.52 earned run average and 158 strikeouts in just a bit over 157 innings of work. By July 25, his record stood at eight wins and 11 losses, but after he pitched nine straight complete games (including two-hit and three-hit shutouts on August 27 and September 6, respectively) through September 6 and worked 86 consecutive innings without the need of a relief pitcher, which set an Astros club record, it was clear that he was on a winning streak. On September 21, in a game against the Reds, he pitched 11 innings and matched a career high of 15 strikeouts, which he also reached earlier in the season on August 3 in a game against the Braves. He closed out the season against the Dodgers by winning his 11th straight game against the team, with his last loss coming on June 23, 1976. He was honored as the National League Pitcher of the Month for September after going 4–1 with a 1.24 ERA, four complete games, two shutouts and 69 strikeouts in 53 innings pitched during the stretch.

He finished the season with 18–13 record and a league-best 2.71 ERA. He struck out 10 or more batters 14 times in the season, and totaled a league-leading 313 strikeouts for the season, breaking his own club record. Richard joined <a href="Nolan%20Ryan">Nolan Ryan</a> and <a href="Sandy%20Koufax">Sandy Koufax</a> as the only modern-day pitchers to strike out over 300 batters in consecutive seasons. He led the club in ERA, complete games and innings pitched and tied <a href="Joe%20Niekro">Joe Niekro</a> in number of games started. He gave up 220 hits in the season, which gave him a league-best 6.77 hits per nine innings ratio. He again led the league by limiting the opposing hitters' batting averages to .209 that year. Richard finished fifth in the league in walks allowed, with his first sub-100 total since he became a mainstay starter with the Astros. He also led the league with a 9.64 strikeouts per nine innings ratio. Richard finished 19th in National League MVP Award voting and third in Cy Young Award voting, behind winner <a href="Bruce%20Sutter">Bruce Sutter</a> and teammate Joe Niekro, who had 21 wins and a 3.00 ERA that season. Richard fared slightly worse in batting and fielding, finishing with a .126 batting average and a .902 fielding percentage and five errors. On October 11, Richard signed a four-year contract with the Astros.

By now Richard was among the best pitchers in baseball. When asked in 2012 who was the "toughest pitcher to get a hit off of" during his career, <a href="Dale%20Murphy">Dale Murphy</a> answered "Anybody that played in the late 70's or early 80's will probably give you the same answer: JR Richard". In 1980, Richard was now teamed with seven-time <a href="American%20League">American League</a> strikeout champion Nolan Ryan, who had joined the Astros as a free agent. During the first half of the season, Richard was virtually unhittable, starting the year with five straight wins, 48 strikeouts (including two starts with 12 and 13 strikeouts), and a sub-2.00 ERA. He was named National League Pitcher of the Month for April. At one point, Richard threw three straight complete-game shutouts, two against the Giants and one against the Cubs. On July 3, he broke Dierker's team record of 1487 career strikeouts in a 5–3 win over the Braves; it was to be Richard's last major league victory. After finishing the first half of the season with a 10–4 record, 115 strikeouts and a 1.96 ERA, Richard was selected to be the National League's starting pitcher in the All-Star Game on July 8, but he pitched just two innings due to various back and shoulder problems. As the season progressed, Richard began to complain of a "dead arm", citing discomfort in his shoulder and forearm. His concerns fell on deaf ears. Some in the media even interpreted these complaints as whining or malingering, citing Richard's reputation for moodiness. Others hypothesized that Richard was egotistical and could not handle the pressure of pitching for the Astros, while others suggested he was jealous of Ryan's $4.5 million contract.

During his next start on July 14 against the Braves, Richard was pitching well and even struck out the side in the second inning, but had trouble seeing <a href="catcher">catcher</a> <a href="Alan%20Ashby">Alan Ashby</a>'s signs and also had difficulty moving his arm. He left the game in the fourth inning after throwing a fastball and feeling his right arm go "dead". He had numbness in the fingers of his right hand and could not grasp a baseball. The Astros placed Richard on the 21-day disabled list. As it turned out, it would be his last major league game.

Nine days later, he checked into <a href="The%20Methodist%20Hospital">Methodist Hospital</a> in Houston for a series of physical and psychological tests to determine the cause of his mysterious arm problems. An <a href="angiogram">angiogram</a> revealed an obstruction in the distal <a href="subclavian%20artery">subclavian</a> and <a href="axillary%20artery">axillary arteries</a> of the right arm. Richard's blood pressure in his left arm was normal but pressure was nearly absent in his right arm due to the completely obstructed artery. On July 25, however, the arteries in his neck were studied, and the doctors reached a conclusion that all was normal and no surgical treatment needed to be performed.

On July 30, Richard went to see a <a href="chiropractor">chiropractor</a> who rotated his neck to fix the flow of blood in his upper torso region. Later that day, Richard was participating in warm-ups before the game when he suffered a major stroke and collapsed in the outfield. Before the stroke, he had a headache and a feeling of weakness through his body. Eventually, that progressed into vision problems and paralysis in the left side of his body. A massive blockage in his right carotid artery necessitated emergency surgery that evening. An examination by <a href="neurologist">neurologist</a> William S. Fields showed that Richard was still experiencing weakness in his extremities and on the left side of his face. He also had blurred vision through his left eye. A <a href="Computed%20tomography">CAT scan</a> of Richard's brain later showed that Richard had experienced three separate strokes from the different obstructions in his arterial system. Furthermore, the arteries in his right arm were still obstructed. Later examinations showed that Richard was suffering from extensive <a href="thoracic%20outlet%20syndrome">arterial thoracic outlet syndrome</a>. While pitching, his <a href="clavicle">clavicle</a> and first <a href="rib">rib</a> pinched his <a href="subclavian%20artery">subclavian artery</a>. As a result of this problem, Richard would feel normal for the first few innings of the game but after putting repeated pressure on his subclavian artery, his arm would start to ache in pain and eventually start to feel "heavy". His wife at the time, Carolyn, told reporters, "It took death, or nearly death, to get an apology. They should have believed him."

Richard underwent rehabilitation and missed the rest of the season. Meanwhile, the Astros recovered from the loss of one of their staff aces and qualified for the <a href="1980%20National%20League%20Championship%20Series">playoffs</a> for the first time in the club's 18-year history.

In 1981, Richard underwent a rehabilitation program with the aim of recovering from the effects of the stroke. He trained with the Astros and the <a href="Texas%20Southern%20University">Texas Southern University</a> team, participating regularly in pitching and batting practice with both towards the end of the baseball season. After pitching in a few simulated games, Richard was placed on the 40-man <a href="Major%20League%20Baseball%20rosters">active roster</a> on September 1, 1981. Astros manager <a href="Bill%20Virdon">Bill Virdon</a> thought Richard was not ready to return, so Richard did not pitch with the team during the last two months of the season.

The following year, Richard pitched in a single <a href="spring%20training">spring training</a> game and then went into extended spring training in <a href="Sarasota%2C%20Florida">Sarasota, Florida</a>, during the first two months of the season. There he registered three wins and two losses and a 3.38 ERA in seven starts with thirty-two total innings. Afterwards, he joined the major league rehabilitation program with the Daytona Beach Astros of the Florida State League. In his six starts, Richard notched three wins, two complete games and posted a 2.79 ERA. He was then promoted to Triple-A baseball with the <a href="Tucson%20Toros">Tucson Toros</a> of the <a href="Pacific%20Coast%20League">Pacific Coast League</a>. He struggled to control the ball, conceding a high number of runs to opposing teams. He took a loss on August 12 against the <a href="Phoenix%20Giants">Phoenix Giants</a> and on August 27 against the <a href="Salt%20Lake%20City%20Gulls">Salt Lake City Gulls</a> in a 13–0 rout. His longest outing as a starter—more than five innings—was an appearance against the Giants in the last game of the season on September 1. He then joined the Astros' extended roster but did not play in any games.

In 1983, Richard started to complain of pain in his left calf. The synthetic graft inserted in his July 1980 surgery had closed off, which meant that he needed a <a href="Coronary%20artery%20bypass%20surgery">surgical bypass</a> in his left leg. Richard was granted free agency by the Astros on November 7, 1983, but the Astros still had faith in him, so he was re-signed on February 17 of the following year. Just a little over two months later, he was released by the Astros, thus ending his baseball career. Despite an almost complete recovery, the risk of future complications was so great that he never pitched again. His final major league record was 107–71, with 1,493 strikeouts and a 3.15 ERA in 238 games and 1,606 innings. Nolan Ryan broke his Astros record for career strikeouts in 1987.

After his professional baseball career ended, Richard returned to Louisiana and invested in some business ventures. He fell prey to an oil business scam, losing over $300,000 in the deal. A few years later, Richard paid $669,000 in a divorce settlement to ex-wife Carolyn. He married and divorced again, losing his suburban Houston home and most of his money. In 1989, Richard was drafted into the <a href="Senior%20Professional%20Baseball%20Association">Senior Professional Baseball Association</a> and played for the <a href="Orlando%20Juice">Orlando Juice</a> but was cut from the team in preseason play. In the winter of 1994, Richard was homeless and destitute and lived under a highway overpass in Houston.

By 1995, Richard was eligible for his pension from Major League Baseball. He played in the <a href="Old-Timers%27%20Day">Old-Timers' Day</a> game with the Astros in the same year. In the following months, after spending many nights under the overpass Highway 59 at Beechnut Road in Houston, he turned to the Now Testament Church and sought help from its minister, Reverend Floyd Lewis. Richard overcame his homelessness by working with this minister, with a belief that he "always knew God was on his side". Richard started working at an asphalt company and later returned to the church as a minister.

Richard became involved in the Houston community, working with local financial donors to help establish baseball programs for children. A small-budget 2005 movie, "Resurrection: The J. R. Richard Story", depicted Richard's baseball career as well as his life after baseball. Along with former major leaguers <a href="Dick%20Allen">Dick Allen</a>, <a href="Jim%20Grant%20%28baseball%29">Jim Grant</a>, <a href="Kenny%20Lofton">Kenny Lofton</a>, and <a href="Eddie%20Murray">Eddie Murray</a>, Richard was honored by the <a href="Negro%20Leagues%20Baseball%20Museum">Negro Leagues Baseball Museum</a> as a 2018 member of the "Hall of Game."

Delrina

Delrina was a Canadian <a href="Computer%20software">software</a> company, which was founded in 1988 and was subsequently acquired by the American software firm <a href="Symantec">Symantec</a> in 1995. The company sold <a href="Form%20%28document%29">electronic form</a> products, including <a href="PerForm">PerForm</a> and <a href="FormFlow">FormFlow</a>, but was best known for its <a href="WinFax">WinFax</a> software package, which enabled computers equipped with <a href="fax%20modem">fax modem</a>s to transmit copies of documents to standalone <a href="fax%20machine">fax machine</a>s or other similarly equipped computers.

Delrina also produced a set of <a href="screensaver">screensaver</a>s, including one that resulted in a well-publicized lawsuit for <a href="copyright">copyright</a> and <a href="trademark%20infringement">trademark infringement</a> ("<a href="Berkeley%20Systems">Berkeley Systems Inc.</a> v. Delrina"). The case set a <a href="precedent">precedent</a> in American law whereby <a href="satire">satiric</a> commercial software products are not subject to the same <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> exemptions as <a href="parody">parodic</a> cartoons or literature.

It also sold online communications software with its <a href="WinComm">WinComm</a> product and produced a Web browser called <a href="Cyberjack">Cyberjack</a>. The firm was sold to <a href="Symantec">Symantec</a> in 1995. After the company was acquired by Symantec, various divisions were sold off and several of Delrina's former executives went on to found <a href="venture%20capital">venture capital</a> firms.

Delrina was founded in <a href="Toronto">Toronto</a> in 1988 by <a href="Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>an expatriate <a href="Bert%20Amato">Bert Amato</a>, South African expatriates <a href="Mark%20Skapinker">Mark Skapinker</a> and <a href="Dennis%20Bennie">Dennis Bennie</a> and American <a href="Lou%20Ryan">Lou Ryan</a>. Delrina was Bennie's third major entrepreneurial start up after co-founding <a href="International%20Audio%20Group">Mission Electronics</a>, a high-end home entertainment equipment producer, and Aviva Software, which became <a href="Ingram%20Micro">Ingram Micro Canada</a>. Delrina's business strategy was to "establish technical and market leadership in niche markets", which it accomplished with its electronic form and PC-based fax software. A year before the firm was incorporated, Amato and Skapinker had quit their jobs to start work on an electronic forms product which would eventually become <a href="PerForm">PerForm</a>. Both would later meet with Bennie, who was then the co-founder and CEO of <a href="Ingram%20Micro">Ingram Micro Canada</a> before becoming CEO of Carolian Systems International, a firm that made business software for <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>. Bennie facilitated an initial seed investment of $1.5 million CAD to finance a new start-up company, "Delrina", to develop this idea. In return, Carolian received 51% of Delrina's shares, <a href="Dennis%20Bennie">Dennis Bennie</a> would become Chairman and CEO, <a href="Mark%20Skapinker">Mark Skapinker</a> President, and <a href="Bert%20Amato">Bert Amato</a> CTO of newly formed Delrina Technology Inc.

Delrina's initial corporate headquarters was located in a small office on Mount Pleasant St in Toronto. A sales office was set up in <a href="San%20Jose%2C%20California">San Jose, California</a> which became its worldwide sales center run by co-founder Lou Ryan. From its Toronto headquarters, the company expanded by establishing branch offices in <a href="Kirkland%2C%20Washington">Kirkland, Washington</a>; <a href="Washington%2C%20DC">Washington, DC</a>; and <a href="Lexington%2C%20Massachusetts">Lexington, Massachusetts</a>. Other offices were later established in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany.

Delrina's initial product offering was an electronic forms application called <a href="PerForm">PerForm</a>. Amato and Skapinker came up with the idea for the product while working as consultants that what their clients wanted was a way to fill in forms electronically, rather than an easier way to create paper-based forms from a computer. There was significant and long-term uptake of electronic forms products within governmental agencies both in Canada and the United States, the latter spurred on in particular by the requirements of the <a href="Paperwork%20Reduction%20Act">Paperwork Reduction Act</a> to reduce the total amount of paperwork handled by the United States government. One of the firm's early major software deals included a multi-year agreement to sell PerForm to the U.S. Navy in 1990. Soon after the software was installed on <a href="Compaq">Compaq</a> <a href="laptops">laptops</a> that accompanied U.S. troops during the <a href="First%20Gulf%20War">First Gulf War</a>, where it was used to requisition "everything from <a href="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> to <a href="Outhouse">privies</a>". Other significant volume sales went to <a href="3M">3M</a> and <a href="Rockwell%20International">Rockwell International</a>. What helped set apart Delrina's electronic forms from its competitors in product reviews included its easy-to-use interface, its extensive development tools, and its comparatively low price. It also scored highly when it came to workflow and routing functions as well as security features. In early 1991 <a href="InfoWorld">InfoWorld</a> selected PerForm Pro
as its "Product of the Year" in the electronic forms
category, and <a href="PC%20World%20Magazine">PC World Magazine</a> gave the product it's "Best Buy" designation. PerForm proved to be successful in its niche, effectively capturing the retail market by 1993.

In the early 1990s Delrina made deals with <a href="value-added%20resellers">value-added resellers</a> like <a href="NCR%20Corporation">NCR</a> and <a href="General%20Electric">GE Information Services</a> who had the staff to customize the product to the needs of corporate customers looking to move away from paper-based forms. The forms products sold well and the annual revenues for the firm grew steadily; 1989 annual revenues (in <a href="Canadian%20dollars">Canadian dollars</a>) were $5,630,393, in 1990 they were $8,759,623, and by 1991 they were $11,894,474.

Despite the growing revenues, the company struggled to make a profit. Heavy expenditures—primarily marketing along with research and development costs—drove the firm's losses from $500,000 from 1989 to $1.5 million by the end of the following fiscal year. For fiscal 1991 it posted a net loss of $1.7 million.

Needing an infusion of funds, in April 1991 Bennie managed to raise $7.7 million in a <a href="private%20placement">private placement</a>.

The firm subsequently sought to find ways to more widely distribute its electronic form software, with Bennie saying in May 1992 that "we've barely scratched the surface of our market".

In early 1992 word leaked to the press on a possible merger between <a href="MicroPro%20International">WordStar International Inc.</a>, and soon after both firms made public the fact that they had signed a letter of intent on a merger deal. However, just over a month later word came out that the merger talks had fallen through, at the time cited to differences over "complex legal, accounting and management issues". WordStar, whose share of the <a href="word%20processing">word processing</a> market had by that time fallen to 5% (from a high of 80%) was seeking Delrina's advanced technologies while Delrina was hoping to utilize the other firm's established global sales network. Despite the failure of the merger talks, Bennie said soon after that "we're still convinced that a larger sales force would give us the kind of marketing clout we need. I still believe that it's possible for us to become a global operation". Not long after WordStar merged with <a href="Spinnaker%20Software">Spinnaker Software Corporation</a> and SoftKey Software Products Inc. to form <a href="SoftKey">SoftKey International</a>. Delrina subsequently signed deals with Wallace Computer Services, UARCO and <a href="NCR%20Corporation">NCR Corporation</a> in an effort to gain greater sales distribution of its products.

In a deliberate attempt to diversify the business, The Company chose to move into the fax software market with its <a href="WinFax">WinFax</a> product. Software developer Tony Davis (another South African expatriate who had moved to Canada) was initially hired as a consultant to work on the forms line of products in the late 1980s, soon afterwards becoming part of that team. In his spare time he developed a prototype of what would become the first WinFax product, with the agreement that Delrina would be its publisher. In 1990 Delrina devoted a relatively small space to this new product at that year's <a href="COMDEX">COMDEX</a> (a computer trade show), under a sign that said simply: "Send a Fax from Your PC". It garnered the most attention of any Delrina product being demonstrated at that show. This interest convinced the founding partners of the commercial viability of the product. Tony Davis went on to sell his product idea to Delrina, and stayed on as its lead software architect and designer.

The initial version of WinFax only worked on fax modems containing a specific chipset, and was only capable of sending faxes; it could not receive them. This was remedied with the launch of the WinFax PRO 2.0 product during the summer of 1991. One of the key factors that differentiated this version of WinFax from other fax software packages of the time was the deliberate attempt to make the program compatible with all fax/modems. Prior to the introduction of WinFax PRO 2.0, competitors concentrated primarily on building software that would only work with a single brand of fax/modem hardware. At the same time that it launched its WinFax PRO 2.0 product, Delrina also announced an <a href="OEM">OEM</a> version of the same product designed to be bundled with new fax/modems. Within a few months, eight modem manufacturers had agreed to bundle this <a href="OEM">OEM</a> version (called "WinFax LITE") of the program along with their own product. By the summer of the following year this number had grown to 50 <a href="OEM">OEM</a> partnerships with various fax-modem and computer system manufacturers to bundle the "LITE" version of Delrina's WinFax software with their own products. By February 1993 this number had grown to over 100 <a href="OEM">OEM</a> partnerships.

Bundling the LITE version of WinFax proved to be lucrative for Delrina. Whenever a person used the program for the first time and submitted their registration information by fax to the company, Delrina would subsequently mail the user an upgrade offer for the PRO version. This sales technique proved to be very effective, and the firm ended up making most of its sales from these upgrades.

In order to reach Apple computer users in this marketplace Delrina acquired Solutions Inc. and their BackFax software for the <a href="Apple%20Macintosh">Macintosh</a> platform in December 1991, which would become "Delrina Fax Pro". A version of the program was also designed for use in <a href="DOS">DOS</a> ("DosFax PRO") which was launched in June 1992.

Initially looking for ways to further improve its electronic forms software, in November 1991 Delrina had attempted to buy two associated firms that produced <a href="Optical%20Character%20Recognition">Optical Character Recognition</a> (OCR) software, with the intention of incorporating OCR functionality into its forms products. The acquisition deal fell through, though by Fall 1992 Delrina had made a deal with <a href="Nuance%20Communications">Caere Corporation</a> to include its AnyFax OCR software within its products. This functionality was incorporated into WinFax PRO 3.0 in late 1992, and subsequently in FormFlow Despite the agreement with Caere, the subsequent version of WinFax used <a href="Xerox">Xerox</a>'s TextBridge OCR engine instead.

Based on strong sales of WinFax, by October 1992 Delrina posted its first profitable quarter in three years. At the same time, the firm also announced its intention to acquire other software firms that sold into the consumer software market.

In October 1992 Delrina acquired <a href="Amaze%20Inc.">Amaze Inc.</a>, based out of Kirkland, Washington. The firm created daily planner software, providing time management features while providing some humour by featuring licensed cartoon strips like <a href="Cathy%20%28comic%20strip%29">Cathy</a>, <a href="Bloom%20County">Bloom County</a>, <a href="B.C.%20%28comic%29">B.C.</a> and <a href="The%20Far%20Side">The Far Side</a>. The firm became a wholly owned subsidiary of Delrina in a deal which also paid down Amaze's $3 million (U.S.) debt and placed two of the firm's directors on Delrina's board. These two individuals were <a href="Rowland%20Hanson">Rowland Hanson</a>, former VP Corporate Communications for Microsoft and George Clut.

One of Delrina's <a href="screensaver">screensaver</a> products was based on the licensed <a href="Bloom%20County">Bloom County</a> characters <a href="Opus%20the%20Penguin">Opus the Penguin</a> and <a href="Bill%20the%20Cat">Bill the Cat</a>. The initial "Opus 'n Bill" screensaver, launched in 1993, landed the company in court as its "Death Toasters" module depicted Opus taking shots at a number of flying toasters, a well-known emblem in Berkeley System's "Flying Toasters" module from their <a href="After%20Dark%20%28software%29">After Dark</a> screensaver.
Berkeley Systems sued for <a href="copyright">copyright</a> and <a href="trademark">trademark</a> infringement. The following court case of "Berkeley Systems Inc. v. Delrina" was fought by Delrina on the basis that a software-based parody should fall under the same <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> protection offered to the press.

A preliminary injunction was filed against Delrina in September 1993 which halted the sale of the product, and subsequently forced a recall of it through the court. The case drew political satirist <a href="Mark%20Russell">Mark Russell</a> to speak in defense of Delrina, who argued in favour of the screensaver as a valid parody, while the estate of composer <a href="Irving%20Berlin">Irving Berlin</a> sided with Berkeley. Commenting on the case involving his characters, cartoonist <a href="Berkeley%20Breathed">Berkeley Breathed</a> said: "If <a href="David%20Letterman">David Letterman</a> can depict the <a href="NBC%20logos">NBC peacock</a> wearing men's boxer shorts, then Delrina should be able to plug a flying toaster with hot lead".

Judge <a href="Eugene%20F.%20Lynch">Eugene Lynch</a> found in favour of Berkeley, citing that a commercial software product was not subject to the same exemptions as parodist literature, and that the toasters were too similar in design. The total cost of the court case and the recalled product was roughly $150,000 U.S.

In the court case, it was also cited that the design for winged toasters was not original and that the Berkeley Systems' design was itself derived from the <a href="Jefferson%20Airplane">Jefferson Airplane</a> album "<a href="Thirty%20Seconds%20Over%20Winterland">Thirty Seconds Over Winterland</a>", which also used flying toasters adorned with wings. Berkeley argued that the firm was unaware of the previous artwork until 1991, and that the album cover's toasters had clocks in addition to their wings. Jefferson Airplane later sued Berkeley Systems in turn for the use of the same flying toaster emblem. The rock group lost the case as they did not trademark the album cover at the time of publication.

The court decision was interpreted by the writer L. Ray Patterson as an erosion of <a href="First%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">First Amendment</a> rights over the increasing protection provided to copyright holders.

While Delrina lost the court case, the publicity it generated was substantial, with coverage in over a thousand newspapers across North America, resulting in consumers turning out in droves to buy the offending program before it could be recalled.

Delrina subsequently removed the wings from the toasters and replaced them with propellers in order to avoid trademark infringement. The module was also renamed from "Death Toasters" to "Censored Toaster Module". Thanks to the publicity from the court case, sales of this new version ended up being triple what had been expected. Updated modules for this particular screensaver were sold for the next couple of years.

Josef Zankowicz, who managed the firm's publicity during this period, later commented: "We had the feeling that we might get sued—actually, we prayed to get sued. Because by suing us, the number one player in the marketplace opened up the door. Anyone can create an interesting product, spend $10 million and create awareness of it. But it's another thing to create a product and spend one-tenth that amount and create twice as much awareness."

This division of the firm at its height only represented less than 15% of the company's total revenues.

The increasing sales of the WinFax product lead to significant growth in revenues for the firm; by 1992 its sales had climbed to $19,208,420, and more than doubling the next year to $48,583,932. The product soon overtook that of the initial forms product in terms of revenues, and within a few years of its launch, WinFax would account for 80% of the company's revenues. By 1994 the firm had sold more than 3 million copies of WinFax, and it regularly featured in the "Top 10" lists of software applications sold during this period.

The rapid growth in sales of this product was unexpected, with Bennie quoted in an interview from late 1993 as saying "the success of WinFax really caught us by surprise". With the success of the WinFax product, the company grew rapidly. By early 1993 the number of employees had grown to 250, and by the end of the year to 350. The increasing success of the WinFax product consequently led to significant strains on the firm to handle the increasing volume of calls to its Technical Support department, as each of the over 300 modems on the market at the time had their own nuances in how they implemented the fax data standard. Delrina spent roughly $800,000 in an improved telephone infrastructure in an attempt to get wait times to under five minutes. In December 1993 Delrina hired 40 additional people to help alleviate the growing number of calls to the firm for technical support. By the end of 1994 the situation had improved to the point where noted industry commentator <a href="Robert%20X.%20Cringely">Robert X. Cringely</a> put Delrina in his shortlist of firms providing "exceptional" product support.

In order to further enhance the appeal of its new flagship product, in 1993 the firm established a Communication Services division, designed to tap into the commercial market. The firm started making deals with major <a href="telecommunication">telecommunication</a> companies, such as <a href="BellSouth">BellSouth</a> and <a href="MCI%20Inc.">MCI Inc.</a> in preparation for the services the firm was about to offer. In November of that year the division launched its Fax Broadcast service. The Fax Broadcast service allowed subscribers to upload a single fax and a recipient list to Delrina. Systems at Delrina would then send out the fax to the recipients on that list, to a maximum of 500 fax numbers. A subsequent Fax Mailbox feature—which enabled subscribers to remotely access both fax and voice messages from a single phone number—was initially held up following a dispute with <a href="AlphaNet%20Telecom">AlphaNet Telecom</a> for the rights to the technology. This dispute was resolved by June 1994, though with both sides publicly disputing the story of the other, and with AlphaNet receiving an undisclosed sum in compensation.

By late 1994 the firm was considered one of the fastest-growing software companies in North America, and employed over 500 people, most located at its offices in Toronto. The firm's financial situation improved greatly, and by February 1995 Delrina was reported to have captured almost three-quarters of the fax software market, was debt-free and had $40 million in the bank. The firm was shipping 200,000 units of WinFax a month, and had an installed base of four million users. The cost of doing business had also improved, as the firm's <a href="cost%20of%20sales">cost of sales</a> was now 25% of net sales, down from 30% the previous fiscal year, improving the firm's <a href="gross%20profit">gross profit</a>s.

In November 1992 Skapinker met <a href="Bill%20Gates">Bill Gates</a> at a <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>-sponsored dinner where he asked whether there were any plans to include any fax functionality in their forthcoming operating system (which could become <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a>). Gates replied that there were plans to include "<a href="Microsoft%20Fax">base-level fax capability</a>" in the next version of Windows, and suggested that Skapinker get in touch with his development staff in order to produce a value-added product for it.

The firm decided to work on a suite of applications designed to be an enhancement on what was to be available in <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a>. In response to a question about Windows 95, Bennie responded by saying: "We are quite convinced that on top of Windows 95, we can build four different applications and will encompass fax, data, telephony or digital voice, and Internet access". This would later become the <a href="CommSuite%2095">CommSuite 95</a> product.

In 1994 the firm acquired <a href="AudioFile%20%28company%29">AudioFile</a>, a company that specialized in computer-based voice technology. The company created a product called <a href="TalkWorks">TalkWorks</a>, which enabled users to use certain fax/modems as a <a href="voice%20mail">voice mail</a> client.

Seeing a growing business in online communications utilities, Delrina licensed <a href="Hilgraeve">Hilgraeve</a>'s <a href="HyperACCESS">HyperACCESS</a> <a href="terminal%20emulator">terminal emulator</a> system in 1993, and used it as the basis for the initial version of its <a href="WinComm">WinComm</a> online communications software. The initial version of the product was originally bundled with WinFax as part of the Delrina Communications Suite, but in March 1994 was issued as a standalone product. It was a relative latecomer to the market, which was then dominated at the time by <a href="Datastorm%20Technologies%2C%20Inc.">Datastorm</a>'s <a href="Procomm">Procomm</a> series of communications software.

Delrina tried to expand aggressively into this market space, first by acquiring the Canadian online bulletin board service <a href="Canada%20Remote%20Systems">CRS Online</a>, and then using it as a distribution channel for free versions of its WinComm LITE and DOS-based FreeComm products in March 1995.

When the Internet was opened to commercial interests in the mid-1990s, Delrina started to expand in this nascent market space with their <a href="Cyberjack">Cyberjack 7.0</a> product, launched in December 1995. Created by a development team based in South Africa, it included a <a href="Web%20browser">Web browser</a>, <a href="Usenet">Usenet</a> news reader, <a href="ftp">ftp</a> client, <a href="Internet%20Relay%20Chat">IRC</a> and integration with the Microsoft Exchange email program. The program used an interesting variant of the now-common bookmark, using a "Guidebook" to store information for various Internet addresses.

<a href="CommSuite%2095">CommSuite 95</a> shipped later that same month, bundling WinFax PRO 7.0 along with WinComm PRO 7.0, TalkWorks and the Cyberjack suite of Internet components.

With the release of Windows 95 in August 1995, Delrina was now competing directly against Microsoft in the fax/electronic communications marketplace, as Windows 95 included a basic faxing application as an accessory, along with a licensed version of <a href="Hilgraeve">Hilgraeve</a>'s <a href="HyperACCESS">HyperTerminal</a> communication package, (which was also used as the basis for Delrina's own WinComm program). While these applications offered only rudimentary fax and online communication services in comparison to the mature Delrina products, Microsoft was perceived as a potentially serious future competitor in the communications market space. The release of the initial version of Microsoft's <a href="Internet%20Explorer">Internet Explorer</a> in late 1995 as a free product effectively killed off the early emerging market for non-free browsers, creating a market where Delrina's Cyberjack browser could not hope to compete.

In late Spring of 1995, Delrina Chairman Dennis Bennie met with Symantec CEO <a href="Gordon%20Eubanks">Gordon Eubanks</a> to discuss the possibility of merging the two firms. In September 1995 Delrina's founders—who owned a controlling interest in the firm—sold the firm to <a href="Symantec">Symantec</a> in a stock deal worth $415 million US. The deal was first announced on July 6 of that year, with shareholders from both firms approving the merger on November 20. The merger was completed on November 22, 1995 and Delrina officially became part of Symantec. The deal made the merged company the fifth largest American software firm at the time. The firm became the "Delrina Group" within Symantec, which brought under its control other communication software products that belonged to the parent firm, such as <a href="pcAnywhere">pcAnywhere</a>. Bennie joined the Board of Symantec and was also appointed an Executive Vice President.

At its height the company employed more than 700 people worldwide, the majority based in Canada. Symantec was following a general trend of large American firms buying smaller Canadian software companies. Other contemporaneous examples include <a href="Softimage">Softimage</a> and <a href="Zoom-it">Zoom-it</a> being bought by Microsoft, and <a href="Alias%20Systems%20Corporation">Alias</a> being bought by <a href="Silicon%20Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a>.

Parts of the company were subsequently sold off, such as the sale of Delrina's Electronic Forms Division to <a href="JetForm">JetForm</a> in September 1996. JetForm, which later changed its name to Accelio, was in turn bought by <a href="Adobe%20Systems">Adobe Systems</a>. Adobe officially discontinued the electronic forms products in 2004. <a href="Creative%20Wonders">Creative Wonders</a> bought the rights to the Echo Lake multimedia product, which was re-shaped as an introductory program on multimedia and re-released as <a href="Family%20Album%20Creator">Family Album Creator</a>.

Though the market for fax software would shrink significantly as the use of email became more pervasive, WinFax brought in significant revenue for Symantec; a year after the merger sales of fax software accounted for 10% of Symantec's revenues.

Delrina was a catalyst for entrepreneurial talent and greatness, as many of the principals and employees of Delrina went on to find new successful ventures. With investments from Skapinker and Amato, and Bennie as lead Director, Davis went on to form <a href="Lanacom">Lanacom</a>, which developed an early Internet "push content" product. This firm and its technology were sold just over a year after its inception to Backweb, a NASDAQ listed software company; Davis remained president and Bennie was brought on as Director.

Skapinker and Davis then went on to found <a href="Brightspark">Brightspark</a>, a software venture capital firm. Brightspark Ventures raised a number of VC Funds from Canadian Financial institutions raising $60m in 1999 and $55m in 2004. Brightspark employed a number of ex-Delrina employees including Allen Lau, Eva Lau, Sandy Pearlman, Marg Vaillancourt. Brightspark Ventures has twice won the Canadian Venture Capital Association "Deal of the Year Award", for the sale of ThinkDynamics to IBM and for the sale of Radian6 to Salesforce.com.

Bennie would move on to found XDL Capital, a company which manages venture capital funds. XDL Capital—appropriately named after "Ex Delrina"—raised money for two funds: XDL Ventures (XDL), raising $25 million in 1997, and XDL Intervest (XDLI), raising $155 million in 1999. David Latner, former legal counsel for Delrina, was a partner in both funds, and Amato (former partner, Delrina) was an advisor and major investor to XDL Capital. He also participated in several investee companies as a Director and/or Advisor.

XDL Intervest focuses primarily on internet-specific entrepreneurial companies and Bennie brought in two new principals: Tony Van Marken, former CEO of Architel Systems Corp. (ASYC), and Michael Bregman, former CEO of Second Cup Ltd. (T.SKL). XDL has assembled an established board and advisory team, which includes Canadian billionaire Robert Young, a native of Hamilton, Ontario, who co-founded Red Hat Inc (RHAT) and remains its chairman. Several of XDL's venture investments were in companies started or run by ex-Delrina employees who founded successful businesses, fostered by the innovative and entrepreneurial environment of Delrina. A few of the successes today are listed below:

Delano Founded by <a href="Bahman%20Koohestani">Bahman Koohestani</a>, another early developer at Delrina, was a company which developed e-business solutions for corporations. XDL Capital provided seed capital prior to Delano listing publicly. Bennie was the Chairman. Delano was listed on NASDAQ (DTEC) was subsequently sold to <a href="Divine%20%28corporation%29">divine</a> in 2003.

Pinpoint Software Corporation a supplier of software solutions for managing networked PCs, was founded in 1992 by Lou Ryan. Ryan was CEO & President with Bennie acting as director. Pinpoint was partially funded by XDL Capital. Pinpoint changed its name to ClickNet Software in 1998. Uniting the company name with the successful ClickNet product family name strengthens the product and corporate identity. The company was eventually renamed Entercept Security Technologies Inc. In 2004, Entercept was sold to Network Associates for $120M where they incorporated Entercept's technology into its McAfee line of antivirus protection and other security products.

Protégé Software was formed in 1996 and was founded by Larry Levy, Delrina's European Managing Director. Levy acted as President and CEO with Bennie as the principal investor. The company raised a $120M round of finance with XDL Intervest participating in 2003. Protégé has successfully launched 20 U.S. companies in Europe, nine of which are among Red Herring Top 50 Private Companies. In addition, five of these companies have gone public during Protégé's tenure with them. The company was ultimately sold to various buyers including <a href="Warburg%20Pincus">Warburg Pincus</a> after the internet bubble burst.

Netect Ltd., an XDL financed venture developing network security software, was purchased by Bindview Development Corporation (NASDAQ:BVEW) in 2001. Marc Camm (Ex Delrina GM Desktop Communications Business Unit) was brought on by Bennie to manage Netect. After the Company was purchased, Camm joined Bindview as the E.V.P. of Marketing. Prior to joining Netect, Marc was the general manager of Symantec and systems group product manager for <a href="Microsoft%20Canada">Microsoft Canada</a>.

Within a few years all of Delrina's major market focuses—fax and form software—would be overtaken or superseded by email, e-commerce and the Internet. Daily planning software remains a niche market, and the immersive 3D environment used for creating multimedia presentations has (so far) fallen by the wayside in favour of more traditional user interfaces. Symantec ended support for its final WinFax PRO product in June 2006.

Delrina is best remembered by its former employees as an incubator for ideas and for providing industry experience to the many people who would go on to work at subsequent software and hardware companies, many in the Toronto region. A forum exists on <a href="Yahoo">Yahoo</a> called "xdelrina", where many former employees of the firm continue to keep in contact with each other.

The company's first product was PerForm, an electronic forms software package. PerForm and its sibling product, FormFlow, (which was aimed at workgroup and enterprise-level electronic forms processing and delivery) became one of the best selling products in its market. Delrina competed against <a href="WordPerfect">WordPerfect</a>'s <a href="Informs">Informs</a> package, <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s Electronic Forms Designer, <a href="Novell">Novell</a>'s Informs, <a href="Lotus%20Software">Lotus Software</a>'s <a href="Lotus%20Forms">Forms</a> and <a href="JetForm">JetForm</a>'s JetForm Workflow software.

PerForm and FormFlow were designed to allow users to create self-contained form applications which could be passed back and forth across a network. Both PerForm and FormFlow consisted of two distinct parts: "Designer", which created the form application, and "Filler", so users could submit the forms either by fax or, later, e-mail. The program could ease repetitive fill tasks, include mandatory fields, and use an <a href="input%20mask">input mask</a> to accept only data entered in a valid format. The information could be saved and restored in a <a href="dBase">dBase</a> file that used a <a href="Public-key">Public-key</a> cryptography system to encrypt the data running from client to server.

The initial version of PerForm was designed for the <a href="Graphics%20Environment%20Manager">Graphics Environment Manager</a> (better known as "GEM"), a DOS-based windowing system. Later versions of this program, known as PerForm PRO, were designed to work under <a href="Windows%203.1">Windows 3.1</a> and subsequent Windows <a href="operating%20system">operating system</a>s. PerForm PRO 3.0 included integration with Delrina's own WinFax software, and included a range of automation tools.

As PerForm captured the retail market, it became apparent that there was a need for electronics forms delivery and processing at the workgroup and enterprise levels. In 1994 Delrina FormFlow was released, which was designed to meet this need. One of the key features of FormFlow 1.1 was forms integration with email, and its Filler module was available for DOS, Windows and <a href="Unix">Unix</a>.

WinFax enabled computers equipped with fax-modems to send faxes directly to stand-alone fax machines or other similarly equipped computers.

Several versions of the WinFax product were released over the next few years, initially for <a href="Windows%203.1x">Windows 3.x</a> and then a Windows 95-based version. WinFax PRO 2.0 for Windows was released in July 1991. The Windows versions were also localized to major European and Asian languages. The company made further in-roads by establishing tie-ins with modem manufacturers such as <a href="U.S.%20Robotics">U.S. Robotics</a> and <a href="Supra%2C%20Inc.">Supra</a> that bundled simple versions of the product (called "WinFax LITE") that offered basic functionality. Those wanting more robust features were encouraged to upgrade to the "PRO" version, and were offered significant discounts over the standalone retail version. All of this rapidly established WinFax as the de facto fax software. By 1994 almost one hundred companies were bundling versions of WinFax in with their own product, including <a href="IBM">IBM</a>, <a href="Compaq">Compaq</a>, <a href="AST%20Research%2C%20Inc.">AST Research</a>, <a href="Gateway%202000">Gateway 2000</a>, <a href="Intel">Intel</a> and <a href="Hewlett-Packard">Hewlett-Packard</a>.

WinFax PRO 3.0 was launched in late 1992 for Windows 3.x machines. This was followed by a version for Macintosh systems. The "Lite" version of WinFax 3.0 was bundled as <a href="OEM">OEM</a> software by a number of fax-modem manufacturers, which was later be superseded by WinFax Lite 4.0 a couple of years later.

The release of WinFax PRO 4.0 in March 1994 brought together a number of key features and technologies. It introduced an improved <a href="Optical%20character%20recognition">OCR</a> engine, introduced improvements aimed specifically at mobile fax users, better on-screen fax viewing capabilities and a focus on consistency and usability of the interface. It also included for the first time the ability to integrate directly with popular new email products such as and <a href="Microsoft%20Mail">Microsoft Mail</a>. It was preceded by a Workgroup version of the same product, which allowed a number of users to share a single fax modem on a networked system. The stand-alone version of the product was also later bundled with a grayscale scanner, and sold as WinFax Scanner.

The final Delrina-branded version of WinFax was WinFax PRO 7.0, which shipped in late 1995, the subsequent version 8.0 being a Symantec product. There was no intervening version 5.0 or 6.0, and the jump to version 7.0 was purely a marketing decision, based on keeping up with the suite of products in <a href="Microsoft%20Office">Microsoft Office</a> which were then at the same number. It also reflected the development effort required to develop the first full <a href="32-bit%20application">32-bit application</a> version, designed to work with the <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> operating system, which set it apart from its competition at the time.

By the time WinFax PRO 7.0 was being sold from retail shelves, Delrina had been acquired by Symantec.

Screensavers were designed to ensure that there would be no phosphor burn-in of images left on a <a href="Cathode%20ray%20tube">CRT</a>-based screen. Delrina added sound and basic interactivity with its series of screensaver products, arguably qualifying it as an early form of multimedia.

Under Delrina several of the already-licensed cartoons brought over from their acquisition of Amaze Inc. were further developed into screensaver applications. The "Opus 'n Bill Brain Saver", which would land the company in court for copyright violations, was launched in 1993. Subsequent screensavers include a licensed version based on the first <a href="The%20Flintstones">Flintstone</a> live-action movie, and "The Scott Adams <a href="Dilbert">Dilbert</a> Screen Saver Collection" which came out in September 1994.

A notable multimedia software program produced by Delrina was <a href="Echo%20Lake%20%28software%29">Echo Lake</a>, an early form of scrapbook software that came out in June 1995. During development it was touted internally as a "cross [of] <a href="Quark%20Xpress">Quark Xpress</a> and <a href="Myst">Myst</a>". It featured an immersive 3D environment where a user could manipulate objects within a virtual desktop in a virtual office and assemble video and audio clips along with images, and then send them as either a virtual book other users of the program could then access, or its content could be printed. It was an innovative product for its time, and ultimately was hampered by the inability of many users to easily input or playback their own multimedia content into a computer from that period.

Phantasmagoria (video game)

Phantasmagoria is a <a href="Graphic%20adventure%20game">point-and-click adventure</a> horror video game designed by <a href="Roberta%20Williams">Roberta Williams</a> for <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a> and <a href="Microsoft%20Windows">Microsoft Windows</a> and released by <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra On-Line</a> on August 24, 1995. It tells the story of Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell), a writer who moves into a remote mansion and finds herself terrorized by supernatural forces. It was made at the peak of popularity for <a href="interactive%20movie">interactive movie</a> games and features live-action actors and footage, both during cinematic scenes and within the three-dimensionally rendered environments of the game itself. It was noted for its violence and sexual content.

Williams had long planned to design a horror game, but she waited eight years for software technology to improve before doing so. More than 200 people were involved in making "Phantasmagoria", which was based on Williams' 550-page script, about four times the length of an average Hollywood screenplay. It took more than two years to develop and four months to film. The game was originally budgeted for $800,000, but it ultimately cost $4.5 million to develop and was filmed in a $1.5 million studio that Sierra built specifically for the game.

The game was directed by <a href="Peter%20Maris">Peter Maris</a> and features a cast of twenty-five actors, all performing in front of a <a href="Chroma%20key">blue screen</a>. Most games at the time featured 80 to 100 backgrounds, while "Phantasmagoria" includes more than 1,000. A professional Hollywood special effects house worked on the game, and the musical score includes a neo-<a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a> performed by a 135-voice choir. Sierra stressed that it was intended for adult audiences, and the company willingly submitted it to a ratings system and included a password-protected censoring option within the game to tone down the graphic content.

"Phantasmagoria" was released on seven discs after multiple delays, but it was a financial success, grossing $12,000,000 in its opening week-end and becoming one of the best-selling games of 1995. Sierra strongly promoted the game. It received mixed reviews, earning praise for its graphics and suspenseful tone while being criticized for its slow pacing and easy puzzles. The game also drew controversy, particularly due to a rape scene. <a href="CompUSA">CompUSA</a> and other retailers declined to carry it, religious organizations and politicians condemned it, and it was refused classification altogether in Australia. The sequel "" was released in 1996, although Williams was not involved.

"Phantasmagoria" is a <a href="Graphic%20adventure%20game">point-and-click adventure game</a> that features <a href="interactive%20movie">live-action actors and cinematic footage</a>, both during scenes between the gameplay and within the three-dimensional rendered environments of the game itself. The game was made when interactive movie games were at the peak of their popularity, with the release of such popular computer games as "<a href="Wing%20Commander%20III">Wing Commander III</a>" and "<a href="Under%20a%20Killing%20Moon">Under a Killing Moon</a>". In this <a href="Single-player%20video%20game">single-player game</a>, the player controls protagonist Adrienne Delaney, who is always on the screen. The player can click certain areas of the screen to control her movements or make her explore specific places and objects. The camera angles and rooms change depending on where the player moves Adrienne. The game includes only four mouse commands: look (which changes to "talk to" when selecting a person), pick up item, use item, and walk. The mouse cursor is always an arrow, unlike in most earlier <a href="Sierra%20Entertainment">Sierra On-Line</a> games, in which the cursor could be changed to represent different functions (like walk, hand, and eye) by right-clicking. The cursor turns red when it passes over an area where the user can click to perform an action. Once the action has been completed, the cursor will not turn red again. Objects in the game can be picked up by clicking on them or interacting with them in a film sequence, after which the item automatically goes into the inventory. If an object is small enough that it can be easily missed, a pulsing glow occasionally surrounds it to draw attention to it.

The user interface is a screen surrounded by a stone border, with buttons and eight inventory slots along the bottom. Adrienne can only hold eight items at once, and each black slot can contain an image of an item that the user can click on to retrieve or use within the game. In the middle of the inventory slots is a "P" button that brings up an options screen, allowing the player to save or restore games, change the game screen to full- or half-size, control the volume, or switch between a censored version of the game and uncensored one, with more graphic content. A chapter gauge on this screen conveys how much progress remains in a given chapter. A fast-forward button, located above the options button, allows the user to skip past cinematic scenes. On the left side of the interface is a red skull button, which the user can click to receive hints. On the right side is a red button with a picture of a closed eye, which displays any inventory item that the user drags to the button. The display shows a close-up image that can be turned in multiple directions.

Game designer <a href="Roberta%20Williams">Roberta Williams</a>, co-founder of Sierra On-Line, deliberately made the "Phantasmagoria" gameplay and interface simple, unobtrusive, and intuitive so it would be more accessible and less frustrating for casual gamers. According to Arinn Dembo from "<a href="Computer%20Gaming%20World">Computer Gaming World</a>", the game is focused more around the story and the frightening atmosphere, rather than on a difficult gaming experience, and therefore the puzzles are relatively easy, logical, and straightforward.

Successful mystery novelist Adrienne Delaney (Victoria Morsell) and her photographer husband Don Gordon (David Homb) have just purchased a remote mansion off the coast of a small <a href="New%20England">New England</a> island previously owned by a famous 19th-century <a href="Magician%20%28paranormal%29">magician</a>, Zoltan "Carno" Carnovasch (<a href="Robert%20Miano">Robert Miano</a>), whose five wives all died mysteriously. Adrienne hopes to find an inspiration for her next novel in her new home, but starts having nightmares immediately upon moving in. She is comforted by the loving and supportive Don. Adrienne explores the estate, making mysterious discoveries like strange music, warnings written on her computer, and ominous messages from a fortune-teller <a href="automaton">automaton</a>. Unbeknownst to the happy couple, Carno had practiced <a href="black%20magic">black magic</a> when he lived in the mansion and had summoned an evil <a href="demon">demon</a> that possessed him and caused him to murder his wives.

During her exploration of the grounds, Adrienne finds a secret chapel hidden behind a bricked off fireplace. After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases Carno's demon, which possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly toward Adrienne, and <a href="rape">rape</a>s her. Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and her strong but dim-witted son, Cyrus (<a href="Steven%20W.%20Bailey">Steven W. Bailey</a>), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion to install the phone, Don screams at him in a jealous rage, warning him to stay away from his wife. After Mike leaves the mansion, unbeknownst to Adrienne, Don bludgeons Mike to death.

While the local townspeople believe all Carno's wives died of natural causes or accidentally, Adrienne learns through a series of visions that he murdered them in grotesque ways. Hortencia (Christine Armond), who avoided Zoltan's abuse by secluding herself in her greenhouse, is stabbed with gardening tools and suffocated with mulch. Victoria (Holley Chant), an <a href="alcoholism">alcoholic</a>, is killed when Zoltan impales her eye with a wine bottle during an argument. An overly talkative third wife, Leonora (Dana Moody), has her mouth gagged and her neck contorted in a torture device. Finally, the food-loving Regina (Wanda Smith) is <a href="force-fed">force-fed</a> animal <a href="entrails">entrails</a> through a funnel until she chokes to death. Harriet performs a séance for Adrienne, revealing in the form of a green <a href="ectoplasm%20%28paranormal%29">ectoplasm</a> the spirit of Carno before he had been possessed. He reveals that the previously contained evil spirit has been released, and urges Adrienne to trap it once again.

Adrienne visits the nearly 110-year-old Malcolm Wyrmshadow (<a href="Douglas%20Seale">Douglas Seale</a>), who had been Carno's apprentice as a young boy. Malcolm reveals that Carno met his demise after his last wife, Marie (Traci Clauson), discovered he was a murderer. Marie conspired with her lover, Gaston (<a href="Jeff%20Rector">Jeff Rector</a>), to kill Carno by sabotaging the equipment for his most dangerous <a href="escapology">escapology</a> trick, in which Carno donned a burning hood and escaped from bonds on a throne underneath a swinging axe. The sabotage left Carno horribly burned and disfigured, but he survived and attacked Marie and Gaston. After killing Marie by beheading her, Carno was killed by Gaston, who then succumbed to his own wounds.

Malcolm tells Adrienne about a ritual that can eradicate the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides to leave with Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, which pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne walking out of the mansion with a vacant stare, almost <a href="catatonic">catatonic</a>.

"Phantasmagoria" was a radically different game for Williams, who was best known for designing the family-friendly "<a href="King%27s%20Quest">King's Quest</a>" fantasy adventure game series. Williams said she did not want to get <a href="Typecasting%20%28acting%29">typecast</a> in a particular genre, adding: "I felt I had more to offer than fairy stories. I wanted to explore games with a lot of substance and deep emotions." Although "Phantasmagoria" was her first horror game, Williams had created murder and crime stories in her earlier mystery games, "<a href="Mystery%20House">Mystery House</a>" and the "<a href="The%20Colonel%27s%20Bequest">Laura Bow series</a>". Williams was a fan of the horror genre, although she did not watch many horror films as a child after a traumatic experience watching "<a href="Horrors%20of%20the%20Black%20Museum">Horrors of the Black Museum</a>" (1959) at age four. She began watching them again as a teen, and particularly enjoyed such films as "<a href="Halloween%20%281978%20film%29">Halloween</a>" (1978), and movies based on <a href="Stephen%20King">Stephen King</a> novels, like "<a href="Carrie%20%281976%20film%29">Carrie</a>" and "<a href="The%20Shining%20%28film%29">The Shining</a>" (1980). Williams cited the works of King and <a href="Edgar%20Allan%20Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a> as the inspirations behind "Phantasmagoria".

Williams had wanted to make a horror game for eight years prior to "Phantasmagoria", and had started to design one on several occasions, but none came to fruition. She felt the computer game industry and software technology had not yet reached the point where an effective and frightening computer game could be made. As a result, she decided to wait until CD-ROMs were faster and could handle real actors, which she believed was crucial for a horror game because she felt the player had to be able to empathize with the character to fear for them. Williams had been considering several horror story ideas for years before making the game. In one, the heroine answers a magician's advertisement for an assistant and gets the job, but the magician turns out to be insane. Another was set in the past, with the female protagonist getting involved in the supernatural life of a magician character. That idea evolved into a woman being married to a man who is drawn to a bizarre house that previously belonged to illusionists and is haunted by ghosts. The final story as it appears in the game has a contemporary setting, but combines elements from modern fiction, 19th century literature, and classic horror films of the 1950s.

"Phantasmagoria" was the first Sierra On-Line game script to be written like a film screenplay. During the writing stage, Williams was under pressure to ensure "Phantasmagoria" was a commercial success for Sierra. She also faced concerns from her husband <a href="Ken%20Williams%20%28game%20developer%29">Ken Williams</a>, the company president and co-founder of Sierra, who wanted the company to focus more on lower-cost, combat-oriented animated games, and was also concerned about the level of violence in "Phantasmagoria". Williams said she knew the rape scene in particular would be controversial, but she felt it was essential to the plot because it was a turning point that made Adrienne realize something was deeply wrong with Don. She felt the rest of the story "would make no sense" without the scene, but also knew there was a chance it would be cut from the game before production ended.

The script numbered roughly 550 pages when completed, about four times the size of an average Hollywood screenplay. It also included another 100 pages of storyboards representing a total of 800 scenes. In preparation for writing it, Williams spent six months watching horror films and reading horror novels, as well as reading books about how to write horror novels and screenplays. She also asked people she knew socially to tell her scary stories so she could identify the elements of fear. She immersed herself so deeply into the genre that she began having nightmares and had to scale back her reading. She also spent about six months researching historical aspects of the story before the writing process. Williams had a history of using female protagonists in her games, like the Laura Bow series and some of the "King's Quest" games. She said her own personality was a partial inspiration for the protagonist Adrienne, although it was not purposeful: "I think it just kind of naturally worked out that way."

Andy Hoyos, the game's art director and a horror aficionado, participated in brainstorming sessions and discussions with Williams during the writing stage. He conceived the ideas for most of the death scenes and tried to make each one different and original with what he called "fresh approaches to murder". Williams wanted to include more scenes with Adrienne and Don as a happy, normal couple, so that Don's transformation to evil would have greater impact. She proved unable to do so while also maintaining the correct pacing for the gameplay. Williams wrote "Phantasmagoria" with the mass market in mind, targeting casual players as well as die-hard computer game fans. To that end, she wrote the game in short chapters to break it into smaller, easier-to-play sections. Her targeted demographic for the game was ages 16 and older. She chose the title "Phantasmagoria" after reading the word in a reference book about the history of magic and magicians. The term refers to a 17th-century theatrical horror show in which "spirits of the dead" were revealed in a darkened theater by the use of a modified <a href="magic%20lantern">magic lantern</a>.

Andy Hoyos was the art director for "Phantasmagoria", and Kim White, Brandee Prugh and Brian Judy were among the computer artists. It was the first computer game Prugh worked on. Mark Hood, a veteran Sierra programmer, and <a href="Mark%20Seibert">Mark Seibert</a> served as "Phantasmagoria" project managers. Seibert called managing the project "much more of a technical and managerial problem-solving job than I ever envisioned". Unlike previous Sierra games, it also involved managing a great deal of outside resources, such as keeping the studio and outside art contractors on schedule. The game's three-dimensional graphics were among the first rendered on <a href="Silicon%20Graphics">Silicon Graphics</a> software. In creating the look of the game, Hoyos drew particular inspiration from the films of <a href="Tim%20Burton">Tim Burton</a>, and he particularly tried to emulate the lighting, sets and "imaginative edge" of "<a href="Batman%20%281989%20film%29">Batman</a>" (1989). Other influences included the films "<a href="Alien%20%28film%29">Alien</a>" (1979) and "<a href="Hellraiser">Hellraiser</a>" (1987). "Phantasmagoria" was designed using the 3-D software package Alias. Hoyos started by designing the rooms, then created the furniture, and added textures and lighting. Once complete, the computer rendered final images of each room, which became the backgrounds for the game. While most computer games at the time had between 80 and 100 background pictures, "Phantasmagoria" had more than 1,000.

The game developers realized early during development that the game could not be completed entirely in-house due to the large scope of the project, and required working with <a href="Cinema%20of%20the%20United%20States">Hollywood</a> agencies, actors and special effects houses, among others. This added further complexity to the game's development and design. Gerald B. Wolfe, the game's director of photography, spoke to the artists about how to set up the camera angles during filming to best accommodate the design of the rooms. Mannequins created in the computer substituted as stand-ins for the actors to help Wolfe position the shots. Most of the artists had never created computer-generated backgrounds for video-captured characters, and found it to be a challenging process. Seibert said bridging the gap between Hollywood and the software world was difficult at first, but after about four weeks of shooting, the two sides had "come to a common language and had a greater understanding of the process". Hoyos said the biggest difficulty in designing the look of the game was creating a definitive scale for the environment, and ensuring the objects and environment would eventually be compatible with human characters and maintain realism.

Once the filming was completed, more than 20 two-hour <a href="Betacam">Beta SP</a> video tapes of footage had to be edited down to fit the actions of the game. The programming included editing the original video footage, and mixing the rendered images of doors, drawers, chairs and other objects into the footage frame-by-frame, which was necessary for more than 100 scenes. The game required more polishing and fine-tuning than most games of its time due to the many video components, and the programmers had to determine the desired frame rate, data transfer rate and desired resolution of the video elements. Another challenge for the game was CD resource management. Since many of the scenes in the game could be repeated in multiple chapters, some pieces of the code were written onto several different CDs to reduce the number of times the player had to swap discs in the middle of a chapter, an unusual practice for computer games at the time. The final game was on seven discs, a large number for a computer game, and more than the four or five discs originally expected.

Twenty-five professional actors were cast in "Phantasmagoria". Roberta Williams watched the audition tapes of all the roles, and was involved with Mark Seibert in picking the actors. The only actor that Siebert chose without Williams' input was Victoria Morsell as the protagonist, Adrienne Delaney. Williams had watched other audition tapes for the part and was not happy with any of the choices. While she was on vacation, Seibert watched Morsell's audition and immediately selected her for the part. Williams was initially concerned that she was not involved in the decision, but later came to agree that Morsell was the correct choice. Morsell mostly had television experience, but had also previously worked in film and theater roles. She had to work 10 to 12 hours a day, six days a week, for three months to capture all her character's actions and movements. David Homb portrayed Adrienne's husband, Don Gordon. Morsell and Homb started dating in real life after filming. Robert Miano was cast as the villain Zoltan "Carno" Carnovasch. He had previously appeared in several films by "Phantasmagoria" director <a href="Peter%20Maris">Peter Maris</a>.

The <a href="comic%20relief">comic relief</a> roles of Harriet and Cyrus were played by V. Joy Lee and <a href="Steven%20W.%20Bailey">Steven W. Bailey</a>, respectively. Lee had mostly done theater work in the <a href="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> and <a href="Seattle">Seattle</a> areas, along with appearing in some industrial films and an episode of "<a href="Northern%20Exposure">Northern Exposure</a>". Bailey had been an actor in Seattle for about three years, doing mostly stage work, as well as some commercials, television episodes, independent films, and industrial films for the <a href="United%20States%20Navy">United States Navy</a>. Malcolm was portrayed by veteran actor <a href="Douglas%20Seale">Douglas Seale</a>. Stella Stevens played the antiques store owner Lou Ann, Geoff Pryser played Bob the realtor, and Carl Neimic played phone technician Mike. Traci Clauson portrayed Marie, Carno's fifth and final wife.

"Phantasmagoria" was Sierra's first game to use live actors integrated with computer-generated backgrounds. About 600 scenes were filmed for the game. The total filming took about four months, 12 hours a day, shooting six days a week. More than 200 people were ultimately involved in the making of the game. A total of $800,000 was originally budgeted for "Phantasmagoria", but it ended up costing $4.5 million. The budget issues caused some friction between Roberta and Ken Williams. It was the first game made in a new filming studio built by Sierra in <a href="Oakhurst%2C%20California">Oakhurst, California</a>, the same location as Sierra's headquarters. It cost $1.5 million to build and was overseen by studio manager Bill Crow, who said, ""Phantasmagoria" essentially started with the design and creation of the studio". Sierra also developed computerized tools specifically to manage the shooting process, including software to digitize the video into the computer. Some of the software was built as the game was being made and as the need for new tools were being identified.

Sierra wanted the game to have Hollywood-quality film sequences, so they sought a director with experience in the film industry. They hired <a href="Peter%20Maris">Peter Maris</a>, whose previous experience was mainly of action and drama films, although some of his earlier films were graphic horror movies. Maris and Roberta Williams collaborated a great deal from the beginning of the process, with Maris explaining what he wanted in each scene from a filmmaker's perspective, and Williams explaining her desires from a game designer's perspective. Maris set up the camera angles and worked with the actors, using three motion-controlled cameras during the shooting. All filming was done entirely in front of a <a href="Chroma%20key">blue screen</a>, and the digitized information was later loaded into the Silicon Graphics computers, which synchronized the relative motion of computer-generated, three-dimensional background art. Next, the live action and the backgrounds were composited using advanced techniques controlled by <a href="Petro%20Vlahos">Petro VLahos</a>'s UltiMatte system. The computer imaging components made "Phantasmagoria" a very different experience for Maris than his usual film industry work. Crow served as a production coordinator during filming, helping facilitate what happened on stage. He also directed the scenes that involved stunts or other special effects that required the coordination of animated sequences with live action. Cindy Jordan worked as the makeup artist.

Due to the nature of filming for a computer game, certain short performances had to be filmed over and over separately, like Adrienne simply crossing a room. Many of the actors, including Morsell, Lee and Bailey, had never done any blue screen acting before, and Miano had only done it once. Morsell in particular said she found it challenging because it was so physically constrictive. Such items as tables, chairs, doors or stairs that the actors appear to interact with are in fact constructed objects painted blue to match the blue screen, and were occasionally challenging for the actors to work with. During one scene, David Homb accidentally stood in such a way that his arm appeared to be going through the living room wall.

Morsell found it challenging to film a scene near the end of the game, in which Adrienne is pleading with Don while getting strapped into the chair with a guillotine overhead. Several different versions of the scene had to be filmed, and Morsell said it was difficult for her to work up the genuine emotion she needed take after take. The torture devices featured in the game were scale models made by local craftsmen. During one scene, the mansion roof starts to collapse, causing beams and chunks of debris to fall around the actors. To achieve this, the crew built lightweight beams out of hollow cardboard, which had to fall in the correct sequence. In another scene, Adrienne crawls along a water pipe that breaks. To film the scene without damaging equipment, the crew built a giant plastic box with a plastic tray underneath for the shoot. Three hoses ran through the pipe so water would spray in multiple directions.

The chase scene at the end of the game, in which Don pursues Adrienne throughout the entire mansion, took a full week to film. Homb wore a prosthesis on his face to simulate wounds from Adrienne pouring acid on him. Only one prosthesis was available, and it was in such bad shape by the end of filming that Williams said "we were essentially holding it in place with the proverbial wire and bailing wax". Several scenes in "Phantasmagoria" involved animals, including a <a href="Doberman%20Pinscher">Doberman Pinscher</a>, two cats, a beagle and several rats. Sierra commissioned Dave Macmillian and other Hollywood animal handlers from the company Worldwide Movie Animals to handle the animals. Two cats were required to portray Adrienne's pet Spaz because the cats were temperamental and each would have moments when they would not perform. Some objects were borrowed by a museum operated by the Fresno Flats Historical Society and used as props in the game. The society was thanked in the credits as a result. Ultimately, all of the scenes filmed for "Phantasmagoria" were used in the final game. Some were edited for length and pacing, but none were cut altogether.

Despite a storyline running over a course of seven days, Adrienne wears the same wardrobe throughout the entire game: an orange shirt and black pants. Williams said this is because many of Adrienne's actions throughout the game can be repeated by the player over and over, making it difficult to change her wardrobe without it becoming "a nightmare of shooting". The only solutions she saw were to allow less decision-making by the player, or to keep the flexibility intact but not allow any costume changes. Williams said she decided the latter option was ultimately better for the game. An orange shirt was chosen for the character because it was the best color to shoot against the blue screen. None of the characters wear blue, purple, gray or any shade of green similar to the blue screen for that same reason.

For "Phantasmagoria"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s special effects, Sierra sought the professional effects house The Character Shop, headed by senior creature maker Rick Lazzarini. The core special effects team for the game consisted of Lazzarini, Michael Esbin and Bill Zahn. Lazzarini said making "Phantasmagoria" was a much faster and more cooperative process than in the film industry. Due to the tight filming schedule, most effects had to be done in one shot with no cuts, so there was less margin for error. They created the effects for all the death scenes in the game, which included creating assorted body prostheses, burn makeup and what Lazzarini called "gallons of fake blood", which was made of sugar, water and dye.

Adrienne's head is split open by a swinging pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached to either side so it could be pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.

One scene involved a burning head, which was created by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, then mounted them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax to make it look bumpy. Another special effect involved a spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from <a href="cellulose">cellulose</a>, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.

Sierra composers Mark Seibert and Jay User created the musical score for "Phantasmagoria", with Neal Grandstaf providing additional music. Most of the music is a mixture of real instruments with synthesized and sampled sounds, and unlike previous Sierra games, the score was recorded live, rather than created in the computer. Themes for the music ranged from <a href="rock%20and%20roll">rock and roll</a> to <a href="opera">opera</a>. The composers observed the game and various scenes to prepare their score, trying to create an ambiance and identify spots to build the tension with music, creating <a href="Sting%20%28musical%20phrase%29">stingers</a> as needed. For cinematic scenes, they watched tapes after the scenes were shot and composed the music afterward. This was a new process for Sierra and the computer game industry in general, but the same concept was regularly followed in the film industry.

The opening theme of the game features a neo-<a href="Gregorian%20chant">Gregorian chant</a>, which was performed in studio by a 135-voice choir. Much of the <a href="Underscoring">underscore</a> music that plays when the player is exploring the game, rather than during cinematic scenes, is based upon that opening scene. The composers made use of silence in many scenes, to build up tension for moments of a "pounce" effect, creating the effect with music that something is catching the listener. They deliberately saved the most intense music for the final chapter of "Phantasmagoria", when the game becomes the most intense. During some chase scenes, drums and low strings are used in the score to simulate a heartbeat, which grows louder and louder during more dangerous moments.

"Phantasmagoria" took more than two years to develop. Sierra officials said this was because it was so different from anything that had been done previously, in both the Hollywood or computer game industries, and the new challenges led to complexities. Roberta Williams said: "It took a full year just to get people to understand what I wanted to do." The game experienced multiple delays before it was ultimately released. It was originally planned that the game would be in stores by late 1993 or early 1994, with Sierra saying it would come out no later than the fall of 1994. The game was previewed at the <a href="Consumer%20Electronics%20Show">Consumer Electronics Show</a> in <a href="Chicago">Chicago</a> in June 1994, where it was announced the release date had been pushed back to October 1994 and that the game would be made available on two discs. The game ultimately required seven discs. The shipping date was later changed again to Christmas 1994, and then February 1995, before Sierra said it would be delayed yet again as the company continued to refine the technology of live-action video. It was announced the game would be ready in June 1995, but when Sierra organized road shows that month to market 18 of its new games, "Phantasmagoria" was not among them because it was not ready yet.

The date was changed once more to August 3, before it was finally released in stores on August 24, 1995, the same day as the <a href="Microsoft">Microsoft</a>'s operating system <a href="Windows%2095">Windows 95</a> version. "Phantasmagoria" came out first for Windows 95, <a href="Windows%203.1">Windows 3.1</a> and <a href="MS-DOS">MS-DOS</a>, then for <a href="Macintosh">Macintosh</a> computers in November 1995. A hint book by Sierra came out at the same time as the game. "Phantasmagoria" was also ported to <a href="Sega%20Saturn">Sega Saturn</a> and spanned eight discs exclusively in Japan, where it was fully translated and dubbed into Japanese, and released by Outrigger under the name "Phantasm". In response to all the delays, Vince Broady, executive editor of the monthly publication "Multimedia World", said Sierra may have been attempting to avoid the same mistakes from the previous year with "<a href="Outpost%20%281994%20video%20game%29">Outpost</a>", for which the company released many advertisements and reviews, but then over-promoted and released before it was finished. Sierra spokeswoman Kathy Gillmore admitted that mistakes were made in marketing "Outpost" and Sierra had tried to fix them. The minimum system requirements were an <a href="IBM">IBM</a> compatible <a href="Intel%2080486">486–25</a>, 8 megabytes of <a href="Random-access%20memory">RAM</a>, 5 megabytes hard disk space, <a href="Super%20video%20graphics%20array">SVGA</a> (256 colors) and a 2x CD-ROM. It supported <a href="Sound%20Blaster">Sound Blaster</a>-compatible sound cards, and for MS-DOS the game worked with a megahertz chip. It sold for as much as $80 in some stores, but was typically sold for $69.95.

"Phantasmagoria" was heavily advertised by Sierra in advance of its release, and the company touted it as its biggest game to date. It was Sierra's first computer game targeted to an adult audience. There was no legislated rating system for computer games in the United States in place, although one was being debated before the <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. Senate</a> at the time. Sierra was among several major software companies that voluntarily supported the ratings system designed by the <a href="Entertainment%20Software%20Rating%20Board">Entertainment Software Rating Board</a>, which rated games so adults could make decisions about software purchases. The game was given an "M" rating for "mature" audiences, meaning intended for audiences 17 or older. As a result, it carried a content warning on the box that said "contains adult subject matter". The game box prominently displayed this rating, as well as a warning on the back panel that the game contains adult subject matter inappropriate for children. It also encouraged parents to review the material before providing it to children and asked retailers not to sell it to minors. "Phantasmagoria" also received mature ratings in <a href="Germany">Germany</a> and the <a href="United%20Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.

The game itself includes a filter that players can activate with a password so that violent or sexually explicit content is censored. When the filter is in place, the screen blurs during the most violent sections, so the player can hear the action but cannot see it. Sierra officials believed it was the first CD-ROM adventure game that self-censored upon command. Sierra producer Mark Seibert said: "There are some pretty gruesome things, and we're concerned about how that is going to impact parents who want to buy a good game with a good story line." But Gene Emery of "<a href="The%20Providence%20Journal">The Providence Journal</a>" said the censoring option was "unlikely to stop any computer-literate 10-year-old" and by scrambling portions of the videos that might be considered offensive, "the censorship option actually makes the explicit scenes seem even worse than they really are".

In October 1997, the first chapter of "Phantasmagoria" was included in the Roberta Williams Anthology, a limited-edition collection of 15 games created by Williams over 18 years. "Phantasmagoria" was made available for <a href="Digital%20distribution">digital download</a> on the website <a href="GOG.com">GOG.com</a> starting in February 2010 for $9.99.

"Phantasmagoria" quickly became the best-selling game in the United States, and was Sierra's best-selling computer game to date. It grossed $12,000,000 and sold 300,000 units during its first week-end of release, debuting at number four in "PC Data"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s August 1995 list of top-selling computer games for MS-DOS and Windows. It followed "", "<a href="Microsoft%20Flight%20Simulator">Microsoft Flight Simulator</a>" and "<a href="Myst">Myst</a>". By September, it had reached number one on the list among computer games and ranked third among all computer software, following Windows 95 and <a href="Microsoft%20Plus%21">Microsoft Plus!</a> "InterAction", a magazine published by Sierra On-Line, wrote that no other Sierra game topped game charts as quickly as "Phantasmagoria" did. By the end of December, it remained at number three among overall software, and number one among computer games, and by January it was estimated as many as 500,000 copies had been sold. According to Sierra On-Line, its global sales surpassed 600,000 units by March 1996.

"Phantasmagoria" finished 1995 as the ninth best-selling game of the year according to an analysis by "PC Data" of sales by 42 retail chains. In January 1996, "Phantasmagoria" was the fourth-best seller among MS-DOS and Windows games, behind "Microsoft Flight Simulator", "Myst" and "<a href="Command%20%26amp%3B%20Conquer">Command & Conquer</a>", and it was number six among all computer software. By February 10 it was number five among MS-DOS and Windows games, and by February 24 it was number 10. It received a boost in June 1996, possibly due to the pending release of its sequel "", and jumped back up to seventh among best-selling computer software programs according to "Computer Life" magazine. One year after "Phantasmagoria" was released, it still remained in the best-seller charts, and more than one million copies were ultimately sold, making it Sierra's first game to reach that milestone.

"Phantasmagoria" received mixed reviews. Vince Broady, executive editor of "Multimedia World", said Sierra was smart to try to capture the adult market, which was looking for sophisticated games especially after the popularity of games such as "<a href="The%207th%20Guest">The 7th Guest</a>." Dwight Silverman of the "<a href="Houston%20Chronicle">Houston Chronicle</a>" declared it the best game of the year, calling it a "masterwork" and "as close as it gets to a film you control", although he said not everyone would appreciate it due to its violent content. "<a href="Entertainment%20Weekly">Entertainment Weekly</a>" gave it a B+ and called it "one of the surest signs yet of computer games approaching the quality level of the movies". The review said it had some suspenseful and novel twists, but also some "horrific touches (that) seem a bit derivative, such as a <a href="Freddy%20Krueger">Freddy Krueger</a>-like nightmare in which hands pull you through a bed". Kim McDaniel of "<a href="The%20Salt%20Lake%20Tribune">The Salt Lake Tribune</a>" called it "the most sophisticated computer game to date" and "a weird, wild, horrific ride that will make you jump at every turn, even if you aren't normally faint-of-heart". Although McDaniel said it might be easy for experienced players, she appreciated that it was more accessible for casual players than difficult games like "The 7th Guest".

A "<a href="Billboard%20%28magazine%29">Billboard</a>" magazine review said "Phantasmagoria" "lives up to the advanced billing" and "aims to unnerve and succeeds gruesomely with bloody special effects interspliced in trusty scare-flick fashion with daubs of flesh and hints of sex". "<a href="USA%20Today">USA Today</a>" writer Joe Wilson gave it three-and-a-half stars and called it well-produced, visually appealing, frighteningly realistic and "a much-needed change from normal fare", although he said the plot did not start to become interesting until halfway through. Gene Emery of "The Providence Journal" said the game was "an impressive work, a sophisticated mix of live action and a rich computer-generated environment, coupled with a musical score that's spooky without being overwhelming". He also called the gameplay "elegant in its simplicity". "<a href="San%20Francisco%20Chronicle">San Francisco Chronicle</a>" writer Laura Evenson called it unpredictable and addictive, comparing it to a good mystery novel. A reviewer for "<a href="Next%20Generation%20%28magazine%29">Next Generation</a>" was pleased with the story, the production values of the cutscenes, and the way the game mixed in full motion video without resulting in slowdown or poor control. However, he found that the lack of a challenge made it a poor value for experienced players, since they would be able to finish the entire game in a day or two, and recommended it strictly for those who were new to the adventure genre. Ric Manning of the Gannett News Service wrote, "The graphics are terrific, but don't play on a full stomach." Steve La Rue of "<a href="U-T%20San%20Diego">U-T San Diego</a>" found the game "visually opulent and interesting" with "dialogue a lot better than I expected, given the trite <a href="gothic%20fiction">gothic novel</a> plot", but also said he had to adjust to the "gradual, contemplative pace". Jack Warner of "<a href="The%20Atlanta%20Journal-Constitution">The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</a>" wrote: "It's hackneyed, but the art is so good, the acting sufficiently convincing and the atmosphere brooding enough to keep you going", although he said "precious little happens" in the first few discs.

"Computer Gaming World" writer Arinn Dembo called the storyline of a couple buying a haunted mansion "a cliché so familiar that it needs no explanation", but said it still worked in a computer game because the player could directly experience it in that medium, rather than simply watching it in a film. Dembo also praised the game for featuring a female protagonist, though she said Adrienne was too much of an exaggeratedly feminine "girlie-type girl". Overall, Dembo said the game "achieved a new height of realism and beauty in a computer game" and was "an important technological leap, and represents a step forward for the whole industry". Another "Computer Gaming World" review said "Phantasamagoria" "appears to deliver on its ambitious promises" and that although the puzzles are too simple for experienced gamers, the appeal of the game is exploring a setting that "would have had even the folks in <a href="The%20Amityville%20Horror%20%281979%20film%29">Amityville</a> making tracks". Harley Jebens of the "<a href="Austin%20American-Statesman">Austin American-Statesman</a>" said some of the acting was "hilariously bad" and the storyline was predictable, but that the game keeps you engaged, the story draws you in and the controls were well executed. "<a href="Fort%20Worth%20Star-Telegram">Fort Worth Star-Telegram</a>" writer Andy Greiser said the game was a beautiful combination of live actors and computer-built backgrounds, but said the action doesn't start to pick up until the halfway point. In a mixed review, Phil LaRose of "<a href="The%20Advocate%20%28Louisiana%29">The Advocate</a>" praised the game for having a female protagonist and excellent special effects, and said it had gone further toward merging the realms of film and game than any other computer game. He also said the game was too linear, with overly simple puzzles and a plotline with "so many recycled concepts in this game, players will feel like they've seen it all before".

Other reviews were more negative. "<a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a>" writer Jeff Sengstack said the expensive budget and long production history "do not necessarily translate into high quality gaming". He complimented the graphics and music, but considered "[the game] generally unchallenging, the characters weak, the violence over-the-top, and the script just lame". Mike Hall of the "<a href="Albuquerque%20Journal">Albuquerque Journal</a>" compared "Phantasmagoria" to big-budget films with multimillion-dollar budgets and multiple production delays that ultimately failed, like "<a href="Cleopatra%20%281963%20film%29">Cleopatra</a>" and "<a href="Waterworld">Waterworld</a>". He said the graphics were beautiful, but the game ended too quickly, the plot was thin and the puzzles were too easy to solve. "<a href="The%20Escapist%20%28magazine%29">The Escapist</a>" writer Brendan Main said the game fell short of its ambition to change how gamers experienced horror media, and the juxtaposition of real-life actors on settings that were "ordinary, pixilated fare" was "odd and unflattering". A one-star review in "The Video Games Guide", published in 2013, "now seems little more than a flawed, though ambitious, white elephant". In a 2014 review, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> writer Kosta Andreadis said the game's special effects were still effective, and that "Phantasmagoria" wisely builds suspense and saves the violent content for the end of the game. But he said it was ultimately "less a bad game than a bad horror film" and said the execution, "although technically interesting, is extremely goofy, full of ludicrous situations, weird plot turns, bizarre dialogue, and dated costume choices".

"Phantasmagoria" earned an Editor's Choice Award from "<a href="PC%20Gamer">PC Gamer</a>", and a Golden Triad Award from "<a href="Computer%20Game%20Review">Computer Game Review</a>", whose editors later gave it their 1995 Best FMV of the Year prize. It was nominated for Best Adventure/Role-Playing Software in the annual Excellence in Software Awards competition, known in the game industry as "The Codies", which are among the most prestigious honors in software development. It was also named Best Adventure Game of the Year by "Games Magazine", Game of the Month by "<a href="Windows%20Magazine">Windows Magazine</a>", and was one of three nominees for "<a href="PC/Computing">PC/Computing</a>"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Game of the Year.

Before "Phantasmagoria" was released, <a href="CompUSA">CompUSA</a>, the nation's largest discount computer retailer, notified Sierra it would not stock the game. The company did not comment on specific reasons for their decision except for a written statement from chief operating officer Hal Compton: "Software comes out all the time. Some we buy, some we don't. This one we chose not to." Analysts believed CompUSA objected to the realistic violence in the game. Lee S. Isgur of <a href="Jefferies%20Group">Jefferies & Co.</a>, a global investment bank that followed the computer game industry, said CompUSA's decision probably would not harm overall sales of the game, and that it could in fact help it generate publicity. He added that "It's probably one of the bloodiest games ever." Likewise, Vincent Turzo of Jefferies & Co. said, "When you say you're not going to carry something, of course the consumers rush to the stores to see what it's all about." Roberta Williams said of CompUSA's announcement: "I'm disappointed that they decided to make a stand with my product." Some smaller retailers also decided not to stock "Phantasmagoria", but others like <a href="Walmart">Walmart</a> continued to carry it.

As well as the graphic gore and violence, the rape scene in "Phantasmagoria" drew particular attention and objections from the game's critics. One major newspaper claimed "Phantasmagoria" "makes a game of sexual violence". Multiple parents' groups, religious organizations, community action committees and special interest groups called for a boycott, and sent letters to the Sierra offices in droves voicing objections to the game. "Phantasmagoria" was unable to be sold in <a href="Australia">Australia</a> after being refused classification by <a href="Australian%20Classification%20Board">Office of Film and Literature Classification</a> (the R 18+ classification was not available for video games at the time). The Roberta Williams Anthology collection was also banned in Australia because it featured a one-chapter preview of the game. The governments of two other countries also banned "Phantasmagoria". The game was spotlighted in U.S. Senate hearings debating regulation of content in the computer software industry, and there was talk that it could re-ignite the debate in <a href="United%20States%20Congress">Congress</a> over whether to impose federally mandated ratings on computer software that stores would be required to enforce.

Sierra found that Williams tended to garner extremely favorable press, even as "Phantasmagoria" got negative press, so the company began having her discuss the game in person. In response to the backlash, Williams said she believed computer games were subject to harsher standards than films and television, which she said often have more violent content than "Phantasmagoria", in part because computer games are often regarded as children's entertainment rather than for adults. Williams said "Phantasmagoria" was less excessively violent than games like "<a href="Doom%20%281993%20video%20game%29">Doom</a>" and "<a href="Mortal%20Kombat%20%281992%20video%20game%29">Mortal Kombat</a>", and that unlike those games, "Phantasmagoria" is "the good guy ... not going around shooting up people". Sierra spokeswoman Rebecca Buxton and Dennis Cloutier, the company's vice president of sales, both expressed surprise at the reaction to the game because Sierra made strong efforts to warn viewers about the adult content in its marketing, box warnings and censoring options. Cloutier said the company was essentially "censoring ourselves". Steven L. Kent of "<a href="The%20Seattle%20Times">The Seattle Times</a>" said there were more violent games than "Phantasmagoria", but that most video game violence appears in computer animations, and thus can be more easily overlooked than in a live-action game, which elicits a stronger emotional response.

In April 1998, three years after the game was released, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System came under criticism for owning 435,000 shares worth $9 million in <a href="Cendant">Cendant</a>, which by this point had purchased Sierra On-Line, due to the violence in the "Phantasmagoria" and other Sierra games. <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a> Sen. <a href="Mitch%20McConnell">Mitch McConnell</a>, <a href="Arkansas">Arkansas</a> Gov. <a href="Mike%20Huckabee">Mike Huckabee</a>, <a href="Iowa">Iowa</a> Gov. <a href="Terry%20Branstad">Terry Branstad</a>, and <a href="Lamar%20Alexander">Lamar Alexander</a>, the former governor of <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>, all asked the system to sell its stock. McConnell was particularly critical of the rape scene. They suggested a link existed between recent student slayings in <a href="West%20Paducah%2C%20Kentucky">West Paducah, Kentucky</a>, and <a href="Jonesboro%2C%20Arkansas">Jonesboro, Arkansas</a>, and the "increasingly violent world many American children enter when they sit down in front of a computer screen". Pat Miller, executive secretary of the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System, said the system wasn't aware of "Phantasmagoria" or Sierra's products, and that it invested in Cendant because it's part of an index fund of the 500 best stocks in the country. Miller added that, if the retirement system finds a problem with Sierra On-Line, it would ask Cendant to cease ownership in the company, and that the system would divest its stock if it refused. Miller said: "We're not going to continue to invest in some company that does something that will be detrimental to our children. We know that our membership would not want us to do that." The same letter was also sent to heads of teachers' retirement systems in <a href="California">California</a>, <a href="Ohio">Ohio</a> and <a href="Texas">Texas</a>.

The commercial success of "Phantasmagoria" had a positive financial impact on Sierra On-Line. Before its release, the company's stock rose in July 1995, up $3.875 to $30.875, which Vince Turzo of Jeffries & Co attributed in part due to anticipation of "Phantasmagoria". Sierra's stock continued to rise after it was released. The company closed on the <a href="NASDAQ">NASDAQ</a> stock market at $43.25 on September 8, 1995, translating to a 73 percent gain in less than three months, which Turzo attributed partially to "Phantasmagoria"s success. For the quarter ending September 30, 1995, Sierra posted a profit of $3.26 million, compared to a loss of $850,000 in 1994. This improvement exceeded expectations in analysts' forecasts, and was thanks largely to "Phantasmagoria" sales.

Williams returned to work on the "King's Quest" series after "Phantasmagoria" was completed. Sierra used the same technology and Hollywood techniques from "Phantasmagoria" to make "" (1995), another interactive movie adventure game. Williams later described "Phantasmagoria" as the game that best represented her career as a game designer. Due to its development delays, "Phantasmagoria" was released after other interactive movie games like "Wing Commander III" and "Under a Killing Moon", so it did not receive as much credit for heralding that game subgenre as the other titles. Harley Jebens of the "Austin American-Statesman" said by the time it was finally released, "computer games that incorporate video [were] becoming a common sight on the software store racks". Sean Clark, a project leader at <a href="LucasArts">LucasArts</a>, feared the success of "Phantasmagoria" would set a bad precedent in that software companies would think they need huge budgets and lots of discs to have a successful game, rather than focusing on quality.

A "Phantasmagoria" sequel, "Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh" (1996), was released by Sierra a year after the original. It was written and designed by <a href="Lorelei%20Shannon">Lorelei Shannon</a>, Roberta Williams' design partner on "<a href="King%27s%20Quest%20VII">King's Quest VII</a>". Williams was not involved with it, and the game featured a very different tone and completely different characters, with no direct connection to the storyline of the first game. Shannon said the original game was a haunted house story in the style of a "late night creature feature", while her game has more science-fiction and <a href="Horror%20fantasy">fantasy horror</a> elements, in the style of the works of <a href="Clive%20Barker">Clive Barker</a> and <a href="Tanith%20Lee">Tanith Lee</a>. Roberta Williams said both she and her husband Ken enjoyed the sequel. A preview for "A Puzzle of Flesh" was included in the first CD of the original "Phantasmagoria" game.

Ken Williams had wanted Roberta to work on a "Phantasmagoria" sequel immediately after the success of the first game, but she could not do so due to her obligations to "<a href="King%27s%20Quest%20VIII">King's Quest VIII</a>". Ken Williams felt the sequel was less successful because players could sense the absence of Roberta's style. "It's as if a bestselling author had a book ghostwritten. Within a few pages, the fans would know they had been duped and feel disappointed, regardless of the quality of the work." Ken Williams said a third game was not produced after "A Puzzle of Flesh" because of issues after Sierra was acquired by <a href="CUC%20International">CUC International</a> in 1996. Distribution was handled by <a href="Davidson%20%26amp%3B%20Associates">Davidson & Associates</a>, another CUC company, which primarily sold educational software. Williams said the company was uncomfortable with the violent content in "Phantasmagoria" and did not attempt to sell the sequel as aggressively as Sierra would have. He also claimed Jan Davidson, the wife of Chairman and CEO Bob Davidson, personally did not like the game and "wanted it shut down". Due to these sales challenges, Williams said "there was no reason to make a third "Phantasmagoria"".

Roberta Williams said she was asked by Sierra to make a third "Phantasmagoria" game, and that she said she would consider it, but it was not ultimately made. Williams said:

Battle of Pulo Aura

The Battle of Pulo Aura was a minor naval engagement of the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, fought on 14 February 1804, in which a large convoy of <a href="Honourable%20East%20India%20Company">Honourable East India Company</a> (HEIC) <a href="East%20Indiamen">East Indiamen</a>, well-<a href="armed%20merchant%20ship">armed merchant ship</a>s, intimidated, drove off and chased a powerful French naval squadron. Although the French force was much stronger than the British convoy, Commodore <a href="Nathaniel%20Dance">Nathaniel Dance</a>'s aggressive tactics persuaded Contre-Admiral <a href="Charles-Alexandre%20L%C3%A9on%20Durand%20Linois">Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois</a> to retire after only a brief exchange of shot. Dance then chased the French warships until his convoy was out of danger, whereupon he resumed his passage toward <a href="British%20India">British India</a>. Linois later claimed that the unescorted British merchant fleet was defended by eight <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ships of the line</a>, a claim criticised by contemporary officers and later historians.

The battle occurred during an extended <a href="commerce%20raiding">commerce raiding</a> operation by a French squadron led by Linois in the <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a> "<a href="French%20ship%20Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau%20%281795%29">Marengo</a>". Linois had sailed to the <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a> in 1803 before the declaration of war, under orders to install garrisons in the French and Dutch colonies in the region and to prey on lightly defended British merchant shipping. One of the richest and most significant targets was the "China Fleet", an annual convoy of East Indiamen from China and other Far Eastern ports that carried millions of <a href="pound%20sterling">pounds</a> worth of trade goods. Although these large vessels were accompanied by numerous smaller merchant ships, news of the outbreak of war had only just arrived in the Pacific and the only warship available to defend the fleet was the small HEIC armed <a href="brig">brig</a> "Ganges". Dutch informants notified Linois of the fleet's destination and date of departure from <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a> while he was anchored at <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a> on <a href="Java">Java</a>, and he sailed in search of the convoy on 28 December 1803, eventually discovering it in early February.

Although no warships protected the convoy, Commodore Dance knew that lookouts could, from a distance, mistake a large East Indiaman for a ship of the line. He raised flags that indicated that his fleet included part of the Royal Navy squadron operating in the Indian Ocean at the time and formed into a line of battle. Although Linois's ships were clearly superior, the British reaction unnerved him and he quickly broke off combat. Dance continued his ruse, pursuing Linois for two hours until the body of the convoy was safe. <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a> <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">knighted</a> Dance for his courage and various mercantile and patriotic organisations awarded him large sums of money, while both Linois's own officers and the Emperor <a href="Napoleon">Napoleon</a> personally castigated the French admiral for his failure to press the attack against a weaker and extremely valuable enemy. Although he remained in command of the squadron for another two years and had some minor success against undefended merchant ships, he suffered a string of defeats and inconclusive engagements against weaker British naval forces. Ironically, Linois was captured at the <a href="Action%20of%2013%20March%201806">Action of 13 March 1806</a> by a numerically superior British battle squadron that he mistook for a merchant convoy.

During the <a href="Napoleonic%20Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>, the British economy depended on its ability to trade with the <a href="British%20Empire">British Empire</a>, particularly the valuable colonies in <a href="British%20India">British India</a>. The intercontinental trade was conducted by the governors of India, the <a href="Honourable%20East%20India%20Company">Honourable East India Company</a> (HEIC), using their fleet of large, well-armed merchant vessels known as <a href="East%20Indiamen">East Indiamen</a>. These ships were of between 500 and 1200 nominal tons burthen (<a href="Builder%27s%20Old%20measurement">bm</a>) and could carry up to 36 guns for defence against pirates, <a href="privateer">privateer</a>s and small warships. They were not, however, capable under normal circumstances of fighting off an enemy <a href="frigate">frigate</a> or <a href="ship%20of%20the%20line">ship of the line</a>. Their guns were usually of inferior design, and their crew smaller and less well trained than those on a naval ship. The East Indiamen sought to ensure the safety of their cargo and passengers, not defeat enemy warships in battle. Despite these disadvantages, the size of East Indiamen meant that from a distance they appeared quite similar to a small ship of the line, a deception usually augmented by paintwork and <a href="Quaker%20Gun">dummy cannon</a>. At the <a href="Bali%20Strait%20Incident">Bali Strait Incident</a> of 28 January 1797 an unescorted convoy of East Indiamen had used this similarity to intimidate a powerful French frigate squadron into withdrawing without a fight. In February 1799 an attack by a combined French-Spanish squadron on the assembled convoy at Macau was driven off in the <a href="Macau%20Incident%20%281799%29">Macau Incident</a> without combat by the small Royal Navy escort squadron.

The East Indiamen would gather at ports in India and the Far East and from there set out for Britain in large convoys, often carrying millions of <a href="pounds%20sterling">pounds</a> worth of trade goods. The journey would usually take six months and the ships would subsequently return carrying troops and passengers to augment the British forces stationed in India. "Country ships", smaller merchant vessels chartered for local trade, sometimes independently from the HEIC, would often join the convoys. To protect their ships from the depredations of pirates, the HEIC also operated its own private navy of small armed vessels. In combination, these ships were an effective deterrent against smaller raiders, but were no match for a professional warship.

Understanding the importance of the Indian Ocean trade and seeking to threaten it from the start of the inevitable war, <a href="First%20Consul">First Consul</a> <a href="Napoleon%20Bonaparte">Napoleon Bonaparte</a> ordered a squadron to sail for India in March 1803. This force was under the command of Contre-Admiral <a href="Charles-Alexandre%20L%C3%A9on%20Durand%20Linois">Charles-Alexandre Durand Linois</a> and consisted of the ship of the line "<a href="French%20ship%20Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau%20%281795%29">Marengo</a>" and three frigates. Linois operated from the island base of <a href="Mauritius">Île de France</a> with orders to attack British shipping once war had begun. Sailing initially to <a href="Pondicherry%20%28city%29">Pondicherry</a> in India, Linois had a close encounter with a British squadron under Rear-Admiral <a href="Peter%20Rainier%2C%20junior">Peter Rainier</a> during July, but was at Île de France in August when news arrived that the Napoleonic Wars had started on 16 May. Determined to fortify the French raiding bases in the region, Linois landed troops and supplies at <a href="R%C3%A9union">Réunion</a> and <a href="Batavia%2C%20Dutch%20East%20Indies">Batavia</a>. During the operation he despatched the frigate to <a href="Muscat%2C%20Oman">Muscat</a>, captured numerous individual country ships, and burned the British trading post of <a href="Bengkulu%20%28city%29">Bencoolen</a>. On 10 December he anchored at Batavia for the winter. Shortly thereafter, informants passed to Batavia the composition and date of departure of the British "China Fleet", leading Linois to set out to intercept it. On 28 December, Linois's squadron—consisting of "Marengo", frigates and , the <a href="corvette">corvette</a> and the Dutch brig —departed Batavia. The ships carried six months worth of provisions as Linois had anticipated an extended patrol in the approaches to the <a href="Strait%20of%20Malacca">Strait of Malacca</a> in the <a href="South%20China%20Sea">South China Sea</a>.

The China Fleet was a large annual British merchant convoy that gathered at <a href="Guangzhou">Canton</a> in the <a href="Pearl%20River%20%28China%29">Pearl River</a> during the winter before sailing for Britain, via India. As the convoy passed through the East Indies, it was joined by vessels sailing from other European ports in the region on the route to India, until it often numbered dozens of ships. The 1804 fleet departed in late January, and by the time it reached the approaches to the Strait of Malacca it had swelled to include 16 East Indiamen, 11 country ships, a Portuguese merchant ship from <a href="Macau">Macau</a> and a vessel from <a href="Botany%20Bay">Botany Bay</a> in <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a>. Although the HEIC had provided the small, armed brig "Ganges" as an escort, this vessel could only dissuade pirates; it could not hope to compete with a French warship. There was no military escort: news of the outbreak of war had reached Canton before reinforcements had arrived from the squadron in India. Spies based in Canton had passed the composition and date of departure of the China Fleet to Linois in Batavia, but the Dutch informants at Canton had also passed on false reports that Royal Navy warships were accompanying the convoy, reports that may have been deliberately placed by British authorities. The convoy was an immensely valuable prize, its cargo of tea, silk and porcelain valued at over £8 million in contemporary values (the equivalent of £ as of 2019). Also on board were 80 Chinese plants ordered by <a href="Joseph%20Banks">Sir Joseph Banks</a> for the royal gardens and carried in a specially designed plant room. The HEIC Select Committee in Canton had been very concerned for the safety of the unescorted convoy, and had debated delaying its departure. The various captains had been consulted, including Henry Meriton, who in his ship had captured a frigate during the <a href="Action%20of%204%20August%201800">Action of 4 August 1800</a>, a disastrous French attack on a convoy of East Indiamen off <a href="Brazil">Brazil</a>. Meriton advised that the convoy was powerful enough in both appearance and reality to dissuade any attack. John Farquharson, captain of , opposed Meriton, arguing that the crews of East Indiamen were so badly trained that they would be unable to mutually defend one another if faced with a determined enemy. Eventually the Committee decided that it could delay the convoy no longer and awarded command to the most experienced captain, Commodore <a href="Nathaniel%20Dance">Nathaniel Dance</a>–an officer with over 45 years service at sea–in the East Indiaman "Earl Camden".

At 08:00 on 14 February 1804, with the island of <a href="Aur%20Island">Pulo Aura</a> within sight to the south-west near the eastern entrance to the <a href="Straits%20of%20Malacca">Straits of Malacca</a>, the Indiaman "Royal George" raised a signal describing three sail approaching the convoy from the direction of the island. This was Linois's squadron, which had been cruising in the area for the previous month in anticipation of the convoy's arrival. Dance ordered the brig "Ganges" and the Indiamen "Alfred", "Royal George", , and "Hope" to approach the strange vessels and investigate, rapidly discovering that they were enemy warships. By 13:00, Dance had readied his guns and reformed his convoy, with the large Indiamen formed up in <a href="line%20of%20battle">line of battle</a> to receive the French attack as if they were warships. During the late afternoon, Linois's squadron fell in behind the slow line of merchant ships and Dance expected an immediate attack, but Linois was cautious and merely observed the convoy, preferring to wait until the following morning before engaging the enemy. Dance made use of the delay to gather the smaller country ships on the opposite side of his line from the French, the brig "Ganges" shepherding them into position and collecting volunteers from their crews to augment the sailors on board the Indiamen. Linois later excused his delay in attacking the merchant convoy by citing the need for caution:

At dawn on 15 February, both the British and French forces raised their colours. Dance hoped to persuade Linois that his ships included some fully armed warships and he therefore ordered the brig "Ganges" and the four lead ships to hoist <a href="blue%20ensigns">blue ensigns</a>, while the rest of the convoy raised <a href="red%20ensigns">red ensigns</a>. By the system of national flags then in use in British ships, this implied that the ships with blue ensigns were warships attached to the squadron of Admiral Rainier, while the others were merchant ships under their protection. Dance was unknowingly assisted by the information that had reached Linois at Batavia, which claimed that there were 23 merchant ships and the brig in the convoy. Dance had collected six additional ships during his journey, and the identity of these were unknown to the French, who assumed that at least some of the unidentified vessels must be warships, particularly as several vessels had been recently painted at Canton to resemble ships of the line.

At 09:00 Linois was still only observing the convoy, reluctant to attack until he could be sure of the nature of his opponents. Dance responded to the reprieve by reforming the line of battle into sailing formation to increase his convoy's speed with the intention of reaching the Straits ahead of Linois. With the convoy a less intimidating target, Linois began to slowly approach the British ships. By 13:00 it was clear that Linois's faster ships were in danger of isolating the rear of the convoy, and Dance ordered his lead ships to <a href="tacking%20%28sailing%29">tack</a> and come about, so that they would cross in front of the French squadron. The British successfully executed the manoeuvre, and at 13:15 Linois opened fire on the lead ship—"Royal George"—under the command of John Fam Timmins. The "Royal George" and the next four ships in line, the Indiaman "Ganges", Dance's "Earl Camden", the "<a href="Warley%20%281796%20ship%29">Warley</a>" and the "Alfred", all returned fire, "Ganges" initially attacking "Royal George" in error. Captain James Prendergrass in "Hope", the next in line, was so eager to join the battle that he misjudged his speed and collided with "Warley", the ships falling back as their crews worked to separate their rigging. Shots were then exchanged at long range for 43 minutes, neither side inflicting severe damage.
"Royal George" had a sailor named Hugh Watt killed, another man wounded, and suffered some damage to her hull. None of the other British ships or any of the French reported anything worse than superficial damage in the engagement. At 14:00, Linois abandoned the action and ordered his squadron to haul away with the wind and sail eastwards, away from the convoy, under all sail. Determined to maintain the pretence of the presence of warships, Dance ordered the ships flying naval ensigns, including his flagship "Earl Camden", to chase the French. None of the merchant ships could match the French speed, but an attempt at a chase would hopefully dissuade the French from returning. For two hours, Dance's squadron followed Linois, "Hope" coming close to catching "Aventurier" but ultimately unable to overtake the brig. At 16:00, Dance decided to gather his scattered ships and return to his former heading rather than risk attack from other raiders or lose sight of his convoy in the darkness. By 20:00, the entire British convoy had anchored at the entrance to the Straits of Malacca. On 28 February, the British ships of the line and joined them in the Strait and conducted them safely to <a href="Saint%20Helena">Saint Helena</a> in the South Atlantic.

There escorted the convoy to England. Five whalers and the "Carmarthen", Captain Doree, also joined the convoy, with the "Blackhouse", from coast of Guinea, joining at sea. The convoy returned to England without further incident.

Linois's squadron reached Batavia several days after the action without encountering any British ships. He was there joined by "Atalante" and, after taking on supplies, made sail for Île de France, arriving on 2 April. The Dutch brig "Aventurier" was left at Batavia and remained there until a <a href="Raid%20on%20Batavia%20%281806%29">raid on the port</a> by a British force in November 1806, when it was destroyed. The French admiral later attempted to explain his conduct during the engagement:

Nathaniel Dance and his fellow captains were highly praised in the aftermath of the battle: in saving the convoy they had prevented both the HEIC and <a href="Lloyd%27s%20of%20London">Lloyd's of London</a> from likely financial ruin, the repercussions of which would have had profound effects across the British Empire. The various commanders and their crews were presented with a £50,000 prize fund to be divided among them, and the <a href="Lloyd%27s%20Patriotic%20Fund">Lloyd's Patriotic Fund</a> and other national and mercantile institutions made a series of awards of ceremonial swords, silver plate and monetary gifts to individual officers. Lloyd's Patriotic Fund gave each captain a sword worth 50 pounds, and one to Royal Navy Lieutenant <a href="Robert%20Merrick%20Fowler">Robert Merrick Fowler</a>, travelling as a passenger on "Earl Camden", and one worth 100 pounds to Nathaniel Dance.

Dance was specifically rewarded, receiving royal recognition when he was made a <a href="Knight%20Bachelor">Knight Bachelor</a> by <a href="George%20III%20of%20the%20United%20Kingdom">King George III</a>. He was also personally presented with the sum of £5,000 by the Bombay Insurance Company and an additional £500 a year for life by the HEIC. Dance immediately retired from the sea to <a href="Enfield%20Town">Enfield Town</a>, where he died in 1827. He refused to take full credit for the survival of the convoy, writing in reply to the award from the Bombay Insurance Company:

Among the passengers on the Indiamen were a number of Royal Navy personnel, survivors of the shipwreck of the exploratory vessel off the coast of <a href="New%20South%20Wales">New South Wales</a> the previous year. This party — carried aboard "Ganges", "Royal George" and "Earl Camden" — volunteered to assist the gun teams aboard their ships and Dance specifically thanked them in his account of the action. One was Lieutenant Robert Merrick Fowler, the former commander of "Porpoise", who distinguished himself in a variety of capacities during the engagement.

Some of the party had influential careers in the Navy, including the naval architect <a href="James%20Inman">James Inman</a>, who sailed on "Warley", and <a href="John%20Franklin">John Franklin</a>, who later became a polar explorer. Also aboard was Indian businessman <a href="Jamsetjee%20Jeejebhoy">Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy</a> returning from the second of his five voyages to China.

Linois continued his raiding, achieving some success against individual sailing ships, but failing to press successfully his numerical superiority against British naval forces; most notably at the <a href="Battle%20of%20Vizagapatam">Battle of Vizagapatam</a> on 15 September 1804 and the <a href="Action%20of%206%20August%201805">Action of 6 August 1805</a>. Ironically, Linois was eventually captured at the <a href="Action%20of%2013%20March%201806">Action of 13 March 1806</a> after mistaking a squadron of British ships of the line for a merchant convoy in the mid-Atlantic. Linois was concerned throughout the engagement for the safety of his ships: with the nearest dockyard over away at Île de France, he could not afford to suffer severe damage to his rigging or masts that would leave his squadron crippled. He also sought to defend his behaviour off Pulo Aura with the claim that the British convoy was protected by as many as eight ships of the line, and that he had performed heroically in saving his squadron from this overwhelming force. Subsequent historians have ridiculed this latter statement: <a href="William%20James%20%28naval%20historian%29">William James</a> wryly commented in his account of the action, written in 1827, that "it would be uncharitable to call into question the courage of Rear-admiral Linois" and <a href="William%20Laird%20Clowes">William Laird Clowes</a> stated in 1900 that "his timidity and want of enterprise threw away a great opportunity". <a href="Nicholas%20Rodger">Nicholas Rodger</a>, writing in 2004, was even more critical, insisting that "his [Linois's] officers do not seem to have been fooled, and it is extremely difficult to believe that he was." He goes on to suggest that no experienced seaman could possibly have mistaken a poorly manned and poorly trained merchant crew for the crew of a real Royal Navy ship of the line, concluding that "Linois had thrown away a prize worth at least £8 million through mere timidity". The most scathing criticism of Linois's conduct came from Napoleon himself, who wrote to <a href="List%20of%20Naval%20Ministers%20of%20France">Minister of Marine</a> <a href="Denis%20Decr%C3%A8s">Denis Decrès</a> on the subject, stating:

The battle has been fictionalised twice, in Captain <a href="Frederick%20Marryat">Frederick Marryat</a>'s 1832 novel "Newton Forster; or, the Merchant Service", and in <a href="Patrick%20O%27Brian">Patrick O'Brian</a>'s novel "<a href="HMS%20Surprise%20%28novel%29">HMS Surprise</a>", published in 1973. In O'Brian's novel, Royal Navy Captain Jack Aubrey aids the China Fleet, organizing the Indiamen who then succeeded as in history. The rewards were shed on Aubrey, rather than the lead merchant captain.

Hero of Belarus

Hero of Belarus (, "Hieroj Biełarusi"; ) is the highest <a href="Hero%20%28Title%29">title</a> that can be bestowed on a <a href="citizen">citizen</a> of <a href="Belarus">Belarus</a>. The title is awarded to those "who perform great deeds in the name of freedom, independence and prosperity of the Republic of Belarus". The deed can be for <a href="Military%20of%20Belarus">military</a> performance, <a href="Economy%20of%20Belarus">economic</a> performance or great service to the State and society. The design of the medal is similar to that of its predecessor, <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>. Similar titles to the Hero of Belarus include the <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Hero of the Russian Federation</a>, <a href="Hero%20of%20Ukraine">Hero of Ukraine</a>, and <a href="Hero%20of%20Uzbekistan">Hero of Uzbekistan</a>. Since its creation, the title has been awarded to ten people.

The title and other Belarusian state awards, their creation, nomination and awarding, are regulated by a set of legal documents: <a href="Constitution%20of%20Belarus">Belarusian Constitution</a>, Law N 288-З "About state awards of the Republic of Belarus" and presidential decrees.

The title was created by the <a href="Supreme%20Soviet%20of%20Belarus">Belarus Supreme Soviet</a> on April 13, 1995, with the passage of <a href="Resolution%20%28law%29">Resolution</a> N 3726-XII, titled "System of State Awards for the Republic of Belarus". Alongside the Hero of Belarus title, the resolution authorized the creation of <a href="medal">medal</a>s, <a href="Order%20%28decoration%29">orders</a>, and titles that can be presented by the Belarusian government. The creation of the awards was a way to honor those who have made valuable contributions to Belarus, irrespective of whether they were performed by a citizen or a foreigner.

This resolution was outlawed and replaced by Law N 288-З on May 18, 2004.

To be considered for title, a person must perform a deed that greatly benefits the state and Belarusian society at large. The title can be awarded to those serving in the military, public service or private enterprise. It can only be awarded once to an individual, and can be awarded <a href="Posthumous%20recognition">posthumously</a>. The official criteria are stated in Chapter 2, Article 5 of Law N 288-З. Chapter 3, Article 60 of Law N 288-З allows any group (association) of workers to submit a recommendation (petition) for an individual to be awarded the title. Governmental bodies, the <a href="National%20Assembly%20of%20Belarus">National Assembly</a>, the <a href="Government%20of%20Belarus">Council of Ministers</a>, cabinet officials and public unions, among others, are also eligible to submit nominations for the title. The candidate is evaluated, and if deemed worthy, the nomination is forwarded to the Council of Ministers and then, after having been allowed by the Governmental Secretariat of the <a href="Security%20Council%20of%20Belarus">Belarusian Security Council</a>, to the <a href="President%20of%20Belarus">President of the Republic</a>.

Under the Belarus Constitution (Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 84), the President of the Republic has the power to bestow state awards. To announce an award, the President issues a <a href="decree">decree</a> conferring the title to a person. Within two months, the title will be presented by the President in a formal setting, usually at the <a href="Independence%20Palace%2C%20Minsk">Independence Palace</a> in the capital city of <a href="Minsk">Minsk</a>. A certificate ("gramota") will also be presented to the recipient, signed by the President of the Republic.

Initially, social privileges for those, who achieved Hero of Belarus, according to the Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus under April 13, 1995 N 3727-XII, were equal to the privileges for people, whom <a href="Hero%20of%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of Soviet Union</a>, <a href="Hero%20of%20Socialist%20Labour">Hero of Socialist Labour</a>, <a href="Order%20of%20Glory">Order of Glory</a> or <a href="Order%20of%20Labor%20Glory">Order of Labor Glory</a> was given. These privileges are regulated by Resolution of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Belarus under February 21, 1995 N 3599-XII.

Now this question is regulated by Law of the Republic of Belarus under June 14, 2007 N 239-З "About social privileges, rights and guarantees to a definite category of citizens".

According to it, Heroes of Belarus have rights:
The consumptions, connected with these privileges, are financed from means of republican and local budgets and of governmental <a href="social%20insurance">social insurance</a>.

The recipient of the title is given a medal called the Medal of the Hero of Belarus (Belarusian: медаль Героя Беларусі, Russian: медаль Героя Беларуси). The star and suspension are made of <a href="gold">gold</a>, and thus it is nicknamed "<a href="Gold%20Star">Gold Star</a>", as was its predecessor, the <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Hero of the Soviet Union</a>. The star has a total <a href="diameter">diameter</a> of 33 millimeters, and is attached to a rectangular suspension device (boot tree). In the center of the rectangle is a ribbon of two sections of red and one section of green. The red and green bars on the ribbon evoke the design and colors of the <a href="Flag%20of%20Belarus">national flag</a>. The amount of gold is set at 585–1 Test, with the total <a href="weight">weight</a> of the medal being 19 <a href="grams">grams</a>. The present design was enacted into law by Presidential Decree Number 516 on September 6, 1999.

The design of the medal is modeled after one used for the Hero of the Soviet Union. Unlike the Hero of the Soviet Union, <a href="Hero%20of%20Socialist%20Labor">Hero of Socialist Labor</a> and the <a href="Hero%20of%20the%20Russian%20Federation">Hero of the Russian Federation</a> titles, there is no engraving on the reverse of the star. The ribbon also copies the Soviet Hero medal's ribbon, since a flag design was also used to make the ribbon of that medal. The medal is always worn in full on the left side of the breast above all other medals and orders. Chapter 4, Article 69 of Law N 288-З states that any awards and titles presented by the Soviet Union and the <a href="Byelorussian%20SSR">Byelorussian SSR</a> must be placed after awards from the Republic of Belarus.

When the title was created, a suggested medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is the design of the suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with <a href="ruby">rubies</a>. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the <a href="Marshal%27s%20Star">Marshal's Star</a>, which <a href="Marshal%20of%20the%20Soviet%20Union">Soviet Marshals</a> wore around their necks. This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.

The first award in history was given to <a href="Uladzimir%20Karvat">Uladzimir Karvat</a> (posthumous) in 1996. The first "group awarding" took place on June 30, 2001 to <a href="Pavel%20Mariev">Pavel Mariev</a>, <a href="Mikhail%20Karchmit">Mikhail Karchmit</a>, <a href="Vital%20Kramko">Vital Kramko</a> and <a href="Alaksandar%20Dubko">Alaksandar Dubko</a> (posthumous), while <a href="Kirill%20Vakhromeev">Kirill Vakhromeev</a>, <a href="Mikhail%20Savicki">Mikhail Savicki</a>, Mikhail Vysotsky, <a href="Pyotr%20Prakapovich">Pyotr Prakapovich</a> and Vasily Revyako were presented their titles on March 1, 2006.

Uladzimir Karvat, a military pilot, was flying his training aircraft <a href="Sukhoi%20Su-27">Sukhoi Su-27</a>p on May 23, 1996. The plane caught fire and Karvat was ordered to eject to safety. Unknown to the ground crew, the plane would have crashed in an area full of civilians. Seeing the civilians on the ground, Karvat steered the plane away until it crashed one kilometer from the <a href="Brest%20Voblast">Brest Voblast</a> settlements of <a href="Arabawshchyna">Arabawshchyna</a> and <a href="Vyalikaye%20Hatsishcha">Vyalikaye Hatsishcha</a>, killing him instantly. President <a href="Alexander%20Lukashenko">Alexander Lukashenko</a> issued Decree Number 484 on November 21, 1996, which posthumously awarded Karvat the title Hero of Belarus. The crash site has been converted to a memorial for Karvat, where a copy of Lukashenko's decree is on the tail fin of the Sukhoi Su-27p.

Pavel Mariev was awarded the title for his work in the automobile industry as manager of <a href="Belarusian%20Auto%20Works">Belarusian Auto Works</a>, a leading producer of Belarusian automobiles.

Vital Kramko and Mikhail Karchmit were awarded for their work in the agriculture industry. Kramko is the chairman of the <a href="Hrodna%20Voblast">Hrodna Voblast</a> agricultural collective "October", while Karchmit was the director of the <a href="Minsk%20Voblast">Minsk Voblast</a> cooperative "Snov" until his death in 2004.

Drapier's Letters

Drapier's Letters is the collective name for a series of seven <a href="pamphlet">pamphlet</a>s written between 1724 and 1725 by the <a href="dean%20%28religion%29">Dean</a> of <a href="St.%20Patrick%27s%20Cathedral%2C%20Dublin">St Patrick's Cathedral</a> in Dublin, <a href="Jonathan%20Swift">Jonathan Swift</a>, to arouse public opinion in Ireland against the imposition of a privately minted copper coinage that Swift believed to be of <a href="Debasement">inferior quality</a>. <a href="William%20Wood%20%28Mintmaster%29">William Wood</a> was granted <a href="letters%20patent">letters patent</a> to mint the coin, and Swift saw the licensing of the patent as corrupt. In response, Swift represented Ireland as constitutionally and financially independent of Britain in the "Drapier's Letters". Since the subject was politically sensitive, Swift wrote under the pseudonym "M. B., Drapier", to hide from retaliation.

Although the letters were condemned by the Irish government, with prompting from the British government, they were still able to inspire popular sentiment against Wood and his patent. The popular sentiment turned into a nationwide boycott, which forced the patent to be withdrawn; Swift was later honoured for this service to the people of Ireland. Many Irish people recognised Swift as a hero for his defiance of British control over the Irish nation. Beyond being a hero, many critics have seen Swift, through the persona of the Drapier, as the first to organise a "more universal Irish community", although it is disputed as to who constitutes that community. Regardless of to whom Swift is actually appealing what he may or may not have done, the nickname provided by <a href="Archbishop%20King">Archbishop King</a>, "Our Irish Copper-Farthen Dean", and his connection to ending the controversy stuck.

The first complete collection of the "Drapier's Letters" appeared in the 1734 <a href="George%20Faulkner">George Faulkner</a> edition of the "Works" of Jonathan Swift along with an <a href="allegory">allegorical</a> frontispiece offering praise and thanks from the Irish people. Today, the "Drapier's Letters" are an important part of Swift's political writings, along with "<a href="Gulliver%27s%20Travels">Gulliver's Travels</a>" (1726), "<a href="A%20Tale%20of%20a%20Tub">A Tale of a Tub</a>" (1704), and "<a href="A%20Modest%20Proposal">A Modest Proposal</a>" (1729).

In 1722, hardware manufacturer William Wood was granted letters patent to produce copper coinage of up to £108,000 (around £ as of 2019) for use in Ireland. The patent was secured by a bribe of £10,000 (around £ as of 2019) to the <a href="Ehrengard%20Melusine%20von%20der%20Schulenburg%2C%20Duchess%20of%20Kendal%20and%20Munster">Duchess of Kendal</a>, mistress to King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Great%20Britain">George I</a>. Although Wood's copper coins were subsequently alleged to be underweight, undersized, and made from inferior materials, <a href="Trial%20of%20the%20Pyx">assay</a>s had found they were not so, prior to their approval by the British Parliament for use in Ireland.

The Irish complaint against Wood was not that they had enough copper coins, but that this would introduce too many coins of inferior quality into the Irish economy. These coins would remove valuable silver and gold coins from circulation in the Irish economy, and since the new copper coins would not be minted under Irish authority, no way existed for the Irish to control the quality and amount. Also, Wood's coin was only one example of allegedly unfavourable economic practices that hurt Ireland; the Irish wanted to have their own national bank and authority to mint their own coinage, and Wood's coin became a way to express their economic-nationalist desires.

The patent issue soon became a struggle between Prime Minister <a href="Robert%20Walpole">Robert Walpole</a> (with the authority of the British Parliament) and the leaders of Ireland. All attempts by the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20Ireland">Irish Privy Council</a> and the <a href="Church%20of%20Ireland">Church of Ireland</a> to prevent the release of the coinage proved fruitless. It was soon thought by many that <a href="William%20Conolly">William Conolly</a>’s <a href="Office%20of%20the%20Revenue%20Commissioners">Commissioners of the Revenue</a> might pay the soldiers stationed in Ireland with the new coin; if the soldiers were paid with the coin, then the merchants of Ireland would be forced to accept the coin from the soldiers or risk military reprisal or a loss of business. This worried the leadership of Ireland and they requested help in challenging Wood's patent and leading a boycott of the coin. Swift was asked by Archbishop King and <a href="Alan%20Brodrick%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Midleton">Lord Chancellor Midleton</a> to contribute to a pamphleteering campaign against Wood's coin.

During this time, <a href="John%20Carteret%2C%202nd%20Earl%20Granville">Lord Carteret</a>, the British <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20%28United%20Kingdom%29">Secretary of State</a> whose <a href="Secretary%20of%20State%20for%20the%20Southern%20Department">remit included Ireland</a>, publicly pushed Walpole into defending Wood's patent. However, Carteret privately attempted to destroy the patent to damage Walpole's reputation. Thus, Carteret appeared to the British as a defender of the patent because he seemingly tried to prevent an Irish uprising against British rule (especially by finding the "Drapier"), but he was really furthering his anti-Walpole agenda and aiding the Irish cause.

Jonathan Swift, then Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral in <a href="Dublin">Dublin</a>, was already known for his concern for the Irish people and for writing several political pamphlets. One of these, "Proposal for the Universal use of Irish Manufacture" (1720), had so inflamed the British authorities that the printer, John Harding, was prosecuted, although the pamphlet had done little more than recommend that the Irish use the materials they produce rather than export them to England. Also, the Irish authorities knew that Swift's political pamphleteering had been employed by the <a href="Tory">Tory</a> government of <a href="Anne%2C%20Queen%20of%20Great%20Britain">Queen Anne</a>, and that he would use his abilities to undermine the <a href="Whig%20%28British%20political%20faction%29">Whig</a> government of Walpole.
Swift analysed the forensic and economic disadvantages of Wood's inferior coinage and the effects it would have over Ireland in the first of the pamphlets, "A Letter to the Shop-keepers" (1724). In the pamphlet, Swift adopted the persona of the "Drapier": a common Irishman, a talented and skilled <a href="draper">draper</a>, a religiously devout individual who believes in scripture, and a man loyal to both the Church of Ireland and to the King of Ireland. Swift's pseudonymous choice served two essential purposes: it provided him with an alternate persona which he could use to hide from potential political reprisals, and it allowed him to create an identity that was closely aligned with the common people of Ireland.

According to 20th-century Swift scholar Irvin Ehrenpreis, debate arose in the academic community over how much Swift may have wished his audience to identify him as the Drapier, especially since the Drapier constantly includes religious imagery that was common to Swift's sermons. However, the religious rhetoric probably used to justify an Irish rebellion against the coinage is merely meant as an important aspect of the Drapier's identity without it being meant as evidence that Swift was the author. Regardless of how secret Swift may have wanted his identity to be, most people in Ireland, including members of the Irish Privy Council, certainly knew that Swift was the author of the letters. Unfortunately for the Walpole administration, little legal proof was available of a relationship between the two that would justify them trying Swift as the "Drapier".

Over the course of a year, four more pamphlets, filled with invective and complaints against both Wood and his patent, followed the first. The pamphlet was successful, and public opinion became so hostile against Wood's coinage that the patent was withdrawn by 1725. At one point, Lord Carteret and the Irish Privy Council offered a significant reward of £300 for information that would verify the identity of the pamphlet's author, but Swift was neither arrested nor charged for the works. The lack of an arrest and the unity of the Irish people behind the "Drapier" was an important motivating factor behind Walpole's withdrawal of the patent.

Although Swift knew that the Duchess of Kendal was responsible for selling the patent to Wood, he rarely mentions this fact in the "Letters". Instead, his first three letters describe Wood as the mastermind behind the patent. Although the Drapier constantly asserts his loyalty to the King, his words did not prevent accusations of <a href="treason">treason</a> from being levelled against him in response to the third and fourth letters.

In the third and fourth letters, Swift argues that the Irish deserve independence from England, but not from the king. This, of all of the Drapier's arguments, is what agitated Walpole, as the head of the British Parliament, the most. Thus, the Drapier was condemned like <a href="William%20Molyneux">William Molyneux</a>, whose "Case of Ireland" (1698) pleaded for Irish independence using the same arguments. The claims of treason levelled against the Drapier were of "treason to the English Parliament", which only caused more resentment among the Irish people, who sided with Swift's constitutional argument that the Irish people owed their allegiance only to the king.

The first three pamphlets were written as a set intended to conclude the matter. However, when Lord Carteret was sent to control Ireland and placed a bounty on the Drapier's head, Swift felt that a fourth pamphlet was necessary. The fifth (in this list) was written at the height of the controversy over Wood's coin, and constitutes the final public writing of "the Drapier". The letter "To the Lord Chancellor Middleton" was signed with Swift's name and not collected until Faulkner's 1735 edition. The last letter, "An Humble Address", was also published after the conflict had ended.

The Drapier's first letter, "To the Shop-keepers, Tradesmen, Farmers, and Common-People of Ireland", was printed in March 1724. Shortly afterwards, a copy of the first letter was forwarded by Swift to Lord Carteret on 28 April 1724, and knowledge of the letter's contents had spread all the way to London. By April 1724, the letter was popular and Swift claimed that over 2,000 copies had been sold in Dublin. The letter was retitled "Fraud Detected: or, The Hibernian Patriot" by Faulkner's "Dublin Journal", which published the piece in 1725. "Fraud Detected" was later used by Faulkner as the title of the collection of the first five letters, published after the patent controversy ended.

The Drapier introduces his subject by invoking the duty of his readers as "Christians, as parents, and as lovers of your country". His purpose is to introduce the background of Wood's coin and then he suggests a boycott similar to the one in his "Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture". Throughout his monetary arguments, the Drapier constantly acknowledges how humble his station in life is, and incorporates theological and classical allusions to mock Wood. The Drapier places the blame for the coin upon Wood, stating: "It is no treason to rebel against Mr Wood."

There are many religious overtones similar to <a href="Sermons%20of%20Dean%20Swift">Swift's sermons</a>, such as the Drapier's combination of a duty to God with duty to one's king and country. Many critics compare the language and rhetorical style of the first letter to a <a href="Prophet%23Judaism">Hebrew prophet</a> or to an <a href="Evangelicalism">evangelical preacher</a> who warns the masses of an imminent threat to their soul. However, the <a href="Last%20Judgment">final judgment</a> had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and the souls of the citizenry.

One of the concerns of the Irish discussed in the first letter was over what is now known as <a href="Gresham%27s%20law">Gresham's law</a>: debased coins would cause silver and gold coinage to be hoarded or removed from the country, which would further debase the currency. Tenant farmers would no longer be able to pay their landlords, and, after the tenants were removed, there would be fewer crops grown in Ireland; the increase of poverty and the decrease of food supply would completely ruin Ireland's economy.

Although some critics and historians view the language and examples employed by the Drapier to describe the possible economic harms as over the top, others consider that Swift's imagery was grounded in truth. Even Swift's satire of Wood's character is based on actual evidence and added very little to what Wood provided the public through his words and actions. Although the Drapier emphasises Wood's involvement and not the king's, glosses of the first letter reveal allusions to Wood bribing the Duchess of Kendal that obscure the distinction to the careful reader. However, the Drapier always respects the king as leader of the Irish nation and the Irish church, although some critics see his bold language and free use of the king's name and title as undermining those positions. The Drapier makes sure that Wood appears to be the primary target, which, when combined with only an indirect attack upon people at the top of the British political system, reassured the people of Ireland that they could rebel against an "insignificant hardware man".

The Drapier's second letter, "A Letter to Mr. Harding the Printer, upon Occasion of a Paragraph in his News-Paper of 1 August, relating to Mr. Wood's Half-Pence", was printed on 4 August 1724, in response to the <a href="Her%20Majesty%27s%20Most%20Honourable%20Privy%20Council">British Privy Council</a>'s testing of Wood's coin.

The Drapier alludes to the involvement of the Duchess of Kendall in his first letter; in the second, the Drapier de-emphasises her involvement and shifts his focus to blame the <a href="British%20Whig%20Party">Whig</a> party. According to the Drapier, the Whigs are the ones who Wood bribed in securing his patent. The central target for this letter is the Privy Council's report produced under the authority of Walpole. It was necessary for the Drapier to attack the report to ensure that the people would be willing to resist the coin and deny the "truth" that Wood's supporters issued. Therefore, the Drapier describes them as "only a few Betrayers of their Country, Confederates with "Woods"".

The Drapier does not directly attack <a href="Isaac%20Newton">Isaac Newton</a>'s assay of Wood's coin, but instead attacks the process behind the assay and the witnesses who testified before the Privy Council. In his criticism of the Privy Council's report, the Drapier claims that the report is part of Wood's propaganda and lies, because Wood released three proposals concurrent with the report: lowering the patent production quota from £100,800 to £40,000 worth; that no one is obliged to accept more than five pence halfpenny per transaction; and to sell the coin at 2<a href="British%20shilling%20coin">s</a> 1<a href="Penny%20%28British%20pre-decimal%20coin%29">d</a> a pound or his raw copper at 1s 8d a pound. Wood's choice of wording, that the Irish would be "obliged" to accept the coin, was criticised by the Drapier who then accused Wood of "perfect "High Treason"" for obliging the people to take any copper coin when the king lacked the constitutional authority to do such a thing.

In the second letter, the Drapier walks a careful line between openly indicting the king and merely hinting at his relationship with Wood's patent; while the Drapier accuses Wood, he constantly refers to the king's authority and power to issue legal tender (this is called "the King's Prerogative"). In particular, the Drapier claims that the king is unable to force his people to accept any copper based currency. As the Drapier points out, the constitution establishing Ireland as a kingdom limits the authority of the monarch because it forces the people of Ireland to use only gold or silver coins as official currency. Throughout this argument, the Drapier compares the king's ability to print money with the petty amount of political power held by Wood, which undermines the image of the king as the supreme authority in Ireland while hinting that the king is not protecting the rights of the Irish people. The Drapier stops himself before he commits treason, and he instead argues that the king would never accept a patent that could harm Ireland; to the Drapier, the king would never act in such a way as to help Wood harm the people of Ireland.

In response to calls for action from the Drapier in the second letter, a group of bankers joined together on 17 August 1724, agreeing in writing that they would not accept the coin produced under Wood's patent. Other merchants and tradesmen followed in a similar fashion. However, this did not stop Walpole from ordering the Commissioners of the Revenue in Ireland to enter the coin into the Irish economy. Regardless of Walpole's orders, the Irish Lord Justices did not act, <a href="Henry%20Boyle%2C%201st%20Earl%20of%20Shannon">Lord Shannon</a> did not command that his troops should be issued Wood's coin, and Middleton's House of Lords and Conolly's House of Commons did not pass any resolution backing up Walpole's order, which effectively prevented the coin from being distributed.

The Drapier's third letter, "To the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom of Ireland: Some Observations Upon a Paper, Call'd, The Report of the Committee of the Most Honourable the Privy-Council in England relating to Wood's Half-pence", was printed on 25 August 1724.

The subject matter of the third letter is similar to that of the second letter, and some scholars have explained this as a result of Swift being forced to respond so quickly to the Privy-council's report. The Drapier emphasises his humble nature and simple understanding when appealing to the pride of his audience, the nobility.

The Drapier spends most of his letter responding to the "Report of the Committee of the Most Honourable the Privy-Councill in England". This document released by Walpole served as a defence of Wood's coin; the report argued that the coin was important to the people of Ireland. However, the report was not officially released by Walpole in the Parliament's "Gazette", but published without Parliament's authority in the "London Journal" in August 1724. Some scholars have speculated that Walpole had the report published in a non-Parliamentary magazine so that he would not be connected directly to Wood's coin. However, the lack of Parliamentary authority behind the report allowed the Drapier to undermine the credibility of the report's content.

The Drapier claims, "Mr. Wood in publishing this paper would insinuate to the world, as if the Committee had a greater concern for his credit and private emolument, than for the honour of the Privy-council and both Houses of Parliament here ... For it seems intended as a vindication of Mr. Wood, not without several severe remarks on the Houses of Lords and Commons of Ireland." To the Drapier, Wood has utter contempt for the political authority of Ireland, and would use his coin and the report to mock them. However, the attack extends beyond Wood to encompass a dispute about the authority of England to rule over the kingdom of Ireland.

The central argument in the letter is that the British have negated the rights of the Irish people by relying on a completely British system to pass the patent without allowing the <a href="Parliament%20of%20Ireland">Irish Parliament</a> a say. William Wood, according to the Drapier, was already involved in a similar dispute with a coin he minted for <a href="Massachusetts">Massachusetts</a>. Wood, the Drapier claims, "hath already tried his Faculty in "New-England", and I hope he will meet with an EQUAL RECEPTION here; what "That" was I leave to the Publick Intelligence." The response to Wood's coin was a complete boycott of the coin.

The Drapier does not blame the production of the coining on Walpole's policies, in regard to England's colonies, but on Wood's (and his accomplice's) actions This criticism of Wood's actions allows the Drapier to attack the patent process in such a way that could not be used directly against the British Parliament. In referring to this point, the Drapier asks, "Were not the People of "Ireland" born as Free as those of "England"?"

The final image of this letter is that of the small but brave <a href="David">David</a> versus the giant <a href="Goliath">Goliath</a>. Wood is the giant invader who wears his brass coin as armour and the Drapier is just the small merchant who is not big enough to fill the king's armour. This image resonated with the people, and a sign was displayed by people of Dublin which read:

The third letter openly incorporates Swift's argument that political authority stems from the consent of a population. As such, the third letter has been seen as a response in part to the <a href="Dependency%20of%20Ireland%20on%20Great%20Britain%20Act%201719">Declaratory Act</a>, which had undermined the independence and the authority of Irish legislature and judiciary in favour of the British. The Declaratory Act removed the ability for any in Ireland to speak for the people of Ireland, and it was necessary for the act to be removed before the people could be heard.

However, such an attack on the Declaratory Act was common in Swift's works, and he constantly argued against the act by promoting Irish autonomy. This does not mean that the Irish independence is to be taken lightly, because Swift viewed the self-reliance as "the only means of halting their [the Irish/Irish Protestant] self-destructive complicity – of which they were inadequately aware – in England's ongoing consumption of Ireland."

The Drapier's fourth letter, "To the Whole People of Ireland, A Word or Two to the People of Ireland, A Short Defense of the People of Ireland", was written on 13 October 1724 and was either published on 21 October 1724 or on 22 October 1724, the day Lord Carteret arrived in Dublin. Throughout the letter, the Drapier pretends that Carteret's transfer to Ireland to enforce Wood's patent was a rumour produced by Wood's allies, although Swift had knowledge to the contrary.

The fourth letter was written in response to the many charges put forth by the British supporters of Wood's patent against the Irish, including claims of papal influence and of treason. A large portion of the letter is a response to these accusations and to refuting further arguments that Wood's coin could be beneficial to the Irish people. The tone of the letter is clear: Wood's allies are promoting an evil that will harm Ireland. However, Wood is only a secondary target—figures like Walpole are mocked for their role in the controversy.

The majority of the fourth letter is devoted to an argument revolving around the political liberty of the Irish people. It is for this argument that the Drapier was persecuted, because his words were seen as a call to challenge British authority and possibly to declare independence from the king. The Drapier walks a fine line between loyalty and disloyalty, because he charges that the Irish are loyal only to their king, who had the title "King of Ireland", but not to England. To this the Drapier states:

In defence of his nation, the Drapier turns around claims of treason and papal loyalty against Wood and his defenders (especially Walpole), calling them as treasonous as the <a href="Williamite%20War%20in%20Ireland">Jacobite rebels</a> and the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">Parliamentary rebels</a>. The Drapier believed that God's providence supported the people of Ireland, but his will required the people of Ireland to stand up against the treasonous British.

The most famous and controversial statement of the "Drapier's Letters" follows claims of loyalty to the Irish king:
This line of argument follows the political philosophy of <a href="John%20Locke">John Locke</a> in the "<a href="Two%20Treatises%20on%20Government">Two Treatises on Government</a>" (1689). Locke wrote that the people had the right to resist their government when their property rights were violated, and that nations have the same sovereign rights even when they have been conquered by another.

A secondary rhetorical battle began between Walpole and the Irish in regard to Wood's patent; the rest of the constitutional debate was over the nature of <a href="Poynings%27%20Law">Poynings' Law</a>, a law that was brought back into use through the Declaratory Act (1720). Poyning's Law was a law that the British claimed allowed them to control all of Ireland's legal actions and to revoke the Irish parliamentary independence. Traditionally, the rulers of Ireland viewed themselves as a kingdom and not a colony that would be controlled by Poyning's Law. The Drapier agreed with the Irish interpretation of the law and incorporated aspects of Molyneux's arguments that combined proof the law was misinterpreted and Locke's political philosophy.

Lord Carteret read passages from the fourth letter about Irish constitutional independence to the <a href="Privy%20Council%20of%20Ireland">Irish Privy Council</a> and claimed that they were treasonable. It was then that Harding was arrested for printing the letters and a reward of £300 was offered for the identity of the Drapier. Lord Carteret wrote that the arrest and bounty were the result of an "unfortunate accident" and he did not want to respond in such a way. Lord Midleton was also forced to denounce his previous ally, the Drapier, when did so when he wrote, "to provoke England to that degree as some have endeavoured to do, is not the true way to keep them out". Archbishop King responded to the letters by saying they were "ludicrous and satyrically writ". However, the Archbishop publicly supported the constitutional actions more than the other three, and his support caused others important officials to criticise him.

Regardless of the proclamation against the Drapier and the words issued by important Irish officials, the people of Ireland had stood by the writer, and it was their support that protected Swift. Some critics have viewed this support as resulting from the letter's appeal to the "mob", or common people, of Ireland.

The Drapier's fifth letter, "A Letter To the Honourable the Lord Viscount Molesworth, at his House at Brackdenstown, near Swords" was published on 31 December 1724. The letter includes the most pseudo-biographical information on the Drapier.

This letter is seen as the final salvo in the Drapier's fight against Wood's patent. Although there was a possible agreement between Carteret and Walpole over ending the patent, Swift found it necessary to publish this defence of the fourth letter to ensure that Walpole would not back down from his promise of removing the patent. It has also been seen as a letter celebrating Harding's release from being tried for printing the Drapier's letters.

The Drapier begins his letter with three quotations: <a href="Psalm%20109">Psalm 109</a>, <a href="Sirach">Ecclesiasticus/Sirach 7</a>, and <a href="Virgil">Virgil</a>'s "<a href="Aeneid">Aeneid</a>" Book Five. With these passages, he sets the tone for his own defence by appealing to both the reason and the religious sentiments of his audience to prove his innocence:
Some critics argue that Swift did not need to defend himself, and "To Viscount Molesworth" was written to gloat. However, the essence of the letter encourages the Irish to remember the actions of Walpole, Wood, and the British Parliament. By willingly throwing himself before the judgement of his fellow Irishmen and before the final judgement of God, the Drapier claims that he is and always will be on the correct side of the argument.

Other critics emphasise that the letter's object, Lord Molesworth, was targeted to bind the higher and lower classes together. Using Molesworth, a <a href="English%20Dissenters">religious dissenter</a>, a nobleman, and the opposite of Swift, the Drapier unites all of the various people of Ireland in a common nationalist cause. Instead of defending charges against himself, the Drapier is calling up more support for the Irish cause; he seeks attention so that the greater liberty of Ireland will be respected.

The letter serves one other purpose: to delight in the Drapier's lack of being captured and his victory over Whitshed. <a href="William%20Whitshed">William Whitshed</a>, <a href="Lord%20Chief%20Justice%20of%20Ireland">Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench in Ireland</a>, was the one who actually arrested Harding and sought to convict him of printing treasonous materials. A letter written anonymously by Swift, "Seasonable Advice to the Grand-Jury", motivated the Irish jury to stand up against Whitshed and release the printer. The Drapier hints at the letter and the freeing of Harding when he lists many other works written by Jonathan Swift, and, in the process, nearly reveals his own identity. However, his tone may not be mocking, as he could just be flaunting his own position, and some have credited this idea to the incorporation of so many Biblical and Classical allusions beyond the three that begin the letter. Scholar Herbert Davis declared this letter is "in some ways the best written of all the "Letters"".

The sixth letter during the Drapier's campaign, "To the Lord Chancellor Middleton", is dated 26 October 1724, and was written as a private letter from Jonathan Swift to <a href="Alan%20Brodrick%2C%201st%20Viscount%20Midleton">Alan Brodrick, Lord Midleton</a> (with the misspelling of his title). It is not a true "Drapier" letter, because the author professes to be different from the Drapier, although he was known to be one and the same by Lord Midleton. <a href="Walter%20Scott">Sir Walter Scott</a> includes this letter as number five, although Faulkner, Sheridan, Deane Swift, Hawkesworth and Nichols label it as number six.

The purpose of the sixth letter was to ensure that Midleton would stay true to his opposition of Wood's patent. Although the extent to which Midleton was influenced by the letter cannot be known, it is certain that Midleton believed that the patent would harm Ireland and that he would resist it at all costs. Regardless, Swift wrote the letter to express himself in a way that the Drapier could not: as the dean of a great, Irish cathedral. He asserts his status to verify that the Drapier's intentions must be good. In essence, the letter rehashes many of the previous letters' arguments to draw Midleton into openly supporting the Drapier's actions. Swift also admits to actively working against the patent, and mentions how his <a href="Sermons%20of%20Dean%20Swift%23On%20Doing%20Good">"On Doing Good" sermon</a> is similar to the ideas expressed by the Drapier.

The Drapier's last letter, "An Humble Address to Both Houses of Parliament", was completed in June 1725. It was written before Wood's patent was defeated, and it was stopped from being printed when word reached Swift that the patent had been withdrawn. This letter remained unpublished for 10 years.

The letter challenges the Ireland's parliament to investigate how Wood originally attained the patent, even though most in power knew that the patent was the result of bribery. Although nothing new would be discovered in an investigation, the letter served the purpose of trying to unite the people of Ireland to fight for further economic freedom. The Drapier refers to Ireland's lack of economic freedom when he claims, the Irish "are altogether Losers, and "England" a Gainer". Swift's intentions behind the letter are uncertain, and some critics believe that Swift did not desire such an investigation into Wood's supporters while others contend that Swift was serious about promoting a public inquiry into the matter.

The topics the Drapier addresses span from <a href="absentee%20landlord">absentee land owners</a> to importing of goods from Britain to the favouring of Englishmen over Irishmen for Irish governmental positions. These issues were the many issues that Swift cared about and saw as threatening Ireland before Wood's halfpence controversy. However, these individual issues were not as important as the independence and unity of Ireland: the specifics of independence were less important than self-rule. Some argue that Swift, after Wood's patent was withdrawn, removed himself from the political landscape to focus on writing "<a href="Gulliver%27s%20Travels">Gulliver's Travels</a>", in which he picked up many of the same ideas.

John Harding published the first four letters before he was arrested and the fifth after his release. After Harding's death, George Faulkner became Swift's primary publisher in Ireland, and "A Letter to the Lord Chancellor Middleton" and "An Humble Address" were copied from manuscript copies provided by the author to Faulkner and then printed with the other letters. The "Drapier's Letters" were first collected and published in their entirety by Faulkner in 1735.

On 9 February 1733, Faulkner advertised his future publication of Swift's collected works in four volumes, the first containing the "Drapier's Letters", in the "Dublin Journal". However, this edition led to the <a href="Motte%20v%20Faulkner">Motte v Faulkner (1735) lawsuit</a>, since the London bookseller Benjamin Motte had publication rights, under <a href="Statute%20of%20Anne">British copyright legislation</a>, to many of the works included in Faulkner's edition. Although the "Drapier's Letters" were not under copyright, the complete work was legally brought to a halt from being published in England by a ruling on 28 November 1735. It is uncertain if Swift allowed Faulkner to publish the works to allow an Irish publisher to compete against a British publisher or if Swift had no say in the matter and Faulkner published the works against Swift's will. In a letter to Motte in May 1736, Swift did not defend Faulkner's legal right to publish the works. Instead, Swift admonished Motte for prosecuting Faulkner instead of coming to an agreement that would allow Faulkner to reprint the copyrighted material.

Although the original printing of the "Drapier's Letters" resulted in the arrest of Harding and a <a href="bounty%20%28reward%29">bounty</a> placed upon the Drapier's head, Swift's actions in defending Ireland were deemed heroic among the Irish citizenry. He was titled the "Hibernian patriot" for his actions. Some residents of Dublin placed banners and signs in the city to recognise Swift's deeds, and images from the letters, such as the Drapier comparing his campaign to <a href="David">David</a> fighting <a href="Goliath">Goliath</a>, became themes in popular literature. Scholar Herbert Davis claims that by the end of 1725, Swift was "the Darling of the populace; His Image and Superscription on a great many Sign-Posts" in Ireland.

Swift did not fully embrace his popularity, but he enjoyed it. On his birthday, 30 November 1727, a large group of men came to St. Patrick's Cathedral to pray and afterwards celebrate throughout the city. This gathering commemorated Swift and his letters and also protested against the harsh British treatment of Ireland.

According to Robert Mahony, the "Drapier's Letters", especially the fourth, were later praised by Irish nationalists. However, as he continued, many recent critics have re-examined this nationalistic claim and asserted a counterclaim that Swift is speaking more for the Protestants of Ireland than for the entire nation. Many critics, including Carol Fabricant, have asked who "the Whole People of Ireland" are, "who" the "Drapier's Letters" are speaking "to", and if Swift has the right, as a Protestant Englishman, to speak for the entire nation. R. F. Foster believes that Swift represented "<a href="Protestant%20Ascendancy">Ascendancy</a> attitudes," but this view is not held by all. Some critics, like Joep Leerssen, believe that Swift's work contributed greatly to a common Irish nationalism regardless of religious affiliation, and that Swift was able to relate to all of Ireland through a unified suffering under the British rule. In overall effect, Fabricant argued that Swift's ability to speak for the whole populace is further suggested by the wide consensus opposed to the coinage plan. Along with this, Swift was able to rhetorically extend natural rights, in the "Drapier's Letters", to all people of Ireland without any regard to restriction.

A Contract with God

A Contract with God and Other Tenement Stories is a <a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a> by American cartoonist <a href="Will%20Eisner">Will Eisner</a> published in 1978. The book's <a href="short%20story%20cycle">short story cycle</a> revolves around poor Jewish characters who live in a <a href="tenement">tenement</a> in <a href="New%20York%20City">New York City</a>. Eisner produced two sequels set in the same tenement: "<a href="A%20Life%20Force">A Life Force</a>" in 1988, and "<a href="Dropsie%20Avenue">Dropsie Avenue</a>" in 1995. Though the term "graphic novel" did not originate with Eisner, the book is credited with popularizing its use.

Four stand-alone stories make up the book: in "A Contract with God" a religious man gives up his faith after the death of his young adopted daughter; in "The Street Singer" a has-been diva tries to seduce a poor, young street singer, who tries to take advantage of her in turn; a bullying racist is led to suicide after false accusations of pedophilia in "The Super"; and "Cookalein" intertwines the stories of several characters vacationing in the <a href="Catskill%20Mountains">Catskill Mountains</a>. The stories are thematically linked with motifs of frustration, disillusionment, violence, and issues of ethnic identity. Eisner uses large, monochromatic images in dramatic perspective, and emphasizes the caricatured characters' facial expressions; few panels or captions have traditional borders around them.

Eisner began his comic book career in 1936 and had long held artistic ambitions for what was perceived as a lowbrow medium. He found no support for his ideas, and left the world of commercial comics after ending his signature work "<a href="Spirit%20%28comics%29">The Spirit</a>" in 1952. The growth of comics fandom convinced him to return in the 1970s, and he worked to realize his aspirations of creating comics with literary content. He wanted a mainstream publisher for the book and to have it sold in traditional bookstores, rather than in <a href="Direct%20market">comic book shops</a>; the small press Baronet Books released "A Contract with God" in 1978 and marketed it as a "graphic novel", which thereafter became the common term for book-length comics. It sold slowly at first, but gained respect from Eisner's peers, and since has been reprinted by larger publishers. "A Contract with God" cemented Eisner's reputation as an elder statesman of comics, and he continued to produce graphic novels and theoretical works on comics until his death in 2005.

"A Contract with God" mixes <a href="melodrama">melodrama</a> with <a href="social%20realism">social realism</a>. Following an author's introduction, "A Tenement in the Bronx", the book contains four stories set in a <a href="tenement">tenement</a> building; they derive in part from Eisner's personal memories growing up in a tenement in the Bronx. With "A Contract with God" he aimed to explore an area of Jewish-American history that he felt was underdocumented, while showing that capable of mature literary expression, at a time when it received little such regard as an artistic medium. In the preface he stated his aim to keep the exaggeration in his cartooning within realistic limits.

The story "A Contract with God" drew from Eisner's feelings over the death at sixteen of his daughter Alice. In his introduction to the 2006 edition of the book, Eisner first wrote about it and the feelings he felt toward God that were reflected in the story. "The Street Singer" and "The Super" are fiction, but sprang from Eisner's memories of people he had met in the tenements of his youth. "Cookalein" was the most autobiographical—the main character "Willie" even carries Eisner's own boyhood nickname. Eisner remarked that "it took a lot of determination, a kind of courage, to write that story".

The stories' sexual content is prominent, though not in the gratuitous manner of ' celebration of hedonism, which contrasted with the conservative lifestyle of Eisner the middle-aged businessman. Eisner used no profanity in the book, and according to critic Josh Lambert the sex in "Contract" is not so much erotic as disturbing, the characters frustrated or filled with guilt.

In Russia, the young, deeply religious <a href="Hasidic%20Judaism">Hasidic Jew</a> Frimme Hersh carves a contract with God on a stone tablet to live a life of good deeds; he attributes to it his later success in life. He moves to New York, into a tenement building at 55 Dropsie Avenue, and lives a simple life devoted to God. He adopts an infant girl, Rachele, who is abandoned on his doorstep. When she dies of a sudden illness, Hersh is infuriated, and accuses God of violating their contract. He abandons his faith, <a href="Shaving%20in%20Judaism">shaves his beard</a>, and lives a life as a miserly businessman in a penthouse with a <a href="gentile">gentile</a> mistress. He illicitly uses a synagogue's bonds that were entrusted to him to buy the tenement building in which he had lived when poor. He becomes dissatisfied with his new way of life, and decides that he needs a new contract with God to fill the emptiness he feels. He has a group of <a href="rabbi">rabbi</a>s draw up a new contract, but when he returns home with it, his heart fails and he dies. A boy, Shloime, finds Hersh's old contract, and signs his own name to it. Eisner appended a page to the 2006 edition, depicting Shloime ascending the stairs to the tenement.

Eisner called the story's creation "an exercise in personal anguish" as he was still grieved and angered over his daughter Alice's death from leukemia at 16. In early sketches of the story, Eisner used her name for Hersh's adopted daughter, and expressed his own anguish through Hersh. He stated, " argument with God was mine. I exorcised my rage at a deity that I believed violated my faith and deprived my lovely 16-year-old child of her life at the very flowering of it."

Marta Maria, an aging opera singer, tries to seduce a young man, Eddie, whom she finds singing in the alleys between tenement buildings. She had given up her own singing career for an alcoholic husband; she hopes to get back into show business as mentor to Eddie, and gives him money for clothes. He buys whiskey instead and returns to his pregnant wife, who herself had given up on show business for him and whom he abuses. He hopes to take advantage of Maria and build an actual singing career, but is unable to find the aging diva again—he does not know her address, and the tenement buildings appear all the same to him.

Eisner based the story on memories of an unemployed man who made the rounds of tenements singing "popular songs or off-key operatic operas" for spare change. Eisner remembered throwing the street singer coins on occasion, and considered he "was able to immortalize his story" in "The Street Singer".

Those who live in the tenement at 55 Dropsie Avenue fear and mistrust their <a href="Antisemitism">antisemitic</a> superintendent, Mr. Scuggs. The tenant Mrs. Farfell's young niece Rosie goes down to his apartment and offers him a peek at her panties for a nickel. After receiving the nickel she poisons Scuggs' dog and only companion, Hugo, and steals Scuggs's money. He corners her in an alley, where the tenants spot him and call the police, accusing him of trying to <a href="Child%20sexual%20abuse">molest a minor</a>. Before the police can break into his apartment to arrest him, he shoots himself, embracing Hugo's body.

Eisner wrote that he based the superintendent on the "mysterious but threatening custodian" of his boyhood tenement. Eisner added a page to the 2006 edition in which a "Super Wanted" sign is posted on the tenement building, following the original conclusion of Rosie counting her stolen money.

"Cookalein" is a story of tenants of 55 Dropsie Avenue vacationing in the country. To be alone with his mistress, a man named Sam sends his wife and children away to the <a href="Catskill%20Mountains">Catskill Mountains</a>, where they stay at a "cookalein" (<a href="Yiddish%20language">Yiddish</a>: , "cook alone", a place for boarders with access to a kitchen).

A <a href="clothing%20cutter">clothing cutter</a> named Benny and a secretary named Goldie are staying at an expensive hotel near the cookalein, both hoping to find someone rich to marry; they mistake each other for a wealthy target, and when they discover this, Benny rapes Goldie. Herbie, an intern Goldie had earlier turned down, takes her into his care, and Benny goes on to court an heiress. An older woman seduces Sam's fifteen-year-old son Willie at the cookalein; they are discovered by her husband who, after beating her, makes love to her in front of the boy.

At the end of the summer, the vacationers return to Dropsie Avenue. Goldie and Herbie are engaged, and Benny believes he will be marrying into the diamond business. Willie is affected by his experiences, but does not express them, and his family plan to leave the tenement. For the 2006 edition Eisner added an extra page of Willie from a rear-view perspective, looking out from his balcony.

"Cookalein" was the most overtly autobiographical of the stories—Eisner used the real names of his family members: his parents Sam and Fannie, his brother Petey, and himself, "Willie". Eisner called "Cookalein" "an honest account of coming of age" that was "a combination of invention and recall".

Will Eisner was born in New York in 1917 to poor Jewish immigrants. He has said he wanted a career in the arts, but that poor Jews at the time were restricted from upper-class universities where he could study it. Like others of his generation, he turned to comics as an artistic outlet, a career he began in 1936. In the late 1930s he co-owned a studio which produced content for comic books; he left the studio in 1940 to produce his best-known creation, the formally inventive "<a href="Spirit%20%28comics%29">The Spirit</a>", which ran as a newspaper insert from 1940 to 1952. After its end, Eisner withdrew from the comic book world and focused on the American Visuals Corporation, which he had founded in 1948 to produce educational and commercial comics and related media. With the rise of comics fandom in the 1970s, Eisner found there was still interest in his decades-old "Spirit" comics, and that the fans wanted more work from him. After American Visuals went out of business in 1972, Eisner entered a deal with underground comix publisher to reprint old "Spirit" stories. Other reprints followed, but Eisner was unwilling to do new "Spirit" stories—instead, he wanted to do something more serious, inspired in part by the <a href="wordless%20novel">wordless novel</a>s of <a href="Lynd%20Ward">Lynd Ward</a> he first read in 1938, and similar work by the <a href="Flemish%20people">Flemish</a> <a href="Frans%20Masereel">Frans Masereel</a> and the German <a href="Otto%20N%C3%BCckel">Otto Nückel</a>.

Eisner had had greater artistic ambitions for comics since his time doing "The Spirit". Since the 1950s, he had been developing ideas for a book, but was unable to gain support for them, as was seen by both the public and its practitioners as low-status entertainment; at a meeting of the <a href="National%20Cartoonists%20Society">National Cartoonists Society</a> in 1960, <a href="Rube%20Goldberg">Rube Goldberg</a> rebuked Eisner's ambitions, saying, "You are a vaudevillian like the rest of us ... don't ever forget that!"

With the critical acceptance of underground comix in the 1970s, Eisner saw a potential market for his ideas. In 1978, he produced his first book-length, adult-oriented work, "A Contract with God". He marketed it as a "<a href="graphic%20novel">graphic novel</a>"—a term which had been in use since the 1960s, but was little known until Eisner popularized it with "Contract". Though it was a modest commercial success, Eisner was financially independent, and soon set to work on another graphic novel "<a href="Life%20on%20Another%20Planet">Life on Another Planet</a>", and completed eighteen further graphic novels before his 2005 death; two featured the autobiographical Willie from the story "Cookalein": "<a href="The%20Dreamer%20%28comics%29">The Dreamer</a>" (1986) and "<a href="To%20the%20Heart%20of%20the%20Storm">To the Heart of the Storm</a>" (1991).

Eisner was brought up in a religious household, but himself was a reluctant disbeliever. In 1970, his sixteen-year-old daughter Alice died after an eighteen-month battle with <a href="leukemia">leukemia</a>. Eisner was enraged, and questioned how a God could let such a thing happen; he dealt with his grief by immersing himself in his work. When working on "A Contract with God", he tried to capture these emotions by acting out Frimme Hersh's character in his head.

The narration is lettered as part of the artwork, rather than being set apart in caption boxes, and Eisner makes little use of conventional box-style panels, often avoiding panel borders entirely, delimiting spaces with buildings or window frames instead. Pages are uncrowded and have large drawings which focus on facial expression. He allowed the length of the stories to develop based on their content, rather than a set page count as was traditional in comics before that time. Eisner emphasizes the urban setting with dramatic, vertical perspective, and dark artwork with much <a href="chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a>, and uses visual motifs to tie the stories together. The dark, vertical rain surrounding Hersh when he buries his daughter in the first story is echoed by the revised final image of the last story, in which Willie stares out into a city sky in a similar <a href="Hatching">hatched</a> rainy "Eisenshpritz" style. The monochromatic artwork was printed in <a href="sepia%20%28color%29">sepia</a> tones, rather than conventional black-and-white.

In contrast to comics in the superhero genre, in which Eisner did prominent work early in his career, the characters in "A Contract with God" are not heroic; they often feel frustrated and powerless, even when performing seemingly heroic deeds to help their neighbors. The characters are rendered in a caricatured manner that contrasts with the realistic backgrounds, though the backgrounds are rendered in less detail than in Eisner's work in "The Spirit"; according to writer <a href="Dennis%20O%27Neil">Dennis O'Neil</a>, this style mimics the impressionistic sense of memory. Eisner explored these sorts of characters and situations further in his other Dropsie Avenue books, such as "A Life Force".

The stories share themes of disillusionment and frustration over thwarted desires. Frimme Hersh grieves over the death of his daughter, which he perceives as a breach of his contract with God; street singer Eddie returns to insignificance when he finds himself unable to find his would-be benefactor; Goldie's and Willie's romantic ideals are disillusioned after her near-rape and his seduction. Violence also ties the stories together; Eddie's wife-beating is mirrored by the beating Willie's seductress receives from her husband.

The characters are depicted neither as purely good or evil: for example, Rosie in "The Super" triumphs over the racist, abusive superintendent by stealing his money, having him framed for pedophilia, and driving him to suicide. Confinement is a prominent theme; Eisner chooses perspectives through which the reader views the characters framed by doorways, window frames, or sheets of rain. Frimme Hersh seeks freedom from oppressive Eastern European antisemitism; there is a feeling of elation for characters in the final story as they find their way out of the tenement's, and the city's, confinement.

According to academic Derek Royal, Jewish ethnicity is prominent throughout the stories; in "A Contract with God" and "Cookalein", religious and cultural Jewish symbolry are prominent, though in the middle two stories, there is little outward evidence of the characters' <a href="Jewish%20peoplehood">Jewishness</a>. The two outer stories further emphasize Jewish identity with the extra-urban portions of their settings—the rural Russian origin of the religious Hersh in "Contract", and the Catskill mountains in "Cookalein", a retreat commonly associated with Jews in the 20th century. Eisner deals with representing Jewish identity through community. He juxtaposes individual stories and individual characters, who have different experiences which may be incompatible with one another; this confounds any single definition of "Jewishness", though there is a communal sense that binds these characters and their Jewishness together. Royal argues that Eisner shows the unresolved nature of American identity, in which ethnicities are conflicted between <a href="cultural%20assimilation">cultural assimilation</a> and their ethnic associations. As the book progresses, the characters move from overt Jewishness to greater levels of assimilation, presented as an ambivalent change that has costs of its own.

Royal argued that the book was not only important to <a href="comics%20studies">comics studies</a>, but also to the study of <a href="Jewish%20literature">Jewish</a> and <a href="ethnic%20American%20literature">ethnic American literature</a>. Much like <a href="short%20story%20cycle">short story cycle</a>s common to contemporary Jewish prose, in which stories can stand alone, but complement each other when read as a loosely integrated package, Royal wrote that "Contract" could be better described as a "graphic cycle" rather than a "graphic novel". He wrote that such cycles, as well as Eisner's, emphasized a heterogeneous multiplicity of perspectives, as "o American ethnic literature can ever be defined monolithically".

Art critic <a href="Peter%20Schjeldahl">Peter Schjeldahl</a> saw the "over-the-topness" endemic to American comics, and Eisner's work, as "ill suited to serious subjects, especially those that incorporate authentic social history". The work has been criticized for its use of stereotypical imagery; writer Jeremy Dauber countered that these images reflect Eisner's own memories of his youth and the strictures that Jewish people felt in the tenements. Others said caricaturized character designs conflicted with the otherwise realism of the stories; the appropriateness of the style was defended by others, such as Dennis O'Neil, who said that they better reflect the impressionistic way a child remembers the past.

The concept of a contract or <a href="Covenant%20%28biblical%29">covenant</a> with God is fundamental to the <a href="Judaism">Jewish religion</a>. The idea that God must uphold his end of the <a href="Thou%20shalt%20have%20no%20other%20gods%20before%20me">first commandment</a> has been a subject of works such as <a href="Elie%20Wiesel">Elie Wiesel</a>'s play "<a href="The%20Trial%20of%20God">The Trial of God</a>" (1979), made in response to the atrocities Wiesel witnessed at <a href="Auschwitz%20concentration%20camp">Auschwitz</a>. To art historian Matthew Baigell, Hershe's angst regarding his relationship with God is a modern response to the questions of <a href="Hillel%20the%20Elder">Hillel the Elder</a>'s quoted in the <a href="Pirkei%20Avot">Pirkei Avot</a>: "If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?" Literary scholar Susanne Klingenstein found Hersh's character unrealistic from the view of Jewish scholarship. She wrote that "the suffering of the righteous" is "one of the greatest problems in Jewish thought", and that a character as devoutly religious as Hersh would not have struggled with what she saw as elementary Jewish teaching.

The book took two years to finish. Eisner worked through a variety of approaches and styles, and toyed with using color, overlays, or <a href="wash%20%28visual%20arts%29">washes</a>, before settling on a hard-lined style printed in sepia. As he had no deadline, he reworked and resequenced the stories until he was satisfied.

Eisner intended "A Contract with God" to have an adult audience, and wanted it to be sold in bookstores rather than comic shops; as such, he turned down an offer from Denis Kitchen to publish it. Though he had contacts at <a href="Bantam%20Books">Bantam Books</a>, he knew they would be uninterested in publishing comics. To secure a meeting with editor Oscar Dystel there, he called the book a "graphic novel". When Dystel discovered that the book was actually comics, he told Eisner Bantam would not publish it, but a smaller publisher might.

Baronet Press, a small New York publishing house, agreed to publish "A Contract with God", which bears the credit "Produced by Poorhouse Press" of "White Plains, N.Y." on its indicia page. Eisner had originally intended to call the book "Tenement Stories", "Tales from the Bronx", or "A Tenement in the Bronx" but Baronet titled it "A Contract with God", after the lead story, as the term "tenement" was not widely known outside the eastern US. The trade paperback carried the term "graphic novel", though it is a collection of stories rather than a novel. As Baronet was not financially sound, Eisner loaned it money to ensure the book was published.
Sales were poor, but demand increased over the years. <a href="Kitchen%20Sink%20Press">Kitchen Sink Press</a> reissued the book in 1985, as did <a href="DC%20Comics">DC Comics</a> in 2001 as part of its Will Eisner Library; and <a href="W.%20W.%20Norton%20%26amp%3B%20Company">W. W. Norton</a> collected it in 2005 as "The Contract with God Trilogy" in a single volume with its sequels, "A Life Force" (1988) and "Dropsie Avenue" (1995). The Norton edition, and subsequent stand-alone editions of "Contract", included extra final pages to the stories. , at least eleven translations have been published, including in Yiddish, a language which would have been common with many of the characters in the book. This Yiddish edition was published by the <a href="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> comics store <a href="Lambiek">Lambiek</a> on 6 November 1984, in the presence of Eisner himself.


"A Contract with God" has frequently, though erroneously, been cited as the first graphic novel; comic book reviewer Richard Kyle had used the term in 1964 in a fan newsletter, and it had appeared on the cover of "<a href="The%20First%20Kingdom">The First Kingdom</a>" (1974) by <a href="Jack%20Katz%20%28artist%29">Jack Katz</a>, with whom Eisner had corresponded. A number of book-length comics preceded "Contract", at least as far back as <a href="Milt%20Gross">Milt Gross</a>'s "<a href="He%20Done%20Her%20Wrong">He Done Her Wrong</a>" (1930). "A Contract with God" attracted greater attention than these previous efforts partly due to Eisner's greater status in the comics community. It is considered a milestone in American comics history not only for its format, but also for its literary aspirations and for having dispensed with typical comic-book genre tropes.

Eisner continued to produce graphic novels in a third phase to his cartooning career that ultimately lasted longer than either his periods in comic books or in educational comics. According to comics historian R. Fiore, Eisner's work as a graphic novelist also maintained his reputation as "a contemporary figure rather than a relic of the dim past".

Editor N. C. Christopher Couch considered the book's physical format to be Eisner's major contribution to the graphic novel form—few in comic book publishing had experience in bookmaking, whereas Eisner gained intimate familiarity with the process during his time at American Visuals. The book succeeded in getting into bookstores, though initial sales amounted to a few thousand copies in its first year; stores had difficulty finding an appropriate section in which to shelve it. It was put on display at the <a href="Brentano%27s">Brentano's</a> bookstore in Manhattan, and reportedly sold well. Eisner visited the store to find out how the book was faring after being taking down from display. The manager told him it had been placed in the religious section, and then in humor, but customers had raised concerns that the book did not belong in those sections. The manager gave up and put the book in storage in the cellar.

Early reviews were positive. The book's marketing consisted initially of word-of-mouth and in fanzines and trade periodicals, as mainstream newspapers and magazines did not normally review comics at the time. Comic book writer <a href="Dennis%20O%27Neil">Dennis O'Neil</a> called "Contract" "a masterpiece" that exceeded his expectations. O'Neil wrote that the combination of words and images mimicked the experience of remembering more accurately than was possible with pure prose. O'Neil's review originally appeared in "<a href="The%20Comics%20Journal">The Comics Journal</a>", and was used to preface later editions of Eisner's book. Critic Dale Luciano called the book a "perfectly and exquisitely balanced ... masterpiece", and praised Kitchen Sink Press for reprinting such a "risky project" in 1985.

Eisner's status as a cartoonist grew after "A Contract with God" appeared, and his influence was augmented by his time as a teacher at the <a href="School%20of%20Visual%20Arts">School of Visual Arts</a> in New York, where he expounded his theories of the medium. He later turned his lectures into the books "<a href="Comics%20and%20Sequential%20Art">Comics and Sequential Art</a>" (1985)—the first book in English on the formalities and of the comics medium—and "<a href="Graphic%20Storytelling%20and%20Visual%20Narrative">Graphic Storytelling and Visual Narrative</a>" (1995). As Eisner's social esteem grew, a distinction developed among publishers between Eisner's pre– and post-graphic novel work; highbrow publishers such as W. W. Norton have reissued his graphic novel work, while his superhero "Spirit" work has been reprinted by publishers with less social esteem such as DC Comics. "The Comics Journal" placed the book in 57th place on its "Top 100 English-Language Comics of the Century" list, which called it "the masterpiece of one of the medium's first true artists".

Cartoonist <a href="Dave%20Sim">Dave Sim</a> praised the book and wrote that he reread it frequently, but called it "a bit illegitimate" to use the term "graphic novel" for works of such brevity; he stated he could read the book in "twenty to thirty minutes", which he argued amounted to "the equivalent of a twenty-page short story".

On July 24, 2010, at the <a href="San%20Diego%20Comic-Con%20International">San Diego Comic-Con International</a>, producers Darren Dean, Tommy Oliver, <a href="Bob%20Schreck">Bob Schreck</a>, Mike Ruggerio, and Mark Rabinowitz announced plans for a film adaptation of "A Contract with God" from a script by Darren Dean, with a different director for each of the four stories.

Herrerasaurus

Herrerasaurus was one of the earliest <a href="dinosaur">dinosaur</a>s. Its name means "Herrera's lizard", after the rancher who discovered the first specimen. All known fossils of this carnivore have been discovered in the <a href="Ischigualasto%20Formation">Ischigualasto Formation</a> of <a href="Carnian">Carnian</a> age (late <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> according to the <a href="International%20Commission%20on%20Stratigraphy">ICS</a>, dated to 231.4 <a href="mya%20%28unit%29">million years ago</a>) in northwestern Argentina. The <a href="type%20species">type species</a>, Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis, was described by <a href="Osvaldo%20Reig">Osvaldo Reig</a> in 1963 and is the only <a href="species">species</a> assigned to the <a href="genus">genus</a>. "Ischisaurus" and "Frenguellisaurus" are <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">synonyms</a>.

For many years, the classification of "Herrerasaurus" was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was <a href="hypothesis">hypothesized</a> to be a <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> <a href="Theropoda">theropod</a>, a basal <a href="sauropodomorpha">sauropodomorph</a>, a basal <a href="saurischia">saurischia</a>n, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>. However, with the discovery of an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, "Herrerasaurus" has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers treating it at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.

It is a member of the <a href="Herrerasauridae">Herrerasauridae</a>, a family of similar genera that were among the earliest of the <a href="Evolution%20of%20dinosaurs">dinosaurian</a> <a href="evolutionary%20radiation">evolutionary radiation</a>.

"Herrerasaurus" was a lightly built bipedal carnivore with a long tail and a relatively small head. Adults had skulls up to long and were up to in total length and in weight. Smaller specimens were half the size, with skulls only about long.

"Herrerasaurus" was fully bipedal. It had strong hind limbs with short <a href="femur">thighs</a> and rather long feet, indicating that it was likely a swift runner. The foot had five toes, but only the middle three (digits II, III, and IV) bore weight. The outer toes (I and V) were small; the first toe had a small claw. The tail, partially stiffened by overlapping vertebral projections, balanced the body and was also an adaptation for speed. The forelimbs of "Herrerasaurus" were less than half the length of its hind limbs. The <a href="humerus">upper arm</a> and <a href="radius%20%28bone%29">forearm</a> were rather short, while the <a href="manus%20%28zoology%29">manus</a> (hand) was elongated. The first two fingers and the thumb ended in curved, sharp claws for grasping prey. The fourth and fifth digits were small stubs without claws.

"Herrerasaurus" displays traits that are found in different groups of dinosaurs, and several traits found in non-dinosaurian archosaurs. Although it shares most of the characteristics of dinosaurs, there are a few differences, particularly in the shape of its hip and leg bones. Its pelvis is like that of saurischian dinosaurs, but it has a bony <a href="Acetabulum%23Perforate%20Acetabulum">acetabulum</a> (where the <a href="femur">femur</a> meets the <a href="pelvis">pelvis</a>) that was only partially open. The <a href="ilium%20%28bone%29">ilium</a>, the main hip bone, is supported by only two <a href="sacrum">sacrals</a>, a <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">basal</a> trait. However, the <a href="pubis%20%28bone%29">pubis</a> points backwards, a <a href="Synapomorphy">derived</a> trait as seen in <a href="dromaeosaurid">dromaeosaurid</a>s and <a href="bird">bird</a>s. Additionally, the end of the pubis has a booted shape, like those in <a href="avetheropoda">avetheropods</a>; and the <a href="vertebra">vertebra</a>l <a href="vertebral%20body">centra</a> has an <a href="hourglass">hourglass</a> shape as found in "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>".
"Herrerasaurus" had a long, narrow <a href="skull">skull</a> that lacked nearly all the specializations that characterized later dinosaurs, and more closely resembled those of more primitive <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>s such as "<a href="Euparkeria">Euparkeria</a>". It had five pairs of <a href="Fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestrae</a> (skull openings) in its skull, two pairs of which were for the eyes and nostrils. Between the eyes and the nostrils were two <a href="antorbital%20fenestra">antorbital fenestra</a>e and a pair of tiny, 1-centimeter-long (0.4 in) slit-like holes called promaxillary fenestrae.

"Herrerasaurus" had a flexible joint in the lower jaw that could slide back and forth to deliver a grasping bite. This cranial specialization is unusual among dinosaurs but has evolved independently in some <a href="lizard">lizard</a>s. The rear of the lower jaw also had fenestrae. The jaws were equipped with large serrated teeth for biting and eating flesh, and the neck was slender and flexible.

According to Novas (1993), "Herrerasaurus" can be distinguished based on the following features: the presence of a premaxilla-maxilla <a href="fenestra%20%28anatomy%29">fenestra</a>, and the dorsal part of laterotemporal fenestra is less than a third as wide as the ventral part; the presence of a ridge on the lateral surface of the <a href="jugal">jugal</a> bone, and a deeply incised <a href="supratemporal">supratemporal</a> <a href="fossa%20%28anatomy%29">fossa</a> that extends across the medial postorbital process; the subquadrate ventral squamosal process has a lateral depression, and the <a href="quadratojugal">quadratojugal</a> bone overlaps the posterodorsal <a href="quadrate%20bone">quadrate</a> face; the <a href="Processus%20pterygoideus">pterygoid</a> process of the quadrate has an inturned, trough-shaped ventral margin, and the presence of a slender ribbed posterodorsal <a href="dentary">dentary</a> process; the <a href="surangular">surangular</a> bone has a forked anterior process for articulation with the posterodorsal dentary process; the <a href="humerus">humerus</a>' internal <a href="tuberosity">tuberosity</a> is proximally projected and separated from the humeral head by a deep groove (also present in coelophysoids); possesses enlarged hands, which are 60% of the size of the humerus+radius, and the humeral entepicondyle is ridge-like with anterior and posterior depressions; and the posterior border of the <a href="ilial">ilial</a> <a href="Caudal%20peduncle">peduncle</a> forms a right angle with the dorsal border of the shaft on the <a href="ischium">ischium</a>.

According to Sereno (1993), "Herrerasaurus" can be distinguished based on the following features, all of which are unknown in other herrerasaurids: a circular pit is present on the <a href="humeral">humeral</a> ectepicondyle, a feature also present in "<a href="Saturnalia%20%28dinosaur%29">Saturnalia</a>"; a saddle-shaped ulnar condyle of the <a href="humerus">humerus</a>, and the articular surface for the <a href="Triquetral%20bone">ulnare</a> on the <a href="ulna">ulna</a> is convex; the articular surface of the ulnare is smaller than that of the <a href="ulna">ulna</a>, a feature unknown in "Staurikosaurus" and "Sanjuansaurus"; the centrale is placed distal to the radiale; a broad subnarial process of the <a href="premaxilla">premaxilla</a>, and a broad supratemporal depression (noted by Sereno and Novas, 1993); the basal tuber and the <a href="occipital%20condyle%23In%20dinosaurs">occipital condyle</a> are subequal in width (noted by Sereno and Novas, 1993)

"Herrerasaurus" was named by <a href="paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Osvaldo Reig after Victorino Herrera, an Andean <a href="goatherd">goatherd</a> who first noticed its <a href="fossil">fossil</a>s in outcrops near the city of <a href="San%20Juan%2C%20Argentina">San Juan, Argentina</a> in 1959. These rocks, which later yielded "<a href="Eoraptor">Eoraptor</a>", are part of the <a href="Ischigualasto">Ischigualasto Formation</a> and date from the late <a href="Ladinian">Ladinian</a> to early <a href="Carnian">Carnian</a> stages of the Late <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period. Reig named a second dinosaur from these rocks in the same publication as "Herrerasaurus"; this dinosaur, "Ischisaurus cattoi", is now considered a <a href="Synonym%20%28taxonomy%29">junior synonym</a> and a <a href="juvenile%20%28organism%29">juvenile</a> of "Herrerasaurus".

Reig believed "Herrerasaurus" was an early example of a <a href="Carnosauria">carnosaur</a>, but this was the subject of much debate over the next 30 years, and the genus was variously classified during that time. In 1970, Steel classified "Herrerasaurus" as a <a href="prosauropod">prosauropod</a>. In 1972, <a href="Peter%20Galton">Peter Galton</a> classified the genus as not diagnosable beyond <a href="Saurischia">Saurischia</a>. Later, using <a href="cladistics">cladistic</a> analysis, some researchers put "Herrerasaurus" and "Staurikosaurus" at the base of the dinosaur tree before the separation between ornithischians and saurischians. Several researchers classified the remains as non-dinosaurian.

Two other partial skeletons, with skull material, were named "Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis" by <a href="Fernando%20Novas">Fernando Novas</a> in 1986, but this species too is now thought to be a synonym. "Frenguellisaurus ischigualastensis" was discovered in 1975, and was described by Novas (1986) who considered it a primitive saurischian, and possibly a <a href="theropod">theropod</a>. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) examined the "Frenguellisaurus" remains and found them referable to "Herrerasaurus". "Ischisaurus cattoi" was discovered in 1960 and described by Reig in 1963. Novas (1992) and Sereno and Novas (1992) reviewed its remains and found them to be referable to "Herrerasaurus".
A complete "Herrerasaurus" skull was found in 1988, by a team of paleontologists led by <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a>. Based on the new fossils, authors such as <a href="Thomas%20R.%20Holtz%2C%20Jr.">Thomas Holtz</a> and <a href="Jos%C3%A9%20Bonaparte">José Bonaparte</a> classified "Herrerasaurus" at the base of the saurischian tree before the divergence between prosauropods and theropods. However, Sereno favored classifying "Herrerasaurus" (and the Herrerasauridae) as primitive theropods. These two classifications have become the most persistent, with Rauhut (2003) and Bittencourt and Kellner (2004) favoring the early theropod <a href="hypothesis">hypothesis</a>, and Max Langer (2004), Langer and <a href="Michael%20Benton">Benton</a> (2006), and Randall Irmis and his coauthors (2007) favoring the basal saurischian hypothesis. If "Herrerasaurus" were indeed a theropod, it would indicate that theropods, <a href="sauropodomorph">sauropodomorph</a>s, and <a href="ornithischian">ornithischian</a>s diverged even earlier than herrerasaurids, before the middle <a href="Carnian">Carnian</a>, and that "all three lineages independently evolved several dinosaurian features, such as a more advanced ankle joint or an open acetabulum". This view is further supported by <a href="ichnology">ichnological</a> records showing large tridactyl (three-toed) footprints that can be attributed only to a theropod dinosaur. These footprints date from the <a href="Ladinian">Ladinian</a> (Middle Triassic) of the Los Rastros Formation in Argentina and predate "Herrerasaurus" by 3 to 5 million years.

The study of early dinosaurs such as "Herrerasaurus" and "Eoraptor" therefore has important implications for the concept of dinosaurs as a <a href="monophyly">monophyletic</a> group (a group descended from a common ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and <a href="Robert%20T.%20Bakker">Robert T. Bakker</a>, who compiled a list of cranial and postcranial <a href="synapomorphy">synapomorphies</a> (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of "Herrerasaurus" by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived from a common ancestor, and that the others were attributable to <a href="convergent%20evolution">convergent evolution</a>. Sereno's analysis of "Herrerasaurus" also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.

"Herrerasaurus" was originally considered to be a genus within <a href="Carnosauria">Carnosauria</a>, which then included forms similar to "<a href="Megalosaurus">Megalosaurus</a>" and "<a href="Antrodemus">Antrodemus</a>" (the latter is equivalent to "<a href="Allosaurus">Allosaurus</a>"), even though "Herrerasaurus" lived many millions of years before them and retained multiple <a href="basal%20%28phylogenetics%29">primitive</a> features. This carnosaurian classification was amended upon by Rozhdestvensky and Tatarinov in 1964, who classified "Herrerasaurus" within the family <a href="Gryponichidae">Gryponichidae</a> inside Carnosauria. The same year, Walker published a differing opinion that "Herrerasaurus" instead was allied with <a href="Plateosauridae">Plateosauridae</a>, although it differed in possessing a pubic boot. Walker also proposed that "Herrerasaurus" may instead be close to "<a href="Poposaurus">Poposaurus</a>" (now considered a <a href="pseudosuchia">pseudosuchia</a>n) and the unnamed theropod from the <a href="Dockum%20Group">Dockum Group</a> of <a href="Texas">Texas</a> (now assigned to the <a href="rauisuchia">rauisuchia</a>n "<a href="Postosuchus">Postosuchus</a>"). In 1985, Charig noted that "Herrerasaurus" was of uncertain classification, showing similarities to both "<a href="prosauropod">prosauropod</a>s" and "carnosaurians". Romer (1966), simply noted that "Herrerasaurus" was a prosauropod possibly within Plateosauridae. In the description of "Staurikosaurus", Colbert noted that there were many similarities between his taxon and "Herrerasaurus", but classified them in separate families, with "Herrerasaurus" in <a href="Teratosauridae">Teratosauridae</a>. In 1970, Bonaparte also proposed similarities between "Herrerasaurus" and "Staurikosaurus", and while classifying them both clearly as in <a href="Saurischia">Saurischia</a>, he stated that they appeared as though they could not be placed in a current family. This was further supported by Benedetto in 1973, who named for the taxa the new family <a href="Herrerasauridae">Herrerasauridae</a>, which he classified as saurischians, possibly within <a href="Theropoda">Theropoda</a> but not in <a href="Sauropodomorpha">Sauropodomorpha</a>. However, in 1977 Galton proposed that Herrerasauridae only included "Herrerasaurus", and found it to be Saurischian "<a href="incertae%20sedis">incertae sedis</a>".

Proposed in 1987 by Brinkman and Sues, "Herrerasaurus" has at times been considered basal to <a href="Ornithischia">Ornithischia</a> and Saurischia, although Brinkmann and Sues still considered it to be inside <a href="Dinosauria">Dinosauria</a>. They supported this on the basis that "Herrerasaurus" has a large pedal digit V, and has a well developed medial wall on the acetabulum. Brinkmann and Sues considered "Staurikosaurus" and "Herrerasaurus" to not form a true group called Herrerasauridae, and that instead they were successively more primitive forms. Also, they considered the characters used by Benedetto to be invalid, instead representing only the <a href="plesiomorphy">plesiomorphic</a> state that was found in both taxa. This was disagreed with in 1992 by Novas, who stated many derived <a href="synapomorphies">synapomorphies</a> of Herrerasauridae, such as a distinct pubic boot, but still classified them as basal to Ornithischia and Saurischia. Novas defined the family as the least common ancestor of "Herrerasaurus" and "Staurikosaurus" and all its descendants. A differing definition of "Herrerasaurus" but not "<a href="Passer%20domesticus">Passer domesticus</a>" first suggested by Sereno (1998), and more closely follows the original inclusion proposed by Benedetto. Another group, <a href="Herrerasauria">Herrerasauria</a> was named by Galton in 1985, and defined as "Herrerasaurus" but not "<a href="Liliensternus">Liliensternus</a>" or "<a href="Plateosaurus">Plateosaurus</a>" by Langer (2004), who used the node-based definition for Herrerasauridae.
In a revision of basal Dinosauria, Padian and May (1993) discussed the definition of the clade, and redefined it as the latest common ancestor of "<a href="Triceratops">Triceratops</a>" and <a href="birds">birds</a>. They also discussed what this definition would do to the most basal taxa, such as Herrerasauridae, and "<a href="Eoraptor">Eoraptor</a>". Padian and May considered that since both Herrerasauridae and "Eoraptor" lack many diagnostic features of Saurischia or Ornithischia, that they could not be considered inside Dinosauria.

A later 1994 study by Novas instead classified "Herrerasaurus" within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas found that the primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for "Herrerasaurus" with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to <a href="Neotheropoda">Neotheropoda</a> than "Eoraptor" or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place "Herrerasaurus" as well as "Eoraptor" basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called <a href="Eusaurischia">Eusaurischia</a>. Langer (2004) conducted a <a href="phylogenetic%20analysis">phylogenetic analysis</a>, and found that it was much more likely that "Herrerasaurus" was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of "<a href="Tawa%20%28dinosaur%29">Tawa</a>", when Nesbitt "et al." conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting <a href="cladogram">cladogram</a> placed Herrerasauridae basal to "Eoraptor", but closer to "<a href="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a>" than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon "<a href="Chromogisaurus">Chromogisaurus</a>", and found that Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia.

In 2010, Alcocer and Martinez described a new taxon of herrerasaurid, "<a href="Sanjuansaurus">Sanjuansaurus</a>". It could be distinguished from "Herrerasaurus" based on multiple features. In the phylogenetic analysis, "Herrerasaurus", "Sanjuansaurus" and "Staurikosaurus" all were in a <a href="polytomy">polytomy</a>, and Herrerasauridae was the most primitive group of saurischian, outside Eusaurischia, "Eoraptor" and "<a href="Guaibasaurus">Guaibasaurus</a>". In 2011, Martinez "et al." described "<a href="Eodromaeus">Eodromaeus</a>", a basal theropod from the same formation as "Herrerasaurus". In a phylogenetic analysis, "Eoraptor" was placed within Sauropodomorpha, Herrerasauridae was placed as the most basal theropods, and "Eodromaeus" was placed as the next most basal. A more recent analysis, by Bittencourt "et al." (2014), placed Herrerasauridae in a polytomy with Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, with "Eoraptor" also being in an unresolved position. This cladogram is shown below.

Other members of the <a href="clade">clade</a> may include "<a href="Eoraptor">Eoraptor</a>" from the same <a href="Ischigualasto">Ischigualasto Formation</a> of Argentina as "Herrerasaurus", "<a href="Chindesaurus">Chindesaurus</a>" from the Upper <a href="Petrified%20Forest%20National%20Park">Petrified Forest</a> (<a href="Chinle%20Formation">Chinle Formation</a>) of Arizona, and possibly "<a href="Caseosaurus">Caseosaurus</a>" from the <a href="Tecovas%20Formation">Tecovas Formation</a> of the <a href="Dockum%20Group">Dockum Group</a> in Texas, although the relationships of these animals are not fully understood, and not all paleontologists agree. Other possible basal theropods, "<a href="Alwalkeria">Alwalkeria</a>" from the Late Triassic <a href="Maleri%20Formation">Maleri Formation</a> of <a href="India">India</a>, and "<a href="Teyuwasu">Teyuwasu</a>", known from very fragmentary remains from the Late Triassic of Brazil, might be related. Paul (1988) noted that it had been incorrectly suggested that "Staurikosaurus pricei" was a juvenile "Herrerasaurus". This claim was refuted when pelvic bones from a juvenile "Herrerasaurus" were discovered, which upon examination did not resemble the pelvic bones of "Staurikosaurus".

The teeth of "Herrerasaurus" indicate that it was a <a href="carnivore">carnivore</a>; its size indicates it would have preyed upon small and medium-sized plant eaters. These might have included other dinosaurs, such as "<a href="Pisanosaurus">Pisanosaurus</a>", as well as the more plentiful <a href="rhynchosaur">rhynchosaur</a>s and <a href="synapsid">synapsid</a>s. "Herrerasaurus" itself may have been preyed upon by giant <a href="rauisuchia">rauisuchid</a>s like "<a href="Saurosuchus">Saurosuchus</a>"; puncture wounds were found in one skull.

<a href="Coprolite">Coprolite</a>s (fossilized dung) containing small bones but no trace of plant fragments, discovered in the Ischigualasto Formation, have been assigned to "Herrerasaurus" based on fossil abundance. Mineralogical and chemical analysis of these coprolites indicates that if the referral to "Herrerasaurus" was correct, this carnivore could digest bone.
Comparisons between the <a href="sclerotic%20ring">scleral ring</a>s of "Herrerasaurus" and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been <a href="cathemeral">cathemeral</a>, active throughout the day at short intervals.

In a 2001 study conducted by Bruce Rothschild and other paleontologists, 12 hand bones and 20 foot bones referred to "Herrerasaurus" were examined for signs of <a href="stress%20fracture">stress fracture</a>, but none were found.

PVSJ 407, a "Herrerasaurus ischigualastensis", had a pit in a skull bone attributed by <a href="Paul%20Sereno">Paul Sereno</a> and Novas to a bite. Two additional pits occurred on the <a href="splenial">splenial</a>. The areas around these pits are swollen and porous, suggesting the wounds were afflicted by a short-lived non-lethal infection. Because of the size and angles of the wound, it is likely that they were obtained in a fight with another "Herrerasaurus".

The holotype of "Herrerasaurus" (PVL 2566) was discovered in the Cancha de Bochas Member of the <a href="Ischigualasto%20Formation">Ischigualasto Formation</a> in San Juan, Argentina. It was collected in 1961 by Victorino Herrera, in sediments that were deposited in the <a href="Carnian">Carnian</a> stage of the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period, approximately 235 to 221 million years ago. Over the years, the Ischigualasto Formation produced other fossils ultimately referred to "Herrerasaurus". In 1958, A.S. Romer discovered specimen MCZ 7063, originally referred to "<a href="Staurikosaurus">Staurikosaurus</a>" in <a href="Carnian">Carnian</a> sediments. "Herrerasaurus" specimens PVL 2045 and MLP(4)61, were collected in 1959 and 1960, respectively, in sediments that were deposited in the <a href="Norian">Norian</a> stage of the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> period, approximately 228 to 208 million years ago. In 1960, Scaglia collected specimen MACN 18.060, originally the holotype of "Ischisaurus cattoi", in sediments deposited in the <a href="Carnian">Carnian</a> stage. In 1961, Scaglia collected "Herrerasaurus" specimen PVL 2558, in the <a href="Carnian">Carnian</a> beds of this formation. In 1990, the Cancha de Bochas Member produced more "Herrerasaurus" specimens, also from its <a href="Carnian">Carnian</a> beds. Specimen PVSJ 53, originally the holotype of "Frenguellisaurus", was collected by Gargiulo & Oñate in 1975 in sediments that were deposited in the Carnian stage.

Although "Herrerasaurus" shared the body shape of the large carnivorous dinosaurs, it lived during a time when dinosaurs were small and insignificant. It was the time of non-dinosaurian reptiles, not dinosaurs, and a major turning point in the Earth's ecology. The vertebrate fauna of the Ischigualasto Formation and the slightly later <a href="Los%20Colorados%20Formation">Los Colorados Formation</a> consisted mainly of a variety of <a href="crurotarsi">crurotarsal</a> <a href="archosaur">archosaur</a>s and <a href="synapsid">synapsid</a>s. In the Ischigualasto Formation, dinosaurs constituted only about 6% of the total number of fossils, but by the end of the <a href="Triassic">Triassic</a> Period, dinosaurs were becoming the dominant large land animals, and the other archosaurs and synapsids declined in variety and number.

Studies suggest that the <a href="natural%20environment">paleoenvironment</a> of the Ischigualasto Formation was a volcanically active floodplain covered by forests and subject to strong seasonal rainfalls. The climate was moist and warm, though subject to seasonal variations. Vegetation consisted of <a href="fern">fern</a>s ("<a href="Cladophlebis">Cladophlebis</a>"), <a href="horsetail">horsetail</a>s, and giant <a href="conifer">conifer</a>s ("Protojuniperoxylon"). These plants formed lowland forests along the banks of rivers. "Herrerasaurus" remains appear to have been the most common among the carnivores of the Ischigualasto Formation. It lived in the jungles of Late Triassic <a href="South%20America">South America</a> alongside another early dinosaur, the one-meter-long "<a href="Eoraptor">Eoraptor</a>", as well as "<a href="Saurosuchus">Saurosuchus</a>", a giant land-living <a href="rauisuchia">rauisuchia</a>n (a quadrupedal meat eater with a <a href="theropoda">theropod</a>-like skull); the broadly similar but smaller "<a href="Venaticosuchus">Venaticosuchus</a>", an <a href="ornithosuchidae">ornithosuchid</a>; and the predatory <a href="therapsid">therapsid</a> <a href="chiniquodontidae">chiniquodontids</a>. Herbivores were much more abundant than carnivores and were represented by <a href="rhynchosaur">rhynchosaur</a>s such as "<a href="Hyperodapedon">Hyperodapedon</a>" (a beaked reptile); <a href="aetosaur">aetosaur</a>s (spiny armored reptiles); and therapsids, including <a href="kannemeyeriidae">kannemeyeriid</a> <a href="dicynodont">dicynodont</a>s (stocky, front-heavy beaked quadrupedal animals) such as "<a href="Ischigualastia">Ischigualastia</a>" and <a href="traversodontidae">traversodontid</a> <a href="cynodont">cynodont</a>s (somewhat similar in overall form to dicynodonts, but lacking beaks) such as "<a href="Exaeretodon">Exaeretodon</a>".

Loggerhead sea turtle

The loggerhead sea turtle ("Caretta caretta"), also called <a href="Common%20name">commonly</a> the loggerhead, is a <a href="species">species</a> of <a href="sea%20turtle">oceanic turtle</a> distributed throughout the world. It is a marine reptile, belonging to the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Cheloniidae">Cheloniidae</a>. The average loggerhead measures around in <a href="carapace">carapace</a> length when fully grown. The adult loggerhead sea turtle weighs approximately , with the largest specimens weighing in at more than . The skin ranges from yellow to brown in color, and the shell is typically reddish brown. No external differences in sex are seen until the turtle becomes an adult, the most obvious difference being the adult males have thicker tails and shorter <a href="plastron">plastron</a>s (lower shells) than the females.

The loggerhead sea turtle is found in the <a href="Atlantic%20Ocean">Atlantic</a>, <a href="Pacific%20Ocean">Pacific</a>, and <a href="Indian%20Ocean">Indian Ocean</a>s, as well as the <a href="Mediterranean%20Sea">Mediterranean Sea</a>. It spends most of its life in saltwater and <a href="estuarine">estuarine</a> habitats, with females briefly coming ashore to lay eggs. The loggerhead sea turtle has a low reproductive rate; females lay an average of four egg <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutches</a> and then become <a href="wiktionary%3Aquiescence">quiescent</a>, producing no eggs for two to three years. The loggerhead reaches sexual maturity within 17–33 years and has a lifespan of 47–67 years.

The loggerhead sea turtle is <a href="omnivore">omnivorous</a>, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s. Its large and powerful jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs are especially vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.

The loggerhead sea turtle is considered a <a href="vulnerable%20species">vulnerable species</a> by the <a href="International%20Union%20for%20the%20Conservation%20of%20Nature">International Union for the Conservation of Nature</a>. 
In total, 9 <a href="distinct%20population%20segment">distinct population segment</a>s are under the protection of the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act%20of%201973">Endangered Species Act of 1973</a>, with 4 population segments classified as "threatened" and 5 classified as "endangered"
Commercial trade of loggerheads or derived products is prohibited by <a href="CITES%23Appendix%20I">CITES Appendix I</a>.
Untended <a href="fishing%20tackle">fishing gear</a> is responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in <a href="Trawling">fishing trawls</a>. <a href="Turtle%20excluder%20device">Turtle excluder device</a>s have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches and the introduction of exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.

The loggerhead sea turtle is the world's largest hard-shelled turtle, slightly larger at average and maximum mature weights than the <a href="green%20sea%20turtle">green sea turtle</a> and the <a href="Galapagos%20tortoise">Galapagos tortoise</a>. It is also the world's second largest extant turtle after the <a href="leatherback%20sea%20turtle">leatherback sea turtle</a>. Adults have an average weight range of , averaging about , and a straight-line carapace length range of . The maximum reported weight is and the maximum (presumed total) length is . The head and <a href="carapace">carapace</a> (upper shell) range from a yellow-orange to a reddish brown, while the <a href="plastron">plastron</a> (underside) is typically pale yellow. The turtle's neck and sides are brown on the tops and yellow on the sides and bottom.

The turtle's shell is divided into two sections: carapace and plastron. The carapace is further divided into large plates, or <a href="scute">scute</a>s. Typically, 11 or 12 pairs of marginal scutes rim the carapace. Five vertebral scutes run down the carapace's midline, while five pairs of costal scutes border them. The <a href="%3Awikt%3Anuchal">nuchal</a> scute is located at the base of the head. The carapace connects to the plastron by three pairs of inframarginal scutes forming the bridge of the shell. The plastron features paired <a href="gular%20scute">gular</a>, humeral, pectoral, abdominal, femoral, and anal scutes. The shell serves as external armor, although loggerhead sea turtles cannot retract their heads or flippers into their shells.

<a href="Sexual%20dimorphism">Sexual dimorphism</a> of the loggerhead sea turtle is only apparent in adults. Adult males have longer tails and claws than females. The males' plastrons are shorter than the females', presumably to accommodate the males' larger tails. The carapaces of males are wider and less domed than the females', and males typically have wider heads than females. The sex of juveniles and subadults cannot be determined through external anatomy, but can be observed through dissection, <a href="laparoscopy">laparoscopy</a> (an operation performed on the abdomen), <a href="Histology">histological</a> examination (cell anatomy), and radioimmunological assays (immune study dealing with <a href="Isotopic%20labeling">radiolabeling</a>).

<a href="Lachrymal%20glands">Lachrymal glands</a> located behind each eye allow the loggerhead to maintain <a href="osmotic%20balance">osmotic balance</a> by eliminating the excess salt obtained from ingesting ocean water. On land, the excretion of excess salt gives the false impression that the turtle is crying.

The loggerhead sea turtle has a <a href="cosmopolitan%20distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>, nesting over the broadest geographical range of any sea turtle. It inhabits the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Oceans and the Mediterranean Sea.

In the Atlantic Ocean, the greatest concentration of loggerheads is along the southeastern coast of North America and in the Gulf of Mexico. Very few loggerheads are found along the European and African coastlines. <a href="Florida">Florida</a> is the most popular nesting site, with more than 67,000 nests built per year. Nesting extends as far north as <a href="Virginia">Virginia</a>, as far south as Brazil, and as far east as the <a href="Cape%20Verde%20Islands">Cape Verde Islands</a>. The Cape Verde Islands are the only significant nesting site on the eastern side of the Atlantic. Loggerheads found in the Atlantic Ocean feed from Canada to Brazil.

In the Indian Ocean, loggerheads feed along the coastlines of Africa, the <a href="Arabian%20Peninsula">Arabian Peninsula</a>, and in the <a href="Arabian%20Sea">Arabian Sea</a>. Along the African coastline, loggerheads nest from <a href="Mozambique">Mozambique</a>'s <a href="Bazaruto%20Archipelago">Bazaruto Archipelago</a> to South Africa's <a href="iSimangaliso%20Wetland%20Park">St Lucia</a> estuary. The largest Indian Ocean nesting site is <a href="Oman">Oman</a>, on the Arabian Peninsula, which hosts around 15,000 nests, giving it the second largest nesting population of loggerheads in the world. <a href="Western%20Australia">Western Australia</a> is another notable nesting area, with 1,000–2,000 nests per year.

Pacific loggerheads live in <a href="temperate">temperate</a> to tropical regions. They forage in the <a href="East%20China%20Sea">East China Sea</a>, the southwestern Pacific, and along the <a href="Baja%20California%20Peninsula">Baja California Peninsula</a>. Eastern Australia and Japan are the major nesting areas, with the <a href="Great%20Barrier%20Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> deemed an important nesting area. Pacific loggerheads occasionally nest in <a href="Vanuatu">Vanuatu</a> and <a href="Tokelau">Tokelau</a>. <a href="Yakushima%20Island">Yakushima Island</a> is the most important site, with three nesting grounds visited by 40% of all nearby loggerheads. After nesting, females often find homes in the East China Sea, while the <a href="Kuroshio%20Current">Kuroshio Current Extension's</a> Bifurcation region provides important juvenile foraging areas. Eastern Pacific populations are concentrated off the coast of Baja California, where upwelling provides rich feeding grounds for juvenile turtles and <a href="subadult">subadult</a>s. Nesting sites along the eastern Pacific Basin are rare. mtDNA sequence polymorphism analysis and tracking studies suggest 95% of the population along the coast of the Americas hatch on the Japanese Islands in the western Pacific. The turtles are transported by the prevailing currents across the full length of the northern Pacific, one of the longest migration routes of any marine animal. The return journey to the natal beaches in Japan has been long suspected, although the trip would cross unproductive clear water with few feeding opportunities. Evidence of a return journey came from an adult female loggerhead named Adelita, which in 1996, equipped with a satellite tracking device, made the 14,500 km (9,000 mi) trip from Mexico across the Pacific. Adelita was the first animal of any kind ever tracked across an ocean basin.

The Mediterranean Sea is a nursery for juveniles, as well as a common place for adults in the spring and summer months. Almost 45% of the Mediterranean juvenile population has migrated from the Atlantic. Loggerheads feed in the <a href="Alboran%20Sea">Alboran Sea</a> and the <a href="Adriatic%20Sea">Adriatic Sea</a>.
Greece is the most popular nesting site along the Mediterranean, with more than 3,000 nests per year. <a href="Zakynthos">Zakynthos</a> hosts the largest Mediterranean nesting with the second one being in <a href="Kyparissia">Kyparissia</a> Bay. Because of this, Greek authorities do not allow planes to take off or land at night in Zakynthos due to the nesting turtles. In addition to the Greek coast, the coastlines of <a href="Cyprus">Cyprus</a> and Turkey are also common nesting sites.

One record of this turtle was made in Ireland when a specimen washed ashore on Ballyhealy Beach in Co. Wexford.

Loggerhead sea turtles spend most of their lives in the open ocean and in shallow coastal waters. They rarely come ashore besides the females' brief visits to construct nests and deposit eggs. Hatchling loggerhead turtles live in floating mats of "<a href="Sargassum">Sargassum</a>" algae. Adults and juveniles live along the continental shelf as well as in shallow coastal estuaries. In the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, age plays a factor in habitat preference. Juveniles are more frequently found in shallow estuarine habitats with limited ocean access compared to non-nesting adults. Loggerheads occupy waters with surface temperatures ranging from during non-nesting season. Temperatures from are most suitable for nesting females.

Juvenile loggerheads share the "Sargassum" habitat with a variety of other organisms. The mats of "Sargassum" contain as many as 100 different species of animals on which the juveniles feed. Prey found in "Sargassum" mats may include barnacles, <a href="Crustacean%20larva">crab larvae</a>, fish eggs, and <a href="hydrozoa">hydrozoa</a>n colonies. Some prey, such as ants, flies, <a href="aphid">aphid</a>s, <a href="leafhopper">leafhopper</a>s, and beetles, are carried by the wind to the mats. Marine mammals and commercial fishes, including tuna and mahi-mahi, also inhabit the "Sargassum" mats.

Loggerhead sea turtles observed in captivity and in the wild are most active during the day. In captivity, the loggerheads' daily activities are divided between swimming and resting on the bottom. While resting, they spread their forelimbs to about midstroke swimming position. They remain motionless with eyes open or half-shut and are easily alerted during this state. At night, captives sleep in the same position with their eyes tightly shut, and are slow to react. Loggerheads spend up to 85% of their day submerged, with males being the more active divers than females. The average duration of dives is 15–30 min, but they can stay submerged for up to four hours. Juvenile loggerheads and adults differ in their swimming methods. A juvenile keeps its forelimbs pressed to the side of its carapace, and propels itself by kicking with its hind limbs. As the juvenile matures, its swimming method is progressively replaced with the adult's alternating-limb method. They depend entirely on this method of swimming by one year old.

Water temperature affects the sea turtle's metabolic rate. <a href="Fatigue%20%28medical%29">Lethargy</a> is induced at temperatures between 13 and 15 °C (55 and 59 °F). The loggerhead takes on a floating, cold-stunned posture when temperatures drop to around 10 °C. However, younger loggerheads are more resistant to cold and do not become stunned until temperatures drop below 9 °C. The loggerheads' <a href="animal%20migration">migration</a> helps to prevent instances of cold-stunning. Higher water temperatures cause an increase in metabolism and heart rate. A loggerhead's body temperature increases in warmer waters more quickly than it decreases in colder water; their <a href="critical%20thermal%20maximum">critical thermal maximum</a> is currently unknown. In February 2015, a live loggerhead turtle was found floating in British Columbian waters of 10.5 °C with extensive algal growth on its carapace.

Female-female aggression, which is fairly rare in other marine <a href="vertebrates">vertebrates</a>, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, <a href="sparring">sparring</a> occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away in opposite directions, or involves chasing one out of the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including <a href="hormone">hormone</a> levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly <a href="Territory%20%28animal%29">territorial</a>, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.

The loggerhead sea turtle is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling <a href="invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, such as <a href="gastropod">gastropod</a>s, <a href="Bivalvia">bivalves</a>, and <a href="Decapoda">decapods</a>. It has a greater list of known prey than any other sea turtle. Other food items include <a href="sponge">sponge</a>s, <a href="coral">coral</a>s, <a href="sea%20pen">sea pen</a>s, <a href="Polychaete">polychaete worms</a>, <a href="sea%20anemone">sea anemone</a>s, <a href="cephalopod">cephalopod</a>s, <a href="barnacles">barnacles</a>, <a href="brachiopod">brachiopod</a>s, <a href="Isopoda">isopods</a>, <a href="Portuguese%20man%20o%27%20war">Portuguese men o' war</a>, insects, <a href="bryozoa">bryozoa</a>ns, <a href="sea%20urchin">sea urchin</a>s, <a href="sand%20dollar">sand dollar</a>s, <a href="sea%20cucumber">sea cucumber</a>s, <a href="starfish">starfish</a>, fish (eggs, juveniles, and adults), hatchling turtles (including members of its own species), algae, and <a href="vascular%20plant">vascular plant</a>s. During migration through the open sea, loggerheads eat <a href="jellyfish">jellyfish</a>, floating molluscs, floating egg clusters, <a href="squid">squid</a>, and <a href="flying%20fish">flying fish</a>.

Loggerheads crush prey with their large and powerful jaws. Projecting scale points on the anterior margin of the forelimbs allow manipulation of the food. These points can be used as "pseudo-claws" to tear large pieces of food in the loggerhead's mouth. The loggerhead will turn its neck sideways to consume the torn food on the scale points. Inward-pointing, <a href="mucus">mucus</a>-covered <a href="wiktionary%3Apapilla">papillae</a> found in the fore region of the loggerhead's <a href="esophagus">esophagus</a> filter out foreign bodies, such as fish hooks. The next region of the esophagus is not papillated, with numerous mucosal folds. The digestion rate in loggerheads is temperature-dependent; it increases as temperature increases.

Loggerheads have numerous predators, especially early in their lives. Egg and nestling predators include <a href="ghost%20crab">ghost crab</a>s, <a href="oligochaete%20worm">oligochaete worm</a>s, beetles, fly larvae, ants, <a href="flesh%20flies">flesh flies</a>, snakes, <a href="gull">gull</a>s, <a href="corvid">corvid</a>s, <a href="opossum">opossum</a>s, bears, rats, armadillos, <a href="Mustelidae">mustelids</a>, skunks, <a href="canids">canids</a>, <a href="Procyonidae">procyonids</a>, cats, pigs, and humans. During their migration from their nests to the sea, hatchlings are preyed on by <a href="diptera">diptera</a>n larvae, crabs, toads, lizards, snakes, seabirds such as <a href="frigatebird">frigatebird</a>s, and other assorted birds and mammals. In the ocean, predators of the loggerhead juveniles include <a href="Portunidae">portunid crabs</a> and various fishes, such as <a href="parrotfishes">parrotfishes</a> and <a href="moray%20eel">moray eel</a>s. Adults are more rarely attacked due to their large size, but may be preyed on by large sharks, seals, and killer whales. Nesting females are attacked by flesh flies, <a href="feral">feral</a> dogs, and humans. Salt marsh mosquitos can also pester nesting females.

In Australia, the introduction of the <a href="red%20fox">red fox</a> ("Vulpes vulpes") by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience complete recovery from such dramatic losses.

Along the southeastern coast of the United States, the <a href="raccoon">raccoon</a> ("Procyon lotor") is the most destructive predator of nesting sites. Mortality rates of nearly 100% of all clutches laid in a season have been recorded on some Florida beaches. This is attributed to an increase in raccoon populations, which have flourished in urban environments. Aggressive efforts to protect nesting sites by covering them with wire mesh has significantly reduced the impact of raccoon predation on loggerhead sea turtle eggs. On <a href="Bald%20Head%20Island%2C%20North%20Carolina">Bald Head Island</a> in <a href="North%20Carolina">North Carolina</a>, wire mesh screens are used on every confirmed nest to prevent excavation by resident red foxes. A new concern with the steel cage technique is interference with the normal development of the nestlings' magnetic sense due to the use of ferrous wire, which may disrupt the turtles' ability to navigate properly. Efforts are underway to find a nonmagnetic material that will prevent predators gnawing through the barrier.

Up to 40% of nesting females around the world have wounds believed to come from shark attacks.

Infectious bacteria such as "<a href="Pseudomonas">Pseudomonas</a>" and "<a href="Salmonella">Salmonella</a>" attack loggerhead hatchlings and eggs. Fungi such as "<a href="Penicillium">Penicillium</a>" infect loggerhead sea turtle nests and cloacae.

<a href="Fibropapillomatosis">Fibropapillomatosis</a> disease caused by a form of the <a href="Herpesviridae">herpes-type</a> virus threatens loggerheads with internal and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent blindness. <a href="Trematode">Trematode</a>s of the family <a href="Spirorchiidae">Spirorchiidae</a> inhabit tissues throughout the body of the loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, <a href="inflammation">inflammatory</a> trematode <a href="lesion">lesion</a>s can cause <a href="endocarditis">endocarditis</a> and <a href="Neurological%20disorder">neurological disease</a>. A <a href="nematode">nematode</a>, "<a href="Angiostoma%20carettae">Angiostoma carettae</a>", also infects loggerheads, causing <a href="histology">histologic</a> lesions in the <a href="respiratory%20tract">respiratory tract</a>.

More than 100 species of animals from 13 <a href="Phylum">phyla</a>, as well as 37 kinds of algae, live on loggerheads' backs. These <a href="parasite">parasitic</a> organisms, which increase drag, offer no known benefit to the turtle, although the dulling effect of organisms on shell color may improve <a href="camouflage">camouflage</a>.

Hatchlings range in color from light brown to almost black, lacking the adult's distinct yellows and reds. Upon hatching, they measure about and weigh about . The eggs are typically laid on the beach in an area above the <a href="strandline">high-tide line</a>. The eggs are laid near the water so the hatchlings can return to the sea. The loggerhead's sex is dictated by the temperature of the underground nest. Incubation temperatures generally range from 26–32 °C (79–90 °F). Sea turtle eggs kept at a constant incubating temperature of 32 °C become females. Eggs incubating at 28 °C become males. An incubation temperature of 30 °C results in an equal ratio of male to female hatchlings. Hatchlings from eggs in the middle of the clutch tend to be the largest, grow the fastest, and be the most active during the first few days of sea life.

After incubating for around 80 days, hatchlings dig through the sand to the surface, usually at night, when darkness increases the chance of escaping predation and damage from extreme sand surface temperatures is reduced. Hatchlings enter the ocean by navigating toward the brighter horizon created by the reflection of the moon and starlight off the water's surface.

Hatchlings can lose up to 20% of their body mass due to evaporation of water as they journey from nest to ocean. They initially use the <a href="Undertow%20%28wave%20action%29">undertow</a> to push them five to 10 m away from the shore. Once in the ocean, they swim for about 20 hours, taking them far offshore. An iron compound, <a href="magnetite">magnetite</a>, in their brains allows the turtles to perceive the <a href="Earth%27s%20magnetic%20field">Earth's magnetic field</a>, for navigation.
Many hatchlings use "<a href="Sargassum">Sargassum</a>" in the open ocean as protection until they reach . Hatchling loggerheads live in this <a href="Pelagic%20zone">pelagic environment</a> until they reach juvenile age, and then they migrate to nearshore waters.

When ocean waters cool, loggerheads must migrate to warmer areas or <a href="hibernation">hibernate</a> to some degree. In the coldest months, they submerge for up to seven hours at a time, emerging for only seven minutes to breathe. Although outdone by <a href="terrapin">freshwater turtles</a>, these are among the longest recorded dives for any air-breathing marine vertebrate. During their seasonal migration, juvenile loggerheads have the ability to use both magnetic and visual cues. When both aids are available, they are used in conjunction; if one aid is not available, the other suffices. The turtles swim at about during migration.

Like all marine turtles, the loggerhead prepares for reproduction in its foraging area. This takes place several years before the loggerhead migrates to a mating area. Female loggerheads first reproduce at ages 28–33 in Southeastern United States and Australia, and at ages 17–30 in South Africa. Age at first reproduction in the Mediterranean, Oman, Japan, and Brazil are unknown. Nesting loggerheads have a straight carapace length of . Because of the large range, carapace length is not a reliable indicator of sexual maturity. Their estimated maximum lifespan is 47–67 years in the wild.
Female loggerheads first reproduce between the ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court their mates, but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce <a href="cloaca">cloaca</a>l <a href="pheromone">pheromone</a>s to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.
While nesting, females produce an average of 3.9 egg clutches, and then become quiescent, producing no eggs for two to three years. Unlike other sea turtles, courtship and mating usually do not take place near the nesting beach, but rather along migration routes between feeding and breeding grounds. Recent evidence indicates <a href="ovulation">ovulation</a> in loggerheads is mating-induced. Through the act of mating, the female ovulates eggs which are fertilized by the male. This is unique, as mating-induced ovulation is rare outside of mammals. In the Northern Hemisphere, loggerheads mate from late March to early June. The <a href="nesting%20season">nesting season</a> is short, between May and August in the Northern Hemisphere and between October and March in the Southern Hemisphere.

Loggerheads may display <a href="Polyandry%20in%20nature">multiple paternity</a>. Multiple paternity is possible due to sperm storage. The female can store sperm from multiple males in her oviducts until ovulation. A single clutch may have as many as seven fathers, each contributing sperm to a portion of the clutch. Multiple paternity and female size are <a href="Correlation%20and%20dependence">positively correlated</a>. Two hypotheses explain this correlation. One posits that males favor large females because of their perceived higher <a href="fecundity">fecundity</a> (ability to reproduce). The other states, because larger females are able to swim more quickly to mating grounds, they have longer mating periods.

All sea turtles have similar basic nesting behaviors. Females return to lay eggs at intervals of 12–17 days during the nesting season, on or near the beach where they hatched. They exit the water, climb the beach, and scrape away the surface sand to form a body pit. With their hind limbs, they excavate an egg chamber in which the eggs are deposited. The females then cover the egg chamber and body pit with sand, and finally return to the sea. This process takes one to two hours, and occurs in open sand areas or on top of sand dunes, preferably near dune grasses that the females can use to camouflage the nest. The nesting area must be selected carefully because it affects characteristics such as fitness, emergence ratio, and vulnerability to nest predators. Loggerheads have an average <a href="clutch%20%28eggs%29">clutch</a> size of 112.4 eggs.

<a href="Carl%20Linnaeus">Carl Linnaeus</a> gave the loggerhead its first binomial name, "Testudo caretta", in 1758. Thirty-five other names emerged over the following two centuries, with the combination "Caretta caretta" first introduced in 1873 by Leonhard Stejneger. The English <a href="common%20name">common name</a> "loggerhead" refers to the animal's large head. The loggerhead sea turtle belongs to the <a href="Family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Cheloniidae">Cheloniidae</a>, which includes all extant sea turtles except the <a href="leatherback%20sea%20turtle">leatherback sea turtle</a>. The subspecific classification of the loggerhead sea turtle is debated, but most authors consider it a single <a href="Polymorphism%20%28biology%29">polymorphic</a> species. Molecular genetics has confirmed hybridization of the loggerhead sea turtle with the <a href="Kemp%27s%20ridley%20sea%20turtle">Kemp's ridley sea turtle</a>, <a href="hawksbill%20sea%20turtle">hawksbill sea turtle</a>, and <a href="green%20sea%20turtle">green sea turtle</a>s. The extent of natural hybridization is not yet determined; however, second-generation hybrids have been reported, suggesting some hybrids are fertile.

Although evidence is lacking, modern sea turtles probably descended from a single common ancestor during the Cretaceous period. Like all other sea turtles except the leatherback, loggerheads are members of the ancient <a href="family%20%28biology%29">family</a> <a href="Cheloniidae">Cheloniidae</a>, and appeared about 40 million years ago. Of the six species of living Cheloniidae, loggerheads are more closely related to the <a href="Kemp%27s%20Ridley">Kemp's ridley sea turtle</a>, <a href="olive%20ridley%20sea%20turtle">olive ridley sea turtle</a>, and the <a href="hawksbill%20turtle">hawksbill turtle</a> than they are to the <a href="flatback%20turtle">flatback turtle</a> and the <a href="green%20turtle">green turtle</a>.

Around three million years ago, during the <a href="Pliocene">Pliocene</a> epoch, Central America emerged from the sea, effectively cutting off currents between the Atlantic and <a href="Indo-Pacific">Indo-Pacific</a> Oceans. The rerouting of ocean currents led to climatic changes as the Earth entered a glacial cycle. Cold water upwelling around the <a href="Cape%20of%20Good%20Hope">Cape of Good Hope</a> and reduction in water temperature at <a href="Cape%20Horn">Cape Horn</a> formed coldwater barriers to migrating turtles. The result was a complete isolation of the Atlantic and Pacific populations of loggerheads. During the most recent <a href="ice%20age">ice age</a>, the beaches of southeastern North America were too cold for sea turtle eggs. As the Earth began to warm, loggerheads moved farther north, colonizing the northern beaches. Because of this, turtles nesting between North Carolina and northern Florida represent a different genetic population from those in southern Florida.

The distinct populations of loggerheads have unique characteristics and genetic differences. For example, Mediterranean loggerheads are smaller, on average, than Atlantic Ocean loggerheads. North Atlantic and Mediterranean loggerhead sea turtles are descendants of colonizing loggerheads from <a href="Tongaland">Tongaland</a>, South Africa. South African loggerhead genes are still present in these populations today.

Many human activities have negative effects on loggerhead sea turtle populations. The prolonged time required for loggerheads to reach sexual maturity and the high mortality rates of eggs and young turtles from natural phenomena compound the problems of population reduction as a consequence of human activities.

Loggerhead sea turtles were once intensively hunted for their meat and <a href="Egg%20%28biology%29">eggs</a>; consumption has decreased, however, due to worldwide legislation. Despite this, turtle meat and eggs are still consumed in countries where regulations are not strictly enforced. In Mexico, turtle eggs are a common meal; locals claim the egg is an <a href="aphrodisiac">aphrodisiac</a>. Eating turtle eggs or meat can cause serious illness due to harmful bacteria, such as "<a href="Pseudomonas%20aeruginosa">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</a>" and "<a href="Serratia%20marcescens">Serratia marcescens</a>", and high levels of toxic metals that build up through <a href="bioaccumulation">bioaccumulation</a>.

The US West Coast is a critical migratory corridor for the Pacific loggerheads, in which these turtles swim across the Pacific to California’s coast from breeding grounds in Japan. Important foraging habitats for juveniles in the central North Pacific have been revealed through <a href="telemetry">telemetry</a> studies. Along with these foraging habitats, high levels of bycatch from industrial-scale fisheries have been found to overlap; with drift gillnets in the past and longline fisheries presently. Many juvenile loggerheads aggregate off the coast of Baja California Sur, Mexico, where small coastal fisheries increase these turtles' mortality risk; fishers have reported catching dozens of loggerheads with bottom-set gear per day per boat. The most common commercial fishery that accidentally takes loggerheads are bottom trawls used for shrimp vessels in the Gulf of California. In 2000, between 2,600 and 6,000 loggerheads were estimated to have been killed by pelagic longlining in the Pacific.

Fishing gear is the biggest threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become entangled in <a href="Longline%20fishing">longlines</a> or <a href="gillnet">gillnet</a>s. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing gear is the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, <a href="fishing%20trawler">trawls</a>, and <a href="dredge">dredge</a>s. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.

Nearly 24,000 metric tons of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest a wide array of this floating debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, <a href="Balloon%20release">balloons</a> and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The ingested plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. Ingested plastics release toxic compounds, including <a href="polychlorinated%20biphenyls">polychlorinated biphenyls</a>, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.

<a href="Electric%20light">Artificial lighting</a> discourages nesting and interferes with the hatchlings' ability to navigate to the water's edge. Females prefer nesting on beaches free of artificial lighting. On developed beaches, nests are often clustered around tall buildings, perhaps because they block out the man-made light sources. Loggerhead hatchlings are drawn toward the brighter area over the water which is the consequence of the reflection of moon and star light. Confused by the brighter artificial light, they navigate inland, away from the protective waters, which exposes them to dehydration and predation as the sun rises. Artificial lighting causes tens of thousands of hatchling deaths per year.

Destruction and encroachment of habitat by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, forcing them to nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the <a href="siltation">siltation</a> of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades habitat and can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles at or near the surface.

Annual variations in climatic temperatures can affect sex ratios, since loggerheads have temperature-dependent sex determination. High sand temperatures may skew gender ratios in favor of females. Nesting sites exposed to unseasonably warm temperatures over a three-year period produced 87–99% females. This raises concern over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction. A more localized effect on gender skewing comes from the construction of tall buildings, which reduce sun exposure, lowering the average sand temperature, which results in a shift in gender ratios to favor the emergence of male turtles.

Since the loggerhead occupies such a broad range, successful conservation requires efforts from multiple countries.

Loggerhead sea turtles are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are listed under Appendix I of the <a href="Convention%20on%20International%20Trade%20in%20Endangered%20Species">Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species</a>, making international trade illegal. In the United States, the <a href="United%20States%20Fish%20and%20Wildlife%20Service">Fish and Wildlife Service</a> and <a href="National%20Marine%20Fisheries%20Service">National Marine Fisheries Service</a> classify them as a threatened species under the <a href="Endangered%20Species%20Act">Endangered Species Act</a>. Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia's <a href="Environment%20Protection%20and%20Biodiversity%20Conservation%20Act%201999">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999</a> and Queensland's <a href="Nature%20Conservation%20Act%201992">Nature Conservation Act 1992</a>. The Convention on Migratory Species works for the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles on the Atlantic coast of Africa, as well as in the Indian Ocean and southeast Asia. Throughout Japan, the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles. Greece's <a href="ARCHELON%2C%20the%20Sea%20Turtle%20Protection%20Society%20of%20Greece">ARCHELON</a> works for their conservation. The Marine Research Foundation works for loggerhead conservation in Oman. Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol of the Cartagena Convention, which deals with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems, also protects them. Conservation organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) to exclude even the largest turtles. TEDs are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers.

In many places during the nesting season, workers and volunteers search the coastline for nests, and researchers may also go out during the evening to look for nesting females for tagging studies and gather barnacles and tissues samples. Volunteers may, if necessary, relocate the nests for protection from threats, such as high spring tides and predators, and monitor the nests daily for disturbances. After the eggs hatch, volunteers uncover and tally hatched eggs, undeveloped eggs, and dead hatchlings. Any remaining live hatchlings are released or taken to research facilities. Typically, those that lack the vitality to hatch and climb to the surface die. Hatchlings use the journey from nest to ocean to build strength for the coming swim. Helping them to reach the ocean bypasses this strength-building exercise and lowers their chances of survival. 

The loggerhead sea turtle appears on the $1000 <a href="Colombian%20Peso">Colombian Peso</a> coin. In the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>, the loggerhead sea turtle is the official <a href="state%20reptile">state reptile</a> of South Carolina and also the state saltwater reptile of Florida.

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption

Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is a <a href="First-person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> <a href="Action-adventure%20game">action-adventure</a> video game developed by <a href="Retro%20Studios">Retro Studios</a> and published by <a href="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> video game console. A part of the <a href="science%20fiction">science fiction</a> "<a href="Metroid">Metroid</a>" series, it is the third main installment in the "<a href="Metroid%20Prime">Metroid Prime</a>" series. It was released in North America and Europe in 2007 and in Japan the following year. 

The story of "Corruption" is set six months after the events of "". It follows <a href="Samus%20Aran">Samus Aran</a> as she confronts the <a href="Space%20Pirates%20%28Metroid%29">Space Pirates</a>, who have launched an attack on the Galactic Federation naval base on Norion. While fending off a Space Pirate assault, Samus and her fellow <a href="bounty%20hunter">bounty hunter</a>s are infected with <a href="Characters%20in%20the%20Metroid%20series%23Antagonists">Phazon</a> by her doppelgänger <a href="Dark%20Samus">Dark Samus</a>. After losing contact with the other hunters, the Federation sends Samus on a mission to determine what happened to them. During the course of the game, Samus works to prevent the Phazon from spreading from planet to planet while being slowly corrupted by the Phazon herself. 

The player controls Samus using the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a> and <a href="Wii%20Nunchuk">Nunchuk</a> devices; the remote is used for jumping, aiming, and firing weapons, while the Nunchuk enables actions such as moving Samus and locking onto enemies. "Corruption" introduces features new to the "Prime" series, such as Hypermode, which allows Samus to use more powerful attacks, and the ability to command her gunship. The new control scheme featured in "Corruption" took a year to develop and caused the game's release to be delayed several times. The game was first shown to the public at the <a href="History%20of%20E3%232005">E3 2005</a> trade show.

Reception to "Corruption" has been positive, with several reviews specifically praising the gameplay. More than one million copies of the game were sold in 2007. It was re-released in August 2009 as part of "", a Wii compilation of the three main games of the "Prime" series with Wii Remote controls. Retro announced that "Corruption" would be the closing chapter of the "Prime" series; however, the next main installment, "<a href="Metroid%20Prime%204">Metroid Prime 4</a>", was announced in June 2017 and is currently in development.

"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption" is a <a href="First%20person%20%28video%20games%29">first-person</a> <a href="action-adventure%20game">action-adventure game</a>. The player controls the protagonist, <a href="Samus%20Aran">Samus Aran</a>, using the <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a> and <a href="Wii%20Nunchuk">Nunchuk</a> devices. The Nunchuk enables the player to perform actions such as moving Samus and locking on to enemies and targets. The Wii Remote allows the player to execute actions such as jumping, aiming, and firing weapons.

"Corruption" is a large, <a href="Nonlinear%20gameplay">open-ended</a> game that takes place across several planets, each with regions connected by elevators, rail systems and bridges. Each region has rooms separated by doors that can be opened when shot with the correct weapon. The gameplay revolves around solving <a href="puzzle">puzzle</a>s to uncover secrets, <a href="Platform%20game">jumping on platforms</a>, and shooting enemies with the help of a "lock-on" mechanism that allows Samus to <a href="Circle%20strafing">move in a circle</a> while staying aimed on an enemy. The "lock-on" mechanism also allows Samus to use the Grapple Beam to attach onto and pull objects, such as enemy shields or certain doors. The game uses a first-person view, except in Morph Ball mode, in which Samus's suit transforms into an armored ball and the game uses a <a href="Third-person%20shooter">third-person camera</a>. The third person camera is also used in conjunction with the Screw Attack power-up: in this case Samus's suit emits strange energy waves as she performs a continuous jump.

The game's <a href="HUD%20%28video%20gaming%29">heads-up display</a> simulates the inside of Samus' helmet, and features a <a href="radar">radar</a>, map, ammunition gauge and <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">health meter</a>. The player can change visors to enable new abilities such as <a href="X-ray%20vision">X-ray vision</a>, collecting information on many items, creatures and enemies, and interfacing with certain mechanisms such as force fields and elevators. "Corruption" also includes a hint system that periodically displays on-screen instructions and navigation assistance. The game also has the addition of the Hypermode, a feature in which health is drained to give temporary invincibility and more powerful attacks. After a certain amount of time, the player will enter Corrupt Hypermode, and if not stopped leads to a non-standard <a href="game%20over">game over</a> due to Samus being overtaken by Phazon. Another new feature is the Command Visor, which allows Samus to summon remotely her gunship from a suitable landing site to save the game, or travel to another destination quickly. During the progress of the game, new abilities can be obtained to allow it to perform aerial attacks against enemy targets and transport heavy objects.

The events in "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption" take place six months after "". The game's protagonist, Samus Aran, is a <a href="bounty%20hunter">bounty hunter</a> hired to assist the <a href="Metroid">Galactic Federation</a> during its ongoing conflict with the <a href="Space%20Pirates%20%28Metroid%29">Space Pirates</a>. After facing initial defeat on the planet Zebes during the events of the first "Metroid", the Space Pirates sought to gain power by using a newly discovered mutagen called Phazon. However, Samus managed to disrupt their operations throughout the "Prime" trilogy and ultimately allowed the Galactic Federation to confiscate and replicate their Phazon armaments.

The Space Pirates' operation was left in disarray following defeat in "Metroid Prime 2: Echoes". In their desperation, they turned to <a href="Dark%20Samus">Dark Samus</a>, Samus's sinister <a href="doppelg%C3%A4nger">doppelgänger</a>, for aid. Dark Samus strengthened the Space Pirates' forces, while also slowly indoctrinating them into mindless servants. Their combined forces seek to corrupt the universe with Phazon by first executing a series of methodical attacks on three Federation planets: Norion, Bryyo, and Elysia. The game is primarily centered on these planets and three other locations that become accessible after completing certain in-game tasks.

Fleet Admiral Castor Dane, the commander of a Galactic Federation flagship "Olympus", calls for a meeting with Samus Aran and three other bounty hunters—Rundas, Ghor, and Gandrayda. The bounty hunters receive orders to clear a <a href="computer%20virus">computer virus</a> from several organic <a href="supercomputer">supercomputer</a>s called "Aurora Units", located throughout the galaxy. The meeting ends abruptly when Space Pirates attack the Federation fleet. Samus and the other bounty hunters are deployed to the planet Norion, where the Space Pirates are concentrating an attack on the Federation base. While suppressing the attack, Samus learns that a Phazon <a href="meteoroid">meteoroid</a>, called a Leviathan Seed, will soon collide into Norion. Samus and the other bounty hunters attempt to activate the base's defense systems, when they are suddenly attacked by Dark Samus. With the other bounty hunters knocked out, a severely wounded Samus manages to activate the system just in time to destroy the Leviathan Seed before she falls unconscious.

A month later, Samus awakens aboard "Olympus", where she learns that Dark Samus's Phazon-based attacks have corrupted her. The Federation equips her suit with a Phazon Enhancement Device (PED) that enables her to harness the Phazon energy within herself. She is informed that her fellow bounty hunters, also corrupted with Phazon and equipped with PEDs, have gone missing during their missions to investigate several planets embedded with Leviathan Seeds. Samus is first sent to the planet Bryyo and later Elysia to determine what happened to her missing comrades. She soon discovers that both planets and their inhabitants are slowly being corrupted by the Leviathan Seeds and that she must destroy the seeds to reverse this. Samus encounters heavy resistance from the Space Pirates, Phazon-corrupted monstrosities, and her fellow bounty hunters who have been corrupted by Dark Samus.

Throughout her mission, which eventually takes her to the Space Pirate homeworld, Samus slowly becomes further Phazon-corrupted. She manages to stop the Space Pirate assault with the assistance of the Federation troops. After stealing a Leviathan battleship, Samus and the Federation fleet use it to create a <a href="wormhole">wormhole</a> that leads to the planet Phaaze, the origin point of Phazon. Samus travels to the planet's core, where she finally defeats Dark Samus and then the corrupted Aurora Unit 313. As a result, Dark Samus is obliterated, and Phaaze explodes, rendering all Phazon in the galaxy inert. The Federation fleet escapes Phaaze's destruction, but loses contact with Samus in the process. Samus eventually appears in her gunship, and reports that the mission is accomplished before flying off into space.

Samus returns to Elysia, where she mourns the loss of her fellow bounty hunters. If the player completes the game with all of the items obtained, Samus is seen flying into <a href="Hyperspace%20%28science%20fiction%29">hyperspace</a>, with <a href="Sylux">Sylux</a>'s spaceship following her.

<a href="Retro%20Studios">Retro Studios</a> intended to give "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption" larger environments than "Metroid Prime 2: Echoes", and enable the game to run at 60 <a href="Frame%20rate%23Frame%20rates%20in%20video%20games">frames per second</a>. The developers were also interested in using the <a href="WiiConnect24">WiiConnect24</a> feature to provide additional content for the game that would be accessible from the Internet. Retro announced that "Corruption" would be the final chapter of the "Prime" series and would have a plot "about closure, told against the backdrop of an epic struggle". After the Wii Remote was revealed, Nintendo demonstrated how "Metroid Prime 3" would take advantage of the controller's special abilities with a version of "Echoes" modified for the Wii and shown at the <a href="Tokyo%20Game%20Show">Tokyo Game Show</a> in 2005. At the Media Summit held by Nintendo during the week of May 21, 2007, <a href="Nintendo%20of%20America">Nintendo of America</a> president <a href="Reggie%20Fils-Aim%C3%A9">Reggie Fils-Aimé</a> said that "Metroid" games "never played this way before" when referring to "Corruption". He also noted that Nintendo employees who had seen the game in action claimed that it "will reinvent the control scheme for a first-person shooter".

Game director Mark Pacini stated that the biggest concern Retro had during production was the controls, which had "too many functions for the amount of buttons". Pacini also said the <a href="Wii%20Zapper">Wii Zapper</a>, a gun shell peripheral, was never considered because it was announced when the game's development was almost done. Retro president Michael Kelbaugh said that the delays for the game's release gave them more time to tune the controller, which took a year. He also stated that while Retro did "a great job on the multiplayer in "Metroid Prime 2"", focus was centered on the single player portion of the game, which was considered to be "the core strength of the franchise". Art director Todd Keller declared the graphics to be focused in both texture detail and variety, with every single texture being hand-made and trying to "make every room its own custom stage". During development, the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20Analysis%20and%20Development">Nintendo EAD</a> team involved with "Corruption" suggested Retro to turn Hypermode into the core of the game, saying it would enhance the tension as it made players powerful but if used excessively would lead to a game over. Retro initially disagreed, saying it would be difficult to implement the feature without dampening the entertainment value, but after discussion decided to turn Hyper Mode into a regular functionality of the game.

The soundtrack for "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption" was composed by <a href="Kenji%20Yamamoto%20%28composer%20born%201964%29">Kenji Yamamoto</a>, Minako Hamano and Masaru Tajima. The game took advantage of the increase in the amount of RAM that took place when the series switched from the <a href="GameCube">GameCube</a> to the Wii; this allowed for higher quality audio samples to be used and thus allowing a better overall audio quality. Yamamoto used <a href="Hirokazu%20Tanaka">Hirokazu Tanaka</a>'s musical design of the original "<a href="Metroid%20%28video%20game%29">Metroid</a>" in "Corruption", by keeping the music and themes dark and scary until the very end, when uplifting music is played during the credits. "Corruption" is the first "Metroid" game to feature a significant amount of voice acting, compared to previous games in the series in which Samus "[acted] alone [... and] always came across as a lone wolf". The producers decided to include voices to create a stronger connection between players and the characters. The characters' voices were performed by Timothy Patrick Miller, <a href="Lainie%20Frasier">Lainie Frasier</a>, <a href="Christopher%20Sabat">Christopher Sabat</a>, <a href="Edwin%20Neal">Edwin Neal</a>, Claire Hamilton, <a href="Brian%20Jepson">Brian Jepson</a>, Gray Haddock, Clayton Kjas and <a href="Ken%20Webster">Ken Webster</a>.

The game was first shown to the public at the <a href="Electronic%20Entertainment%20Expo">Electronic Entertainment Expo</a> (E3) 2005 in a short pre-rendered trailer. It was later announced during Nintendo's press conference at the E3 2006. Nintendo revealed in May 2006 that "Corruption" would be released as a launch game for the <a href="Wii">Wii</a> console, but a few months later it was delayed to 2007. In April 2007, Fils-Aimé stated in an interview that "Corruption" was "not going to ship by June" and set it at a summer 2007 release date at the earliest. Later he opined, "when we release it, it will be perfect. And if that's a little later than folks would have liked, I'm hoping they're going to be happy." In late April 2007, <a href="IGN">IGN</a> editor <a href="Matt%20Casamassina">Matt Casamassina</a> revealed that "Corruption" would be shown in detail during May of that year, and that the game would be released on August 20, 2007, in the United States. Nintendo of America later announced to have moved the release date to August 27, 2007, but Nintendo finally announced an "in stores" date of August 28, 2007. The game was later released in Europe on October 26, 2007, and in Japan on March 6, 2008. In the Japanese version, the game's <a href="difficulty%20level">difficulty level</a> is decided by answering to "a <a href="questionnaire">questionnaire</a> from the Galactic Federation", in contrast to the North American version where the difficulty level is chosen directly by the player. "Metroid Prime" series producer <a href="Kensuke%20Tanabe">Kensuke Tanabe</a> said that an idea for a questionnaire came from Retro Studios.

Casamassina initially criticized Nintendo for its minimal <a href="marketing%20campaign">marketing campaign</a> for "Corruption" and compared it to the larger campaign for the original "Metroid Prime", which included its own live action advertisement. He concluded that the campaign was the result of Nintendo's new focus on casual games for their console. When questioned on the company's actions, Nintendo of America responded by saying, "Nintendo fans will be surprised by the quantity and quality of "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption" information that becomes available before the game launches on Aug. 27. Your patience will be rewarded (or Corrupted)." Following this promise, Nintendo released the ""Metroid Prime 3" Preview" channel on August 10, 2007, in North America and on October 15, 2007, in Europe. The channel, available as a free download via the <a href="Wii%20Shop%20Channel">Wii Shop Channel</a>, allowed Wii owners to view preview videos of the game that included a battle sequence and previously unannounced details on new characters. The Preview channel was the first in a series of new downloadable content including videos made available in North America. The "month of "Metroid"", as named by Nintendo, included <a href="Virtual%20Console">Virtual Console</a> versions of "Metroid", available on August 13, 2007, and "<a href="Super%20Metroid">Super Metroid</a>", available on August 20, 2007.

"Metroid Prime 3" was rereleased on August 24, 2009 in North America, alongside "Metroid Prime" and "Metroid Prime 2: Echoes", as a single-disc compilation, "". "Prime" and "Echoes" feature the motion controls and achievement systems introduced in "Corruption". The compilation was later rereleased on the <a href="Wii%20U">Wii U</a>'s <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">Nintendo eShop</a> on January 29, 2015.

"Metroid Prime 3: Corruption" received critical acclaim. "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" commented, "The stunning visuals and immersive gameplay of the finale to the "Prime" series proves that the Wii is ready for the mainstream gamer." IGN awarded the game an Editor's Choice Award, and noted that the game was beautifully designed and the best looking game for the Wii. They also praised the inclusion of "well-done" voice acting, in contrast to the lack of any voice acting in most other Nintendo games. Despite stating that "Metroid Prime 3" was too similar to its predecessors, the review concluded that it was the best game in the "Prime" trilogy. IGN also said that it could be worthy of the same score as the original "Metroid Prime" (9.8), had it not been for the aforementioned reason. <a href="X-Play">X-Play</a> claimed that the game was enjoyable, but it had a few awkward control mechanics and was a little difficult to control on the Wii. They also said that although it was fun, there were problems that lead to odd lock-on mechanics and painful wrists from continuous motions.

Shane Satterfield from <a href="GameTrailers">GameTrailers</a> praised the more user-friendly and action-packed nature of the game compared to "Metroid Prime" and "Echoes". Satterfield also praised the superior motion-sensitive controls, stating, "After playing "Metroid Prime 3" you'll never want to play a shooter with dual analog controls again, it's that good." He further added that those elements make "Corruption" "far superior to the original "Metroid Prime"". <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> was enthusiastic about the new control system and said the graphics were "some of the best visuals in gaming, period". "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" gave "Corruption" a Silver award and named it one of the Games of the Month. <a href="GameSpot">GameSpot</a> stated the game had enjoyable puzzles, boss battles, atmospheric levels, and smooth gameplay. It also explained that the game was more like a traditional shooter video game than an adventure shooter, and stated that the motion activated actions were too unresponsive.

<a href="GamesRadar">GamesRadar</a> named "Metroid Prime 3: Corruption" the 10th best Wii game of all time out of a list of 25, stating that "Metroid Prime 3 is the ultimate achievement of the series. The formula, which was repeated several times by Corruption, has been tweaked and pruned to its most perfect point, with some of the best shooting on the system." In IGN's Best of 2007 Awards, "Corruption" received the awards for Best Wii Adventure Game, Best Artistic Design, and Best Overall Adventure Game. <a href="GameSpy">GameSpy</a> ranked it as the second best Wii game of the year, behind "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>", and honored it as the Best Innovation on the Wii. Australian website MyWii named "Prime 3" as the second best Wii game currently available, behind "Super Mario Galaxy". Despite being released on August 27, "Corruption" was the fifth best-selling game of the month, with 218,100 copies sold. It also debuted at the fifth spot of the Japanese charts, with 34,000 units in the first week of release. More than one million copies of the game were sold in 2007, and as of March 2008, 1.31 million copies of the game were sold worldwide.

"", a <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> game developed by <a href="Next%20Level%20Games">Next Level Games</a>, was announced at <a href="E3%202015">E3 2015</a>; "Metroid Prime" series producer Kensuke Tanabe said that "this time around we're doing a story on the Galactic Federation." Regarding the "Corruption"s ending, Tanabe wanted to create a story that centers on Samus and Sylux, noting that "here's something going on between them. I want to make a game that touches upon ." Tanabe added that Nintendo had no plans on releasing the next "Metroid Prime" game for the Wii U, stating "it would likely now be on Nintendo's NX console."

On June 13, 2017, Nintendo announced during their "Nintendo Spotlight" presentation at <a href="E3%202017">E3 2017</a> that "<a href="Metroid%20Prime%204">Metroid Prime 4</a>" is currently in development for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>. The game was initially announced to be developed by an entirely new team overseen by series producer Kensuke Tanabe, instead of Retro Studios. <a href="Eurogamer">Eurogamer</a> reported in February 2018 that <a href="Bandai%20Namco%20Entertainment">Bandai Namco Singapore</a> was working on the game alongside Nintendo and that the project included some staff members who worked on the cancelled "<a href="Star%20Wars%201313">Star Wars 1313</a>" game. However, in a January 2019 development update posted on their YouTube channel, Nintendo announced that development of "Metroid Prime 4" was restarted and the project would be handled by Retro Studios once again.

Cave Story

Independent developer <a href="Nicalis">Nicalis</a> worked with Amaya to <a href="Port%20%28video%20game%29">port</a> the game to <a href="WiiWare">WiiWare</a> and <a href="DSiWare">DSiWare</a> in 2010. An enhanced version, Cave Story+, was released for <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> in November 2011, and for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> in October 2012. A 3D <a href="Video%20game%20remake">remake</a> of the game, titled Cave Story 3D, was developed by Nicalis and published by <a href="Nippon%20Ichi%20Software">NIS America</a> for the Nintendo 3DS in November 2011. A port of "Cave Story+" for the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a> was released in June 2017.

The fast-paced gameplay of "Cave Story" revolves around Quote, who wakes up without his memory intact and must explore and blast his way through cavernous areas in order to figure out his story and backstory. The character gains access to new areas as he powers up his weapons and solves various platforming puzzles. Quote speaks to non-player characters scattered around the game world in order to learn more and more about the world and its inhabitants.

The player controls the on-screen character directly using the keyboard or gamepad. The player progresses by navigating <a href="platform%20game">platform game</a> puzzles and shooting enemies with the equipped weapon. When the player collects multiple weapons, they may be toggled at any time with the press of a button. Defeating enemies sometimes yields yellow triangular objects, which give <a href="experience%20point">experience point</a>s to weapons when collected. Weapons may be improved up to level three, but taking damage causes weapons to lose experience and levels. <a href="Health%20%28gaming%29">Health</a> and missile capacity upgrades are scattered throughout the game world. The player must interact with a variety of <a href="non-player%20character">non-player character</a>s and objects to complete the game.

"Cave Story" takes place within the cavernous interior of a <a href="floating%20island%20%28fiction%29">floating island</a>. The island is populated by Mimigas, a race of sentient, rabbit-like creatures. A particular species of red flower that grows in the island causes the normally peaceful Mimigas to fall into a violent frenzy when ingested. The island also conceals an artifact called the Demon Crown, which has vast magical powers. An army of robot soldiers was sent to the floating island on a <a href="Expeditionary%20Warfare">military expedition</a>, seeking to harness the Demon Crown as a weapon for wars on the surface world. These robots slaughtered Mimigas indiscriminately in their search for the crown, but were defeated when the Mimigas decided to eat the red flowers as a last resort. Shortly before the game begins, Professor Booster, the Sakamoto family, and various assistants formed a scientific party to research the island, but they became stranded when their medical doctor managed to acquire the Crown: he then forced the expedition to search for the red flowers.

The <a href="player%20character">character</a> awakens in a cave with no memory of how he came to be there. He finds a village of Mimigas, who are being persecuted by the Doctor. The Doctor's servants Misery and Balrog are looking for Sue Sakamoto, a girl who had been transformed into a Mimiga. Not finding her, they mistakenly abduct another Mimiga named Toroko instead. The player finds Sue in the Egg Corridor, where she discovers the eggs of a Sky Dragon, which could allow her to escape the floating island if hatched. Sue attempts to rescue her brother Kazuma, but King, the leader of Mimiga Village, captures her and holds her responsible for Toroko's kidnapping. Sue tasks the player with retrieving Kazuma from Grasstown. After freeing him, they meet Professor Booster, who reveals that the Doctor plans to use the red flowers on Mimigas to create an army to take over the surface world. Booster sends the player to the Sand Zone to destroy the red flowers before the Doctor can find them. While there, the player meets Curly Brace, a female robot who also has no memories of her past, and Jenka, an old witch who is Misery's mother and guardian of the red flowers. Jenka calls the player character a "soldier from the surface", one of many who were sent to the island to slaughter the Mimigas. Balrog manages to steal the key to the warehouse containing the red flowers from Jenka, who urges the player to stop them. Before the player can reach the warehouse, however, the Doctor force-feeds the captured Toroko a red flower and gravely injures King, leaving the player to fight the rabid Toroko, who ultimately dies.

Misery banishes the player to the Labyrinth deep inside the island as punishment for interfering with the Doctor's plans. Curly Brace has also been thrown into the Labyrinth and they cooperate to escape. Balrog helps them to move the boulder blocking the exit, revealing his kind nature. The pair find and defeat the Core, a magical creature whose power keeps the island afloat. However, the Doctor steps in to save it before the island collapses. Depending on certain conditions, the player may rescue Curly Brace, who had sacrificed her air tank to save the player character. When he returns to Mimiga Village, he finds that the Doctor has captured the Mimigas. In the Egg Corridor, Kazuma offers the player a choice to escape the island with him using a Sky Dragon, leading to an <a href="alternate%20ending">alternate ending</a> in which the Doctor conquers the surface world while Kazuma and the player hide in the mountains. The player may instead choose to confront the Doctor and destroy the island's Core, which would return the Mimigas to normal. The player scales the outer wall of the island to reach the Plantation where the Doctor is using the Mimigas as slave laborers to grow red flowers. The Doctor's servants capture the player and place him in a jail cell with Sue. She is taken away before the player wakes up, but her letter reveals that the Doctor was a member of the research expedition that included Sue's family and Professor Booster, but he betrayed them once he found the Demon Crown. Sue directs the player to find her mother who may have a plan to stop the Doctor.

If the player saved Curly Brace earlier, the player may find an item to restore her memories. She remembers that the player character's name is Quote, and that they were not the killer robots who slaughtered Mimigas in the past. Instead, they were sent to destroy the Demon Crown to prevent its power from falling into the wrong hands. Quote finds Sue's mother, Momorin, who is building a rocket that will allow access to the top of the island where the Doctor resides. After helping her complete the rocket, Quote confronts Misery and the Doctor. The Doctor has purified the essence of the red flowers into a crystal, which allows him to survive even after Quote destroys his body. The Doctor's spirit possesses the Core of the island, but Quote succeeds in destroying that as well, causing the island to begin falling to Earth. Should the player have saved Curly and restored her memories, they may proceed into a <a href="bonus%20stage">bonus stage</a> called the Bloodstained Sanctuary where Curly can be found and rescued; it is also here that Ballos—creator of the Demon Crown and Jenka's younger brother—is imprisoned. A powerful wizard who went insane and destroyed his homeland after being tortured by a jealous king, Ballos was sealed deep within the island by his sister. At some point, his niece Misery forced him to create the demon crown, but she and Balrog became cursed to serve whoever possessed it. Additionally, it is stated via narration that the Demon Crown will repair itself if it is destroyed, and will only truly lose its power if Ballos is killed, necessitating that Quote and Curly take his life.

With the help of Curly Brace, Quote defeats Ballos and stops the source of the negative energy that was causing the island to fall, saving its inhabitants. Balrog saves the two before they are crushed by Ballos' collapsing prison—he had been sent by Misery as thanks for breaking her curse. Quote, Curly Brace, and Balrog leave the island to live out their days in peace.

<a href="Daisuke%20%26quot%3BPixel%26quot%3B%20Amaya">Daisuke "Pixel" Amaya</a> developed "Cave Story" in his free time over five years. He began the project when he was in college and continued working on it after getting a job as a software developer. He started by writing the title screen music and programming rudimentary character movements. The idea for the cave setting evolved spontaneously when he created a number of enclosed spaces. Amaya admitted this lack of planning caused "problems down the line" because he did not have dedicated map editing and data management tools. Amaya describes the game as having an "old-fashioned feel", reminiscent of the games he played as a child, like "<a href="Metroid%20%28video%20game%29">Metroid</a>". More importantly, this <a href="Retrogaming">"retro" design choice</a> allowed him to create a large amount of art on his own, which would have been impossible for a <a href="Video%20game%20graphics%233D">3D game</a>.

At a <a href="Game%20Developers%20Conference">Game Developers Conference</a> <a href="Postmortem%20documentation">project post-mortem</a>, he emphasized the role of pragmatic design in shaping the game. While designing the main character, "Quote", Amaya drew inspiration from the plumber <a href="Mario">Mario</a>'s iconic original appearance—a large, expressive face and a high contrast between his white skin and red shirt make him stand out from the dark cave backgrounds. Most other characters feature either light skin or white clothes for the same reason. To make levels memorable, Amaya designed them around a single theme, such as "warmth" for the Egg Corridor, and "arid and oppressive" for the Sand Zone. Instead of a <a href="tutorial">tutorial</a> level, a concept Amaya dislikes, the first level of the game gives the player two paths, one of which is blocked off until retrieving an item from the other path. This setup, inspired by the opening of "<a href="Metroid%20%28video%20game%29">Metroid</a>", "lets players feel like they've solved problems on their own" and persists throughout the game. In beta versions of the game, all the enemies were shaped like bars of soap, a concept that evolved into the "Balrog" character. There was also a "frog prince" character who could travel through water more easily. Elements of this beta were incorporated into the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a> version of the game.

"Cave Story" has been ported to <a href="Linux">Linux</a>, <a href="Haiku%20OS">Haiku OS</a>, <a href="AROS">AROS</a>, <a href="MorphOS">MorphOS</a>, <a href="AmigaOS%204">AmigaOS 4</a> and <a href="Mac%20OS%20X">Mac OS X</a> operating systems, <a href="PlayStation%20Portable">PlayStation Portable</a>, <a href="Xbox%20%28console%29">Xbox</a>, <a href="Dreamcast">Dreamcast</a>, <a href="Sega%20Genesis">Sega Genesis</a>, <a href="GP2X">GP2X</a>, <a href="GP2X%20Wiz">GP2X Wiz</a>, and the <a href="Texas%20Instruments">TI</a> <a href="graphing%20calculator">graphing calculator</a>. An enhanced port, featuring updated character designs, remixed music and extra game modes, was developed by <a href="Nicalis">Nicalis</a> and released on <a href="WiiWare">WiiWare</a> on 22 March 2010 in North America and 10 December 2010 in Europe. Nicalis also ported the game to <a href="DSiWare">DSiWare</a> on 29 November 2010 in North America and 22 November 2011 in Japan. Although it does not feature the enhanced graphics and sound or some of the extra modes from the Wii version, it does include the Sanctuary Attack mode. There is also a <a href="Free%20Software">free/libre</a> <a href="Simple%20DirectMedia%20Layer">SDL-based</a> recreation of the original game engine, titled NXEngine, made by programmer Caitlin Shaw, which allows for extended modification of the game, and the creation of ports for additional devices. The game was released for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>'s <a href="Nintendo%20eShop">Nintendo eShop</a> service (separate from the retail 3DS game) in the United States on 4 October 2012 and in Europe on 1 May 2014. This version includes the DSiWare version's Jukebox mode, as well as all the additional modes included in "Cave Story+".

An enhanced PC version titled "Cave Story+" was released by Nicalis on the <a href="Steam%20%28software%29">Steam</a> service on 22 November 2011. "Cave Story+" features an alternative script that differs from the original English translation. This version contains all the additional modes from the WiiWare version, a remastered soundtrack, as well as the option to toggle the style of graphics between the classic style and that of the WiiWare version and the music of the original game, the WiiWare port, or the 3DS update. It also features an exclusive 'Wind Fortress' level. The game got an update that added an exclusive Machine Gun Challenge. The game was included as a bonus game in the <a href="Humble%20Indie%20Bundle">Humble Indie Bundle 4</a> sale in December 2011, <a href="Humble%20Indie%20Bundle">Humble Bundle 7</a> in December 2012, and was released on the <a href="Desura">Desura</a> service in April 2012. On 19 January 2017, Nicalis announced a port of Cave Story + on the <a href="Nintendo%20Switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, which released on 20 June 2017. This version is packaged with a full-color manual for the game and a <a href="Mini%20CD">Mini CD</a> containing arrangements of the game's soundtrack made in FamiTracker, a chiptune music tracker based on the <a href="Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System">Famicom</a>'s synthesizers; a later update also added two-player <a href="cooperative%20gameplay">cooperative gameplay</a>. Additionally, GameStop purchases of the Nintendo Switch version include one of three keychains modeled after Quote, Curly, and Balrog.

"Cave Story 3D" is a 3D version of the game developed by Nicalis and published by <a href="Nippon%20Ichi%20Software">NIS America</a> as a retail title for the <a href="Nintendo%203DS">Nintendo 3DS</a>. It was released on 8 November 2011 in North America, 11 November 2011 in Europe and 26 July 2012 in Japan. The game was built from scratch using 3D character models, featuring a dynamic camera system and another additional level, as well as a remixed soundtrack by <a href="Danny%20Baranowsky">Danny Baranowsky</a>. The Japanese version features crossover content from various NIS and other companies' franchises such as "<a href="Crazy%20Climber">Crazy Climber</a>", "<a href="Ikki%20%28video%20game%29">Ikki</a>", and "<a href="Dragon%20Slayer%20%28series%29">Dragon Slayer</a>". In order to devote more time to perfecting the title, Amaya quit his job as a software developer to become director of "Cave Story 3D". He remarked that the transition to 3D was difficult because it required the consideration of so many more details.

The original "Cave Story" earned widespread critical acclaim. <a href="1UP.com">1UP.com</a> described it as "so massive that it rivals modern [Game Boy Advance] "Castlevania" and "Metroid" games in terms of scope and play time". Matt Miller of "Game Informer" observed that "Cave Story" combines elements of "Metroid", "<a href="Ninja%20Gaiden%20%28Nintendo%20Entertainment%20System%29">Ninja Gaiden</a>", "<a href="Mega%20Man%20%28video%20game%29">Mega Man</a>", "<a href="The%20Legend%20of%20Zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>", and "Castlevania" into an "engrossing, challenging, and quite lengthy" whole. <a href="Inside%20Mac%20Games">Inside Mac Games</a> ascribed the game's popularity to its "polished feel, engaging storyline, and compelling artwork". "<a href="Electronic%20Gaming%20Monthly">Electronic Gaming Monthly</a>" stated that "the burgeoning Western indie game scene owes a tremendous debt to Japanese pioneers like Studio Pixel, whose freeware hit "Cave Story" proved that with sufficient vision, skill, and passion, a single developer can still craft a deep, compelling action game". Jonathan Holmes of Destructoid called "Cave Story" an "important game", observing its influence on artistic indie games like "<a href="Braid%20%28video%20game%29">Braid</a>", as well as the continued relevance of 2D game design (cf. <a href="Capcom">Capcom</a>'s "<a href="Mega%20Man%209">Mega Man 9</a>"). He also compares the game design to that of <a href="Shigeru%20Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> in its ability to teach without tutorials, like at the beginning of "<a href="Super%20Mario%20Bros.">Super Mario Bros.</a>" In July 2006, "Cave Story" earned 1st place in "<a href="Super%20PLAY">Super PLAY</a>"'s list of the 50 best freeware games of all time. In July 2015, the game placed 14th on USgamer's The 15 Best Games Since 2000 list.

The WiiWare version has received mostly positive reviews, with the central criticism being the 1200 <a href="Wii%20Point">Wii Point</a> price tag (<a href="United%20States%20dollar">US$</a>12, <a href="pound%20sterling">£</a>10), after years of free play. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com commended the graphical update, which "sacrifices none of [the game's] classic-influenced charm". He also remarked that the <a href="Classic%20Controller">Classic Controller</a> and <a href="Wii%20Remote">Wii Remote</a> are superior to the keyboard input of the PC original. On the issue of price, he explained that "the prospect of Amaya finally earning a little something for the hard work he invested in this masterpiece strikes me as satisfyingly poetic" and "absolutely worth your money". John Teti of Eurogamer had similar sentiments, but also noted the technical issues with the remixed music, recommending the original soundtrack. "Edge" compared the remake to "", satisfying both modern tastes with its graphical overhaul and old school fans with the option to switch to the original graphics. Daemon Hatfield of IGN felt that "Cave Story" "belongs on a Nintendo system" and noted gameplay similarities to "<a href="Blaster%20Master">Blaster Master</a>", in which damage reduces the power of weapons as well. "Cave Story" was nominated for Game of the Year at the 2010 "<a href="Nintendo%20Power">Nintendo Power</a>" Awards, as well as WiiWare Game of the Year.

Criticism of "Cave Story 3D" echoed that of the WiiWare version. Many reviewers cautioned that the graphical update does not justify the $40 initial price point, especially with cheaper or free versions of the game available through download services. Parish defended the release, deriving satisfaction from the game's availability as a physical cartridge. Holmes praised the dynamic camera system and new graphics, comparing them to classic Disney films. He considers this release to be the "best version of the game, [but] not necessarily the definitive version". Jane Douglas of GameSpot felt that the 3DS Circle Pad was a comfortable fit for the game's control scheme. Audrey Drake of IGN noted that the 3D effect made it difficult to distinguish certain platforms between background and foreground, a complaint shared by Douglas. Simon Parkin of the UK "Official Nintendo Magazine" was more critical, citing lack of detail in the 3D models and a too-dark color palette. Japanese magazine "<a href="Famitsu">Famitsu Weekly</a>"s four reviewers scored it 7, 7, 8, and 8 points out of 10 to a total of 30 out of 40 points, indicating average reviews. This version was nominated for Best Adventure Game at the 2011 "Nintendo Power" Awards.

Quote appears as a downloadable character in "". Curly Brace appears as a bonus playable character in <a href="1001%20Spikes">1001 Spikes</a>. Both Curly Brace and Quote appear as playable characters in the crossover fighting game "<a href="Blade%20Strangers">Blade Strangers</a>". Quote, Curly Brace and Ballos are featured as playable characters in Nicalis' puzzle game "<a href="Crystal%20Crisis">Crystal Crisis</a>". Quote's hat is also featured in the game <a href="Terraria">Terraria</a>.
